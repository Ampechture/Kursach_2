abstract = {Within construction, we have become increasingly accustomed to relying on the benefits of digital technologies, such as Building Information Modelling, to improve the performance and productivity of projects. We have, however, overlooked the problems that technology is unable to redress. One such problem is rework, which has become so embedded in practice that technology adoption alone can not resolve the issue without fundamental changes in how information is managed for decision-making. Hence, the motivation of this paper is to bring to the fore the challenges of classifying and creating an ontology for rework that can be used to understand its patterns of occurrence and risks and provide a much-needed structure for decision-making in transport mega-projects. Using an exploratory case study approach, we examine ‘how’ rework information is currently being managed by an alliance that contributes significantly to delivering a multi-billion dollar mega-transport project. We reveal the challenges around location, format, structure, granularity and redundancy hindering the alliance’s ability to classify and manage rework data. We use the generative machine learning technique of Correlation Explanation to illustrate how we can make headway toward classifying and then creating an ontology for rework. We propose a theoretical framework utilising a smart data approach to generate an ontology that can effectively use business analytics (i.e., descriptive, predictive and prescriptive) to manage rework risks.}

This study analyses data from approximately 7,800 houses in Ontario and Québec, Canada to investigate the most suitable data length, data interval and calibration horizon of building models for assessment of Model Predictive Control strategies on a large scale. Overall, models with calibration horizon of 24 h, data length of 7 days and time interval of 15 min provided the best balance between accuracy and computational resources. The calibrated models were used to compare a simple deadband controller to a Model Predictive Controller that minimizes the cost of electricity for a cold day in January. The results showed that the Model Predictive Controller can systematically reduce the high-price energy consumption, while improving thermal comfort, by successfully preheating before the high-price periods. Preheating shifts the peak power consumption, reducing it by 15 % for Ontario and 30 % for Québec. If just 1,000 houses adopt optimal strategies, the grid could see an average reduction in energy consumption of up to 15 MWh and 11 MWh during high-price periods in Ontario and Québec respectively.}

Lack of such a comprehensive decision-making framework which utilizes BIM, Management Information Systems (MIS), simulation, and automation tools to choose between different construction alternatives have been addressed in the research background. As an example of decision-making objective, optimized smart building's equipment combination for a certain project should be selected in the feasibility study phase. In this research, a comprehensive decision-making framework was developed to choose smart building's equipment based on energy consumption and cost trade-off. Subsequently, smart building alternatives were considered as a decision-making example to choose the best alternative using BIM, MIS and simulation tools. The research contributes to the automating of some parts of the decision-making framework by developing an Application Programming Interface (API). This API helps with making the appropriate automating permutation out of possible options, totalizing the cost of each combination and sorting data in the research database developed for the recommended framework. This framework, database and API can be used similarly for any other decision making objective. Finally, a model representing the average conditions of residential buildings in Tehran was developed to choose the optimized smart building's equipment combination of 31 considered options. This optimized combination which included all possible smart building options except for smart lighting has an investment return of about 7.5 years which is more than that of similar projects in other countries due to Iran's low energy carrier tariff.}

Cities have also been understood as a living system, a macroscopic organism, linked through its collective consciousness, communicative structure and relationship to natural resources and cycles. Like the human body or other natural organisms, the city is comprised of multiple parts, organs, cells and functions, each autonomously working with its own requirements while simultaneously interacting as gestalt system framework. In urban planning, the city has been made analogous to the human body and other representations in nature, expressed through the modernist doctrine of the functional city and more recently through biomimetic architectures. To be sustainable, branding is a key driver of the city DNA, promoting each city’s unique character and competitive advantage in order to attract investment and to stimulate growth. The next generation of the smart city ontology is a new socio-cyber-physical formation where these realms converge as interactive, reflexive and hybrid systems. Mapping and simulation document this process as real-time strata of physical and virtual city systems, incorporating diverse geographic, human and technological data, establishing a collective intelligence that governs cities as self-regulating organisms.}

abstract = {Outdoor mobility of individuals with visual impairment is challenging particularly where collision with obstacles can have significant impact on both physical and mental health. A variety of technological mobility aids for visually impaired people (VIP) have been studied and proposed in the literature which mainly utilise machine intelligence and deep learning (DL) approaches for object detection. However, object detection via the existing approaches suffers from reliability challenge due to real-time dynamics or the lack of available domain knowledge for specific obstacles identified by the VIP as potential hazards. In the present study, an object detection model (ObDtM) based on deep transfer learning techniques was developed for a custom-built dataset comprising of specific obstacles identified by the VIP as potential hazards. A custom dataset was compiled and manually annotated from various publicly available sources to train the ObDtM. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed ObDtM for unseen obstacles kept as the test set. Results showed that ObDtM outperformed the state-of-the-art with 97% mean Average Precision (mAP), indicating a robust and generalizable DL approach. The compiled dataset and the ObDtM is useful for several potential use cases, particularly highlighting the use of DL in IoT and smart city applications. Additionally, a smart synergetic outdoor mobility framework was proposed for VIP (SOMAVIP) allowing comprehensive and accurate semantic representation of the surroundings by utilising the proposed ObDtM, cloud services, internet of things (IoT), and digital environment in the context of emerging smart city infrastructure. The proposed SOMAVIP can be highly impactful for improving VIPs’ quality of life mainly for safer, cost-effective, and reliable independent outdoor mobility enriched with real-time perception and interpretations of the surroundings.}

The passive system has high operational reliability with natural driving forces such as gravity, natural circulation and stored energy. In recent years, development of innovative SMRs has emerged as a global R&D initiative for sustainable energy to challenge the carbon neutrality of climate change. The passive safety system makes reactor design simple and thus enhances the reliability of the reactor. As advanced reactors adopt passive safety systems, regulatory requirements and guides are required. Thus, development of regulatory guide and detailed regulatory review methodology for the passive safety systems is needed. In this paper, long term cooling safe shutdown acceptance criteria and performance analysis methodology are proposed for the regulatory standard design approval for the SMART100 integral reactor with fully passive system which has been jointly developed by KAERI in Korea and K.A.CARE in Saudi Arabia. The long term cooling safe shutdown performance analyses are performed until 72 hours to evaluate the methodology, and sensitivity analyses are also performed to provide a technical basis for the regulatory independent review for the long term cooling performance of the SMART100 passive safety systems.}

In this context, Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can play an essential role in reducing costs and ease of usage. One of the critical challenges of this network is energy consumption, the main part is related to the transmission unit. In this way, the Smart Optimizer Approach (SOA) to solving global optimization, engineering problems, and clustering in UAV-Assisted IoT Wireless Networks is presented. The SOA uses a Hybrid Vector-Based Operator (HVO), a Smart Selection Search Mode (S3M), and a Smart Re-Randomize Schema (SRS). Numerical comparison and discussions are done on CEC 2017 functions and benchmark functions and engineering problems. Comparison of performance with other algorithms shows the high generality of the SOA. Finally, this paper presented a new SOA-based Clustering protocol (SOAC) for large-scale UAV-Assisted IoT Wireless Networks. In this network, UAVs are used as Air Base Station (ABS). According to this large-scale network and the UAVs' movement, traditional protocols with high control message overhead aren't suitable. Clustering is presented with the aim of reducing overhead and increasing throughput by UAVs simultaneously. SOAC uses two new mechanisms, Assistant to the Cluster Head (ACH) and discretion license (DL), which have been introduced recently. The results of the simulations show the proposed clustering has a good improvement in stability, energy/load balancing, network lifetime, and throughput.}

A preliminary step towards a proper organizational and management strategy of the metropolitan city is the analysis, benchmarking and optimization of the metropolitan areas through a set of indicators coherent with the overall sustainability objective of the metropolitan city. This paper proposes the use of the Analytic Hierarchy Process multi-criteria decision making technique for application in the smart metropolitan city context, with the aim of analysing the sustainable development of energy, water and environmental systems, through a set of objective performance indicators. Specifically, the 35 indicators defined for the Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems Index framework are used. The application of the approach to the real case study of four metropolitan areas (Bari, Bitonto, Mola, and Molfetta) in the city of Bari (Italy) shows its usefulness for the local government in benchmarking metropolitan areas and providing decision indications on how to formulate the sustainable development strategy of the metropolitan city. Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process characteristics, the results highlight that although one specific area (Mola in the considered case) is globally ranked at the first place, it is only ranked first with respect to some dimensions. Such a result has strong implications for the metropolitan city's manager who has the possibility to identify and implement targeted actions, which may be designed ad hoc to improve specific dimensions based on the current state of the city, thus maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the actions undertaken for the sustainable development of energy, water and environmental systems of the whole metropolitan city.}

We have generated the first Wifi-based localisation datasets for a GPS-denied open area. We selected a busy open area at Murdoch University to generate the datasets using so-called “smart bins”, which are rubbish bins that we enabled to work as access points. The data gathered consists of two different datasets. In the first, four users generated labelled WiFi fingerprints for all available Reference Points using four different smartphones. The second dataset includes 2450865 auto-generated rows received from more than 1000 devices. We have developed a light-weight algorithm to label the second dataset from the first and we proposed a localisation approach that converts the second dataset from asynchronous format to synchronous, applies feature engineering and a deep learning classifier. Finally, we have demonstrated via simulations that by using this approach we achieve higher prediction accuracy, with up to 19% average improvement, compared with using only the fingerprint dataset.}

To bridge the gap in device energy consumption data, we propose the design and implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled, minimalistic, cost-effective and efficient smart energy meter which will aid consumers in obtaining information on the energy consumption of any electrical appliance.

Study results showed that the consumers’ willingness to participate in co-governance of Smart BSSs is significant and the influence factors presented the diverse characteristics. Finally, this study provided the multi-path solutions for the further co-government. For consumers, positive participation in co-governance of Smart BSSs; For the government and urban managers, it is necessary to constantly optimize related institutional arrangements; For Smart BSSs enterprises, how to adopt rational market behaviors and improve service level will become the key.

An issue that becomes a bottleneck for blockchain-based applications is their restricted ability to process in comparison to distributed database systems. In this paper, we present intelligent traffic control using a hybrid model based on the PSO-based optimization algorithm and fuzzy logic in order to improve blockchain performance. The real-time network feedback model is designed and used as an input to control the transaction traffic across the entire network in a robust way without human intervention. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed model, a clinical trial service framework as a test network is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric. The case study is further compared with baseline network, network with fuzzy approach, and network with optimized parameter. The experiments show that the proposed model not only enhanced the network by maximizing the network throughput and minimizing the network latency. A smart contract is implemented to automate the transaction flow as per real-time data of network conditions. An open-source blockchain framework, Hyperledger Fabric, is harnessed for implementation of the experiment environment in order to signify the potential of the proposed model. The outcome of this study indicated a remarkable increase in transaction throughput (i.e., 38.5%) and a decrease in transaction latency of 40.5%. Moreover, the proposed model can easily be integrated with other existing blockchain-based performance-enhancing tools.}

The droplet-based 10X Genomics Chromium (10X) approach and the plate-based Smart-seq2 full-length method are two frequently used scRNA-seq platforms, yet there are only a few thorough and systematic comparisons of their advantages and limitations. Here, by directly comparing the scRNA-seq data generated by these two platforms from the same samples of CD45− cells, we systematically evaluated their features using a wide spectrum of analyses. Smart-seq2 detected more genes in a cell, especially low abundance transcripts as well as alternatively spliced transcripts, but captured higher proportion of mitochondrial genes. The composite of Smart-seq2 data also resembled bulk RNA-seq data more. For 10X-based data, we observed higher noise for mRNAs with low expression levels. Approximately 10%−30% of all detected transcripts by both platforms were from non-coding genes, with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) accounting for a higher proportion in 10X. 10X-based data displayed more severe dropout problem, especially for genes with lower expression levels. However, 10X-data can detect rare cell types given its ability to cover a large number of cells. In addition, each platform detected distinct groups of differentially expressed genes between cell clusters, indicating the different characteristics of these technologies. Our study promotes better understanding of these two platforms and offers the basis for an informed choice of these widely used technologies.}

On the other hand, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has equipped buildings with an ability to learn. A lot of research has been dedicated to specific machine learning applications for specific phases of a building's life-cycle. The reviews commonly take a specific, technological perspective without a vision for the integration of smart technologies at the level of the whole system. Especially, there is a lack of discussion on the roles of autonomous AI agents and training environments for boosting the learning process in complex and abruptly changing operational environments. This review article discusses the learning ability of buildings with a system-level perspective and presents an overview of autonomous machine learning applications that make independent decisions for building energy management. We conclude that the buildings’ adaptability to unpredicted changes can be enhanced at the system level through AI-initiated learning processes and by using digital twins as training environments. The greatest potential for energy efficiency improvement is achieved by integrating adaptability solutions at the timescales of HVAC control and electricity market participation.}

By laying the groundwork for the conceptualization of urban resilience within and beyond urban studies, we use multiple urban cases across Saudi Arabia to establish approaches towards climate resilience, arguing that an understanding of urban resilience in urban studies and planning is critical to analyzing and combating the impacts of climate change in cities in the Global South. This leads us to argue for the need to explore urban resilience in relation to climate vulnerability, precarity, and urbanization. We conclude by advancing a research agenda on urban resilience in the Global South that draws upon the urban planning ethics of responsibility for climate change management.}

The evaluation of DR potential is of great importance for estimating the power reduction, targeting appropriate DR customers, and obtaining constrained boundary for economic dispatch. To better reveal the multi-faceted factors and multi-uncertainties during DR, this paper present a novel definition and evaluation approach of operational DR potential from single customer to large-scale load centers. Aimed at resolving two main issues of evaluation: disaggregation of ACLs component and parameter estimation, an unsupervised load decomposition methodology considering load level difference and seasonal variation is proposed to disaggregate the whole-house energy consumption into ACLs and baseload components non-intrusively. Subsequently, based on the thermal dynamics model of ACLs, a segment analysis methodology is developed, including a constrained regression method for the static parameter estimation and a hybrid method for the dynamic parameter estimation. Data experiments based on ground truth data of residential customers in Austin, Texas, U.S., smart homes in Western Massachusetts and low voltage area in a developed city, Jiangsu province, China, validate the better performance of accuracy and robustness using the proposed methods. The proposed methods are further implemented to four application scenarios, including ACLs consumption behavior learning, operational DR potential analysis, customers targeting for different time-scale DR programs, and day ahead scheduling. These results also demonstrate that great difference in terms of ACLs usage patterns (a total of 19 patterns), DR potential (a maximum of 0.7 kW) results from different DR duration and operational conditions. The DR programs designers and load aggregators are suggested to consider the proposed 5 basic indicators to target customer and select participants in different DR scenarios. And the operational DR potential is more reliable and suitable to generate strategies for day ahead scheduling.}

Despite valuable research contributions that represent fundamental knowledge on this topic, today’s body of research appears quite fragmented in relation to the role of micro-mobility as a transformative solution for meeting sustainability outcomes in urban environments. This paper consolidates knowledge on the topic, analyses past and on-going research developments, and provides future research directions by using a rigorous and auditable systematic literature review methodology. To achieve these objectives, the paper analysed 328 journal publications from the Scopus database covering the period between 2000 and 2020. A bibliographic analysis was used to identify relevant publications and explore the changing landscape of micro-mobility research. The study constructed and visualised the literature’s bibliometric networks through citations and co-citations analyses for authors, articles, journals and countries. The findings showed a consistent spike in recent research outputs covering the sustainability aspects of micro-mobility reflecting its importance as a low-carbon and transformative mode of urban transport. The co-citation analysis, in particular, helped to categorise the literature into four main research themes that address benefits, technology, policy and behavioural mode-choice categories where the majority of research has been focused during the analysis period. For each cluster, inductive reasoning is used to discuss the emerging trends, barriers as well as pathways to overcome challenges to wide-scale deployment. This article provides a balanced and objective summary of research evidence on the topic and serves as a reference point for further research on micro-mobility for sustainable cities.}

One of the most effective alternatives to mitigate pollution is to promote green mobility via electric vehicles. However, the lack of electric charging stations may decrease individuals’ satisfaction to use electric vehicles in daily life. To bridge the gaps, this paper aims to simultaneously allocate electric vehicle charging stations and smart photovoltaic inverters in distribution networks to optimize three important objective functions, including power loss, voltage deviation, and voltage unbalance factor. To solve such a multi-objective optimization problem, a novel hybrid fuzzy Pareto dominance concept with differential evolution algorithm is proposed. A scenario-based framework is also used to capture the uncertainties of the model comprising loads, PVs’ generation and the demand of electric vehicle charging stations. The effectiveness of the stochastic multi-objective approach is then examined and verified on an unbalanced 37-bus network under different case studies. Attained results illustrate that if smart photovoltaic inverters integrate into the network with charging stations, the network performance is significantly improved, such as keeping voltage unbalance factor under standard value accounting for two percent.}

The use of technologies such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, digital twins, among others, in the agricultural environment is increasing. Digital twin applied to agriculture is in its early stages of development. A digital twin is one in which data flows automatically and in both directions between a physical object and a virtual object. Withing this context, this paper presents a digital twin of a smart irrigation system in an application scenario. A digital twin for an irrigation system is one in which the physical components of the system, such as its sensors and actuators, are connected with their virtual representations. The system is composed of a FIWARE-based internet of things platform and a discrete event simulation model in Siemens Plant Simulation software. The internet of things platform is used to collect, aggregate and process soil, weather and crop data to calculate daily irrigation prescriptions. The simulation model is used to simulate the behavior of an irrigation system defined in an application scenario. The communication between the platform and the simulation model happens in real-time and is intermediate by an OPC UA server. A application scenario is considered to evaluate the behavior of the system and to evaluate, in future research, different irrigation strategies. The benefits of the systems proposed are twofold. First, evaluate the behavior of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform and an irrigation system before implementing both in the field. Second, enable the evaluation of different irrigation strategies in parallel with current farm practices. Within the system proposed, farmers can evaluate the behavior of the system before implementing in their farms and allowing the system to operate automatically. It is possible to infer that the system can improve farm operations and reduce water usage by allowing farmers to gather soil, weather and crop information and evaluate multiple irrigation strategies.}

Cities are the main hubs of human activity and the engines of economic growth. In pursuit of such growth, cities are transgressing their local environmental boundaries. Ongoing urbanisation increasingly contributes to the human pressure on planetary boundaries and negatively affects planetary health. In a telecoupled world, cities externalise impacts by shifting production and many other functions away from their boundaries. At the same time, urban inhabitants and people who follow urban lifestyles but live outside cities are increasingly disconnected from nature. This Viewpoint highlights the role of degrowth in keeping an urban planet within planetary boundaries and suggests areas for further research and policy. Degrowth calls for meaningfully connecting planetary boundaries with cities and ensuring everyone receives a fair share of their ecological capacity. Degrowth calls for lower use of existing resources, highlights political power asymmetries, and moves beyond pricing interventions. Degrowth addresses three key aspects that connect cities and urban lifestyles to planetary boundaries: reducing production and consumption, connecting people and nature, and including nature (to a more substantial extent) in the design of cities and in what is used and consumed in cities. A radical degrowth transformation of cities is necessary to stay within a safe operating space for humanity.}

The greater adoption of EVs presents an ideal use-case scenario of EVs acting as power dispatch, storage, and ancillary service-providing units. This EV aspect can be utilized more in the current smart grid (SG) scenario by incorporating demand-side management (DSM) through EV integration. The integration of EVs with DSM techniques is hurdled with various issues and challenges addressed throughout this literature review. The various research conducted on EV-DSM programs has been surveyed. This review article focuses on the issues, solutions, and challenges, with suggestions on modeling the charging infrastructure to suit DSM applications, and optimization aspects of EV-DSM are addressed separately to enhance the EV-DSM operation. Gaps in current research and possible research directions have been discussed extensively to present a comprehensive insight into the current status of DSM programs employed with EV integration.

Based on methods for calculating optimum slope angle of the strips on the pane(s), their widths and relative position on two surfaces, equations are obtained for calculating the transmittance of the grating filter with chromogenic strips. Angular and temporal characteristics of the transmittance calculated using these equations demonstrate the angular selectivity of a smart window with chromogenic filter compared to a conventional smart window, fully glazed with chromogenic glass. In addition, such a window attenuates the direct solar radiation in a preset angular range and transmits the diffused radiation providing comfortable daylighting and temperature indoors, unlike conventional smart windows which in an active state attenuate not only direct but also diffused radiation.}

In this paper, we present Gait-watch, a context-aware authentication system for smart watch based on gait recognition. We address the problem of recognizing the user under various walking activities (e.g., walking normally, walking upstairs and walking with calling the phone), and propose a feature extraction method from gait signals to improve recognition accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that Gait-watchimproves recognition accuracy by up to 30.2% by leveraging the activity information, and can achieve 3.5% Equal Error Rate (EER). We also report a user study to demonstrate that Gait-watchcan accurately authenticate the user in real-world scenarios and require low system cost.}

Such decisions must ensure low emission, efficiency, and high service quality by also considering the impact on traffic congestion caused by other vehicles in the transportation network. In this paper, we first propose an abstract trilevel multi-objective formulation architecture to model all vehicle routing problems with assignment, routing, and speed decision variables and conflicting objective functions. Such an architecture guides the development of subproblems, relaxations, and solution methods. We also propose a way of integrating the various urban transportation services by introducing a constraint on the speed variables that takes into account the traffic volume caused across the different services. Based on the formulation architecture, we introduce a (bilevel) problem where assignment and routing are at the upper level and speed is at the lower level. To address the challenge of dealing with routing problems on urban road networks, we develop an algorithm that alternates between the assignment-routing problem on an auxiliary complete graph and the speed optimization problem on the original non-complete graph. The computational experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in determining approximate Pareto fronts among the conflicting objectives.}

Blockchain technology helps in creating a decentralized network of users where the transactions are recorded in an open distributed ledger. These features of blockchain enable a transparent and cost-effective platform for different applications. Based on the need to an effective crowdfunding platform for developing smart nation and the inherent features of blockchain technology, we propose a global crowdfunding platform called BitFund. Investors and developers can act as different nodes of the network. The investors can request a specific project and they can give their initial bid value in terms of time, cost and maintenance required. Different developers can bid with different values of the same parameters to get the project ownership. A smart contract is deployed between the investors and the developers to reach an optimal solution for the investors. Multiple iterations of bidding are carried out between the developers until the optimal solution or equilibrium is reached. The experimental results show that the proposed model yields better results as compared to other generic algorithms for crowdfunding.}

High-performing ports are implementing smart technologies to better manage operations meeting new challenges in maintaining safe, secure, and energy efficient facilities that mitigate environmental impacts. In this context, a new concept has emerged which is called smart port. However, a unified definition of a smart port has not been well documented. This article attempts to develop a framework for a smart port and a quantitative metric, smart port index (SPI), that ports can use to improve their resiliency and sustainability. Our proposed SPI is based on key performance indicators (KPIs) gathered from the literature. These KPIs are organized around four key activity domains of a smart port: operations, environment, energy, and safety & security. Case studies are conducted to show how one can use SPI and to assess the performance of some of the busiest ports in the world. Our methodology provides a quantitative tool for port authorities to develop their smart port strategies, assess their smartness, and identify strengths and weaknesses of their current operations for continuous improvement. Our study reveals that smart port initiatives around the world have different levels of comprehensiveness. The results of this study also suggest that government policies and region-specific variables can impact SPI value.}

For privacy reasons, these speakers analyze every sound in their environment for their respective wake word like “Alexa,” “Jiǔsì’èr líng,” or “Hey Siri,” before uploading the audio stream to the cloud for further processing. Previous work reported on examples of an inaccurate wake word detection, which can be tricked using similar words or sounds like “cocaine noodles” instead of “OK Google.” In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of such accidental triggers, i.e., sounds that should not have triggered the voice assistant, but did. More specifically, we automate the process of finding accidental triggers and measure their prevalence across 11 smart speakers from 8 different manufacturers using everyday media such as TV shows, news, and other kinds of audio datasets. To systematically detect accidental triggers, we describe a method to artificially craft such triggers using a pronouncing dictionary and a weighted, phone-based Levenshtein distance. In total, we have found hundreds of accidental triggers. Moreover, we explore potential gender and language biases and analyze the reproducibility. Finally, we discuss the resulting privacy implications of accidental triggers and explore countermeasures to reduce and limit their impact on users’ privacy. To foster additional research on these sounds that mislead machine learning models, we publish a dataset of more than 350 verified triggers as a research artifact.}

The challenge on predicting these applications still exists. Suitable monitoring systems are necessary, to maintain the healthy society with sustainable growth. With the advancement of Internet of Things and modern sensors, the environmental monitoring systems have become smart monitoring system. These wireless sensors are scattered around the environmental locations and places. The localization of sensor placement at the correct place will reduce the redundancy of the sensing environment and cost of the equipment. More nodes are placed at the area that has more pollutant. Accurate node sensor placing on the needed area will reduce the cost of sensors and increase the prediction accuracy. This helps to keep our health safe by selecting less polluted environment. Hence, this article focuses on introducing the deep learning algorithm called Graph Long Short-Term Memory (GLSTM) neural network to predict the air quality characteristics. Next, the evolutionary algorithm called Dragon fly optimizer has been used to localize the node based on the prediction. Deep evolutionary based algorithms will improve the air pollutant prediction and node localization sensor cost.}

Using dual sensor with confidence-weighted averaging sensor fusion method, variance in the raw sensor readings is minimized. Further, the pre-processed recalibration data is used to develop linear, polynomial, and optimized 3-layer FFBP-NN (feedforward backpropagation neural network) direct and inverse models of the sensor. Performance evaluation of the models indicate that goodness of fit and accuracy of the FBNN models is the highest, followed by the polynomial and linear models.}

While most research has centered around vibration analysis, tangible solutions to control elevated vibration levels remain rare. The study aims to introduce an intelligent ThingSpeak-Enabled IoT (Internet of Things) solution that provides real-time monitoring and generates prompt warning alerts for tractor operators when vibrations exceed safe thresholds. The initial phase involved the real-time measurement of WBV (whole-body vibration) and SEAT (seat effective amplitude transmissibility). Following this, the secondary phase encompassed the analysis and validation of the system in cases where WBV and SEAT exceeded the recommended limits. The experimental design comprised 135 trials by systematically varying tractor ride parameters, including average speed (m/s), average depth (m), and pulling force (kN) levels. Daily vibration exposure response ranged from 0.43 m/s² to 0.87 m/s² with a mean exposure of 0.64 m/s2, surpassing the EAV (exposure action value) threshold of 0.5 m/s². The SEAT values ranged between 91.37 and 133.08 with a mean of 108.35, that indicates insufficient seat isolation capacity, i.e., < 100. Statistically, the study ascertained a significant influence of average speed and average depth WBV and SEAT responses at a 5% significance level. It underscores the potential efficacy of altering speed and depth parameters to attenuate vibration exposure levels. Further, the effectiveness of the system was tested through the automatic transmission of warning alerts via emails, text messages, and flashing red LED light on the IoT system. This critical feature provides considerable utility for tractor operators to adjust ride settings, ensuring that the ride remains within safe vibration limits. Furthermore, adopting such an advanced warning system in tractor manufacturing signifies a pioneering step towards sustainably enhancing operator well-being.}

Cities have started to restructure themselves into ‘smart cities’ to address the challenges of the 21st Century—such as climate change, sustainable development, and digital disruption. One of the major obstacles to success for a smart city is to tackle the mobility and accessibility issues via ‘smart mobility’ solutions. At the verge of the age of smart urbanism, autonomous vehicle technology is seen as an opportunity to realize the smart mobility vision of cities. However, this innovative technological advancement is also speculated to bring a major disruption in urban transport, land use, employment, parking, car ownership, infrastructure design, capital investment decisions, sustainability, mobility, and traffic safety. Despite the potential threats, urban planners and managers are not yet prepared to develop autonomous vehicle strategies for cities to deal with these threats. This is mainly due to a lack of knowledge on the social implications of autonomous capabilities and how exactly they will disrupt our cities. This viewpoint provides a snapshot of the current status of vehicle automation, the direction in which the field is moving forward, the potential impacts of systematic adoption of autonomous vehicles, and how urban planners can mitigate the built environment and land use disruption of autonomous vehicles.}

Due to the so long stochastic and bad information entering the systems in order to make malicious attacks, their location and time data links have the ability of straying of those acting in normal conditions that attempt to have an effect on the precise voltage regulation and current dividing via influencing sensors of current and voltage. The ability to extract high-level features due to the usage of fast fourier transform (FFT) and deep learning (DL) for attack detection in cyberspace has made them to be considered as a strong technique in the face of small mutations or new attacks. These self-educated and compaction abilities of DL architectures have been considered as basic techniques for hidden scheme detection from the training datum for this reason attacks have been distinguished from benign traffic. A novel method, deep learning and FFT, for cyber-security has been used in the following paper with the aim of enabling the attacks detection in DC smart MG. The deep model and traditional machine learning way are evaluated in terms of performance, and distributed attack detection has been compared to the centralized diagnosing procedure. The tests proved that the distributed attack detection system studied can be more advanced in comparison with centralized detection systems applying FFT in the role of the input index of the DL model. This suggested distributed method enables for scalable monitoring of a MG and has the ability of detecting the existence of cyber-attacks in the communications between distributed generation agents (DGAs) controlled via a control on the basis of consensus and isolating the communication link over that the attack has been injected. Any local attack detection needs restricted information about its neighbor’s dynamics. The most important factor of the proposed detection plan can be that has the ability of detecting cyber-attacks with great precision and distinguishing cyber-attack from load changes.in addition, this has been shown that the suggested model can be further useful in the detection of the attack.}

abstract = {In the pursuit of advancing urban sustainability within the unique backdrop of Nigeria's built environment and its environmental challenges, this study presents the significance of information and communication technology (ICT). Undertaking this research holds immense importance in illuminating the possibilities inherent in leveraging ICT to foster urban sustainability. The study's objectives encompass a comprehensive investigation into the multifaceted contributions of ICT to urban sustainability, while also delving into its impact on stakeholder engagement and participation in these sustainability endeavors. Addressing an identified gap, the study sheds light on the critical nexus between stakeholders' active involvement and the resulting impact on urban sustainability. This connection serves as a crucial yet under-explored avenue within the broader discourse on leveraging ICT for sustainable urban development. The study employs structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate a proposed model and analyze empirical data. The results of the study highlight the critical role of ICTs in urban sustainability (β = 0.614, R2 = 0.85), demonstrating its capacity to enhance efficiency; which promotes sustainability practices, and improves the quality of life for urban residents. The findings of this study have significant implications, as they suggest the potential for optimizing the impact of ICT-based urban environments to meet the diverse needs and priorities of society as a whole. By leveraging ICT effectively, countries can create a robust smart environment that contributes to sustainable development and addresses environmental concerns. To leverage the benefits of ICT, however, appropriate attention should be committed to the execution of smart urban sustainability through stakeholder participation and involvement. The implication of the study enables the possibility to optimize the impact of an ICT-based urban environment, thereby creating sustainable and resilient communities that meet the needs and priorities of all members of society.}

This paper presents both the technical and regulatory background that explain the failure of a public policy intended to modernize the electric distribution grid. It is described the arguments that promoted the investment of the companies on the MMCS, the antecedents that lead the Government to eliminate the obligations opting for the voluntariness in relation to the change of smart meters during the implementation process and the dilemma generated with regards to the pilot projects developed by some electrical distribution companies. Finally, a solution is proposed for the smart-meter’s property dilemma.}

abstract = {Background
High adherence to remote monitoring (RM) in pacemaker (PM) patients improves outcomes; however, adherence remains suboptimal. Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) technology in newer-generation PMs enables communication directly with patient-owned smart devices using an app without a bedside console.
Objective
To evaluate the success rate of scheduled RM transmissions using the app compared to other RM methods.
Methods
The BlueSync Field Evaluation was a prospective, international cohort evaluation, measuring the success rate of scheduled RM transmissions using a BLE PM or cardiac resynchronization therapy PM coupled with the MyCareLink Heart app. App transmission success was compared to 3 historical “control” groups from the Medtronic de-identified CareLink database: (1) PM patients with manual communication using a wand with a bedside console (PM manual transmission), (2) PM patients with wireless automatic communication with the bedside console (PM wireless); (3) defibrillator patients with similar automatic communication (defibrillator wireless).
Results
Among 245 patients enrolled (age 64.8±15.6 years, 58.4% men), 953 transmissions were scheduled through 12 months, of which 902 (94.6%) were successfully completed. In comparison, transmission success rates were 56.3% for PM manual transmission patients, 77.0% for PM wireless patients, and 87.1% for defibrillator wireless patients. Transmission success with the app was superior across matched cohorts based on age, sex, and device type (single vs dual vs triple chamber).
Conclusion
The success rate of scheduled RM transmissions was higher among patients using the smart device app compared to patients using traditional RM using bedside consoles. This novel technology may improve patient engagement and adherence to RM.}

abstract = {The optimal and sustainable management of water distribution systems still represent an arduous task. In many instances, especially in aging water net-works, pressure management is imperative for reducing breakages and leakages. Therefore, optimal District Metered Areas represent an effective solution to decreasing the overall energy input without performance compromise. Within this context, this paper proposes a novel adaptive management framework for water distribution systems by reconfiguring the original network layout into (dynamic) district metered areas. It utilises a multiscale clustering algorithm to schedule district aggregation/desegregation, whilst delivering energy and supply management goals. The resulting framework was tested in a water utility network for the simultaneously production of energy during the day (by means of the installation of micro-hydropower systems) and for the reduction of water leakage during the night. From computational viewpoint, this was found to significantly reduce the time and complexity during the clustering and the dividing phase. In addition, in this case, a recovered energy potential of 19 MWh per year and leakage reduction of up to 16% was found. The addition of pump-as-turbines was also found to reduce investment and maintenance costs, giving improved reliability to the monitoring stations. The financial analyses to define the optimal period in which to invest also showed the economic feasibility of the proposed solution, which assures, in the analysed case study, a positive annual net income in just five years. This study demonstrates that the combined optimisation, energy recovery and creation of optimized multiple-task district stations lead to an efficient, resilient, sustainable, and low-cost management strategy for water distribution networks.}

While previous research has considered intermediaries as a trigger for implementing new technologies, this article examines intermediary resistance. We study the case of municipalities' resistance in France by using a quantitative clustering analysis on 444 municipalities’ reports, which detail their decision to reject smart meters. Findings reveal five argumentative strategies of resistance, which are associated to distinct degrees of resistance. Those results challenge previous research by inviting to study resisting actors as a heterogeneous group, and to further explore the particularities of the intermediary level of resisting actors. Our study also shed light on a trigger for resistance that has been neglected in the existing literature: the installation process itself and its potential flaws. Finally, we provide insights to overcome resistance for smart-meters in a context of “forced adoption”, by involving intermediary actors in all stages of the roll-out and adopting a differentiated strategy of communication toward them and also by reducing the imbalance between costs and benefits for end-consumers.}

Even though some developed countries practice modern household e-waste management techniques, including extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, household e-waste legislative frameworks are not yet fully implemented in Malaysia. In order to support the sustainability of smarter cities concept, household e-waste needs to be efficiently managed and this work discusses the application of smart collection systems pertaining to the Malaysian e-waste management and recycling sector. A smart household e-waste collection box was designed, fitted with e-waste level measurement sensors to record the disposal data. A backend server was developed which automatically notifies and schedules e-waste collectors to dispatch and collect the e-waste when the volume of the collection box reaches a certain threshold (e.g. box is 80% filled). A mobile application was developed in this work and public end users are intended to use it to dispose their household e-waste. The smart system was successfully developed as a proof-of-concept in this work and it could be beneficial to improve the household waste consumer electronics collection in Malaysia.}

Yet, existing building reconstruction methods encounter crucial bottlenecks against high-definition data of large scales and high-level complexity, particularly in high-density urban scenes. This paper proposes a Building Section Skeleton (BSS) to reflect architectural design principles about parallelism and symmetries. A BSS atom describes a pair of intrinsic parallel or symmetric points; a BSS segment clusters dense BSS atoms of a pair of symmetric surfaces; the polyhedra of all BSS segments further echo the architectural forms and reconstructability. To prove the concepts of BSS for automatic compact reconstruction, this paper presents a BSS method for building reconstruction that consists of one stage of BSS segments hypothesizing and another stage of BSS segments merging. Experiments and comparisons with four state-of-the-art methods have been conducted on 15 diverse scenes encompassing more than 60 buildings. Results confirmed that the BSS method achieves frontiers in compactness, robustness, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, simultaneously, especially for high-density urban scenes. On average, the BSS method reconstructed each scene into 623 triangles with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.82 m, completing the process in 110 s. First, the proposed BSS is an expressive 3D feature reflecting architectural designs in high-density cities, and can open new avenues to city modeling and other urban remote sensing and photogrammetry studies. Second, for practitioners in smart city development, the BSS method for building reconstruction offers an accurate and efficient approach to compact building and city modeling.

To illustrate this principle, we engineered near-infrared light-activated smart nanogels (NASNs) by chemically cross-linking ROS-responsive linkages within hyaluronic acid-graft-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-diethylenetriamine-grafted-chlorine e6 (Ce6) polymer (HA-PEG-Dien-g-Ce6) and carboxylated thioketal (TK) serving as a cross-linker to enable PDT-driven cytochrome c (CC) liberation. The NASNs demonstrated substantial loading capacity and exceptional stability across diverse biological settings, attributed to the robust nature of the TK bond. Notably, CC-loaded NASNs effectively penetrated A549 cells via CD44-mediated endocytosis and rapidly escaped from the endo-lysosomal compartment. Upon light activation, the Ce6 produced ROS, leading to TK bond disruption in NASNs, and consequent release of encapsulated CC. This precise, photo-induced PDT mechanism and CC liberation markedly enhanced antitumor efficacy while maintaining minimal toxicity, establishing a solid foundation for remote, as-needed protein delivery systems and potential integration with additional therapeutic modalities.}

The first step, which was open coding, involved the collection of a group of primary concepts and the extraction of analytic categories. In axial coding, the relationship between the categories was determined. Using selective coding, all of the identified categories were integrated and built, and 6 main categories and 28 sub-categories were identified.

This concept offers (1) individual control of each implemented SRB with its incorporation into the integrated water system management and (2) a simple large-scale implementation of additional storage units as an alternative to future expansion of existing infrastructure. The open-source software “Smartin” is developed by hypothetically retrofitting an Alpine municipality with SRBs to evaluate the effects of the latter on the urban water infrastructure. Compared to uncontrolled rain barrels, a simple coordinated control strategy already clearly improves the performance of the integrated system by reducing combined sewer overflow and addressing drinking water demand.}

The article proposes a Fatigue Monitoring and Detection (FMD) model based on a fusion Machine Learning (ML) approach: Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA)-optimized Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM). Firstly, the physiological information of electroencephalogram (ECG) of coal miners before and after manual handling operations was collected using the MP160 recorder (multiconductance physiological 160) produced by BIOPAC, USA. Using the paired-samples t-test method, the characteristic indicators reflecting miners' fatigue were extracted from the ECG. Secondly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to optimize the selected feature indicators and establish the depth fatigue feature parameter set to characterize the fatigue level of miners. Finally, the proposed MPA-LSSVM-based FMD model is applied to recognize Miners' fatigue levels. The results show that the selected indexes can effectively reflect the fatigue status of Miners. The proposed MPA-LSSVM-based FMD model has higher recognition accuracy than SVM and LSSVM models (13.99% and 18.68% higher, respectively) and better robustness. Therefore, the proposed MPA-LSSVM-based FMD model can accurately and effectively identify the fatigue status of Miners.}

abstract = {Smart Island (SI) refers to the condition where distributed generation (DG) units e.g. wind turbines (WT), fuel cell (FC), and photovoltaic cells (PV) have to control current, voltage, and frequency of the grid by themselves without any support from the main grid. Therefore, design and implementation of robust controller to overcome disturbances and load variations is very crucial. This paper presents a new approach using General Type-II Fuzzy controller to control smart island in combination with a novel modified optimization algorithm to increase the load sharing throughout the DGs operating in an islanding mode. This case study assumes that there are two DGs in the smart island where each DG has its own responsibilities. In particular, one of the DGs regulates the frequency and voltage based on a reference feedback, while the other DG operates in load current control mode to share load between each DG properly. The simulation results indicate that the suggested controller has a quick response to load alternations with a low steady state error and low THD. Moreover, the proposed controller is independent from system states and other units. The experimental analysis indicate that the suggested control system is effectively capable to coordinate the operations of the DG units in smart island to validate the stable operation of the overall smart island.}

Researchers studied managing and scheduling applications in these architectures extensively, however some issues, especially the effect of mobility, have been less explored. Additionally, evaluation of these mechanisms in realistic scenarios is difficult, as real-world experiments are costly and building composite applications with existing simulation tools is laborious. We call such composite applications which entail functions for handling connectivity and mobility disruptions in the edge network, Edge Processes. In this paper, we present STEP-ONE - a set of tools developed to simulate IoT systems where the management and application composition is handled with Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) related standards. We demonstrate STEP-ONE with a smart-city scenario, where an application modeled as a choreography of processes is executed between different resources - cloud, fog and moving edge devices. We show how STEP-ONE enables constructing such a scenario and how it can be extended with algorithms and decision-mechanisms to adaptively drive the execution of such processes. We also present how detailed performance metrics can be extracted from the discrete event simulations run with STEP-ONE.}

Many applications, such as energy management need information like activities and occupancy to provide good assistance. Most of the previous research about AR and OE focused on applying supervised machine learning methods. Researchers train a model and evaluate it using data collected from the same environment (Domain). A model trained in a specific domain will not generalize well in other domains. Creating a trained model to every environment is not feasible due to the lack of data. Collecting sufficient data can be time consuming and infeasible in some cases. Computational power can be a challenge for researchers by increasing the training time due to the lack of the required computing resources. Using traditional machine learning methods, the obtained performance may be unsatisfactory, and can not lead to optimal solutions. For all these reasons, we need a solution that helps us overcome the stated problem and obtain models with acceptable results. In this work, we present and discuss different transfer learning methods that help us transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. The goal is to reuse as much as possible information from the source domain to enhance the performance of the model at the target domain. This type of approaches will solve the problems mentioned before such as the lack of data and will provide us with good results due to the use of knowledge from multiple source domains. We tested five Transfer learning (TL) approaches: a principal component analysis (PCA)-like method that creates a transformation like the PCA transformation and apply it to the data to create new common domain, a PCA based method that creates common domain using PCA, a PCA-SMOTE method that balances the data and creates common domain, a basic method based on a simple matching between similar features from source and target domain, and a sparse coding-based method that creates a common domain where the data representation will be as sparse as possible. The impressive results that we obtained in both tasks prove that the presented methods can be applied to transfer knowledge across different domains.}

Based on 3705 observations from 435 articles, we demonstrated that the response of N2O emissions was more sensitive to N inputs on acidic soils than alkaline soils and that climatic factors influence this difference. Total global N2O emissions from tea plantations in the 2010s were estimated to be 46.5 Gg N yr–1 using an exponential model developed herein. Tea plantations are a significant contributor to N2O emissions from the agricultural sector in several countries. The intensity of yield-scale GHG emissions from tea was significantly higher than in other upland cereals. Applying climate-smart practices in Chinese tea plantations could reduce emissions equivalent to one-third of the global total. We conclude that accurate identification of N2O emission hotspots and implementation of targeted measures are essential to achieving global temperature control targets.}

A novel framework was proposed with the “European circular cities declaration” (ECCD) (2020), consisting of a list of 10 principles committing to integrate circularity into the city's design, development, and management. As a foremost finding, and building on the authors' previous studies of Japan's CE and CC, this work shaped a circular cities declaration (CCD) for Japan following a triple-axis methodology; It (1) evaluates the ECCD as a baseline, (2) adapts it to Japan's unique socio-economic landscape, and (3) considers the three pillars of sustainable development, offering practical guidance for governments facing similar challenges. This environmental management tool goes beyond the EU one providing a model of hybrid governance and monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The resulting declaration is intended for the government to facilitate a transition from insulated CE policies to holistic CC ones, but also for businesses, academia, and communities; Thus, it may aid in endorsing a cities' common framework and shared vision to harness the potential of CC to address environmental issues, foster innovation and collaboration toward a resilient future in Japan.}

To supply energy for agricultural sensors, the wind energy harvester supports a possible solution. However, the average wind speed on the earth surface is only 3.28 m/s, which cannot easily be harvested by traditional generators efficiently. To efficiently harvest breeze energy in the farmland environment, a breeze-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (BD-TENG) was proposed. By selecting lightweight rotor materials and designing suitable wind scoops structures, the start-up wind speed of BD-TENG is as low as 3.3 m/s, and when the wind speed is 4 m/s, the energy conversion efficiency of the BD-TENG can reach 12.06%. Moreover, under 4 m/s wind speed, the output performance of the BD-TENG is 330 V, 7 μA, 137 nC, and the peak power is 2.81 mW. So, the BD-TENG is easier to operate normally even in low wind speed environments and can harvest natural breeze energy efficiently. Experiments prove that in natural environments, the BD-TENG successfully lights up 300 red and blue light-emitting diodes in series, which can be applied to increase lighting time for plants at night. Moreover, the BD-TENG can power a soil thermometer by harvesting natural breeze energy. Therefore, the BD-TENG can be widely used in farmland environments to provide energy for agricultural sensor networks. The BD-TENG has bright prospects in smart agriculture and can promote its sustainable development.}

Although these systems are economically profitable, reducing the energy cost of the buildings over time, their penetration has not been that impressive yet due to their high initial cost. In this study, an energy system comprising a few PVT panels (without any batteries) and a heat storage tank is proposed and investigated for smart buildings with two-way interactions with both heat and electricity grids. Removing the battery from the system would result in a sharp reduction of the cost of the system and, thereby, will make incentives for the end-users to adopt the solution. This novel system will not only supply the buildings’ real-time electricity and domestic hot water needs but also will compensate for a significant portion of the buildings’ energy expenses by selling the surplus generations to the electricity and heat networks. The dynamic model of the proposed system is comprehensively analyzed from thermodynamic and economic points of view using TRNSYS software. Additionally, defining the overall annual exergy efficiency, and the total product cost as the objective functions, optimization of the design and size of the system employing the TRNOPT tool has been done. It is shown that the optimized system results in 16.7 €/MWh and 7.7 €/MWh lower energy costs for electricity and heat of the buildings compared to when the buildings’ demand is only supplied by heat and electricity grids.}

This work aims to simultaneously address the issue related to the management of the energy demand of the private transport sector and building sector in the framework of the smart grid energy districts. The investigated smart grid is designed for meeting the energy demands of a district, including the energy demand for space heating and cooling, as well as the electric energy of a lot of buildings, occupied by people who only use electric vehicles. The system is equipped with a cogenerator, which is expected to operate according to the base-load operation strategy, constantly producing the rated power for whatever power demanded. Two charging strategies are analyzed and compared with the aim of detecting which strategy better exploits the power produced by the cogenerator. The performed dynamic simulations of the whole system are carried out by means of TRNSYS tool. TRNSYS allows one to use a detailed library of components which carefully model and simulate the devices included in the proposed system model. Suitable control strategies are also developed in order to improve the energy, environmental and economic performance of the smart grid. The results show that this layout allows one to considerably reduce the primary energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of the investigated district. As matter of fact, the proposed smart energy grid achieves a primary energy saving index of about 32%, with a payback period of about 6 years. These promising results suggest that the proposed smart energy grid may be useful for addressing the issue related with environmental impact of building sector and private transport sector.}

abstract = {Battery electric vehicles do not emit CO2 from an internal combustion engine but can cause emissions while charging electricity generated by remote fossil power plants. Smart charging offers the possibility to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) by shifting the charging sessions to moments with lower emissions in power generation. However, this requires the battery electric vehicle user to accept postponed charging and a system to shift charging towards times with lower CO2 emissions. This requires a forecast of the marginal emission factors of the energy system. While marginal emission factors are often used to evaluate CO2 saving potentials of smart charging in long-term scenarios, there is little insight on the saving potentials of individual charging sessions in the short run. We derive marginal emission factors for Germany in 2017 using an established regression model and generate short-term predictions of marginal emission factors using a multilayer perception (MLP). The forecasts can provide feedback to drivers and allow scheduling for CO2 efficient smart charging. Comparison between this approach and immediate charging throughout a year in the German power system allows calculating the CO2 saving potentials of the system. The results show that marginal emission factors in Germany depend on the system’s load with peak load levels having the smallest marginal emission factors. Using average instead of marginal emission factors, can result in misinformation and even increase emissions. We propose forecasts of marginal emission factors that rely on short-term load forecasts and are accurate enough to obtain substantial saving in CO2 emissions from 1% to 10% depending on the charging parameters. While using this approach as a smart charging algorithm would result in increasing peak loads, the methodology might be a way to provide BEV users with real-time feedback of their charging behaviour and increase their willingness to postpone charging.}

B-FERL uses permissioned blockchain technology to tailor information access to restricted entities in the connected vehicle ecosystem. It also uses a challenge–response data exchange between the vehicles and roadside units to monitor the internal state of the vehicle to identify cases of in-vehicle network compromise. In order to enable authentic and valid communication in the vehicular network, only vehicles with a verifiable record in the blockchain can exchange messages. Through qualitative arguments, we show that B-FERL is resilient to identified attacks. Also, quantitative evaluations in an emulated scenario show that B-FERL ensures a suitable response time and required storage size compatible with realistic scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate how B-FERL achieves various important functions relevant to the automotive ecosystem such as trust management, vehicular forensics and secure vehicular networks.}

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has become a common approach for distributed training of quality of service (QoS) prediction tasks in smart city solutions. However, FL is vulnerable to heterogeneity. Existing FL-based QoS prediction methods usually update the global model by directly aggregating the divergent local gradients computed on heterogeneous datasets, which does not effectively capture the heterogeneity of users’ QoS data distribution and requires many rounds of training and much communication time to achieve satisfactory accuracy. In addition, the high communication latency between the central server and the client further slows down the convergence process. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-centre federated learning framework for services QoS prediction via a cloud–edge collaboration mechanism, namely MultiFed. In this framework, we sink the central server in traditional FL from cloud to edge and train a global model in each edge region. The edge server performs two gradient aggregation strategies to update the global model in each training round. One is an internal aggregation strategy for regional users; the other is an external aggregation among edge servers with the assistance of a cloud server. Extensive experiments have shown that 9.52%∼40.00% reduces the communication delay, and 1.91%∼38.89% reduces the communication rounds required to reach the target prediction in this method compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of MultiFed.}

Herein, we introduce a new one-body strategy, zinc ion battery (ZIB) is the technology of flexible sensor energy supply, the technology uses a rechargeable solid-state zinc ion battery with multiple charging modes as the energy supply unit (405.07 mAh g−1), and the electrode material is used as the sensitive layer of the flexible pressure sensor, which greatly improves the sensitivity (S=5.64 *105 kPa−1) of the pressure sensor through layer assembly technology. This pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (60.0/80.0 ms), stable long-term response, excellent cycle stability (8000 times) and wide pressure detection (50 Pa-70,000 Pa). We believe that the design of the self-powered sensor integration system will open up a new and versatile platform for the next generation of autonomous power electronics in smart home applications.}

abstract = {Recently, brain–computer interface (BCI) based systems have become an emerging technology facilitating smart living. Accurate identification of eye states (open or closed) via an EEG-based BCI interface has many applications in a smart living environment, such as controlling devices and monitoring health status. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), including deep neural networks, are currently quite popular in many applications. In this study, a robust and unique ANN-based ensemble method is developed in which multiple ANNs are trained individually using different parts of the training data. The outcomes of each ANN are then combined using another ANN to enhance the predictive intelligence. The outcome of this ANN is considered the ultimate prediction of the user’s eye state. The proposed ensemble method requires minimal training time and yields highly accurate eye state classification. An extensive analysis of bias and variance was used to assess the generalization ability of the proposed model while applying it to a real BCI environment and dataset. The proposed model outperforms traditional ANNs and other machine learning tools for eye state classification.}

A composite is composed of magnetostrictive and piezoelectric reinforcements that both show nonlinear multiphysics coupling and a polymer matrix that exhibits viscoelastic behavior. For dealing with nonlinear and time-dependent problems, a tangent linearization is employed to linearize the nonlinear constituents and a time-integration algorithm is applied to numerically determine the viscoelastic response of the matrix. A unified constitutive equation can be subsequently formulated to cover various phase constitutive laws following by a simplified unit-cell micromechanics model to set up a composite constitutive relation. The presented formulation is validated by limited experimental data available in literatures. Numerical results show that inclusion of a polymer matrix in a smart composite causes magnetoelectric coupling to be creep due to strain-mediated coupling among these three phases. The established unit-cell micromechanics model can be further integrated into a finite element framework to analyze composite structures, which is a great merit in a variety of practical applications. It will do so by implementing the presented micromechanics method at every integration point.}

Malware detection is one of the most powerful and effective approaches to guarantee security of Android systems, especially for industrial platform and smart city. Recently, researches using machine learning-based techniques for Android malware detection increased rapidly. Nevertheless, most of the appeared approaches have to perform feature analysis and selection, so-called feature engineering, which is time-consuming and relies on artificial experience. To solve the inefficiency problem of feature engineering, we propose TC-Droid, an automatic framework for Android malware detection based on text classification method. The core idea of TC-Droid is derived from the field of text classification. TC-Droid feeds on the text sequence of APPs analysis reports generated by AndroPyTool, applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore significant information (or knowledge) under original report text, instead of manual feature engineering. In an evaluation with different number of real-world samples, TC-Droid outperforms state-of-the-art model (Drebin) and several classic models (NB, LR, KNN, RF) as well. With multiple experimental settings and corresponding comparisons, TC-Droid achieves effective and flexible performance in Android malware detection task.}

Since electricity is scarce and in high demand it has become an important problem for identifying robust energy consumption predictive models for powered smart residential homes. In our research we compare SVR, LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU models for predictive energy consumption data of smart residential homes. Empirical results indicate that with increase in the amount of data the performance of machine learning SVR degraded significantly more as compared to Deep Learning Techniques, which provides conclusive evidence that machine learning techniques are not suitable for the task. Whereas, our proposed CNN-GRU architecture performs 17.4% better in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) with a value of 0.151 compared to the LSTM which has a value of MAE equals to 0.183 for days granularity of data and is only bested by the LSTM by 0.4% in terms of MAE for hour granularity data, where the CNN-GRU has MAE of 0.229 and LSTM achieves the MAE of 0.228.

However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols. It is noteworthy that the detection performance of the SPEAR SIEM is demonstrated with real data originating from four real SG use case (a) hydropower plant, (b) substation, (c) power plant and (d) smart home.}

The proposed approach recognizes the activities performed in a smart home, and separates the normal from the anomalous activities. Moreover, we identify the anomalous days based on the number of activities performed in a day. We perform activity recognition by applying probabilistic neural network on the pre-segmented activity-data obtained from the sensors deployed at different locations in a smart home. We use H2O autoencoder to identify the anomalous from the normal instances of activities. We further categorize the anomalies based on the criteria such as missing or extra subevents, and unusual duration of activity. Since the ground truth of the anomalies is unavailable, we generate the ground truth using the boxplots of the duration, and the number of subevents in an activity. We provide the quantified results of activity recognition and anomaly detection that can be further used by the research community. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach on two publicly available CASAS smart home datasets demonstrates its ability in the activity recognition and the correct identification of anomalies.}

Income inequality, on the other hand, is crucially linked to both transport demand and institutions that can shape transport regimes. However, existent literature has scarcely linked income inequality and HTE. This research provides evidence about this link. Income concentration by the richest 10 per cent of the population is found to be significantly, positively and exogenously correlated with HTE on purchase and use of private transport equipment. The proposed econometric models can explain close to half of the variance of this type of HTE among countries. Two theoretical explanations are proposed and debated. One is demand-based, and the other supply-based. The latter is preferred over the former, stating that income concentration by the elites is a proxy of a balance of power that is associated to private-oriented transport regimes. Such regimes promote private goods over public goods or, in other words, car dependency, transport disadvantage, and/or informal transport over strong public transport networks. A fundamental challenge for the future of cities is that more unequal societies are in danger of producing wider inequalities after adopting private-oriented smart transport technologies.}

Constructing buildings, bridges, or motorways over water reservoirs is perilous for resident amphibians, which belong to one of the most fragile animal groups. An automated system that reliably identifies whether any amphibian species live in a water reservoir before construction in that region will help building inspectors during city planning and will ensure that citizens can enjoy the opportunities provided by nature. In this paper, an intelligent amphibian species detection system is developed using features extracted from GIS and satellite images. The presence of seven amphibian species is detected using an artificial neural network (ANN). Depending on the spatial features of the region, the proposed cascade-forward backpropagation neural network (CFBNN) model, a special type of ANN, determines which amphibian species live there to enable ecological precautions to be taken before construction starts and to preserve the biodiversity for the future health of the community. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms recently suggested strategies with more than 15% improvement on average. The performance of the system shows that the proposed detection approach can be a useful tool for smart and ecological city planning.}

In this paper, a new Augmented-Urban Building Energy Model (A-UBEM) is proposed that combines data-driven and physics-based simulation methods to produce synthetic hourly load curve estimates for every building within a city—similar to data an hourly smart meter would measure. By using only publicly available data, a generalizable two-step process is implemented—that other cities with similar available data can replicate—using New York City as a case study. Step (1) estimates the annual energy use for every building in the city using supervised machine learning algorithms. Step (2) extends these results and leverages physics-based simulation models through a convex optimization formulation that minimizes the squared difference between the aggregated building demand and the observed city-wide hourly electricity demand. Results from step (1) show that the Random Forest algorithm performs best with a mean log squared error of 0.293, while the convex optimization in step (2) results in a mean training error of 6.11% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). To validate the stability of the produced load curves, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted, using random subsets of buildings from the city, which produce an out-of-sample error averaging 6.41% MAPE across each simulation. Particle swarm optimization is also explored—using the results from the Monte Carlo simulation—to assess if the model could be improved by relaxing certain constraints, but marginal error reductions are found, further proving the stability of the proposed model. Overall, A-UBEM is a first step towards creating highly granular urban-scale synthetic hourly load curves solely using open data. Such load curves are integral for planning sustainable cities and accelerating the adoption of low-carbon distributed energy resources (DERs) and district energy systems.}

The need for early prediction helps EV stations improve their power performance and utilize available power by designing intelligent charge scheduling algorithms. This study introduces a novel design approach for an off-grid photovoltaic (PV)-powered EV charging station, which involves three main stages: evaluating and analyzing different solar irradiance prediction models (theoretical, empirical, and artificial neural network (ANN) models), forecasting day-ahead solar power profiles, and optimizing charge scheduling for pre-booked vehicles using energy storage systems (ESS). The effectiveness of various solar irradiance prediction models is assessed to identify the best-performing model. The proposed approach employs a novel algorithmic procedure to fine-tune the selected model using a basic dataset. Power prediction simulations are conducted using MATLAB, while Python is utilized for model development. The feed forward neural network (FFNN) model for irradiance prediction has a 0.88 R2 score; the anisotropic general regression neural network (AGRNN), isotropic GRNN both have 0.94 and 0.95 R2 values for direct PV current prediction, providing a strong base for reliable forecasting models. The significance of ESS backup for effective charging stations is clearly demonstrated by a remarkable 20 kW peak shaving.}

First, the concept of DR and recent practical advances are investigated, especially the application of communication technologies to DR. Then, a comprehensive review of the cyber security, consumer privacy, and reliability of DR is presented. These topics received little attention in the past, but they will be among the most crucial factors in the future. In addition, the essential features and typical application scenarios of 5G communication are investigated. On this basis, the advantages, methods, recent advances, and implementation planning of 5G on DR are studied. Finally, the future work that must urgently be conducted in order to achieve the application of 5G to DR is discussed.

Using blockchain technology, the ciphertext document is stored in the medical cloud, the secure index is stored in the blockchain, and the smart contract is used for searching, which reduces the computational burden of the medical cloud. In addition, this scheme can verify whether the results returned by the cloud server are correct, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The scheme eliminates duplicate data and reduces the storage space of the medical cloud. Furthermore, users’ privacy security is guaranteed due to the hiding of access policy. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the semantic security of adaptively chosen-keyword attacks, can effectively protect the confidentiality of medical data and anonymity of users. Performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves optimizations in security index generation, trapdoor generation, search efficiency and result verification; hence, it is more suitable for many-to-many search scenarios such as smart medical applications. It effectively realizes the sharing of patient electronic medical records between doctors and third-party users without infringing on patient privacy.}

Yet there is a rising awareness that the success or failure of these practices depends on how they are staged and the context in which they are conducted. These contextual factors are often less than ideal, and futures practices take place at the crossroads of many pre-determined agendas and priorities. We distinguish four factors that shape the effects of participatory futures practices: 1) how the institutional landscape constrains or enables a project aimed at urban sustainability transformations; 2) the participatory culture surrounding the project; 3) the project design; and 4) the futures methods applied. We assess these factors in three cities within the European H2020 IRIS Smart Cities project. In each city, project members participated in sessions where they designed citizen engagement using a futures methodology: the novel Scope and Ladder models. Each city reflects a different combination of the four contextual factors. We find that space for exploration and re-imagining can be found and optimized under imperfect conditions. Drawing on the results of the three cases, we conclude with a set of recommendations for the funders, project members and futures organizers of urban sustainability transformation projects.}

This article explores the development of the New Urbanism and Smart Growth movements and their influence over institutional approaches to managing urban growth in recent decades. It reviews the principles of the theories, discusses the ways in which they have been established in policy and practice, and considers the challenges to their implementation in North America.}

abstract = {Atomic force Microscopy (AFM) is commonly used to study various mechanical, functional, and electrical properties of materials at the nanoscale, as well as for characterizing the topography and surface properties. Up to our knowledge, this is the first investigation to study the surface properties of some carboxymethyl guar gum-based smart superabsorbent hydrogels before and after swelling. In this regard, three sets of modified carboxymethyl guar gum (CMGG) hydrogels were prepared via reaction with different weight ratios of acrylate monomers. The chemical composition of these hydrogels was assured via the IR spectroscopy and the morphology of the dry and swelled gels was studied via the ESEM. The swelling data were correlated with the chemical composition of the prepared hydrogels together with a detailed AFM study of their maps. The chemical modifications were also confirmed by a recent model of AFM. The data reveal that the highest swelling was achieved by C2 in which the weight ratio of acrylate monomers is twice that of guar gum (Qmax = 676 g g after 150 min) It was also found that the swelling capacity of all the prepared hydrogels decreases slightly from the first to the third swelling cycle. For instance, the swelling performance for C2 is as following: 767, 750 and 734 g g for the first, second and third cycles respectively. The data extracted from the AFM showed that surface roughness increases from 15.62 nm to 22.47 and the height rises from 11.2 nm to 43.9 nm as a result of chemical modification for guar gum into carboxymethyl guar gum.}
