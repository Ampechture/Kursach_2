abstract = {This paper describes a microclimate monitoring system consisting of a LoRaWAN network of wireless climate sensors, a data collector and analytical software. The system is a part of the ICS RAS SmartGrid Centre project for predicting building energy consumption. During the design phase, the authors considered the concept of comfort, which is involved in setting control objectives for HVAC plants. It was necessary to overcome some characteristics of the LoRaWAN protocol, such as floating data transmission period and limited intensity of sensor communication. These have been overcome by post-processing the data with Python software, using libraries numpy and scipy. The collected data was passed through an interpolation filter for synchronization, and the resulting data is freely available in dataset format on our website for all interested researchers. Additionally, weather data was collected using a local meteostation to be considered as external disturbances in analysis problems. This paper also considers an approach to passive identification of the thermal protection parameters of a building. The coronavirus lockdown period was chosen to assume the impact of visitors negligible. The parameters are supposed to be estimated by correlation analysis. The estimates obtained should be compared with the values calculated according to ISO and Russian construction standards for diagnostic reasons.}

abstract = {Electrical energy consumption if reduced during peak hours can result in the deferment of generation, transmission and distribution capacity addition. The postponement of capacity addition, or “avoided cost” is of promising value to electric utilities who can redirect financial resources for other purposes due to these offset costs. The reduction in energy consumption is achievable through smart grid implementation. Therefore, the utilities need to investigate whether upgrading their grid system to make it smarter is economically justifiable or not. Electricity companies have used the smart grid maturity model to assess their rating/ranking in different domains. The paper provides a framework for establishing future strategies and work plans as they pertain to smart grid implementations. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the demand-side management (DSM), energy efficiency measures and distributed generation benefits of smart grid in Oman. The developed scenarios include grid enhancement, customer contribution to the grid and both of these options simultaneously. The scenarios are analyzed for peak reduction and their benefits are calculated in terms of avoided cost of generation, transmission, distribution, and environmental costs.}

In addition, to efficiently manage such traffic, it is critical to be able to predict the impact of different traffic policies, and potential changes to the city road systems structure. To this end, accurate traffic simulation models must be derived that can help in this task. This paper presents a tool that aims to improve the representativeness of traffic simulations by generating realistic Origin-Destination (OD) traffic matrices. In particular, we focus on cities whose source of traffic information are the induction loop detectors deployed through the different streets and avenues of the city. By comparing against the widely used DFROUTER tool, part of the SUMO open-source traffic simulation package, we show how we are able to improve the traffic model accuracy significantly. Specifically, we achieved more realistic route lengths and a better distribution of traffic sources and destinations.}

NCFs were dip-coated with pristine polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), intrinsically stretchable polymer pristine polyurethane (PU), and three different PTFE–PU blends to generate five different coated nanoconductive fibers (CNCFs). SGs for electricity generation and harvesting were fabricated by intertwining the NCFs and CNCFs. The SG based on pristine-PTFE-coated NCFs showed poor performance, owing to the rigidity of PTFE. Optimization of the PU polymer ratio and the power generation mechanism of the SGs was analyzed using various techniques. The SG with a PTFE:PU ratio of 8:2 generated the highest output current (9.86 nA) and was mechanically robust even under a high level of stretching (50%). Moreover, this SG was durable up to 175 stretching–relaxation cycles and could still deliver significant output current (2.88 nA). Strontium aluminate was dip-coated on the optimized SG to fabricate an incorporated smart garment (ISG) with improved light generation efficiency. The as-prepared ISG can be used in the future as a lightweight, reproducible, and renewable energy harvester.}

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is connected with every aspect of social, cultural, economic, educational, and commercial activity. Smart devices in particular have changed society and are necessary goods for modern people. Smart device usage is rapidly growing in everyday life, so the ability to use a smart device is increasingly important, yet there is little data supporting increased digital inclusion of people with disabilities in mobile device use.
Objective/Hypothesis
This study investigates the effects of the smart environment on the information divide experienced by people with disabilities.
Methods
Data from the 2013 Information Divide Index Data of the National Information Society Agency was analyzed regarding three aspects: access, skill, and competence. The accessibility difference was investigated by comparing access to a PC or smart device in two groups. The effects of a smart environment on the information divide were analyzed using General Linear Modeling (GLM).
Results
The access rate was higher for the general group than for that of those with disabilities, and this difference appeared to be greater in the smart environment. The results of the GLM showed that disability and device access had statistically significant effects on skill and all aspects of competence.
Conclusions
These results provide evidence that the smart environment further creates the information divide for people with disabilities. Strategies should be formed to reduce this divide, particularly within smart environments.}

abstract = {This paper develops a machine learning aggregated integer linear programming approach for the full observability of the automated smart grids by positioning of micro-synchrophasor units, taking into account the reconfigurable structure of the distribution systems. The proposed stochastic approach presents a strategy occurring in several stages to micro-synchrophasor unit positioning based on the load level and demand in the system and based on the pre-determined sectionalizing and tie switches. Such a technique can also deploy the zero-injection limitations of the model and reduce the search space of the problem. Moreover, a novel method based on whale optimization method (WOM) is introduced to simultaneously enhance the reliability indices in order to specify the optimum topology for each phase and reduce the costs of power losses and customer interruptions. Although the problem of micro-synchrophasor placement is formulated in an integer linear programming framework, the restructuring technique is resolved on the basis of the WOM heuristic approach. Considering the uncertainty due to the metering devices or forecast errors, a stochastic framework based on point estimation is deployed to handle the uncertainty effects. The simulation and numerical results on a real system verify that the proposed method assures visibility of the distribution network pre and post reconfiguration in the time horizon of the planning. Furthermore, the results show that the system observability can be guaranteed at different load levels even though the system experiences different reconfiguration and topologies.}

abstract = {The hypothesis of this paper is that in order to identify least cost solutions of the integration of fluctuating renewable energy sources into current or future 100% renewable energy supplies one has to take a Smart Energy Systems approach. This paper outline why and how to do so. Traditionally, significant focus is put on the electricity sector alone to solve the renewable energy integration puzzle. Smart grid research traditionally focuses on ICT, smart meters, electricity storage technologies, and local (electric) smart grids. In contrast, the Smart Energy System focuses on merging the electricity, heating and transport sectors, in combination with various intra-hour, hourly, daily, seasonal and biannual storage options, to create the flexibility necessary to integrate large penetrations of fluctuating renewable energy. However, in this paper we present the development and design of coherent Smart Energy Systems as an integrated part of achieving future 100% renewable energy and transport solutions. The transition from fossil fuels towards the integration of more and more renewable energy requires rethinking and redesigning the energy system both on the generation and consumption side. To enable this, the Smart Energy System must have a number of appropriate infrastructures for the different sectors of the energy system, which are smart electricity grids, smart thermal grids (district heating and cooling), smart gas grids and other fuel infrastructures. It enables fluctuating renewable energy (such as wind, solar, wave power and low value heat sources) to utilise new sources of flexibility such as solid, gaseous, and liquid fuel storage, thermal storage and heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. Smart Energy Systems also enable a more sustainable and feasible use of bioenergy than the current types allow. It can potentially pave the way to a bioenergy-free 100% renewable energy and transport system.}

Therefore, there is a need to reorganise the urban streets to create more spaces for pedestrians, even with the presence of automated vehicles (AVs). This research proposes the concept of a superblock model in the presence of automated vehicles to meet this challenge. This research aims to assess the impacts of AVs on pedestrian-friendly streets using a superblock approach. In the superblock model, cut-through traffic demand is restricted, and traffic generated or attracted to a superblock can have access, allowing for more room for public spaces. This study systematically discusses the superblock model implemented in a network with a grid structure using a genetic algorithm. It addresses the dynamic user equilibrium assignment for demand and topology segmentation. Three scenarios are considered due to the longer period of transition from traditional vehicles to fully AVs. The study evaluates the potential and constraints of implementing the superblock model with different penetration rates of AVs in the system by defining variable traffic demand and the variable number of superblocks. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed methodology is conducted. The proposed model is implemented on a real-time network of Barcelona city, and the findings of this study are summarised by the macroscopic fundamental diagram, which depicts the improvement in the performance of the network with the inclusion of AVs.}

In the upper level of the framework, attackers separately solve an optimization problem to result in optimal and suboptimal candidates of false data injection attack vectors leading to possible scenarios of under/overvoltage in the system. In the lower level, the attackers solve the second optimization problem collaboratively to identify the attacks targeting the most vulnerable regions of the system to undervoltage and overvoltage at the optimal time.

abstract = {Windows play a huge role in today's buildings, allowing for outside view and providing occupants with daylight. However, windows are also often considered to be one of the weakest building components with respect to high thermal losses and are in addition often the reason for overheating and glare issues. In comparison to traditional static windows, dynamic solutions like adaptive and controllable smart windows have the ability to adjust their optical properties in response to changing boundary conditions and hence have the potential to improve the energy performance and the user comfort of buildings. The objective of this work is twofold: (1) To collect and present the state-of-the-art of commercially available smart windows from manufacturers, both adaptive and controllable products, i.e. thermochromic, photochromic and electrochromic smart windows. This collection provides the reader with valuable information about window properties such as the U-value, g-value, solar transmittance (Tsol) and visible solar transmittance (Tvis). However, it is currently difficult to obtain all the desired information about the products from the manufacturers' websites and other open channels. (2) To conduct building energy performance simulations on selected products from each technology. These products are also simulated using the same U-values as the reference window, and in addition, two theoretical cases have been simulated to investigate the theoretical potential of different smart windows. Here, the optical parameters take on fictitious values between 10 and 90% and between 0 and 100% transmittance, respectively. All cases are simulated at three different locations, i.e. Trondheim (Norway), Madrid (Spain) and Nairobi (Kenya), and are compared to a reference static window. In total, 63 cases are simulated using the simulation software package IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE). The results shows that the electrochromic window controlled by operative temperature has the highest potential in lowering the energy demand for all cases and locations. The study also highlights the importance of having the right control strategy and control levels for each specific case.}

abstract = {There is a growing requirement for Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to ensure low response time to provision latency-sensitive real-time applications such as health monitoring, disaster management, and smart homes. Fog computing offers a means to provide such requirements, via a virtualized intermediate layer to provide data, computation, storage, and networking services between Cloud datacenters and end users. A key element within such Fog computing environments is resource management. While there are existing resource manager in Fog computing, they only focus on a subset of parameters important to Fog resource management encompassing system response time, network bandwidth, energy consumption and latency. To date no existing Fog resource manager considers these parameters simultaneously for decision making, which in the context of smart homes will become increasingly key. In this paper, we propose a novel resource management technique (ROUTER) for fog-enabled Cloud computing environments, which leverages Particle Swarm Optimization to optimize simultaneously. The approach is validated within an IoT-based smart home automation scenario, and evaluated within iFogSim toolkit driven by empirical models within a small-scale smart home experiment. Results demonstrate our approach results a reduction of 12% network bandwidth, 10% response time, 14% latency and 12.35% in energy consumption.}

Thus, SM can provide a competitive edge for manufacturers that successfully adopt it. In the process of adopting SM, building blocks play a critical role and can be seen as prerequisites. Managers of manufacturing companies are interested in learning what building blocks are relevant and can help make their operations smarter and more competitive. Our paper is a first attempt to answer this question through presenting the most frequently used building blocks for SM adoption. In order to achieve this objective, we conducted a systematic mapping review to identify both building blocks as well as current methods for adopting SM. In a next step, we matched the building blocks with the adoption methods. This matching of building blocks with the adoption methods helped in determining whether a building block actually recommended in the methods for adopting SM. We found that intelligent control, data analytics, IT-based production management systems (e.g., ERP, CAx, etc.), smart products/parts/materials, interoperability, data sharing systems and standards are the most commonly used building blocks for manufacturers that are aligned towards adopting SM. As a consequence, the future manufacturing workforce needs to be prepared to understand analytics, sensors, etc. The results also showed that, although building blocks such as blockchain, robots, visual technology, and 3D printing may find their application in specific manufacturing sectors, overall, they are less commonly associated with SM adoption compared to the other building blocks.}

It has been found that nonintegrated intensive approaches towards changing individual's behaviour, such as education and economic self-interest are not successful. This paper will explain how a large urban electricity meter replacement program can achieve a reduction in peak demand and overall energy consumption through the use of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI or ‘smart meters’) coupled with CBSM, which in turn enables the progression towards a ‘smart grid’. In order to measure success the following targets were set:•Peak demand reduction (peak lopping) of 20% from the households participating in the Behaviour Change Programs (BCPs).•Peak demand shifting (load shifting) to reduce energy consumption during ‘super peak’ by 10% in BCP participating households.•Average total energy use reduction of 10% in BCP participating households. The energy efficiency actions discussed with householders during eco-coaching, and other feedback communications, are identified by utilising the information regarding barriers and benefits generated from the research phase prior to coaching. These actions can include referral to other initiatives such as the provision of reduced cost solar PV power systems, direct load control devices for domestic air-conditioners, the time-of-use pricing product, the provision of in-home-displays (IHD) and other devices necessary for development of a ‘smart grid’.}

Since a large number of assembly lines can occur in a single factory, one of the main problems is how these data are processed in real-time. The system can handle incredibly large amounts of data by discharging the load from the central servers to the fog nodes. In this paper, there are two obvious advantages. Next, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is adapted to the fog computing environment, which improves its calculation performance considerably. The other is that a model of control is built that can display the form and extent of the defect simultaneously. A decision-making framework for multi-agents is built to ensure a production process architecture to optimize production processes.}

Technological solutions called “smart wells” and “smart fields” have been applied in petroleum industry for nearly two decades. They aim to improve the knowledge of petroleum production processes, and thereby improve the efficiency of operations. Researchers and companies in pursuit of their goals tend to use one-sided implications and numerous synonyms when describing the substance of the term, which leads to an occasional confusion. In order to study the concept of smart field from a general perspective, a literature review has been conducted, and main characteristic attributes of such solutions have been revealed. Selected marketed products offered by engineering companies have been analyzed as examples of the technology implementation. A definition has been proposed along with its practical implications. Additionally, an attempt has been made to place these solutions in a broad scientific context of intelligence and sustainability in contemporary business processes.}

The Overgrid Demand Response (DR) architecture is used for managing the residential flexible loads, estimating the aggregated power demand without any centralized server and creating a virtual “community” of smart buildings in the small island. Two different control schemes are applied considering load curtailing and load shifting in presence of significant variations of the electricity production in the island. Our simulation experiments show how the proposed architecture, without any centralized control, is able to contrast such events and, thanks to load shifting actions, guarantees also a minimum discomfort for the end-users, opening the path to substantial smart energy retrofit of small island communities.}

However, water utilities are yet to harness the potential of smart meters to build tailored daily diurnal demand patterns that reflect the consumption characteristics of individual developments that are increasingly applying alternative water sources and ultra-efficient appliances. This paper demonstrates how smart metering and water end-use data facilitates enhanced infrastructure planning of contemporary water supply schemes located in Queensland, Australia. To achieve research aims, extensive data received from high resolution smart meters fitted to a sample of 130 households was disaggregated into end use events (e.g. shower, dishwasher, etc.) and categorised into 48 thirty-minute time steps (i.e. daily diurnal demand) over the average day (AD) and peak day (PD). Moreover, these demand curves were also clustered according to water appliance stock efficiency ratings. Novel bottom-up end-use level models of demand were formulated representing scenarios of both single and multi-residential dwellings installed with combinations of water efficient appliances and rainwater tanks or greywater reuse. AD and PD diurnal demand patterns for these contemporary water scenarios were compared against the baseline scenario which represents the typical building code mandated dwelling constructed in the region of Queensland, Australia. Modelled demand curves for scenarios applying more efficient appliances in both dwelling types had lower peak demand than the baseline scenario by 13% and 6% for the AD and PD respectively, while scenarios also including rainwater tanks and greywater reuse (i.e. source substitution) resulted in peak reductions of 28% on the AD and 51% on the PD. The paper concludes with some implications for better handling the demand complexities of contemporary water supply schemes being developed by using smart meter data for the optimal planning of water infrastructure networks.}

In a very demanding market, request for on-time cargo delivery, transport efficiency is a critical issue, and the ability for real-time detection and resolving of all possible obstacles and exceptions becomes a core competency for logistics operators. The work presented here introduces the concept of Smart Cargo, able to autonomously react to its context, find and understand alternatives, compute adaptive behavior, optimizing its own decisions. The Smart Cargo concept, implements a paradigm shift requiring taking the control of computing applications, data, and services away from some central nodes (the “cloud”) to the other logical extreme (the “fog”) of the Internet. Fog provides an intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things, enabling Smart Cargo to go beyond the existing Intelligent Cargo concept. Fog computing is described here, as a necessary paradigm shift on distributed freight intelligence, allowing multimodal freight transport to achieve real-time situation awareness and reaction, planning with predictions and learning from the environment.}

EU member states are facing many challenges in order to fulfil different legal obligations linked with the sustainable waste management. The EU legislation related to environmental protection, already implemented in the national legislation of the Republic of Croatia, aims to introduce a system of integrated and sustainable waste management. This puts a focus on material and energy utilization of different waste streams produced in urban areas. Therefore, this requirement represents main challenge for many municipalities, mostly due to various binding targets in waste collection and treatment. Some of them are: reduction of waste generation and disposal, increase of the separately collected waste amounts and recycling rates. Source-separation of biowaste combined with biofuel production is one of the key priorities for many cities, combined with biofuel production in urban areas and its distribution via existing gas grids. The objective of this research is to present environmental benefits of such concept for city of Zagreb. First step is involvement of citizens and assessment of available organic waste. Hence, the conducted analysis has been performed as a survey in order to understand their behaviour and to successfully assess the energy potential of organic fraction from municipal solid waste. The presented research show that 84% of citizens are willing and motivated to participate in biowaste separation. An estimation of energy potential through the anaerobic digestion of organic waste has been presented and calculated to 1,900 t of biomethane based on the analysis which can be utilized through almost 70 CNG busses. This paper proposed concrete solution for the biofuel consumption, and gave an overview of the required land demand for digestate utilization. Also, presented SWOT analysis is giving an overview and confirming the sustainability of proposed concept.}

We investigate, in particular, the persistence of the effects and whether the effects differ between periods of high and low household occupancy, i.e. between morning and evening periods, and between weekdays and weekend days. The findings show that feedback is effective, leading to about 5% electricity consumption reduction that is persistent over an eleven month period. Furthermore, our results show that this reduction affects both low and high occupancy periods, suggesting that feedback is associated with rather permanent changes in habitual behavior and/or investments in energy-efficient technologies.}

We used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) topic modeling to cluster topics from Twitter data. Then, we conducted a temporal-spatial analysis to examine the distribution of these topics across different regions during the 2020 western U.S. wildfire season. Our results show that Twitter users mainly focused on three topics: “health impact,” “damage,” and “evacuation.” We used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) theory to explore the magnitude and velocity of topic diffusion on Twitter. The results displayed a clear relationship between topic trends and wildfire propagation patterns. The estimated parameters obtained from the SIR model in selected cities revealed that residents exhibited a high level of several concerns during the wildfire.

Deep Neural Network-powered IoT allowed innovative developments for medical society and distinctive probabilities to the medical data analysis in the healthcare industry (Yin, Yang, Zhang, & Oki, 2016). Despite this progress, several issues still required to be handled while concerning the quality of service. The key to flourishing in the shift from client-oriented to patient-oriented medical data analysis for healthcare society is applying deep networks to provide a high level of quality in key attributes such as end-to-end response time, overhead and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a holistic Deep Neural Network-driven IoT smart health care method called, Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network (GFB-CNN) based on real-time analytics. In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-driven IoT eHealth architecture based on the Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network in which the key quality of service parameters like, time and overhead is reduced with a higher rate of accuracy. The feasibility of the method is investigated using a comprehensive Mobile HEALTH (MHEALTH) dataset. This illustrative example discusses and addresses all important aspects of the proposed method from design suggestions such as corresponding overheads, time, accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By simulation, the performance of GFB-CNN method is compared to the state-of-the-art methods with various synthetically generated scenarios. Results show that with minimal time and overhead incurred for sensing and data collection, our method accurately evaluates medical data analysis for heart signals by efficient differentiation between healthy and unhealthy heart signals.}

The optimized composite showed a maximum strength of 286.15 kPa at its maximum strain rate of 410 %, and a high electrical conductivity of 8.23 S cm−1. It is further utilized to demonstrate SHS strain sensor for biomechanical signal detection, which exhibits high sensitivity to human wrist’s flexion and extension. Furthermore, it exhibits a high sensitivity with average TCR value of −5.2 % ℃-1 in a wider temperature range (25–100 ℃).

Concept networks precisely capture design information from a large volume of unstructured and heterogeneous textual data and saliently decrease time and labor cost for designers to read texts, which creates new opportunities for developing a smart product design system. To advance data-driven design, this study proposes the novel function-structure concept network (FSCN) construction method, which combines sentence parsing and word/phrase extraction to integrate functional and structural information. Furthermore, a network analysis method is proposed to explore design information associations that contain both explicit and implicit associations together and thereby recommend them simultaneously to designers as inspirational stimuli to support design ideation. This approach can enhance designers' capabilities to build associations between design information, conceive new design ideas during conceptual design, and increase creativity for solving design problems. The proposed FSCN construction and analysis method can be used as an auxiliary tool to visualize associations among design information so as to inspire idea generation in the early stage of conceptual design. An illustrative example was used to validate the practicability of the proposed methodology. The code of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/KWflyer/FSCN.}

abstract = {We proposed a support system called the “Smart Partition System” for infill elements that integrate smart technologies according to the Open Building principles. The design requirements were collected from design practitioners. These design requirements consisted of both architectural and information subsystems. The Smart Partition System was composed of the following multiple levels of smartness: the foundation/core level with an embedded design knowledge in the support system and the utility level with a modular infill that integrate smart technologies. We constructed functional prototypes to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed support system and some of the possibilities of the smart infill elements. Furthermore, the prototypes were evaluated by design practitioners. We compared our approach with current practices of smart building developments, and we also discussed some future prospects.}

That reason makes Indonesia becoming a place that is interesting to be visited by many tourists either local or international. Every year the number of tourists who visited Indonesia has greatly increased1,2 and transformed the tourism to be an important sector for Indonesia economical. The rapid development of tourism sector in Indonesia must be equilibrated by the evolution of technology and the supported facilities. Now, the usage of a smartphone technology is one of the important things and a part of modern people daily activities. By taking the advantages of a smartphone, this study is conducted to develop an android application that is named Smart Travelling. Smart travelling has many features that can facilitate every tourist who visited Indonesia, such as recognizes any tourist attractions, shows any events that nearby visited attractions, displays the nearest police station and hospital for an emergency case, and saves the history of the recognized objects. The main idea of the tourist attractions recognition here is to implement an image recognition using landmark detection feature from Google Cloud Vision Application Program Interface (API)3 technology which helps the tourist to easily remember and access any information regarding the visited attractions. In this study, the result is a completed application which is evaluated using questionnaires to 35 randomly selected participants. Based on the evaluation, the smart travelling achieves positive inputs and mostly the participants agree that the image recognition feature is really helping them. Furthermore, we also obtained a significant result for the scan landmark testing, which is 86% for the accuracy.}

We correlate data from multiple sources and consider a time interval ranging from about one year before to one year after the pandemic breakout, which allows to account for preexisting seasonal patterns as well as the disruption brought by the pandemic. Results: We identify that increased traffic volume is associated with significantly more collisions with a robust elasticity varying between 1.2 and 1.7. At the same time, higher traffic volumes are associated with a significant reduction in casualties. Conversely, low traffic volumes are associated with high speeds and with particularly dangerous collisions. In terms of social cost, we separately calculated the cost of property damage and casualties. We measured that the reduction in the per-day social cost of collisions during the COVID-19 period is approximately $453,000 in property damage. However, the increase in casualties from collisions at lower traffic volumes are worth approximately $2.6 million in injuries and fatalities, entirely offsetting any benefit from reduced collisions. Practical Applications: This research provides valuable insights that policy makers may take into consideration when shifting traffic volume in relation to social cost and safety, such as congestion taxes.}

Today the term 'smart home' is also linked with the networking of home automation systems, home appliances and communications and entertainment electronics. Living in a smart home often makes also significant demands on the occupants who are required to drastically change some of their living habits. This review summarizes current findings on the effect of measured environmental parameters on indoor air quality, individual thermal comfort and living behavior in smart homes with focus on central Europe. A critical evaluation of available sensor technologies, their application in homes and data security aspects as well as limits and possibilities of current technologies to control particles and gaseous pollutants indoors is included.

The knowledge graph grows via automated link predictions using genetic programming that are validated by humans for improving transparency and calibrating accuracy. The knowledge graph builder is designed for pervasive devices such as smartphones and preserves privacy by localizing all computations. The accuracy, practicality, and usability of the knowledge graph builder is evaluated in a real-world social experiment that involves a smartphone implementation and a Smart City application scenario. The proposed methodology of knowledge graph building outperforms a baseline method in terms of accuracy while demonstrating its efficient calculations on smartphones and the feasibility of the pervasive human supervision process in terms of high interactions throughput. These findings promise new opportunities to crowdsource and operate pervasive reasoning systems for cyber–physical social systems in Smart Cities.}

However, while cities are also targeting consumption-based emissions, whether their plans are sufficient to become climate neutral from both a territorial and a consumption-based perspective remains unclear. We designed a conceptual framework based on a literature review of urban climate mitigation and reviewed mitigation–related documents from nine Swedish cities. We found a strong political will and solid targets but gaps in the plans and actions mostly related to transport, construction and food. Municipal governments use “soft” policy instruments to meet climate targets; at times, economic instruments contradict the vision. Our evaluation indicates a disconnect between intent and outcomes. More regulatory instruments must be deployed to become climate-neutral, and economic incentives must be aligned with the vision. Understanding how climate mitigation strategies affect resources within the city will be necessary to ensure the acceptance and uptake of climate action plans. Collaboration with superordinate governments, within and outside national borders, will be essential to align on policy and policy instruments.}

Further, we propose that consumer innovativeness moderates these relationships. Survey responses from 338 actual shoppers with prior experience of smart retail technology were used to test the research model, while structural equation modelling was used to develop the proposed hypotheses. The present study offers a better understanding of consumer adoption of smart retail technology that may help managers to develop adoption strategies for successful implementation of smart retail technology in-store.}

A convergence process is identified, with higher growth rates for less-developed regions; however, the most developed regions are more resilient. Tourism demand is positively correlated with growth and resilience but a high share of tourism within regional employment has negative impacts on both. Specialisation patterns combining tourism with agriculture have positive effects in both cases. Diversification strategies including unrelated sectors contribute to increased resilience in these regions, and a prioritisation of construction reduces regional resilience.}

In this era of rapid technological advances, these applications have become one of the primary tools we use daily both in our personal and professional lives. The applications play key roles in facilitating many applications that are pivotal in our today's society including communication, education, business, entertainment, medical, finance, travel, utilities, social, and transportation. This paper reviewed the opportunities and challenges of the applications related to transportation. The opportunities revealed include route planning, ridesharing/carpooling, traffic safety, parking information, transportation data collection, fuel emissions and consumption, and travel information. The potential users of these applications in the field of transportation include (1) transportation agencies for travel data collection, travel information, ridesharing/carpooling, and traffic safety, (2) engineering students for field data collection such as travel speed, travel time, and vehicle count, and (3) general traveling public for route planning, ridesharing/carpooling, parking, traffic safety, and travel information. Significant usage of smart mobile applications can be potentially very beneficial, particularly in automobile travel mode to reduce travel time, cost, and vehicle emissions. In the end this would make travel safer and living environments greener and healthier. However, road users' interactions with these applications could manually, visually, and cognitively divert their attention from the primary task of driving or walking. Distracted road users expose themselves and others to unsafe behavior than undistracted. Road safety education and awareness programs are vital to discourage the use of applications that stimulate unsafe driving/walking behaviors. Educating the traveling public about the dangers of unsafe driving/walking behavior could have significant safety benefits to all road users. Future research needs to compare accuracies of the applications and provide guidelines for selecting them for certain transportation related applications.}

To more realistically represent street-level heat stress, we propose a new urban climate-human coupling system by integrating an advanced urban canopy model (UCM) with a new human-environment adaptive thermal stress (HEATS) module. The coupled UCM-HEATS system features a state-of-the-art solution to complicated human-street radiative exchanges and incorporates dynamic human thermoregulatory responses to microclimatic changes. The UCM-HEATS system was evaluated in a typical hot and humid city, Hong Kong, and then applied to investigate street-level thermal stress in various urban settings and under different personal conditions. By explicitly resolving shading effects of buildings and trees on human radiation budgets, our study emphasizes the marked effectiveness of active shade management using green and gray infrastructure on daytime heat mitigation, proposing a “right shade, right place, right time” paradigm for regulating important street canyon geometries (building height, road width, and tree crown width) and orientations. Additionally, human evaporative heat dissipation can be hindered by urban moisture islands and wind impediments; thus, a detailed urban ventilation strategy is suggested considering different temperature-humidity combinations. For personal heat protection, we identified an evident cooling effect of high-albedo clothing and a thermal-comfort-optimal walking speed. Special attention is paid to heat-vulnerable groups, especially older people who suffer from notably higher heat risks during pandemics with facemask-induced heat burden. Bridging urban climate and human ergonomics, this study aims to advance human-centric urban design toward future smart, resilient, and inclusive cities.}

In this paper, we develop a straightforward method to identify group travel behavior (GTB), defined as two or more persons intentionally traveling together from a single origin to a single destination, with public transit smart card data based on proxemics theory. We apply our method to Beijing to reveal the patterns of GTB, using all records generated by the subway system during a one-week period in 2010. Our data and method do not allow a reliable estimate of GTB share in overall travel, but do enable a description of the characteristics and the spatiotemporal pattern of GTB. The results reveal that the group size and GTB frequency follow a long tail distribution: far more people travel in small groups than in large groups and far more group travelers can be observed carrying out only one group trip than travelers making multiple group trips. Group trips tend to occur in weekends, in afternoons, and during public holidays. Furthermore, stations and lines serving leisure destinations show the highest GTB scores. We conclude that the GTB pattern is distinctly different from the pattern of individual travel in terms of both time and space, and is essentially influenced by urban land uses surrounding subway stations.}

abstract = {‘Water town’, a city design idea featuring buildings sitting along rivers and their associated riparian vegetation, serves as natural refuges for citizens to escape the dual challenges of heatwaves and urban heat islands. We investigated the multi-scale cooling effect of river networks in Shanghai, a typical modern city widely known as an assemblage of water towns. At the neighborhood scale, we conducted a series of field experiments along various rivers with different characteristics during the 2022 heatwave periods in central Shanghai. At the city scale, we first quantified the cooling impact of urban river networks by integrating remotely sensed data and fine-resolution urban river network maps. We found that the width of rivers, coverage ratio, density, and morphology of river networks are the key factors affecting the cooling potential. The confluence or proximity of river tributaries can also bring an enhanced cooling effect than standalone ones. Rivers were found to be all-day cool spots compared to adjacent city streets, with greater daytime cooling intensity (1–3 °C) than at night (0–0.6 °C). Compared to vegetation which has more spatial coverage within the city, rivers are constrained by a linear shape along certain paths but possess the ability to flow, which is beneficial for cooling by carrying cool water from upstream parks and offering wind corridors. The atmospheric cooling capability of 20% of river coverage is equivalent to 30% of tree canopy coverage in a neighborhood. The city-scale cooling effect yields a 36.9% cooling area with a maximum cooling extent of 5.5 °C. The disparities in cooling effect between river networks and standalone rivers primarily manifest in confluence areas and the reinforced cooling within dense river networks. Each additional confluence in local river networks leads to a mean increase of 3% in cooling area and 0.01 °C cooling intensity. Our study implies that urban watercourses cannot be neglected in urban climatic studies and should be incorporated into a new conceptualization of water-included urban local climate zone classifications in the world urban database.}

abstract = {The balance between power generation and consumption is long debated. However, the practical steps towards generating renewable energy sources and utilizing the free energy are still in their nascency. These require smart and intelligent decisions such as tapping into free energy for addressing global energy needs. Based on Bedini's free energy generators’ design, the current study attempts to tap into free energy using the radiant energy space phenomenon. A modified 8-pole neodymium magnet based free energy generator is proposed powered through the internet of things (IoT), and a prototype is developed that captures the radiant energy through its intelligent decision making and utilizing the free energy. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the proposed prototype is calculated as 1.837 compared to Bedini's COP of 1.502, showing 30% greater efficiency than the original model. Besides, a cost savings of 35% can be materialized due to the reduced life cycle costs and maintenance requirements of the proposed model. If explored and implemented at a wider scale, the proposed prototype can address the global energy issues and help move towards smart cities and a smarter planet.}

abstract = {An accurate characterization and prediction of heat loads in buildings connected to a District Heating (DH) network is crucial for the effective operation of these systems. The high variability of the heat production process of DH networks with low supply temperatures and derived from the incorporation of different heat sources increases the need for heat demand prediction models. This paper presents a novel data-driven model for the characterization and prediction of heating demand in buildings connected to a DH network. This model is built on the so-called Q-algorithm and fed with real data from 42 smart energy meters located in 42 buildings connected to the DH in Tartu (Estonia). These meters deliver heat consumption data with a 1-h frequency. Heat load profiles are analysed, and a model based on supervised clustering methods in combination with multiple variable regression is proposed. The model makes use of four climatic variables, including outdoor ambient temperature, global solar radiation and wind speed and direction, combined with time factors and data from smart meters. The model is designed for deployment over large sets of the building stock, and thus aims to forecast heat load regardless of the construction characteristics or final use of the building. The low computational cost required by this algorithm enables its integration into machines with no special requirements due to the equations governing the model. The data-driven model is evaluated both statistically and from an engineering or energetic point of view. R2 values from 0.70 to 0.99 are obtained for daily data resolution and R2 values up to 0.95 for hourly data resolution. Hourly results are very promising for more than 90% of the buildings under study.}

In this study, Poly (N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL) was prepared by photopolymerisation and the lower critical solution temperature of the physically crosslinked PNVCL copolymers was tailored by controlling the contents of the material concentration and the electron beam irradiation dose, i.e. 0, 5, and 50 kGy. The lower critical solution temperature of the polymers was established by UV-spectroscopy. By altering the radiation dose, this allowed the key attributes of the PNVCL to be tailored in order to suit a number of applications, for example, smart glass technology.}

Tests were conducted to evaluate to what extent these smart materials, when embedded in multi-scale systems from construction components, to buildings, to a community, would enhance total urban energy performance. A conceptual framework of holarchies is proposed to articulate subsystems of an urban system. This framework explores the multiple-scale and cross-sectorial relationship of material properties and their building spatial configurations. An experimental test case uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) to construct databases from the various levels of the urban system from M (material), to P (products and building component) and B (building systems). It is then connected to N (neighborhood) by incorporating Urban Energy Building Modeling (UBEM). This connection considers contextual factors such microclimate and landscape features. After conducting the M-P-B-N multi-scale modeling experiment, emerging system properties will be derived and turned into design principles for informing future design decision-making.}

This massive urbanization has created unprecedented challenges for cities and city managers which has led many of them to look for technological solutions to address them, including the use of Big Data, which is among the most considered technological support to help improve the overall operational and service delivery of cities. It is estimated that around 7 billion connected objects will soon be implemented in cities worldwide which will produce an unprecedented and massive amount of real-time data that will have to be managed, used, and analyzed effectively. If this massive amount of data is effectively managed and used, it can provide important benefits and produce real positive impacts on the functioning of cities. Nonetheless, despite these benefits, only a few cities are able to use and exploit big data, and some studies have shown that less than 0.5% of all the available data has been explored. The objective of this study is to understand the factors that influence cities to use big data and the nature of such use. Based on a field survey involving 106 municipalities, this study investigates the antecedents of big data use by cities and shows how different sets of antecedents influence three different types of big data use by cities.}

Combined with the currently low renovation rate, the realization of the 2000 W society will be challenging. A fast and remote detection of optimal retrofitting targets may help to address this problem. In this contribution, a novel procedure to characterise a building and its heating systems from smart grid monitoring data is presented. The parameters of a simplified physical simulation model for the building and heating system are adjusted to match the simulated and the actual power consumption of the heat pump. The method is validated on three reference buildings with almost perfect reproduction of the heat consumption over the course of one year and good recovery of relevant building/heating system parameters. The application on five real-world buildings shows the possibility to reproduce the annual heat consumption within a maximal deviation of 5% in four out of five cases. These convincing results enable also the application of the developed procedure as a load prediction tool.}

Comparatively, less attention has been paid to the study of variability, which, however, has been argued as equally important as regularities, since variability identifies diversity. In a transport network, variability exists from person to person, from place to place, and from day to day. In this paper, we present a set of measuring of variability at individual and aggregated levels using multi-day smart-card data. Statistical analysis, correlation matrix and network-based clustering methods are applied and potential use of measured results for urban applications are also discussed. We take Singapore as a case study and use one-week smart-card data for analysis. An interesting finding is that though the number of trips and mobility patterns varies from day to day, the overall spatial structure of urban movement always remains the same throughout a week. This finding showed that a systemic framework with well-organized analytical methods is indeed, necessary for extracting variability that may change at different levels and consequently for uncovering different aspects of dynamics, namely transit, social and urban dynamics. We consider this paper as a tentative work toward such generic framework for measuring variability and it can be used as a reference for other research work in such a direction.}

Still, the complexity of technical requirements narrows the financial margins of the construction industry. Limited researchers have investigated PV manufacturing, planning and techniques for electricity generation. Additionally a new method of generating power via the use of a human population has been developed. A piezoelectric transducer is used to detect the vibration. When a footstep applies pressure to the piezoelectric transducer, the pressure or force is converted to electrical energy. This experimental research investigates the photovoltaic sensors and piezoelectric transducers incorporated floor tiles in a residential building for power generation. The performance of the sensors were analysed experimentally and analytically by using machine learning models such as ARIMA time series model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN). The prediction models were validated through assessment matrix such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). From the experiments, it was observed that voltage is high during the day when a load is applied, and a low amount is acquired at night when no load is applied. And from the analytical study, the ARIMA time series model has the highest prediction accuracy. Error analysis was done to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed models. The accuracy of the developed models can be further increased, which is subject to future research.}

They are expected to shift from a passive role as consumer of electricity to an active role as co-provider. In this article, the extent to which current technologies, products and services empower end-users to take up an active role as co-providers is evaluated. Based on a review of literature and related pilot projects, current approaches were found to be driven by technical and financial considerations. There appears to be a lack of product and service design that supports end-users in their role as co-providers in a smart grid. This is reflected in the lack of thought given to how the end-users’ process of behavioral change can be supported to enable the transition from consumer to co-provider. Several recommendations are provided for product and service designers towards fostering the role of co-provider, which comes under under: (a) user interaction needs, (b) approaches to behavioral change and (c) community initiatives and management of resources. Designers are considered to play a bridging role between policy making and engineering, while facilitating involvement of end-users in the design process.}

The smart controls shift ventilation rates in time, but ensure an annual occupant pollutant exposure equal to, or less than, what would be experienced in a home with a constant ventilation rate equal to the whole house target airflow in the ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2016. Annual simulations of previously developed prototype homes with validated ventilation models were conducted via co-simulation of EnergyPlus with CONTAM. Controller performance varied substantially by climate zone, airtightness and house prototype. Smart controls were generally ineffective in Climate Zone 1 (Arcata) due to its lack of a cooling season and low diurnal temperature swings. The most successful smart controls used parameters pre-calculated using an optimization routine. In order to better inform state energy policy, we also determined savings weighted by the amount of new home construction in each climate. The best controls averaged about one-third of ventilation-related energy savings that increased to about 48–55% when weighted. Annual average savings were about 650–700 kWh/year for the best controllers. The vast majority of site energy savings were for heating end-uses (>90% of total savings). Whole house ventilation rates increased between 0% and 42%, with typical increases in the 15–20% range. The best-performing control strategies shifted ventilation rates seasonally and modulated flows within each season. Peak concentrations during low ventilation times were kept below an exposure level of 3, well below the maximum of 5 required to avoid acute exposure issues.}

This new approach has made great contributions in the area of cyber–physical–social systems by employing various computational intelligence techniques like deep learning, for analyzing data, especially heterogeneous data from sensing and wireless communication. As a representative example of deep learning, deep residual networks have achieved excellent performance for big data feature learning since they can avoid gradient vanishing issues in deep learning models effectively. Unfortunately, they could not learn features for heterogeneous data, especially multi-modal data, in smart IoT. This paper proposes a deep residual computation model by generalizing the deep residual network in the tensor space. Especially, each multi-modal data object is represented as a tensor, while all hidden layers are also represented as tensors. Furthermore, we propose a tensor back-propagation algorithm to train the parameters of the deep residual computation model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the presented deep residual model by comparing with the existing models such as multi-modal deep learning models, 3D deep residual models, deep computation models, and deep convolutional computation models. Results show that the proposed model produces more accurate classification results than other models for heterogeneous data feature learning in cyber–physical–social systems.}

These challenges are associated with adaption of emerging technologies, socio-economic issues, lack of policies and awareness. Since Government of India (GoI) has initiated nationwide deployment of SG projects, the objective of this paper is to identify challenges and issues in SG implementation. In such situation, it is primarily essential to identify and discuss the barriers to overcome deployment concerns, including consumer's acceptance. In this paper, such major challenges and issues for SG implementation have been encapsulated. Considering the vision and roadmap of the Indian SG, an indicative assessment framework has been developed and details are discussed here. A case study of solar PV awareness survey has also been presented to understand consumers’ interest and concerns toward components of SG.}

Mobiquitous services in a smart environment rely on the capability of smart objects to sense, compute, communicate and take some adaptive actions according to their goals in situated contexts, even without the human intervention. These complexity oriented issues make the human interaction with mobiquitous services more crucial and more challenging as compared with the classical human–computer interaction. In this paper, we propose a general framework as a conceptual tool for modeling such an interaction, once specific technologies are selected and employed. We view a single interaction occurring in a smart environment as a sequence of actions that involve users, mobiquitous services, interaction resources, environmental context items, and information exchanges between the user and the mobiquitous service. We specify these concepts and we discuss their inter-relationships. The rationale is to provide a conceptual aide for designing, analyzing and operationalizing human interaction with mobiquitous services and applications in smart environments.}

abstract = {The aim of route optimization system (ROS) is to design a set of vehicle routes to fulfill transportation demands, in an attempt to minimize cost and/or other negative social and environmental impacts. ROS, established based on the fruitful studies of vehicle routing problem (VRP), has been applied in various industries and forms. During daily operations, dynamic traffic conditions, varying restriction policies, road constructions, drivers’ progressing familiarity with the routes and destinations are all common factors affecting the performance of ROS. However, most current systems are designed in a one-way and open-loop manner, i.e. these systems do not track how the planned vehicle routes are performed, which hinders the continuous improvement of the system and would lead to the failure of the system. This study proposes a smart product-service system (SPSS) approach to design an IoT-based ROS, arguing that the product (i.e. the ROS) and services (updating base data and learning users’ behaviors automatically to optimize the system) should be designed as a bundle. For this end, IoT devices are employed to acquire real-time information and feedbacks of vehicles and drivers, which are used to assess the execution of planned routes and dynamically modify the base data. Moreover, the driving records from IoT devices reveal drivers’ improving familiarity with routes and destinations, which will be considered to optimize the assignment of routes to drivers. Finally, we use a case of retailing industry to show the advantages of the proposed SPSS approach.}

PPWMs reduced the need for direct contact between utility staff and customers, resulting in less susceptibility to COVID-19 than conventional meters. The PPWMs fostered water distribution equity by promoting conservation. While these meters boost the revenue of water utilities, increasing user satisfaction by optimizing water distribution is essential, ensuring suitable PPWM installation rates and sustainability. Concerns linger about consistent customer resistance to PPWMs, support for low-income households, and the provision of maintenance services post-warranty.}

Incorporating cloud servers and edge devices to such IoT based system through a three tier architecture can provide correct prediction performances and even real time monitoring with less Internet traffic. Vertical farming is another important direction where such monitoring systems can be highly beneficial.

Earlier empirical investigations have tested aspects affecting consumer purchase intentions concerning remanufactured products, yet they largely ignored risks hindering consumers from opting for them. In order to fill the given theoretical gap, the study tests both inhibiting and igniting factors affecting consumer's remanufacturing products purchase behavior through the use of Stimulus Organism Response (SOR) theory. SOR assists in better understanding consumers' digital purchase behavior toward remanufactured products. Moreover, the study extends the knowledge by examining the impact of Perceived Environmental Benefits, Seller's Reputation, Price Sensitivity, and Social Influence on Consumer's Purchase behavior for remanufactured products. It also investigates the mediating role of the Perceived Risk of Remanufactured Products, followed by the moderating role of Consumers Trust. A useable sample data of 361 was collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results indicated the inverse relationship between increased price sensitivity and purchase behavior concerning remanufactured products, and all other stated variables reflected a significant association with consumer purchase behavior. Likewise, both mediating and moderating roles were found to be significant. Along with theoretical contributions, the study contains numerous practical directions for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers to increase consumers' purchase behavior toward remanufactured products.}

For that, this unprecedented smart grid data require an effective platform that takes the smart grid a step forward in the big data era. This paper presents a framework that can be a start for innovative research and take smart grids a step forward. An implementation of the framework on a secure cloud-based platform is presented. Furthermore, the framework has been applied on two scenarios to visualize the energy, for a single-house and a smart grid that contains over 6000 smart meters. The application of the two scenarios to visualize the grid status and enable dynamic demand response, suggests that the framework is feasible in performing further smart grid data analytics.}

Due to the complexity of the energy oriented systems and their critical importance, energy management is one of the most challenging concerns in these metropolitan centres and the promise of a political response; sustainable development is a promise of Social governance, coordinating that response.

Trajectory data is large-scale, high-dimensional, and sparse in nature and, thus, requires an efficient privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) algorithm with high data utility. This paper describes the investigation of the publication of non-interactive sanitized trajectory data under a Differential Privacy (DP) definition. To this end, a new prefix tree structure, an incremental privacy budget allocation model, and a spatial-temporal dimensionality reduction model are proposed to enhance the sanitized data utility as well as to improve runtime efficiency. The developed algorithm is implemented and applied to real-life metro smart card data from Shenzhen, China, which includes a total of 2.8 million individual travelers and over 220 million records. Numerical analysis finds that, compared with previous work, the proposed model outputs sanitized dataset with higher utilities, and the algorithm is more efficient and scalable.}

abstract = {Optimizing the power demand for smart home appliances in a smart grid is the primary challenge faced by power supplier companies, particularly during peak periods, due to its considerable effect on the stability of a power system. Therefore, power supplier companies have introduced dynamic pricing schemes that provide different prices for a time horizon in which electricity prices are higher during peak periods due to the high power demand and lower during off-peak periods. The problem of scheduling smart home appliances at appropriate periods in a predefined time horizon in accordance with a dynamic pricing scheme is called power scheduling problem in a smart home (PSPSH). The primary objectives in addressing PSPSH are to reduce the electricity bill of users and maintain the stability of a power system by reducing the ratio of the highest power demand to the average power demand, known as the peak-to-average ratio, and to improve user comfort level by reducing the waiting time for appliances. In this paper, we review the most pertinent studies on optimization methods that address PSPSH. The reviewed studies are classified into exact algorithms and metaheuristic algorithms. The latter is categorized into single-based, population-based, and hybrid metaheuristic algorithms. Accordingly, a critical analysis of state-of-the-art methods are provided and possible future directions are also discussed.}

abstract = {Smart toys have become popular as technological solutions offer a better experience for children. However, the technology employed greatly increases the risks to children’s privacy, which does not seem to have become a real concern for toy makers. We investigated this issue through a study driven by two major research questions: which are the major smart toys-related children’s privacy risks and which are the major mitigation so to such risks. To answer these questions, we conducted a scoping review. As a result, we selected 26 primary studies and elaborated two classifications of risks and proposed solutions – technical and domain-specific. The most mentioned technical risk is data disclosure, while from a domain-specific perspective there is much concern on the children’s physical and psychological safety. From a mitigation standpoint, many recommendations and solutions have been proposed, but without a more common type of contribution. As a main conclusion, we observed that toy makers and privacy regulations are not yet ready regarding children’s privacy for a more active smart toys market.}

This paper selects 116 Chinese resource-based cities to construct an evaluation system for urban green land use and measure its efficiency. Secondly, it identifies driving factors affecting urban green land use efficiency (UGLUE) and comprehensively analyze the heterogeneity of these factors. The important findings of this paper include: (1) The UGLUE of resource-based cities in China has experienced a trend of first fluctuating and then improving. However, there are obvious regional differences. The UGLUE in the eastern and western regions are higher than those in the central and northeastern regions. (2) Industrial upgrading, financial development and technological innovation are key factors affecting UGLUE in resource-based cities. (3) There is significant heterogeneity in the impact of different factors in different city types, different regions and different time periods. The land use in resource-based cities should transform from blind expansion in pursuit of short-term economic benefits to a green development that pursues the coordination of economic, social, and ecological benefits based on the local conditions.}

To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-to-end example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented.}

To attain high efficiency, the Information and communication technology (ICT) is used for execution, data monitoring and control, dependability, economics, and sustainability. In this regard, the SMI plays a critical role in the SG’s control, monitoring, and management of different domains. Despite SMI’s key benefits, security and privacy concerns have arisen due to the high openness of SG existence over traditional grid. It is expected that a significant number of heterogeneous devices will be coordinated across public communication networks. On the other hand, SGs are more vulnerable to security assaults than traditional grids due to their Internet and wireless networks. Thus, this chapter shows a quick review of real cyber-attack occurrences affecting traditional energy networks and smart metering networks. This chapter proposes a threat taxonomy that takes into account: (1) system-level security concerns; (2) service threats and theft; and (3) privacy threats for a set of guidelines over security and privacy for the SG metering network. Moreover, this chapter discusses various strategies utilized to handle these threats, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks.}

This paper evaluates the performance of a PV system in five different cities of Iran with diverse climatic conditions in order to investigate the effect of weather and climatic conditions on the efficiency and performance of PV panels. Numerous studies on this topic have been conducted in order to find the greatest and most cost-effective geographic location for employing PV systems in various industries. Using a mathematical model, the effect of temperature and radiation on PV system performance has been investigated. Then, by defining various performance indicators, using the SMART method, the studied cities are ranked in a multi-criteria decision-making process. Finally, in order to evaluate the model, its outputs have been validated using System Advisor Model software. According to the research outputs, the city of Yazd has provided the best performance, followed by Isfahan, Bandar Abbas, Tabriz and Tehran. The data show that the amount of energy produced per year and average annual calculated efficiency in the city of Yazd, as the best city, is equal to 8,184.59 (kWh) and 18.24%, respectively. This led to a capacity factor of 23.57 and performance ratio of 0.887 for this city.}

Whereas previous studies mostly use large EV fleets in their models, our focus is on a smaller scale. We apply the model to a microgrid in Lombok, a residential neighbourhood in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The microgrid consists of a 31kWp PV installation, an office, internet servers, three households, and two EVs. Three control algorithms are presented which manage the charging profile of multiple EVs either in real-time or using linear optimisation with predictions for PV power and electricity demand. We perform one-year simulations using data for PV power, EV use, and electricity demand. Simulations results are evaluated on PV self-consumption and peak demand reduction. In addition, we make qualitative statements on battery degradation resulting from the charging strategies based on several indicators. We also simulate changes in microgrid composition, for example by including more EVs. In the simulations, self-consumption increases from 49% to 62–87% and demand peaks decrease by 27–67%. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of smart charging EVs with PV power. Furthermore, our results give insight into the effect of different charging strategies and microgrid compositions.}

In this paper, smart residential loads are firstly classified into different categories according to various demand response programs. Secondly, a complete scheduling scheme is modeled based on the dispatch of residential loads and distributed generation. The presented model reduces the cost of user’s electricity consumption and decreases the peak load and peak-valley difference of residential load profile without bringing discomfort to the users, through which residential community can participate in demand response efficiently.

Unfortunately, gas quality is expected to affect metrological performance of thermal mass flow-meters (TMFs), as far as flow disturbances and such conditions often occur in modern networks. In this paper the authors investigate the sensitivity of TMFs with natural gas quality changes and different flow disturbances. To this end, a metrological test campaign has been carried out through specifically designed laboratory test bench and facilities. The results of the tests with gas quality changes show the capillary TMFs are able to recognize the natural gas flowing strictly included in the EN 437 group H and to consequently apply specific correction factors. On the other hand, capillary TMFs have been found sensitive to high contents of CO2 and N2, like in biogas and natural gases at the borders of group H. Finally, flow disturbances tests show the accuracy of full bore insertion in line TMFs is affected by the interaction between sensor and piping both for double out-of plane bend and single 90° bend disturbances.}

Indeed, buildings are, on one side, the biggest consumers of energy in the electrical grid and could be among the greatest producers of renewable energy, especially thanks to the concept of energy positive buildings, and this by offering at the same time high flexibility in energy demand. That is why the paper focuses on methodologies using physical models and optimization for smart design and smart supervision for valorizing those buildings energy properties and contribute thus to the emergence of the concept of smart buildings (SBs) integrated in smart grids (SGs): we will give an overview of the mathematical optimization method used and of the kind of physical models we have developed over 10 years of active research in order to propose by this way a smart software dedicated to those SBs integrated in SGs. We explain also our global research strategy for improving this smart software, by a so-called “human-in-the-loop” approach, in which we consider that they there will be no “smart building” without “smart users”. This means a complex multi-disciplinary research that we develop in a “living lab”, in which the inhabitants are involved as “pro'sumers”, i.e. as active and implicated designers and users.
Résumé
L'enjeu du XXIe siècle est de faire décroître la consommation des énergies fossiles au profit des énergies renouvelables sous la pression climatique. Ce papier montre que les bâtiments intelligents (smart buildings), intégrés dans des réseaux intelligents (smart grids), peuvent significativement contribuer à cet objectif. En effet, les bâtiments sont, d'une part, les plus grands consommateurs d'énergie dans le réseau électrique et pourraient devenir l'un des plus grands producteurs d'énergie renouvelable, en particulier grâce au concept de bâtiment à énergie positive, et ceci en offrant dans le même temps un important gisement de « flexibilité » en demande énergétique. C'est pourquoi cet article se focalise sur des méthodologies utilisant des modèles physiques et l'optimisation pour une conception et une supervision « intelligentes », afin de valoriser les propriétés énergétiques de ces bâtiments et contribuer ainsi au concept de smart building intégré dans des smart grids : nous donnerons un aperçu des méthodes mathématiques d'optimisation utilisées et des types de modèles physiques que nous avons développés au cours d'une recherche qui s'est déroulée sur plus de dix ans, de manière à proposer ainsi des approches logicielles dédiées à ces smart buildings intégrés à des smart grids. Nous détaillerons aussi notre stratégie globale de recherche pour améliorer ce type de logiciel « intelligent », par une approche dite « humain dans la boucle » (human in the loop), dans laquelle nous considérons qu'il n'y aura pas de « bâtiments intelligents » sans « utilisateurs intelligents ». Ceci implique une recherche interdisciplinaire complexe, que nous développons dans un living lab dans lequel les usagers sont impliqués comme consom'acteurs (pro'sumers), c'est-à-dire comme concepteurs et usagers actifs.}

Recent advances in digitalization and sophisticated data analytics offers new innovative ways in delivering rehabilitation services to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. Currently, the development of data-driven solutions for rehabilitation in Malaysia is limited due to multiple factors: medical and rehabilitation data is not digitally stored; the knowledge for the interpretation of clinical data is distributed; in particular, there is a lack of expertise in the field of medical data science. Thus, a data science platform is proposed so that medical expertise can be made available through digital services and is not dependent on human resource, location, time or financial ability. This platform is applied for the smart diagnosis of upper limb spasticity in compliance with clinical practice, and extensible for the other smart rehabilitation applications. By collaborating with the prestigious Fraunhofer Society, their knowhow in industrial data science can be brought to Malaysia towards improved health care in the country. The smart diagnosis system provides advice in classifying the severity level of upper limb spasticity based on the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Modified Tardieu scale. The basis is a measurement system for muscle signal, muscle tone and elbow motion. Users of the smart diagnosis application include rehabilitation physicians, doctors from other specialities, nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. The tools provided by the data science platform is deployed to store and analyze the clinical data. Further, the expertise of a rehabilitation physician is emulated in the form of an expert system to determine the severity level of upper limb spasticity. The digital clinical database helps medical researchers in secondary analysis towards knowledge discovery for the betterment of intervention and treatment of spasticity.}

Smart-Pockets works by recognizing users' body-deictic gestures entailing access to their pockets, for which associations between specific pockets and personal digital content anchored to those pockets has been managed a priori. The “pocket metaphor” that we explore in this work enables links to digital content using physical personal containers (i.e., pockets) placed at convenient locations on the user's body, containers that have been specifically devised over decades of fashion design to store and carry people's personal belongings comfortably and conveniently. Consequently, Smart-Pockets gestures are fast, require absolutely no precision to perform effectively, and are robustly recognized in user-independent scenarios with absolutely no training required from the user of the ambient display. Also, the Smart-Pockets technique is flexible and easily extensible to other physical containers, such as bags and hand-held objects, which we demonstrate in the form of Smart-Containers. We evaluate the accuracy of several techniques for recognizing Smart-Pockets access gestures, for which we report +99% accuracy for user-independent classification and explicit segmentation. We discuss users' kinematic performance with Smart-Pockets and Smart-Containers and show that the average pocket access time of 2.2s is comparable to the average production time of touch gestures on smart mobile devices and is much smaller than the time required to produce other whole-body gestures. Beyond their practical implications for advancing knowledge in gesture-based interface design for ambient interactions, we believe that the contributions introduced by the Smart-Pockets concept will also foster new developments by pointing the community attention toward (i) more examination of the potential of a new class of whole-body gestures, i.e., body-deictics, (ii) more attention toward how users access their personal digital content on public displays, an important preliminary step before actual interaction, and (iii) inspiring work in the community to examine new and creative associations between users' physical personal objects and their digital content visualized on ambient displays.}
