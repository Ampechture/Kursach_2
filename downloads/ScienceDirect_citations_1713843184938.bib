abstract = {The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation within the European Union intensifies regulatory requirements in terms of data protection for Smart City services. In particular, the mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process constitutes a complex managerial challenge. To reduce the complexity, this study develops a typology of Flemish Smart City services based on DPIA costs. Our explorative case study, based on face-to-face interviews and a workshop, shows that DPIA costs vary along the complexities of i) the urban environment in which a Smart City service is provided, and ii) the Smart City service itself. The research further demonstrates that these complexities represent multilayered concepts. The complexity of the urban environment consists of three layers: i) city size, ii) diversity of urban stakeholders, and iii) total of Smart City services in the urban region. Similarly, the complexity of the Smart City service is composed of five layers: i) number of different data streams, ii) clarity of data ownership, iii) amount of use-cases, iv) privacy invasiveness, and v) visibility of the Smart City service. While most layers of the respective complexities unequivocally matter in the eyes of the experts, others are more contested, such as the size of the city and the visibility of the Smart City service. This cost-based framework is of value to city administrations and Smart City service providers as it allows them to make the DPIA process more efficient by shortening the learning curve and improving decision making by clustering services based on data protection needs. In particular, stakeholders that have little expertise in-house, and that are looking for an easy-to-understand, rational framework can benefit from these results. Furthermore, based on both the literature review and the obtained results, our systematic data protection impact-cost-approach is generalizable beyond the EU-borders.}

abstract = {Substantial population growth, increasing urbanization, overloaded infrastructure, more energy consumption, environmental impacts, and investment in technological developments are major challenges in city management and development. Municipalities seek to improve their citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but the need to find a balance between these complex factors makes decision-making processes more difficult. Experts must analyze the determinants of smart cities, which are urban centers intended to be socially involved, habitable, and economically and environmentally sustainable, and that rely strongly on technology and innovation. Based on multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) principles, this study combines cognitive mapping techniques and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to develop a multicriteria model that can help managers analyze smart city determinants in a collaborative manner. The research included identifying these determinants and their respective cause-and-effect relationships using an expert panel’s experience and knowledge related to the subject under analysis. The results were validated by both the panel and the city councilor responsible for mobility and municipal projects within Évora City Council, Portugal, which has implemented smart city strategies. The latter specialist verified that the proposed evaluation system can be used as a tool to facilitate smart city collaborative decision-making processes. The study’s main advantages and limitations are also analyzed and discussed.}

Most of the surveillance data recorded by the IoT devices is in the form of video and needs to be transmitted to the admin or server by video streaming technology. Fractal video compression uses a self-similarity concept for video compression, meaning the fractal image contains self-similarity of itself that is explained and denoted by change. Computational cost is more in fractal video coding; different methods have been developed to reduce this computational cost. The proposed work's main objective is to implement a video streaming approach by combining the Diamond-search-pattern- block-matching motion estimation algorithm and hash-based fractal video compression algorithm to reduce the encoding time. It improves both the delay and security of the block matching system and the developed approach measures based on evaluation parameters: Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), encoding time, decoding time, Mean squared error (MSE), and Compression ratio for Smart City Applications. Compared to other algorithms, the IoTs video data is streamed efficiently in a smart city to analyse the abnormalities.}

To date, few studies have been conducted on the effects of service quality on citizen engagement in smart cities in a public emergency. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model and uncertain management theory, this study analyses the impact of the service quality of smart city system on citizen engagement in a public emergency. Data were collected in Chinese smart cities. Three valuable and novel results are identified. First, high-quality information content, highly reliable systems and highly responsive systems have a significant positive effect on citizens' continuous experiences, but not on citizens' immediate experiences. Second, both the immediate and continuous experiences of citizens have a significant positive effect on citizen engagement. Third, continuous experiences impose a full mediation effect between information content and citizen engagement, between reliability and citizen engagement and between responsiveness and citizen engagement. As its main contribution, this study focuses on the construction of a theoretical model. Based on this model, smart city managers can understand citizens' reactions in public emergencies from stimulation to experience and their behaviours in relation to smart city services.}

The theory is tested using the Akaike Information Criterion Stepwise OLS regression model with data from 329 cities in the United States and 13 smart city technologies. The study finds that adoption of smart city technologies is indeed contingent with managerial incentives, constraints and context. Funding from state governments, availability of technical assistance and city branding have positive and statistically significant effects on smart technology adoption. Conversely, lack of leadership, legacy systems and lack of understanding of technology have negative and statistically significant effects. Demography, geography and form of government are also associated with technology adoption. Managerial contingency theory opens a new field of research on smart cities.}

abstract = {Innovative cities that use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) while guaranteeing that they meet current generations’ needs for life quality, operating efficiency, and competitive nature are known as Smart Sustainable Cities (SSCs). Green spaces and eco-friendly practices are integrated into the urban area to reduce pollution levels and CO2 emissions and protect the natural resources within the city. Apps for smart cities are designed to control traffic and respond to emergencies in real-time. Therefore, smart cities may be better equipped to react to challenges than those with a straightforward transaction processing relationship with their residents. Existing high-speed internet and underground wiring in major metro areas are both in need of replacement due to deterioration from decades of use. Although the availability of wireless broadband service is expanding, some parts of the country’s largest cities are still without it. In order to maintain cities in a sustainable fashion, there are several obstacles that must be faced. Congestion, a lack of funding for essential services, a lack of suitable accommodation, deteriorating infrastructure, and increasing air pollution are all common problems in cities. The major challenges such as the best use of urban buildings’ energy generation, storage, consumption, fossil fuel use, disregard for the environment, and limited internet technology (IT) architecture are all contributing factors in the city’s decline addressed in this research. Therefore, this paper proposes the social collaboration of renewable energy resources (SC-RER) technique to overcome the basic challenges described above. With the help of the proposed technique, local renewable energy sources can be used to their full potential. Smart block innovation (SBI) is used to make smart community planning mode. Energy-Efficiency (EE) model is framed to reduce the energy consumed significantly. As a result, it helps increase the method’s efficiency to gain a 95.4% maximum level, suitable for making sustainable smart cities.}

Taking 153 cities from China as the research sample, we evaluated the impact of smart city policy (SCP) on urban ecological total factor energy efficiency (ETFEE) using the generalized synthetic control method. The main results are as follows. (1) SCP significantly improves urban ETFEE after controlling the endogeneity and unobserved time-varying confounders, and this conclusion is strongly supported by multiple robustness tests. (2) There is a two-stage mediating mechanism through which SCP functions. Specifically, SCP promotes innovation by enhancing intelligence (including informatization, human capital, and technology), thereby improving urban ETFEE. (3) Public participation and market conditions play moderating effects, and they improve the contribution of SCP on urban ETFEE. (4) For heterogeneity, SCP plays a significant role in eastern cities, large-size cities, non-resource-based cities, and non-old industrial base cities, whereas it has little impact on other cities’ ETFEE. This study provides empirical evidence and policy insights for constructing smart cities in China and even other emerging economies.}

It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others. The 6G communication network takes care of latency and reliability issues in the smart city with their unique characteristics such as latency (10–100 μs) and reliability (99.99999%). Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review for blockchain technology and IoT together functional to smart cities. First, state-of-art-the works and contextual information are introduced. Then, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized architecture for IoT-integrated smart cities covering different application perspectives, such as smart grid, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and healthcare 5.0 underlying 6G communication networks. Next, we describe the challenges of the proposed architecture respective to each application, as mentioned above. Finally, we collated the open research issues and future direction to efficiently integrate blockchain into IoT-envisioned smart cities.}

The framework translates abstract ethical requirements into a set of systematically derived governance mechanisms which are at the same time anchored in the concept of democratic accountability. This guiding principle does not demand that citizens necessarily become active themselves to realize citizen-centric data governance for socially sustainable smart city development. Rather, it demands that data governance comprises a suitable set of accountability measures that put the purposes of any data use center-stage.}

This paper introduces a novel model to assess cities for their smartness. A smart city is characterized by assessing 8 main domains including economy, environment, society, governance, energy, infrastructure, transportation, and pandemic resiliency. Each domain is evaluated by assessing several key parameters that reflect the condition of that domain in any given city. All indicators are measurable and can be assessed, which gives this approach more credibility and accuracy. This model has been applied on 20 cities worldwide. Enhancing the smart energy index by 25 % results in doubling the smart economy index for all cities. Furthermore, enhancing the GDP per capita by 50 % results in modest increase in the smart economy index. Smart governance has a positive and linear relationship with smart economy with a p value of 0.004. Montreal has the highest Smart City Index of 0.8 while Abuja has the lowest of 0.3. Socioeconomic and energy domains are critical domains that must be improved to achieve higher Smart City Index scores and therefore resilient and smart cities.}

Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, no research investigations have yet investigated exploiting the computational capabilities of CAVs to become an added value to the computational power of smart cities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Computational Resource (VaCR) and develop a system that enables vehicles to share their computational resources within smart cities. Users rely on Service Provider (SP) to acquire the required services that meet their Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences. The device capabilities of VaCR are one of the main indicators in QoE preferences. To that end, evaluation models are developed based on aggregate statistics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the discovery and selection of the appropriate VaCRs to participate in the provisioning of services. The deployment is modeled using a multiagent system. Then, game theory is used to model the recruitment that aims at optimizing QoE for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Thorough simulations, analyses, and evaluations of the proposed VaCR system are carried out. The performed validations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing QoE and the successful VaCR system operation, while attaining appealing performance characteristics.}

In particular, smart cities have the potential to limit participation opportunities for information-disadvantaged groups in decision-making by their optimized use of ICT in infrastructure and service delivery. Until now, studies on citizen participation in smart cities have mainly focused on the participation characteristics of general citizens. Thus, this study categorizes the key considerations for encouraging the participation of information-disadvantaged groups in smart cities and analyzes the difference in the relative importance between types using a series of Delphi surveys to collect the opinions of smart city experts in South Korea. The findings show that service accessibility is significantly important in encouraging participation, while the calculation of appropriate service cost and developing a support plan for service delivery are paramount in improving service accessibility. Furthermore, financial support for reducing the digital divide and citizens’ understanding of the purpose of participation for increasing participative receptivity are found to be statistically significant.}

In this regard, this study follows two primary purposes. First, we investigate the concept of “smart city” and its pillars. Second, we develop a smartness assessment framework by considering both subjective and objective criteria and employing six effective multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methods. A linear assignment model is formulated to find an aggregated ranking vector using the ranking vectors obtained from these MADM methods. Then, as a case study, five out of the most important cities in Iran are compared and evaluated by adopting the proposed framework. Furthermore, different scenarios are introduced to investigate the sensitivity of results to the distribution of the importance weights amongst criteria. The results demonstrate the significance of the governmental, economic, and environmental indicators in evaluating the smartness of cities. Moreover, Tehran, the capital city of Iran, obtains the best ranking in all the methods and weighting scenarios, while Tabriz has the worst ranking among the cities under study.}

Microgrids, featuring dispersed power sources, exhibit superior resilience, efficiency, and stability in contrast to conventional power grids. Noteworthy investments in eco-friendly initiatives have been made by various major corporations, particularly in institutional structures. The current research advocates for the integration of photovoltaics, energy storage, and electric vehicles (EVs) as pivotal elements in a smart grid. This study introduces an optimal energy management system (EMS) designed to efficiently allocate power from existing sources. To address the challenges within an uncertain and reliable environment, a stochastic framework leveraging the whale optimization algorithm and unscented transform has been formulated. All simulations have been executed using the digital twin of the smart grid components. Results suggest that the proposed EMS ensures uninterrupted power supply, contributing to a substantial 45% reduction in energy costs. Furthermore, the potential of EVs as storage devices is explored. When employed as energy sources, EVs led to a noteworthy 45.58% reduction in power prices, while their use as loads still yielded a significant 19.33% decrease. The study also delves into the analysis of outage effects on the continuous power supply cost.}

Although many preparations are made against natural disasters in urban life, it is evident that adequate measures are not taken against secondary disasters. One of the most destructive and frequent secondary disasters is fires after earthquakes. In this study, an early fire detection system is proposed in order to minimize the losses caused by fires in the potentially chaotic environment that may occur after earthquakes in cities. This system consists of a structure that detects fire with convolutional neural network (CNN) based You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, determines the geolocation of the fire with stereo vision/epipolar geometry and provides information to the disaster management center via wireless sensor network (WSN). Experimental test findings conducted in İstanbul verify that the proposed system would be useful for post-earthquake fire detection with low cost, high reliability and high accuracy.}

This paper examines the influence of smart city construction on urban green total factor productivity (GTFP), explores the influence mechanism and further investigates the heterogeneous influence among the factors of urban scale, human capital and financial development, by conducting a quasi-natural experiment based on the first batch of pilot smart city in China and using panel data of 174 prefecture level cities over the period of 2005−2016. Our findings show that: (1) Smart city construction pilot significantly improves GTFP and green technological progress (GTP) in China, but its influence on GTE is not significant, which means smart city construction promotes GTFP mainly through promoting GTP. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. (2) The estimation result of mediating effect models is that smart city construction promoted GTFP and GTP mainly through boosting urban technological innovation. The influence path of “smart city construction→technological innovation→GTFP” is verified. (3) Regarding city heterogeneity, cities with larger scale, richer human capital and higher level financial development have stronger positive effects on GTFP and GTP. These conclusions are of vital significance to improve the urban ecological environment and promote the high-quality development of urban economy.}

abstract = {To address various urban issues such as fine dust, traffic congestion, and water shortage caused by rapid urbanization, a national pilot Smart City is planned in two Korean cities, Sejong and Busan. As weather data is crucial for improving the environment and operating future transportation while constructing a smart city, preparing for future weather disasters by analyzing the characteristics of various meteorological phenomena in the planned development area is necessary. This study analyzed the fog generation characteristics for the period of 2016–2020 at the automatic weather system sites of the Korea Meteorological Administration in Sejong and Busan, and the characteristics of the meteorological elements during fog were investigated. Additionally, three machine learning based models, including Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Network DNN-1 and DNN-2, were constructed for estimating visibility using meteorological input variables. In Sejong, approximately 50 fog days were observed annually for the analysis period, with the highest frequency of these days being during autumn. The fog hours were distributed from nighttime to before sunrise and 94.3% of the fog occurred when the wind speed was less than 1.5 m/s, showing the characteristics of radiative fog. Most of the fog occurred during summer in Busan, and the maximum number of fog days was observed in July. The average wind speed during fog was approximately 2.5 m/s, which was relatively large, suggesting that advection fog was likely to occur. As a result of estimating visibility from the ML-based models, the RF model had the highest R2 (0.66 and 0.53) in both regions, but the visibility estimated from the RF model had an over- and under-estimation for short and long visibility ranges, respectively. DNN-1 and DNN-2 models have lower biases. In the detection of fog-possible weather based on the estimated visibility from the models, the best precisions (0.85 and 0.84) and F1-scores (0.76 and 0.74) were from the RF model, but model recall was better in the DNN-1 model. The model recalls for the detection of the thick and dense fog were also better in the DNN models. ML-based models presented reasonable performance but revealed their weaknesses and strengths depending on performance indicators.}

The urban population has been severely affected by this viral pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns, resulting in increased poverty and inequality, slowed economic growth, and a general decline in quality of life. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the effects of the pandemic by combining agent-based simulations—based on Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model—with a hybrid neural network. A baseline agent-based model (ABM) incorporating various epidemiological parameters of a viral pandemic was developed, followed by an additional functional layer that integrates factors like agent mobility restrictions and isolation. It is inferred from the results that low population densities of agents and high restrictions on agent mobility could inhibit the rapid spread of the pandemic. This framework also envisages a hybrid neural network that combines the layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for predicting the spatiotemporal probability of infection spread using real-world pandemic data for future pandemics. This framework could aid designers, regulators, urban planners, and policymakers develop resilient, healthy, and sustainable urban spaces in post-COVID smart cities.}

In the second phase, the DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique is used to examine smart city focusing on the dimensions derived from the literature in the form of six main and 33 sub-dimensions. Data is collected by contacting ten academia experts through a questionnaire specifically designed; open-ended questions and DEMATEL technique assessments. Results indicated that both phases had different outputs. While technology was highlighted and possible managerial issues emerged in the qualitative section, on the contrary, in the quantitative section, ‘smart people’ has emerged as the most important predictor of the smart city while ‘smart governance’ was the least.

Management of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure for such dynamic environment at scale brings about new challenges. Existing fog layer resource management involves context-sharing and migration for real-time vertical and cross-vertical services. However, improper context migration might affect performance negatively. In this paper, the authors have envisioned improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of smart transportation while employing context-aware computing and Artificial Intelligence, which helps alleviate massive data transfers among Fog nodes and intelligent vehicles in real-time. The proposed Context-Aware Intelligent Transportation System (CAITS) manages the services of intelligent vehicles and manages the road traffic of traditional vehicles in an effective manner, with a three-layered learning model that accounts for on-vehicle, on-co-vehicle, and on-fog-and-vehicle learning by means of a platoon control algorithm as well as federated learning at the Fog level. Simulations are carried out on CloudSim simulator under different scenarios and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves prediction efficacy of contexts at the Fog layer by approximately 8%–24% than existing models which in turn reflects in reduced service time and energy consumption of EVs and reduces the CO2 of environment.}

abstract = {This study investigates the factors that drive an innovation network formation comprising companies, government, and society, and the ways these actors contribute and collaborate within a network to develop technologies that have a social impact. A conceptual framework has been developed by combining literature-based arguments and insights from two cases of smart city innovation. This study demonstrates that the innovation network is driven by the activities of searching, acting, and convincing actors of an opportunity to develop smart city solutions. The findings also show that innovation networks emerge not solely from a business goal, but also from a social goal and can still generate business opportunities for companies. Therefore, innovation for smart cities specifically requires a new form of configuration (public–private and citizens’ participation), drivers (economic and social), and resources (technological and non-technological) in both its development and implementation. The analysis of the different configurations suggests more/less effective innovation.}

abstract = {To address the aftermath of ever more frequent natural disasters striking highly-populated urban areas, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations increasingly involve the coordinated efforts of multiple agencies and in particular Civil–Military Cooperation (CIMIC). In such scenarios, rescuers operate in a disrupted environment, must maintain a high operational tempo, and need to quickly make high-impact decisions. Effectively supporting emergency responders through IT services that implement accurate situation awareness presents a formidable set of challenges, including the discovery and integration of surviving IT assets with purposely deployed ones; effective information prioritization; resilient communications; and secure information sharing. We believe that in the highly digital modern urban environment, often referred to as smart cities, these challenges can be effectively addressed only by integrating by design HADR support into the smart city middleware. This paper presents Aceso — a proof-of-concept smart city middleware that provides location- and context-sensitive services with full support for HADR operations. Aceso provides a set of functions, ranging from resource discovery to secure information sharing, that can be quickly activated in case of unpredictable and adverse events to facilitate HADR operations. Furthermore, Aceso leverages the Value-of-Information (VoI) methodology to handle the processing and dissemination of mission-critical information. To validate the capabilities of Aceso, we devised a fictional HADR scenario, set in the city of Helsinki, Finland, that involves the collaboration of multiple responder teams with different roles. The validation results confirm Aceso’s usefulness in prioritizing the processing and dispatching of critical information and in realizing federation-wide sharing of this information among HADR teams.}

To achieve this, we evaluated the performance and efficiency of 32 smart cities in China between 2012 and 2017. The 32 cities were divided into four categories according to average performance and efficiency. The process of change in the smart cities between 2012 and 2017 was mapped and three primary trends in performance and efficiency were identified. The final status reached by the 32 cities was predicted according to the three trends. To more effectively implement smart city initiatives, two evolutionary routes for smart cities are proposed. The findings demonstrate that the performance of smart city implementation is consistent with economic development but not with efficiency. The status of smart city implementation is not static; it depends on the context of the city and can shift between the four city categories. Smart city initiatives should be driven by technology firms with appropriate governmental guidance.}

abstract = {The smart cities agenda has garnered considerable interest recently as the spread of mobile technologies and notions of ‘big data’ have opened possibilities for promoting greater efficiencies in urban metabolisms. This has been particularly prominent in the realm of environmental sustainability, where smart technologies have been viewed as a way of reducing traffic congestion and delivering energy efficiencies. Key to these aspirations is the way in which technologies are seen to interact with human behaviour and how digital technologies can promote behavioural change through the provision of ‘better’ information. However, smart city programmes adopt a particular intellectual and pragmatic framing of behavioural change that we argue is fundamentally narrow and unambitious, raising concerns about how behavioural science is mobilised, by whom and its potential to promote sustainable urban futures. First, we propose that the focus in smart city narratives on quantitative data and insights from ‘big data’ is methodologically narrow and is representative of a highly individualised, libertarian paternalist perspective that privileges rationalistic and atomised understandings of behaviour. Second, we argue that the logic of smart cities leads city governments towards a focus on superficial change and the language of ‘encouraging’ shifts in individual behaviour that presents a distraction from the urgent need to reconfigure city infrastructures for low carbon forms of living. Third, we explore how such behavioural change approaches are fundamentally didactic and often lapse into assuming that publics are the passive receivers of ‘smarter’ information rather than active citizens who can question, campaign and present alternative visions to those of corporate-government interests. In this way, we argue that the suffusing of the smart cities and behavioural change agendas act as a neo-liberal distraction to the ways in which cities can develop to support the priorities of human and ecological wellbeing.}

The predicted effectiveness of our model for intelligent city applications, including emergency vehicle routing, is well demonstrated by the LIT2FLS correlation coefficients of 0.994%. This data fusion approach determines the exact level of congestion for a given place by combining sensory data with crowd reactions. In addition, OSRM employs a road communication system to detect real-time traffic variations and choose the least congested route. Furthermore, a sensor station for gathering the speeds and pollutants of moving automobiles on the road has also been established. An Android app has been developed to collect public information on blockages A driver of an Exigency Vehicle (EV) is directed towards a medical facility with the quickest, congestion-aware path by means of the Application software service.

Thus, this study explores how SVC contributes to achieving the SDGs at the city level. We performed the Cross-Network Information Analysis protocol, which is properly designed for investigating dyadic phenomena. The main findings revealed that SVC contributes to most SDGs in cities, mainly 11, 17, 9, and 8. Consensus building, smart sustainable cities, and innovation ecosystems are central aspects of the SVC contribution to the SDGs in general. Other relevant aspects are: shared meaning, networking strategy, socio-spatial & cultural patterns, technology, circular economy, sharing economy, corporate social responsibility, entrepreneurship, social bricolage, knowledge sharing, open innovation, ethics, and creativity. However, there has been no empirical evidence of SVC contribution to reaching the SDGs 5, 14, and 15. Policymakers, academics, and practitioners can address the lack of applied research on these last three SDGs by including non-human stakeholders, the environment, and gender diversity in organizational processes, organizational systems, and partnerships.}

However, despite the recent large-scale development of smart cities in China, it is still uncertain whether smart cities could effectively promote urban resilience. Exploiting the quasi-experimental nature of smart city development in China, this paper uses DID and PSM-DID to determine their impact on urban resilience. Four aspects of urban resilience are analyzed: economic resilience, social resilience, ecological resilience, and infrastructure resilience. The results show that the development of smart cities can improve social resilience considerably without any obvious effect on economic and ecological resilience and even negatively affect infrastructure resilience; the distribution effect, technological effect, and structural effect are important mechanisms for smart cities to influence urban resilience; and smart cities that have a sound industrial structure, enough good-quality companies, large size, and a large pool of highly-skilled labor are much more likely to be associated with a high level of urban resilience. Policy suggestions are also provided to promote the simultaneous improvement of smart cities and urban resilience, and hence help establish a new ‘urban resilience’ model.}

A significant concern is the false data injection attack (FDIA), which intricately targets sustainable energy system state estimation. This attack allows adversaries to bypass detection methods, manipulate outcomes, and jeopardize secure grid operation. This study explores FDIA identification in smart grids, focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for detection. The objective is to assess the proposed detection methodology through simulation experiments on the IEEE standard test scheme, validating practicality under diverse sustainable energy conditions. This study undertakes a focused exploration into the realm of identifying FDIAs within smart grids, centering on the utilization of Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) as a machine learning approach for detection.

Various contrasting scenarios are meticulously designed to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the detection model under diverse conditions. In the intricate landscape of Fault Detection, Isolation, and Diagnosis in smart grids, the imperative is to recognize and comprehend abnormal conditions or faults within the grid's operational framework.

A complex event is inferred from patterns of different individual primitive events according to their spatio-temporal information. Complex event processing (CEP) systems facilitate applications to define their reasoning rules based on event processing languages (EPL), similar to SQL. However, current languages and CEP engines do not efficiently support spatial data characteristics. Geospatial CEP is challenging since applications have diverse definitions for complex events (e.g., air quality index), IoT devices have heterogeneous specifications/capabilities, and complex events may happen concurrently. This paper proposes the Geo-Tesla language that enables smart city applications to define spatial attributes in complex event definitions and reasoning rules. Then, we devise the GeoT-Rex CEP engine that implements geospatial operations that compiles Geo-Tesla language and processes the spatial data. The integration of Geo-Tesla and GeoT-Rex enables applications to process complex events with spatial characteristics in their reasoning rules and identify boundaries of the detected complex event (event footprint). The evaluation results from the proof of concept implementation show that our proposed solution outperforms in identifying the footprint of complex events up to 44% in the largest network size. They also show that the detection percentage in the concurrent appearance of complex events is 40% more on average than a close state-of-the-art baseline.}

Even though green IoT devices operate in a resource-constrained environment. Monitoring, recognizing, and responding to activities that entail continuous access to timely information in a partially or fully distributed ecosystem is a difficult task. To overcome the challenges of resource management in the IoT, we proposed an energy-efficient Dynamic Clustering Routing (DCR) protocol using a neuro-fuzzy technique for restricting the resources of IoT devices. The proposed protocol uses a dynamic self-organizing neural network to create dynamic clusters in a network. The test-bed analysis is for computing the real-time event detection and clustering sensor nodes using TinyOS. The simulation result shows that the proposed protocol achieved a significant gain over peer-competing well-known green communication routing protocols like Low-energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Low-energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy-Centralized (LEACH-C). The proposed model results show that using neuro-fuzzy logic is effective for sustainable IoT devices and green smart city applications in terms of resource management and dynamic clustering. The result analysis shows that the proposed protocol shows an average 35% significant gain on the First Node Dies (FND), Last Node Dies (LND), the number of packets sent to CH & BS, network convergence time, network overhead, and average packet delay to compare with the LEACH and LEACH-C.}

In this review paper, the main components and roles of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, and biofuels) for the smart city were fully introduced. Besides, integrating the renewable sources form into the energy systems of smart cities was thoroughly analyzed on the basis of technical and economic criteria. Finally, existing challenges and future scenarios were also discussed in detail to clarify the progress and perspective of smart renewable energy systems for the smart city. In general, the integration of renewables into energy systems of the smart city is a sagacious perspective and solution aiming to achieve cleaner process and more sustainable development. However, the optimization issues of the energy system for integrating of renewable components, ensuring good stability, maximizing the operating range, and minimizing the investment costs should be critically evaluated in the future works.}

abstract = {In recent times, Tourism and Travel are considered a flexible, dynamic, and ever-growing industry. The Smart Tourism Destinations concept arises from the advancement of smart cities. Since information technologies are considered a key competitive element of a city's destination, tourism companies invest extensively in smart system initiatives. Moreover, the smart city concept and related approaches are increasingly recognized by cities worldwide to optimize sustainable environments. Furthermore, a smart tourist city faces the challenge of creating urban areas that residents and tourists can experience together, particularly in cities that pose new tourism challenges. This paper proposes the Data-Driven Sustainable Smart City Framework (DDSSCF) for sustainable green tourism strategies and policies. This paper explores the aspects of technologies essential for creating a smart city and a fashionable tourism destination. The preservation of the climate, protected cultural heritage, and natural resources would contribute to an environment, the economic, social sustainable field of tourism by reducing hazardous pollutants and energy usage. Therefore, based on the preservation limit, it has been classified into three components includes-green architecture, green waste, and green energy as a part of the green management framework at the same time. Hence, green tourism, including marketing efforts, such as green marketing, are necessary for the vision of successful adequate green management activities. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances efficiency ratio when compared to other existing methods.}

The urgency to mitigate the pandemic has generated severe effects on society in general, such as economic paralysis, the annulment of social conviviality, the threat to employment and the non-existence of various accessibilities. However, cities should not disappear and have seen a huge adaptation to technologies and an unprecedented digital transformation coupled with good governance practices in order to minimise the effects of these disruptive blockages. Thus, the objective of this study is the measurement of smart performance in cities in pandemic times. To respond to this objective, the composite index of Rodrigues & Franco (2019) for city intelligence based on the subdimensions governance and ICT was adopted, thus following the quantitative methodology and resorting to secondary data. Moreover, this index measures the adjective smartness distinct from smart, whose adoption by cities provides a smart way to solve their daily problems. The sample covered the 308 Portuguese cities and towns, commonly known as municipalities. The results obtained still show some weaknesses to be overcome by municipalities in the future, if they opt for a continued commitment to governance models based on ICT, although the future path is challenging, so that the returns of these strategies are converted into effective offers of hard and soft amenities to citizens, in which urban networks play a key role, with exponential effects on the new demands of citizens regarding their quality of life, given that the pandemic has manifestly changed their behaviours and lifestyles. Finally, the final considerations, implications for theory and practice, limitations and future research agenda are presented.}

This is highly relevant for delivering city-wide urban solutions to grand challenges. The combinations of conditions (factors) for scale-up remain understudied. This paper contextualizes its research within the theoretical literature of smart cities, innovation, knowledge management, and governance and compares 17 smart city pilot projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. The cases were selected according to the research objective and analyzed using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The findings show two paths of city-wide scale-up, which we term “bureaucratic tailoring” and “low-uncertainty partnering.” This article makes three important theoretical contributions. First, it is possible for smart city pilot projects to scale-up to an entire city through different paths. Second, differentiating the role and capabilities of the municipality in terms of these different paths and in relation to the other governance conditions is essential. Third, the social perception of technological uncertainty is not static but fluid, and is highly related to other governance conditions. Future-oriented policy makers might find the paths explained here useful for anticipating how projects might scale-up.}

This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category. Finally, some of the best practices for attaining sustainable smart cities are provided.}

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been widely used in sustainable smart city construction due to its advantages such as low price, good maneuverability and strong flexibility. However, as the heterogeneity of smart city systems and the high mobility of UAV network nodes cause them to face more serious security threats, ensuring the security and authenticity of message is crucial for UAVs to correctly perform the tasks issued by the command center. To fix the above-mentioned issues, many digital signature schemes have been presented in recent years. Regrettably, most existing schemes either have security vulnerabilities or poor performance. Very recently, He et al. came up with a certificateless designated verifier proxy signature (CLDVPS) scheme and advocated that it was secure. But, we find that their scheme cannot achieve its stated purpose because it fails to resist user impersonation attack. We put forward a new CLDVPS scheme to address the data security and privacy issues in UAV networks. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme can realize a higher security level while greatly reducing communication and computation overheads. Compared with related schemes, our scheme is more suitable for the application of UAV network in sustainable smart city.}

abstract = {Visually-impaired people encounter a series of challenging tasks in their daily life that are easy to the majority of society. For example, crossing a street, which is a critical task for a pedestrian traveling in a city, actually involves a set of orientation and navigation sub-tasks. The typical form of assistive technology as a solution today for street crossing relies upon an accessible pedestrian signal (APS) usually in the mode of audio signals broadcasted at a cross street. As popular as such APS is, there are various pain points to visually-impaired users who are trying to rely on conventional APS when crossing a street. Given the prevalence of smartphones among the visually-impaired around the world, there is still a vacuum in the literature as to the possibility of providing them, through a smartphone, a safer solution to address those pain points so that users can more confidently walk across a street. In this paper we look at how mobile technology relevantly helps the visually-impaired to cross streets more comfortably and confidently by presenting an action-research-based case of developing and deploying a smart accessible pedestrian signal system (SAPSS) in Taiwan. Originated from an ability-based design principle so as to ensure accessibility, the system integrates hardware, software, and a user-side mobile app into an enhanced solution for the visually-impaired to comfortably cross a street. Two field tests by 19 visually-impaired end users help modify the system and confirm its usability. From the positive feedbacks of these test participants, SAPSS has been formally deployed in three cities in Taiwan. This case study reports the development, the tests, and the deployment of the system in detail and also discusses implications of such a new generation assistive technology in the development of smart cities.}

DMADICV is a novel method proposed in the current study for Six Sigma. The proposed DMADICV framework consists of six key constructs: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Improve, and Control & Verify. These constructs are used as layers in smart cities, and relevant literature is reviewed to highlight the key factors and groups related to each layer. A conceptual framework is provided for smart city management and an assessment mechanism presented for measuring and testing the performance of smart city integrated processes. This is achieved by measuring and controlling the cost of quality non-conformance, right documentation in the first time, and timely implementation of control measures, the activity processing index, and quality controls. Improvement construct has a percentage of 35.67 % share in the DMADICV framework followed by define (16.76 %), design (15.52 %), control & verify (14.33 %), measure (10.08 %), and analyze (8.15 %). The top ten factors for managing smart cities through the Six Sigma method include process quality improvement, organizational development, process analysis, quality management, cost control, DMAIC, change management, project management plan, waste reduction, process quality measurement, and value creation, respectively. The DMADICV framework and its dynamic relations are shown through a system model and its key groups represented in layers of the smart cities whereby the city governance and management teams can provide services to their smart citizens effectively and efficiently. The proposed DMADICV method and associated smart city management framework are a humble addition to the body of knowledge that can be adopted and utilized in other knowledge fields.}

Thus, it is important to identify available community resources to help people cope with adversity, which can contribute to the overriding goal of a smart tourism city. To do this, we aim to provide empirical evidence on the spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters as community resources on community resilience to advance the building of a resilient smart tourism city. Using spatial econometric modeling with spatial data, we measure the spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters on community resilience in the United States. The findings reveal the significant spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters on community resilience within a specific region and across surrounding regions. The findings of this study provide policymakers and practitioners with spatial information on regional sport industry clusters as community resources that are locally bound and specialize in smart tourism and planning to enhance community resilience.}

Thus, it has become mandatory to turn up our cities to be intelligent by introducing IoT and smart grids to build smart buildings, smart communication technologies, smart healthcare systems, smart transportation, etc. Smart cities guarantee the healthy living of indoor inhabitants by sensing, processing and controlling all possible indoor–outdoor measures. In this paper, we develop a framework that systematically builds a reliable and secure Smart City Model (SCM) to be integrated then exploited by the building information model (BIM). SCM encloses both physical and digital models which highlight smart buildings in particular. First, the proposed solution identifies and models SCM components including their appropriate architectures that are responsible for communication, extension, information flow, and protection. To ensure SCM functional and security requirements, we develop a sound hybrid approach that relies on formal methods and network analysis. Uppaal model checker is used to verify the satisfiability of the smart city requirements whereas Cooja is deployed to simulate the connectivity and the communication coverage of the developed SCM. The obtained results, in Uppaal, showed that the different implemented scenarios are satisfying the functional correctness and security policies. Moreover, the simulation through Cooja showed that how different obstacles and positions of nodes affect the communication coverage and the energy consumption regarding the deployed nodes. Experimentally, the effectiveness of the developed framework has been shown through practical scenarios that are difficult to model and analyze.}

In the case of the ASCN, technocratic regionalism is used to spur urban development through the rollout of smart city plans, policies and projects across Southeast Asia. As such, it is a regional strategy designed to scale smartness, and thus deprovincialise the city by embedding it within transnational flows of capital, ideas and expertise. At the same time, however, already existing urban issues have the potential to re-provincialise the city. The vagaries of local contexts, structures of governance and urban cultures complicate processes of scalar ascendency and thus foreground the paradox of (de)provincialisation. We identify three challenges – divergent infrastructural developments, vertical and horizontal (non-)integration, and the need to reconcile (in)formal spaces of the “smart” city – that underpin the translational politics of technocratic regionalism, and which are likely to compromise the efficacy and success of the ASCN.}

Combining WPT with renewable energy, electric vehicles, and recharge infrastructure is a promising new application for smart city development. This paper examines the history, characteristics, and six classifications of WPT technology through the lens of urban development, in addition to its successful implementations in seven contexts, such as portable devices and transportation, based on a survey of 161,425 papers. We propose a dependable and efficient research-to-application life cycle for high-power WPT operations, which is capable of achieving efficiencies of approximately 90 percent at approximately 50 percent of the original cost. In addition, the significance of incorporating WPT technology, renewable energy sources, and urban infrastructure into the design of sustainable cities is highlighted. This study determined that WPT is advantageous for promoting the construction of space and ground photovoltaic plants, as well as photovoltaic rooftops, and also serves to accelerate the promotion of electric vehicles, smart devices, and charging roads. The findings of this study cast light on three problem areas and six future prospects of WPT, as well as its multifaceted benefits in terms of energy, the environment, and the social economy of sustainable cities.}

abstract = {Using big data in supply chain management (SCM) has the potential to have a significant impact on the industry in general and international transportation in particular. Big data have a direct influence on transportation capacity in future cities. There has been a significant increase in urbanization over the last decade in which one in three people will live in an urban area by 2050. An updated transportation infrastructure is essential to keep up with the present flow of goods, while also limiting its impact on the environment and human health and this is likely to be achieved using big data analytics technique. To overcome this problem, smart cities are becoming more popular. With the use of information and communication technology (ICT), a smart city aims to address public concerns in an inclusive, municipally-based partnership. A big data transportations system may be built using the superstructure of a smart city. A good way to define it is the modeling and analysis of urban transportation and distribution networks using enormous data sets created by GPS, mobile phones, and transactional data from company activities. Big Data analytics may be used in public transportation to better understand how people go about the city. A better understanding of passengers’ travel patterns might help transportation providers make better judgments regarding service quality. People who travel by automobile on a regular basis may now be predicted based on the triangulation of mobile phone data from millions of anonymous users. Local and national polls may demonstrate the paradigm’s applicability. To compute the time it takes for passengers to board and exit trains, Metro and iBus vehicle position data may be combined with information from smart cards. Big Data analytics for traffic management may benefit from these findings.}

Smart cities could be considered as urban areas that use data collection sensors and digital technologies which cooperate to create benefits for citizens in terms of well being, inclusion and participation, environmental quality, and intelligent development. Smart city vendors provide software systems to support application developers, city managers, urban planners, and policy-makers in designing, implementing, deploying, and managing smart city applications for an effective urban development and management. Although there exist a variety of smart city software systems, their benefits and limitations are still unknown. In this paper we review smart city vendors and we provide insight into their software systems for smart cities. Thus, we come up with a good entry point, and here survey a large amount of information to help developers, city managers, urban planners, and policy-makers to take better decisions when choosing smart city software systems.}

However, by integrating these enabling technologies with behavioral intelligence, scientific research and trans-disciplinary knowledge can enable smart cities to drive inhabitants more efficiently, and these urban hubs will be able to meet their sustainable development goals (SDGs). Sustainable growth depends on the successful management of transparent and inclusive urban development, particularly in low income and lower-middle income countries where rapid urbanization is expected to reach 50% and 59% on average by 2050. Further, this study sheds light on current issues as well as challenges and future research where the above technologies can promote socio-economic and techno-environmental development, and become a catalyst for the implementation of the concept of smart cities leading to a sustainable future. Keeping in mind the need for sustainability globally, this study presents a participative bottom-up and cognitive top-down paradigm that focuses on developing self-sustainable smart cities where sustainability is at the centre of governance, inhabitants, business, and all other related entities.}

Walkability-enhanced ICT (WICT) caters to pedestrian needs and preferences by providing intelligent real-time information as a person strolls in an urban environment. Governments invest heavily in various ICTs and big data as part of their planning decisions in smart cities. The walkability enhancement enabled by integrated ICTs needs to be evaluated by urban planners, but this aspect is not covered in previous studies. WICT is usually provided free of charge to users. The benefits enjoyed by pedestrians are intangible with a non-market nature. This research looks into the walkability performance of WICT by evaluating its benefits to pedestrians. A survey was carried out in Hong Kong for a WICT installable in smartphones. The Contingent Valuation was used to evaluate the non-market benefits quantitatively, employing ordinal regression. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) is estimated as the proxy of monetary value for the benefit enjoyed by individual users, which may be aggregated for a Cost-Benefits Analysis. This econometric approach intends to assist in decision making for continued investment in similar information systems of Smart City. Influential factors affecting WTP are also highlighted for targeting policies. Recommendations for city managers are proposed to establish a rational basis for planning smart cities.}

Additionally, using text mining in reviews can help summarize, detect patterns, and better explore papers. The proposed methodology (and code) is reproducible and can be applied to different research fields. As a case study, we systematically review smart road space allocation literature and the role of big data and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in promoting emerging urban solutions. Even though, recently there has been a significant rise in studies related to smart cities and big data, few papers consider these approaches in road space allocation. On the one hand, temporary solutions are mainly held in local access streets to achieve place-making and reclaim vacant public spaces. On the other hand, intermittent and dynamic solutions are mainly studied in arterials and highways and focused on traffic performance. Ultimately, new road space allocation proposals are not sufficiently studied where there is a high dispute and limited space to allocate space. Big data and smart technologies have the potential to collect real-time data and adapt the infrastructure according to fluctuations of demand and also in case of an unpredictable event.}

Such a scenario also comprises the interpretation of smart cities as tools to assist policymakers and city administrators in directing solutions based on emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) to the materialization of urban strategic plans addressing these confrontations. There are, however, no established indicator systems that attest to the substantiation of such plans by smart city solutions, nor to their alignment with the goals of urban sustainable development. Therefore, an analytical framework is proposed here to address this knowledge gap. It enables guiding the leverage of smart cities’ ICTs, not only for the achievement of economic goals, a feature intrinsic to smart city innovations, but also to reach other sustainability dimensions, as the environmental, social, institutional and cultural. To this end, generic sustainability indicator frameworks and also a set of smart city indicators are explored. They are examined as potential sources of specific taxonomies in smart city services for urban sustainable development. From this compilation of options, the Dashboard of Sustainability, once one of the indicator systems most recommended by experts, is revisited. It is adapted as a framework for analyzing and helping to maintain the strategic targeting of smart city solutions, during their entire lifecycle, at sustainability. To complete the qualitative-analytical-taxonomic frame, the services offered by a real smart city solution, the Rio de Janeiro Center of Operations, are employed as a model. This allows investigating its 9-year transition from a wider, larger capacity, strategic and innovative configuration in orientation towards sustainability perspectives, to a more narrow, operational composition, that is predominantly devoted to the economic dimension.}

The smart city concept was developed to deal with these challenges by incorporating new technologies in order to find solutions that preserve cities’ environment while promoting their residents’ wellbeing. However, for cities to be truly “smart”, they should be evaluated, and, to that end, determinants that facilitate their creation need to be identified. This study thus sought to combine cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach to find which factors foster smart city success, as well as the cause-and-effect relationships among these determinants. In two groupwork sessions, a panel of experts identified a wide range of smart city determinants and analyzed the dynamics of their relationships. The results were validated by the panel members and senior representatives of Cascais and Évora City Councils, Portugal, who confirmed that the analysis system developed provides a deeper understanding of this research context.

The optimal management of energy resources is of key importance, and with mobile EVs playing a pivotal role in smart city power flows, the coordination of energy management systems (EMSs) at their parking locations can bear global benefits. In this study the coordination between home energy management systems (HEMSs) and EV parking lot management systems (PLEMS) is proposed, modeled, and simulated, as a new contribution to earlier studies. The EMSs coordinate through partially sharing individual EV schedules and without sharing private information. Missing information is completed through public cloud repositories and services. The HEMS and PLEMS are implemented using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The proposed coordination framework is computationally implemented and simulated based on a real-life case study. The results show that the proposed EMS coordination framework is both technically beneficial for power grids and economically beneficial for EV owners.}

Smart cities primarily rely on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to manage and maintain its service offerings. In literature, clustering and multihop routing techniques have been proposed, validated and implemented to reduce the consumption of energy in the network. With this motivation, the current study develops Adaptive Parallel Seeker Optimization-based Energy Aware Route Planning Technique (APSO-EARPT) for clustered WSN in smart cities. The presented APSO-EARPT technique concentrates on appropriate selection of Cluster Heads (CHs) and optimal routes in WSN. To accomplish this, APSO-EARPT model encompasses Weight-Based Clustering Scheme (WBCS) for effective selection of CHs. Then, routing process is performed with the help of APSO algorithm. The proposed APSO-EARPT technique computes a Fitness Function (FF) that comprises of three variables such as Residual Energy (RE), distance to Base Station (BS), and node degree. This fitness function helps in optimal selection of routes in WSN. In order to validate the supremacy of the proposed APSO-EARPT model in terms of network lifespan and energy efficiency, simulations were conducted and the results confirmed the excellent performance of the proposed model.}

The first building has no PCM and has a wall thickness of 29 cm, but the second and third buildings have PCM and a wall thickness of 34 cm. In general, the installation of PCM in the northern, southern, eastern, and western walls is beneficial, as it reduced heat exchange by 63.5% in PCM-filled buildings compared to the reference one.

5G has taken off at a brisk speed over the years, bringing significant benefits to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wireless sensor nodes. The launching of 5G technology provides an excellent opportunity for the faster development of smart cities. Nanogenerators (NGs) have been widely demonstrated as sustainable power sources and self-powered active sensors. The last 15 years of research on NGs have revealed that it can contribute to the digitalization of smart city services, such as localized renewable energy supplies, intelligent transportation, smart vehicles, and digital healthcare applications. The integration of novel NG technology in smart cities will solve problems pertinent to sustainable power sources for decentralized IoT devices and provide pathways for realizing self-powered active sensing systems. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive review of current research on NGs’ applications in different sectors of a smart city. More importantly, we will show how NGs can be a game changer in the development of smart cities under 5G services and how the usage of NGs can boost the convenience of city dwellers. Our aim is to draw more attention to NG applications in the digitalization of smart cities and provide a guideline for applying smart concepts in future urban planning.}

By applying this strategy, the amount of light and the energy consumption of LED light sources is restricted under conditions where no activity occurs in the environment or the level of the performed activity is limited. The results of system simulation and implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.

Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the “bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)” are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level.

The temperature of the cable of power company A is measured under normal and hidden dangers, and the body insulation test is conducted on No. 1 main transformer. The results show that under normal operation, the cable temperature at each point is slightly different, which is basically about 40 °C. The temperature before the fourth point of the cable rises obviously, indicating that the fourth point has faulty. Over time, the more chemical molecules are detected in phase A. When phase B and phase C are tested on the same day, the difference of chemical molecular content is relatively small. It indicates that the chemical molecular content detected by chromatographic test of bulk insulating oil is normal. To sum up, smart power, as the objective need of urban intelligent development, is an important foundation of smart city. The power inspection scheme based on IoT and RFID technology proposed has high detection efficiency.}

In this article, we argue that the main challenges policymakers confront in deploying these technologies are organizational rather than technological. To do so we draw on research from science and technology studies on sociotechnical systems and interviews with city government officials to characterize smart cities as large technological systems, which are immense, interconnected systems that consist of not just of technologies but organizational and institutional processes. We then use this analysis to identify challenges and opportunities affecting North American smart city initiatives. We find that disparate – and at times competing – stakeholder motives inhibit the deployment of smart city technologies, including in ways that preserve privacy and security, creating organizational challenges that we argue must be overcome for smart city initiatives to succeed. We conclude by drawing on the perspectives of local policymakers and science and technology studies to offer pathways for local governments to overcome these organizational challenges through collective action and facilitate smart city development.}

After 2 weeks of its impact, this study conducted a household survey in the central part of Bhubaneswar city (comprising of different wards), where smart-city projects were implemented and ongoing. Survey questions categorized into Social & Human, Financial, Physical, and Smart-city factors and their corresponding indicators were chosen through literature review and some modified based on local conditions. A total of 22 vulnerability and 40 capacity indicators were used to calculate the vulnerability and capacity index. The result indicates that overall capacity overweighs the overall vulnerability in the central part of the city during the Fani cyclone. Specifically, the city was more vulnerable based on Financial factors, whereas more capable and smartly prepared for the cyclone in the context of Social & Human factors, Physical factors, and Smart-city factors. The study indicates the mitigating impact of the smart-city project in the central Bhubaneswar city area and applauds the step taken by the government for preparation during such an extreme event. The realizations of these results will help the government to further improve its disaster management plan with important infrastructural modification highlighted in this study.}

This study proposes an energy management platform based on an intelligent probabilistic wavelet petri neuro-fuzzy inference algorithm (IPWPNFIA) to control the V/F index in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs) and battery energy storage system (BESS) facing with various uncertainties. The suggested approach is programmed at two central and local controller stages based on the communication system and time-of-use demand response programs execution. The suggested approach is modeled by considering asymmetric membership functions based on the BESS optimal participation to control uncertainties caused by RESs, plug-and-play operations, and load fluctuations. The proposed platform's performance is verified and compared in different scenarios with different methods. The experimental setup and results are based on the rapid control prototyping of the micro-grid platform, MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB software, and hardware infrastructure such as the OPAL-RT (OP5600/OP8660) System.

Although, the majority of proposed solutions provide the optimal way to direct network traffic toward cloud storage. However, most of them are still needed to manage resources efficiently while handling huge amounts of data. Moreover, distributed IoT services must be intelligent and also be secure against malicious data access. This study introduces an autonomous approach using trusted sensing technologies to provide reliable remote sensing and aggregation for future-generation systems. In the first phase, the proposed model looks at an artificial intelligence-based method for negotiation between IoT devices and mobile stations for transferring the data. The second phase involves the creation of a robust security method that supports digital certificates for peer-to-peer mutual authentication. Additionally, to maintain the integrity of certificates, they are sent securely in the form of a chain. Finally, a combination of trust and privacy is used while storing data on cloud servers. Simulation-based experiments have shown that the proposed model significantly outperforms I-AREOR and MCNA in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, malicious threats, and overhead.}

However, because they have primarily focused on the software aspects of monitoring and control using IT technologies, studies on the hardware aspects (that is, the characteristics of buildings and renovation techniques for energy saving) that affect energy performance have been underrepresented in the context of smart cities. Therefore, by using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, this study aims to analyze the causal relationship by examining how the characteristics of buildings and energy-saving techniques affect the energy performance of EU smart city projects.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely utilized as the major significant element of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for feasible smart cities due to the capability of IoT for supporting sustainability in numerous domains. There is a need for fault avoidance via the continuous and dynamic utilization of network behavior for achieving the necessary quality of the IoT communication system that allows us to get sustainable enhancement in smart cities regarding IoT communication systems. While considering the IoT-assisted network, the basic part of the IoT model is considered a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), especially for data management that consists of various sensor nodes in the smart city area. Moreover, every node in a WSN is considerably utilized for a specific reason and thus, every node is handled by a battery that increases the consumption of energy in the entire smart city scheme for processing the data regarding communication. On the other hand, there exist various limitations like scalability, communication latency, centralization, privacy, security, etc. Thus, this paper plans to develop the IoT and WSN-based smart city application using novel intelligent techniques, aiming for the optimal performance classification of the network. The infrastructure of IoT will consist of WSN, Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET), Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Here, the efficiency of the whole IoT system is acquired from the efficiency of the whole IoT module. Hence, the IoT network efficiency rates of the individual must be predicted in an earlier stage to predict the effectiveness of the complete IoT system. The efficiency of each network is forecasted with the help of the constraints such as energy consumption, gathered data size, transmitted data size, mobility, false positive, throughput, packet loss, and delay. The output from each network is considered as input to the Optimized Recurrent Neural Network (ORNN) for predicting the ending superiority of the whole IoT network. Here, the parameter tuning in the RNN is done by the Self Adaptive Honey Badger Algorithm (SA-HBA). The empirical outcomes confirmed that the designed method has forecasted and enhanced the superiority of a whole simulated IoT system in an accurate manner. Throughout the result analysis, the given designed method attains minimum energy consumption rate and also better prediction accuracy.}

Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities.

However, the extant studies primarily focus on business-led smart city projects. Little attention is paid to the causal relations between organizational conditions and technology enactment in government-led projects. Therefore, there is a research gap concerning what conditions of governmental organizations, singly or jointly, drive technology enactment in smart city projects. To fill the gap, this article establishes three increasing levels of smartness and formulates four government conditions. Based on this conceptual framework, this article explores different configurations of organizational conditions that lead to varying levels of smartness. It uses the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method to study 11 smart city projects in Hangzhou, China. The results generate three configurations of organizational conditions that lead to decisional intelligence, indicating that multiple pathways exist to achieve the highest level of smartness. These configurations often emphasize the significant role of human resource pressure in driving decisional intelligence. But no single condition is necessary because when human resource pressure is absent, strong financial capacity, good information-sharing, and facilitative leadership can work together as a substitution.}

Smart manufacturing, characterized by the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, offers the potential to reduce energy consumption, emissions, and enhance productivity. This study investigates the influence of the low-carbon city pilot (LCP) policy on smart manufacturing and its underlying mechanisms. Leveraging data spanning 2003 to 2020 from China’s A-share-listed manufacturing companies, several key findings emerge. First, the LCP policy exerts a significant positive impact on the smart manufacturing capabilities of companies operating within LCPs. Furthermore, this impact strengthens over time. Second, a company’s innovation and effective resource allocation act as active mediators in the correlation between the LCP policy and smart manufacturing, whereas government intervention plays a positive moderating role. Lastly, state-owned manufacturing companies exhibit a lesser positive effect from the LCP policy compared with their non-state-owned counterparts in terms of smart manufacturing. Moreover, the positive effect of the LCP policy on manufacturing companies in cities with traditional industrial bases is relatively smaller than that in cities with emerging industrial bases. Building upon these findings, this study offers targeted recommendations to promote smart and sustainable manufacturing.}
