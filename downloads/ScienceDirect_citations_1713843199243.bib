It is, therefore, important that we understand the impact of those initiatives in terms of circular economy objectives. This chapter gives an overview of the current smart city concept and definitions, and of the definitions related to the smart sustainable city and the advantage of the implementation of smart sustainable city instead of the smart city concept. Furthermore, the chapter addresses the impact of smart sustainable city initiatives in promoting sustainability and the circular economy (CE), particularly in the water and waste water-management, waste-management, and energy sectors. A number of use cases are presented of solutions that have been adopted, using technologies such as IoT-enabled devices, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, to enable the transition toward a circular economy and resource efficiency in a smart sustainable city, and the effects of these solutions are discussed.}

This research paper will discuss about the influence gained from playing a game upon city management skills, and careful planning on what must be done first, in order to maintain or increase the well-being of the citizen and the city welfare. By implementing real life applicable condition in the game which will be played by a person through a sandbox simulation style of gameplay, the player will be able to learn and experience certain types of city problems and the solutions to mitigate those problems without actually making it occur in a real city with real casualties, so it will be a safe vessel to gain new knowledge or to rediscover old effective methods, regarding city management, through a game. The results will portray, how can ‘Smart City’ aspects be implemented into a game, and how a city management simulation game can influence other people’ actions on their city management knowledge.}

Namely Four-Hospitality, which consists of accessible, safety, problem solve, and flexible. The Four-Hospitality will become the standard benchmark assessment of smart city design. In this research method, we compare between the literature of different countries and the concept of Four-Hospitality. The comparison in this study aims to enable us knowing the latest form of the technological solutions that are applied by various countries, to provide disability welfare and most discussed in several literatures. The result can be observed that around 62.5% of the 8 literatures fulfill Four-Hospitality standard. The most observed deals using IT-based technologies such as Wemap, Wheelmap, SIMON, OpenStreetMap and other similar applications. For implementation, is tailored to the competitiveness of the city, where the competitiveness of the city is shaped by the main factors (input) and economic performance (output). So, the conclusion is by using the Four-Hospitality standard, we will get the right public service facility to implement a smart city with friendly environment design for disability. And for the implementation phase, we can use the city progress parameters by measuring the level of competitiveness based on input and output factors. We believe, by implementing this strategy, selecting technology with Four-Hospitality standard in implementation a smart city with ideal design, it will be able to build a city that can improve welfare’s life of disability.}

The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), an enabler of smart city phenomenon, has incubated a productive environment for such innovations. Smart things equipped with IoT capabilities, allow for developing smart city applications at such large scale that each application can be represented as a system of systems (SoS). Nevertheless, the complexity of engineering such SoS has been a major challenge in developing and maintaining smart city applications. One of the engineering challenges that industry face today is the verification of a SoS smart city application at runtime. We introduce utilization of a model-based runtime monitoring approach for providing reliable service. We propose to use message sequence charts for representing a smart city application, later allow the practitioners to express expected behavior of an application in terms of complex-event processing patterns. We demonstrate the fidelity of our approach on a sample smart parking system. Our approach is one of its kind in enabling a non-intrusive monitoring of IoT behavior at runtime (online).}

However, the application of classic density-based clustering algorithms on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. Since metropolitan cities are heavily characterized by variable densities, multi-density clustering seems to be more appropriate to discover city hotspots. This paper presents CHD (City Hotspot Detector), a multi-density approach to discover urban hotspots in a city, by reporting an extensive comparative analysis with three classic density-based clustering algorithms, on both state-of-the-art and real-world datasets. The comparative experimental evaluation in an urban scenario shows that the proposed multi-density algorithm, enhanced by an additional rolling moving average technique, detects higher quality city hotspots than other classic density-based approaches proposed in literature.}

The smart cities are realized by using IT based services in the domain of transportation, health care, building management and so forth. In order to provide these services, vital information has to be sensed and disseminated using Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, which are sparsely deployed in a smart city. These devices have low end processors and sometimes, they are installed in places where battery replacement is not feasible. In addition, they are also vulnerable to security attacks by the malicious nodes. There are a lot of recent attacks where IoT networks have been targeted by the hackers to launch a coordinated cyber attacks on some web domains. Therefore, there is a need to develop secure IoT solutions for smart cities that consume low energy. Due to its lightweight but powerful mechanisms, trust management is a promising technology to establish security for the heavily resource-constrained devices that are characteristic of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we develop an approach using trust management and investigate how it can be improved to work more energy-friendly. In particular, we adapt our mechanism to the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. Further, we analyze the outcome of these adaptations finding out that they can reduce the active listening time of IoT nodes significantly.}

However, urban problems, e.g., environmental pollution, resources shortage, and traffic jam, have been more and more serious for urban management and development. Smart city has been put forward as an effective approach to achieve better urban management recently. Smart city aims to realize the integration of municipal service, business, transportation, water, energy source and other urban sub-systems through close combination of human wisdom and information communication techniques (ICTs). As a result, the link and synergy of information could be ultimately established with ICTs, e.g., internet, internet of things, cloud computing. Yet, few studies have been conducted to systematically link smart city with big data in China. This paper aims to put forward a development framework of smart city with Chinese characteristics against the background of big data. Key actions, including rational planning of city infrastructures, the establishment and improvement of long-acting mechanism, the effective performance of city managerial function, are proposed to realize the development idea. Meanwhile, this paper also investigates the risks embedded in development of smart city with Chinese characteristics, e.g., information safety, weak emergency responding capacity and poor independent research and development capacity of core technology. This study can facilitate Chinese local governments to systematically plan smart city before clinging the hot concept in a rush.}

The capability for cities to endorse, foster, enhance ongoing transformations and modern challenges is obstructed by the unsuitableness and lack of communication and integration of both material and immaterial infrastructures. The new vision of Smart Cities can fill these gaps, as it represents a balance among hardware and software aspects, technology and human capital, and it aims at realizing and guaranteeing the quality of life to the inhabitants. At today, there is absence of uniformity both in the definition and in the concept development of a Smart City, and there are not practical methodologies supporting the evaluation models developed in literature. The approach often does not appear as a holistic, complete and integrated, but as a combination of sector-based non communicating and non integrated actions. In this framework, the aim of this paper is to outline a planning methodology of actions to realize a Smart City that provides a holistic and specific approach to territories and cities by taking into account the specific features of the context and by developing different and appropriate strategies. According to this, a way to integrate the various aspects of a Smart City through the definition of the relations existing among all the subsystems of the city, considered as a whole (human) organism, has been developed.}

In addition, with the rise of smart cities and IoT, there is a need for efficient TSCs that can handle large and complex data. To address this issue, this study proposes a TSC system to maximize the number of vehicles crossing an intersection and balances the signals between roads by using Q-learning (QL). The proposed system has a flexible structure that can be modified to suit the changes in the original structure of the intersection.}

It presents research experience gained from a European project for managing social and technological innovation in the production and evaluation of citizen-centred internet-enabled services in the public sector. It is based on six urban pilot initiatives, which sought to operationalise a new approach to co-producing and co-evaluating civic services in smart cities – commonly referred to as open innovation for smart city services. Research suggests that the evidence base underpinning this approach is not sufficiently robust to support claims being made about its effectiveness. Instead evaluation research of citizen-centred internet-enabled urban services is in its infancy and there are no tested methods or tools in the literature for supporting this approach. The paper reports on the development and trialing of a novel Co-evaluation Framework, indicators and reporting categories, used to support the co-production of smart city services in an EU-funded project. Our point of departure is that innovation of services is a sub-set of innovation management that requires effective integration of technological with social innovation, supported by the right skills and capacities. The main skills sets needed for effective co-evaluation of open innovation services are the integration of stakeholder management with evaluation capacities.}

Urban areas are developing rapidly from a technological viewpoint, and innovative technologies create new possibilities for smart mobility management. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between the implementation of the smart city concept and the idea of sustainable transport, particularly with regard to the reduction of transport generated CO2 emissions. The study estimates CO2 emissions for different potential scenarios of development for the Warsaw transport system until 2050 using the United Nations' ForFITS (For Future Inland Transport Systems) model. The study also analyses the additional impact on CO2 emissions of smart city elements as determinants of mobility. The results show that meeting the reduction targets set by the European Union 2011 White Paper on Transport will be challenging, requiring an in-depth transformation of the transport and energy sectors. This study also confirms that smart city solutions can play a crucial role in mitigating transport emissions and meeting reduction goals. The conclusions provide important insights for the design of smart mobility governance and enhance the relationship between transport policy and research.}

However, location data are outsourced to the third party (e.g., vehicles and the vehicular cloud), which causes high security risks. In this paper, we first define a personalized local differential privacy criterion for location data, which offers a strong private guarantee to drivers. Then, we propose a density-based location clustering mechanism, i.e., PLPP-CLIQUE, which not only satisfies the proposed privacy criterion but also maximizes the utility of vehicles for location-based services. Moreover, we design a more efficient mechanism, i.e., Improved-PLPP-CLIQUE, to increase the utility of location clustering for vehicular clouds under the same privacy requirement. We demonstrate that our mechanisms satisfy the privacy criterion and have the high utility by theoretical analysis. Finally, we perform extensive experiments to show the good capability of our mechanisms.}

This paper focuses on linking proposed smart city strategies to smart village policies to ensure that rural youth have improved opportunities for employment through ICT initiatives to ensure digital inclusion, using primary surveys undertaken in India. The motivation was to understand how mobile telephony could be a catalyst to create Smart Villages in India, where young people can chart out new pathways to realize their aspirations with regard to tertiary education and new avenues for diversifying into rural non-agricultural employment. We use data obtained from a household survey in villages in the states of Punjab and Tamil Nadu to examine the mobile phone usage preferences of rural educated youth to identify the way forward in improving the accessibility of services on the supply side. We make the case that where youth are using mobile phone access to increase their social information base it is indeed possible that the new social media groups formed by rural youth become a powerful conduit for generating new employment opportunities. The key to accessing this solution is to use a demand driven model for mobile services that would permit a bottom of governance model to generate sustainable growth of enterprises and improved human development of these villages.}

abstract = {The European “Smart Cities & Communities Initiative” of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) supports cities and regions in taking ambitious measures to progress by 2020 towards a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable use and production of energy. This initiative aims to pool resources to support the demonstration of energy, transport and information and communication technologies in European urban areas. In this effort, the zero energy buildings (ZEB) are expected to play a crucial role. The main objective of this paper is to present the potential contribution of the ZEB principle towards achieving smart cities in Europe. In terms of this study, the evolution of building standards towards the ZEB concept will be presented, followed by discussions regarding the provisions of a SET-Plan smart city and the ZEB definition. Additionally, past studies discussing on the role of zero energy buildings in smart energy regions will also be reviewed. The conclusions of the analysis on the potential of ZEBs in SET-Plan smart cities will provide some useful insight towards the actions required in the building assessment methodologies’ developments, in order to achieve the envisioned smart cities in Europe.}

abstract = {Smart cities are built upon information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enable a broad range of advanced services. Through a comprehensive literature review, this study identified four pitfalls brought by the pervasive application of ICT, including information insecurity, privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Therefore, a questionnaire survey together with 27 interviews was conducted in Hong Kong to investigate how the public perceived these pitfalls within the context of mobile apps providing real-time parking information which form a major part of smart mobility. System insecurity and privacy leakage were found to arouse worries among the app-users while their awareness of protecting personal data was found to have room for improvement. Islands of real-time parking information occur as a result of the lack of collaboration among private carpark operators. Digital divide existed widely among the disadvantaged groups and the problem cannot be solved by mere provision of ICT facilities. Overall, technologies alone cannot make a city smart or smarter. It is the suitable way in which ICTs are used to serve all citizens that matters.}

In response, a rapidly growing social-scientific literature is critically exploring how the smart city imaginary (SCI) promotes ötechno-utopian’ fantasies, ignoring the risks of a technologically determined future. In this paper we begin by considering SCI as emblematic of the colonization of contemporary (urban) futures by vested interests, arguing for the need for diverse and plural imaginaries and thus for a re-engagement of the social sciences. We explore how critical social scientific contributions to shaping futures might be deepened through further engagement with utopian theory and speculative fiction, two traditions of future-orientated thinking that seek to combine critique with constructive thinking about alternatives. We therefore contribute to ö50 + 50 Theme 2: Framing Futures in 2068-the limits of and opportunities for futures research’ by 1) extending critique of contemporary claims about (smart urban) futures, and; 2) exploring how utopianism and fiction can expand ways of thinking, imagining and knowing futures.}

The genesis of smart cities has evolved from the need of sustainable development and a better future for humankind. The efficacy of the smart city paradigm in the remediation of environmental issues, specifically waste management, has emerged as a potential topic of research. The shortcomings and issues associated with the current urban waste management practices can be suitably dealt through the integration of tools such as the ‘internet of things’ (IoT), ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI), ‘cloud computing’, and ‘intelligent transportation systems’ with the existing waste management system and infrastructure for waste collection, segregation, transportation, treatment, and final disposal. The application of automation through cyber-physical systems can effectively turn waste management practices smart in the smart city paradigm. In this context, the chapter provides insights into the current trends of the applicability of IoT techniques, including radio-frequency identification (RFID) techniques, sensors and actuators, embedded systems, and wireless mobile communication technologies for effective waste segregation, real-time collection, optimal transportation, and future perspectives considering product lifecycle for the reduction in waste generation and increasing waste recycling for achieving circular economy in the smart cities.}

Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of ‘sense’, ‘seize’, ‘align’, and ‘transform’ functions. Our case study focuses on the ‘sense’ and ‘seize’ steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights. Our approach has the potential to assist policy makers in designing a comprehensive strategy toward the goal of the smart city.}

However, many public administrations still struggle with such innovations due to complex technologies, high investments, and the numerous stakeholders involved. To address this issue, some local governments in continental Europe have turned to collaborative innovation approaches, partnering with (semi-)public utility companies in the hope that their additional innovation assets will boost innovativeness. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how exactly such collaborations should be governed to ensure that the focus remains on creating public value, as utility companies may have their own agendas. To explore this question, we conducted a comparative case study in the context of smart city initiatives with four cases in Swiss local governments. Drawing on agency and stewardship theory, we then propose a model of public-value-focused collaborative innovation, enabling us to explore various collaboration characteristics and their effects on public value creation. Our findings suggest that both agency- and stewardship-based collaborations increase innovativeness. However, while agency collaborations tend to produce smart city innovations that mainly serve the utility companies' business interests, stewardship relationships lead to innovations that are focused more on public value creation. As such, our study extends the literature on the effects of collaborative innovation on public value, and it provides practical recommendations on how such collaborative innovation should be designed.}

In smart city, people can interact directly with the community and the infrastructure at anytime and anywhere, where GLObal MObility NETwork (GLOMONET) is an important network infrastructure for smart city. Recently, Gope and Hwang proposed an efficient authentication scheme for GLOMONET. However, we find their scheme lacks session key update and wrong password detection mechanisms, and vulnerable to denial-of-service attack. Besides, the session key can be known by HA (home agent), and perfect forward secrecy cannot be ensured. Furthermore, in their scheme, HA has to take heavy secret key management work. Based on previous work, this paper first summarizes the security and function requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment. Later, this paper proposed a robust biometrics based three-factor authentication scheme for GLOMONET in smart city. Security features of the proposed scheme are analyzed in detail, and comparisons of our scheme with other related schemes are illustrated. Analysis and comparison results show that our scheme meets the preconcerted security requirements of authentication for GLOMONET in smart city environment, and it is robust for GLOMONET in smart city environments with higher security requirements.}

In this paper, a multi-view ensemble threat hunting model based on Sparse Representation based Classifier (SRC) is proposed to use in IoT systems that are finding domain space in the advent of Smart Cities. An ensemble of SRCs is considered where every individual SRC classifies malware by Opcode, Bytecode and system call views of several standard IoT and Ransomware datasets. The final decision is made through weighted majority voting. SRC is employed to alleviate the complexity of the base classifiers. Experimental results verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed model in different balanced and imbalanced environments. The proposed model outperforms all base classifiers and several well-known works in current literature.}

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system.}

Therefore, this article presents a four-stage model in which the scheduling of smart buildings, microgrids and the main grid is done. In the first stage of this model, subscribers of smart buildings do their day-ahead scheduling with the aim of minimizing their electricity bill and send it to the central control unit of the building. In the second stage, the central control unit of the smart building performs its day-ahead scheduling according to the received programs and sends it to the microgrid operator. Then, in the third stage, the microgrid's strategy for participating in the day-ahead market is designed, considering the programs received from smart buildings. Finally, in the fourth stage, the market manager receives buy / sell offers of microgrids and calculates the market settlement price (MSP) with the aim of maximizing the social welfare (SW) index. The simulation results illustrate that equipping smart buildings with solar panels and energy storage systems (ESSs) not only reduces the MSP during peak hour by 6.66%, but also improves the network voltage profile. In addition, the results reflect that changing the behavior of smart subscribers and electric vehicles (EVs) by the incentive programs leads to a significant improvement of the technical and economic indicators of the network.}

We note that the existing works on analyzing the secrecy performance of WP-BackComs have largely ignored the spatial randomness of nodes that is used to model a large-scale network. To fill this gap, this paper evaluates the secrecy outage probability of the large-scale WP-BackComs based on a tractable framework of stochastic geometry (SG). In particular, the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at each gateway (GW) and eavesdropper (Eve), and the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and energy-causality constraint at each backscatter user (BU) are considered. The energy outage probability and secrecy outage probability expressions are derived in the general case at first, then the closed-form expressions are obtained under the special scenario, i.e., the no-noise and the typical propagation loss scenario. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and examine the impacts of various parameters on the secrecy performance. In particular, there exists an optimal reflection coefficient for secrecy outage probability minimization under certain conditions, and the optimal reflection coefficient increases with the increasing SIC coefficient at GW.}

This paper conducts a scientometric review of the progressively synthesized network derived from 7840 bibliographic records from a topic search on SC in the period 1990–2019. Using CiteSpace, co-occurrence analysis of categories is conducted to explore the evolution of the disciplines engaged in SC research; co-word analysis of the keywords and document co-citation analysis associated with cluster analysis are further performed to reveal the development paths and research topics in terms of burst terms, text and citation-based clusters, citation structure, and pivotal points in the field. These scientometric techniques are combined to: (1) reveal the intellectual division of this developing field using a visual and comprehensive approach, (2) identify in chronological order the 10 core research sub-topics in this area with burst references and terms, (3) identify Internet of Things, big data, and fog computing as the most promising technologies for SC planning and development, and (4) conclude that smart sustainable cities and sustainable smart cities are the two emerging trends in the domain.

On the basis of these cases, we highlight three characteristics that emerge when smart city policies are made mobile: glossiness, fragmentation and randomness.

This evolution requires real reflection and actions to attain sustainable development and a better quality of life in the city. The concept of smart city emerges as a strategic innovation to limit the issues arisen by the growth of the urban population and meet urban challenges. Smart city as a multi-stakeholder ecosystem upholds the value co-creation process of related actors within a framework to provide and deliver the expected service. Unlike the analogue era, ICT as the new technology enabler in smart city creates a transition of collaboration form among stakeholders. This paper presents an academic development of multi-stakeholder co-creation analysis in smart city management based on the perspective of service science. The analysis proposes a representative model of stakeholders with the designated values, service flow, and expected final result from the conceptual service platform. The model aims to depict in depth contribution of stakeholders which also leads to an innovation of service platform creation. This approach is carried out within the experience obtained from Bandung as one of the running smart city project in Indonesia. Bandung, which just occupies the integrated stage of the smart city maturity stages, does not allow the harmony of value co-creation. The one-way web-based integration resulted in the limited value creation for the society. This model enables a conceptual direction of becoming a two-ways interaction and creates a more convenient co-creation service ecosystem platform among stakeholders in term of innovation.}

Since they are independent, it is not easy to correlate information from different systems and put it together to work in order to achieve application goals. The collaboration among different systems enables an agent to offer new functionalities (services or just information about the city) that cannot be provided by any of these systems working as individual entities. The goal of this paper is to propose an integration middleware to support the management of Smart Cities in a dynamic, transparent and scalable way. The proposed middleware intends to support interoperability among different systems operating in a city.}

abstract = {Investments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are beginning to take place in the context of smart city initiatives in many cities. Energy efficiency and emissions reduction are becoming essential rationales for such investments. It is important, therefore, to understand under what conditions investments in ITS in the context of smart cities produce energy savings. We reviewed existing literature, conducted case studies and interviews, and found that the smart cities context has transformed traditional ITS into “smart mobility” with three major characteristics: people-centric, data-driven, and powered by bottom-up innovations. We argue that there are four main steps for smart mobility solutions to achieve energy savings and that several institutional, technical, and physical conditions are required at each step. Energy savings are achieved when users change their behavior and result in less travel, modal shift, and reduction of per-km energy consumption in the short term. Smart mobility solutions also enable other energy saving policies or initiatives, which would otherwise not be feasible. In the long term, users’ lifestyles could change and lead to further energy savings. For cities in developing countries with lower motorization, less-developed infrastructure, less financial resources, and less institutional and technical capacity, our recommendations to achieve benefits from smart mobility investments are: (1) involve all public and private players in a collaborative and transparent setting; (2) develop the technical capacity to procure and monitor information services; and (3) focus on basic infrastructure, including a coherent road network and basic traffic management measures.}

Yet, the translation of those visions into actual urban implementations often fails to place the citizen experience at the forefront for the sake of the efficiency and optimization of urban processes and systems. Looking at the future as a design opportunity, this paper offers an alternative perspective to the technocentric and universalist approach on smart cities through a design-driven and human-centric approach. The article draws on a research initiative focused on mid-sized European cities, attempting to bridge the gap between strategic visions and innovative interventions towards a socio-technological hybridization of the city. Selected projects from this initiative present urban scenarios of adaptive street environments, responsive urban safety, and dynamic retail spaces developed through smart city tactics. Resulting from an inductive approach, a threefold design research model is then outlined: (1) grounded vision, addressing the ideation of alternative futures that stem from specific needs or local opportunities; (2) embraced technology, elaborating on the role played by urban technologies in augmenting the inner intelligence of places; and (3) urban co-evolution, fostering a mutually-constructive interaction between the urban players (citizens, researchers and designers, and stakeholders) for collaborative innovation. This framework may ultimately be employed in smart city projects to reveal latent future scenarios and eventually support the design of an environment and infrastructure where various parties can experiment, develop and test ideas, services and technologies in participatory ‘living labs’.}

However, the increasing population, industrialism, urbanization, etc., also affect the ecological balance. Clean and pollution-free environment is the fundamental right protected under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution of India, that is, right to live. Thus, India requires adopting the legal provisions regarding sustainability and prevention measures for the improvement of environment. In this regard, green policing policy is effective to achieve this purpose. In general, the main role of police administration toward the society is to maintain the law and order, to maintain the discipline, prediction and prevention of crime, investigation and detection of crime, and production of investigation report and criminal before the Court of law. Therefore, Green Police shall be efficacious in preserving the green justice, law, and order. In addition, blockchain technology which is an emerging transformational technology has proven effective in internet security system. Decentralized mechanism with perpetual distributed digital ledger and enhancing network security system, blockchain technology has emerged as a new hope of constructing of smart cities. Blockchain technology avoids the third-party involvement in transaction of data, thus it ameliorates the Internet of Things (IoT) system by creating safe intercommunication between man and device. Moreover, blockchain technology with amalgamation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) system is upraised as a new dimension of smart society.

One of the industries with the fastest growth rates worldwide, and notably in Thailand, is medical tourism. With connections to Cambodia and Laos, Ubon Ratchathani is located in lower northeastern Thailand, close to Vietnam and Myanmar. Therefore, there is a significant chance that this region will welcome medical travelers. High-quality medical facilities are available in Ubon Ratchathani to fulfill the needs of medical tourists. A visitor’s decision to travel to Ubon Ratchathani for medical treatment is influenced by factors other than the high-level medical facilities, such as lodging, accessibility to public transportation, and tourist attractions. The public transportation services in Ubon Ratchathani, especially the public bus system, are poorly designed and may let down visitors. The purpose of this study is to develop a smart public bus route design that will meet tourists’ demands. The concept of open innovation will be utilized to develop the model. We surveyed 400 visitors to Ubon Ratchathani. The tourists’ opinions and views of public transportation will be made public and used as an input parameter when designing bus routes. The bus route can then be constructed using the differential evolution algorithm (DE). A web-based smart public transportation system was built. In order to construct an efficient smart public bus system (SPBS), open innovation was used in the development phase. According to the computational results, the new routes using DE lead to a 5.97% reduction in travel distance when compared to the output of the more well-known genetic method. More than 98.5% of visitors are satisfied with the new routes, and once they start running, 99.5% of all respondents plan to use public transit.}

First, we model privacy concerns in a smart city as the problem of privacy-preserving collaborative filtering recommendation. Then, we introduce k-coRating to address privacy concerns in published rating matrices, by filling the null ratings with predicted scores. This allows us to mask the original ratings to preserve k-anonymity-like data privacy, and enhance data utility (quantified using prediction accuracy in this paper). We show that the optimal k-coRated mapping is an NP-hard problem and design an efficient greedy algorithm to achieve k-coRating. We then demonstrate the utility of our approach empirically.}

MOMPA is validated on several benchmarks and compared with many CI algorithms. The results of the Friedman Ranked Mean test indicate the proposed algorithm can find the shortest collision-free path in almost all test cases. In addition, the proposed algorithm reaches an almost %100 success ratio for solving all test cases without constraint violation of the regarded problem. After the validation experiment, the proposed algorithm is applied to smart medical emergency handling in Egypt's New Galala mountainous city. Both experimental and statistical results ensure the prosperity of the proposed algorithm. Also, it ensures that MOMPA can efficiently find the shortest path to the emergency location without any collisions.}

In this paper, we propose iSapiens, an IoT-based platform for the development of general cyber–physical systems suitable for the design and implementation of smart city services and applications. As distinguishing features, the iSapiens platform implements the edge computing paradigm through both the exploitation of the agent metaphor and a distributed network of computing nodes directly scattered in the urban environment. The platform promotes the dynamic deployment of new computing nodes as well as software agents for addressing geographical and functional extensibility. iSapiens provides a set of abstractions suitable to hide the heterogeneity of the physical sensing/actuator devices embedded in the system, and to support the development of complex applications. The paper also furnishes a set of methodological guidelines exploitable for the design and implementation of smart city applications by properly using iSapiens. As a significant case study, the design and implementation of a real Smart Street in the city of Cosenza (Italy) are shown, which provides decentralized urban intelligence services to citizens.}

Second, we compute the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a decentralized regime in which spending on the ICTs is financed by a uniform tax on the city residents. Third, we ascertain the optimal level of ICT provision in the two cities in a centralized regime subject to equal provision of ICTs and cost sharing. Fourth, we show that if the two cities have the same preference for ICTs then centralization is preferable to decentralization as long as there is a spillover from the provision of ICTs.

In this manuscript, we propose a clustering based scheme for the detection of small target pedestrians to address above difficulties. Clustering detection yields object cluster regions and gives an estimation of the object scales for these regions, so the clustered region is consistent with the input size of the fine detection model. Then, the detection results of small target pedestrians in the clustered region are obtained and restored to the input image to achieve the final detection results. Our detection strategy has several advantages over previous solutions. It saves a lot of computational power and running time which is vital for self-driving cars. Furthermore, the detection model is replaceable, making our scheme an easy solution to more complex tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme on both YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN as their detection performance can be greatly improved.}

In this paper, the potential for smart city policies to help make significant energy (and related greenhouse gas) savings in urban transport and building construction and operation is investigated. The main findings are that although significant potential exists, it will not be realised unless supporting policies are in place.

The key feature that distinguishes the FC paradigm for smart cities is that it spreads communication and computing resources over the wired/wireless access network (e.g., proximate access points and base stations) to provide resource augmentation (e.g., cyberforaging) for resource- and energy-limited wired/wireless (possibly mobile) things. Motivated by these considerations, this paper presents a Fog-supported smart city network architecture called Fog Computing Architecture Network (FOCAN), a multi-tier structure in which the applications are running on things thatjointly compute, route, and communicate with one another through the smart city environment. FOCAN decreases latency and improves energy provisioning and the efficiency of services among things with different capabilities. In particular, three types of communications are defined between FOCAN devices – interprimary, primary, and secondary communication –to manage applications in a way that meets the quality of service standards for the Internet of Everything. One of the main advantages of the proposed architecture is that the devices can provide the services with low energy usage and in an efficient manner. Simulation results for a selected case study demonstrate the tremendous impact of the FOCAN energy-efficient solution on the communication performance of various types of things in smart cities.}

Information and Communications Technology are called on to be one of the key players to get these cities to use smart devices and sensors (Internet of Things) to know at every moment what is happening within the city, in order to make decisions that will improve the management of resources. The proliferation of these “smart things” is producing significant deployment of networks in the city context. Most of these devices are proprietary solutions, which do not offer free access to the data they provide. Therefore, this prevents the interoperability and compatibility of these solutions in the current smart city developments. This paper presents how to embed an open sensorized platform for both hardware and software in the context of a smart city, more specifically in a university campus. For this integration, GIScience comes into play, where it offers different open standards that allow full control over “smart things” as an agile and interoperable way to achieve this.

One indispensable basis in the research, development and implementation of smart cities is urban sensing technology. Automotive sensing is a novel urban sensing technology that equips sensors to vehicles, like buses, taxi cabs or garbage trucks and utilizes their mobility to help to conduct urban sensing tasks. In this paper, we present Cruisers, an automotive sensing platform for smart cities, based on the following ideas: a) Garbage collecting trucks are used to host sensors, b) Cellular communication network is used to deliver sensed data to servers, and c) Proxy server(s) are adopted to convert the format of sensed data to required ones, such as sampling rate, spatial interval or pub/sub protocol. To validate the feasibility of Cruisers, we implement a real system that consists of 66 customized sensing modulars integrating typical environmental and mobility sensors and deploy them into the garbage collecting trucks at Fujisawa, a medium-sized city in Japan. Performance evaluation is conducted to investigate the performance of Cruisers in terms of scalability, data publishing delay and spatial coverage.}

abstract = {The vision of smart cities has emerged from the integration of advances in information technologies to a city’s infrastructures and assets. The use of information will improve the daily operations, and lead to greener, safer, and more human friendly cities. The most preeminent city asset is the electrical power grid, upon which the modernization of human life is built. However, integration of power grid with information technologies, known as smart grid, comes at a cost of reduced privacy. Electricity consumer behavior expressed via daily consumption patterns may be visible to third parties, which can make critical inferences over the consumers’ personal life. In this paper, a new method is proposed that aims at enhancing consumer privacy in smart cities by proposing an intelligent aggregation of anticipated demand patterns of multiple consumers as a mean to hide individual features. To that end, the method utilizes consumers self-elasticities matrices and a genetic algorithm to create an aggregated pattern that masks individual consumption data. The proposed method is tested on real world electricity demand patterns, and morphing performance is recorded with respect to symmetric mean average percentage error (SMAPE) attaining morphing over 60% in all tested cases.}

abstract = {With the expansion of urbanization, energy becomes one of the foremost requirements of a smart city. Low energy consumption, renewable energy, and carbon footprints reduction are prime targets of a smart city. A smart city needs to be energy efficient and technology driven. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) helps to improve system efficiency and creates a way for the end consumer to communicate with utilities and the network service provider. The two-way communication model of a smart grid makes possible reliable, stable and efficient communication between utility and consumer by using ICT. The major issue in smart energy system is the lack of necessary interoperability and integration of communication standards, which hampers the effective deployment of communication networks. In this paper, we present a hierarchical architecture to resolve this issue, which will support smart energy system infrastructure and services in smart cities for provisioning of ubiquitous communication. It consists of two computing zones (fog computing and cloud computing) along with two implementation phases (initial and final). Fog computing will help to offer low latency response to anomalous and hazardous events in real time while reducing a burden on the cloud for computing as well as storage. To provide ubiquitous communication in smart energy system for data acquisition, a network selection algorithm has been proposed. TOPSIS MADM technique is employed for network selection in a heterogeneous environment at HAN/NAN (Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, WLAN, LoRaWAN) and WAN (GPRS, UMTS, LTE, and WiMAX) levels of smart energy system's multilayer communication infrastructure. Coverage area, data rate, power consumption and security level attributes are employed for network selection. The results revealed that WLAN performed better in case of HAN/NAN environment, whereas LTE worked best at WAN level.}

Each IoT device that is producing data may sense a sensitive one that should not be disclosed unintentionally. Due to the existence of a large number of devices in the near future, the possibility of information leakage, privacy breach, is increasing. To prevent this, each device applies a privacy-preserving method. We discover that all of the existing solutions have three major drawbacks: (1) applying one static privacy-preserving method for the entire system, (2) sending whole data at once, and (3) not context-aware. These cause unacceptable privacy-preserving degree. To address them, in this paper, at first, we equip IoT-based smart city with Software Defined Networking paradigm (SDN). Then, we mount an efficient privacy-preserving method on top of it that manages flowing data packets of split IoT device’ data. We have done extensive simulation through MININET-WIFI to show the effectiveness of our approach. Evaluation results show that our method can be widely applied to the smart city application with a superior performance regarding accuracy, overhead, and penetration rate compared to existing privacy-preserving solutions.}

Smart congestion management allows road users to avoid congested areas, decreasing pollutant concentration. Accurately predicting congestion propagation is difficult however, due to the dynamic non-linear behavior of traffic flow. With the rise of Internet of Things devices, there are now data sets available that can be used to provide smart, sustainable transport solutions within cities. In this work, we introduce long short-term memory networks for the prediction of congestion propagation across a road network. Based on vehicle speed data from traffic sensors at two sites, our model predicts the propagation of congestion across a 5-min period within a busy town. Analysis of both univariate and multivariate predictive models show an accuracy of 84–95% depending on the road layout. This accuracy shows that long short-term memory networks are suitable for predicting congestion propagation on road networks and may form a key component of future traffic modelling approaches for smart and sustainable cities around the world.}

The research used a set of 3150 data points regarding the performance of these cities. It analyzed the performance of the 150 best cities, divided into three groups of interest identified as small cities, medium-sized cities and big cities, on a set of 21 indicators. The set of identified indicators shows the attention of the cities to socioeconomic and information and communication technologies issues, thus revealing that Brazilian city managers are more interested in positioning their cities as smart than sustainable. Analysis of the general indicators of the cities, supported by the number of inhabitants, indicated that big cities present superior performance in relation to medium-sized cities, and that the latter perform better in relation to the small cities. However, small cities in the individualized analysis of social indicators present a better-performing set.}

The reason to select that data is air pollution rates are often associated with traffic congestion, and there is intensive research that exists to forecast air pollution by road traffic. To the best of our knowledge, any effort to enhance road traffic prediction through air quality and ensemble regression model techniques is not yet been proposed. In this research, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we have performed a comparative analysis of 7 different regression models to find out which model gives better accuracy. Secondly, we propose a framework using regression models in which the first regression model's result is boosted using boosting ensemble method and is passed to the next regression model which shows that the proposed framework gives more satisfying results than the above 7 regression models. The experimental findings show the effectiveness of the proposed framework which decreases the error rate by 2.47 %.}

The sensors or mobile objects in ITS constantly generate mobility data and the scale at which this data is generated is witnessing an exponential increase in volumes. To store and subsequently analyze such massive data generated by sensors, new architectures are needed which are primarily designed for working with big data. In this work, we propose a big data analytics architecture for ITS.

Proposed smart traffic light solutions based on Wireless Sensor Network and Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork are either unreliable and inflexible or complex and costly. Furthermore, the handling of special vehicles such as emergency is still not viable, especially during busy hours. Inspired by the emergence of distributed smart cameras, we present a novel fuzzy logic approach to traffic control at intersections. Our approach uses smart cameras at intersections along with image understanding for real-time traffic monitoring and assessment. Besides understanding the traffic flow, the cameras can detect and track special vehicles and help prioritize emergency cases. Traffic violations can be identified as well and traffic statistics collected. In this paper, we introduce a flexible, adaptive and phase-free distributed traffic-control algorithm that uses the information provided by distributed smart cameras to efficiently control traffic signals. Experimental results show that our collision-free approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of the average user’s waiting time in the queue and improves the routing of emergency vehicles in a cross congestion area.}

On the basis of access cloud, the distributed micro-cloud system of Smart City is deployed to migrate the service capabilities of the remote core cloud server to the local area. Users can obtain high-quality low-latency application services from the micro-cloud server in the local area. A resource description model based on resource graph and hierarchical resource vector is established, which enriches the Smart City service mode of IaaS cloud platform and provides a structural basis for optimal scheduling of cluster resources. A multi-node system resource graph scheduling and allocation algorithm VCE-PSO based on particle swarm optimization is proposed to optimize the response speed and resource efficiency of multi-node collaborative scheduling. The example shows that the above key technologies significantly improve 5G. The scheduling optimization and utilization efficiency of various resources in the hierarchical distributed cloud service for the Smart City effectively reduces the response time of the tenant resource request and optimizes the performance of system resource scheduling on the cloud platform.}

Initially, a Smart Drone is designed to monitor 9 different pollutants present in the air in a Metropolitan City. Air quality parameters are monitored using drones in and around solid waste dump yards. Real-time data for training is used for the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) network model development. The network model estimates the concentration of different contaminants in the air based on the training, delivering information about air quality in various places. The model yielded average RMSE values of 1.63, 1.35, and 1.47 for solid waste dumpsites, residential areas, and industrial areas. Similarly, the average MAE of the proposed model for waste disposal sites is 0.25, 0.89 for the industrial sector, and 0.75 for the residential area.

abstract = {In smart cities, region-based prediction (e.g. traffic flow and electricity flow) is of great importance to city management and public safety, and it remains a daunting challenge that involves complicated spatial-temporal-related factors such as weather, holidays, events, etc. Region-based forecasting aims to predict the future situation for regions in a city based on historical data. In the existing literature, the state-of-the-art method solve region-based problems with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms that extract the temporal view and local convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms that extract the spatial view (local spatial correlation via local CNN). In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method for region-based prediction for smart cities. First, we divide the cities into regions based on the space dimension and model the situation of the cities in 3D volumes. Based on the constructed 3D volumes, we design a model called multiple local 3D CNN spatial-temporal residual networks (LMST3D-ResNet) for region-based prediction in smart cities. LMST3D-ResNet can extract multiple temporal dependencies (including trend, period and closeness) for local regions and then predict the future citywide activities according to the learned multiple spatial-temporal features. LMST3D-ResNet can also combine the spatial-temporal features with external factors. LMST3D-ResNet includes 3D CNNs and ResNet mechanisms for processing spatial-temporal information. In particular, 3D CNNs have the ability to model 3-dimensional information due to 3D convolution and 3D pooling operations, while ResNet enables the connection of the convolutional neural network across layers to obtain a deeper network structure. Specifically, in our proposed model, a novel region-based information extraction mechanism and an end-to-end multiple spatial-temporal dependency learning structure are designed for local regions. Extensive experimental results on two datasets, i.e., MLElectricity and BJTaxi demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the exisiting state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Energy efficiency of public sector is an important issue in the context of smart cities due to the fact that buildings are the largest energy consumers, especially public buildings such as educational, health, government and other public institutions that have a large usage frequency. However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment.}

Application and quality based information exchange are autonomous with hand-held devices participating in communication or requesting services. Controlling resource management in such environment is tedious due to their distributed, asynchronous, and mobility features. An agent-based middleware framework (AMF) using distributed Cyber Physical System (CPS) is proposed in this manuscript for improving communication reliability in smart city environment. Agent-technology with linear computation model evades the data source downtime issues. The agents are autonomous and are independent of each other in providing seamless resource sharing and response scheduling irrespective of the request queries and communication time. This framework jointly addresses the request failure and response time problem by balancing the storage and resource utilization in an optimal manner. The linear computation model classifies the overloaded agents to assign non-overlapping resources and thereby improving the response for the processed query. The performance of the proposed framework is analyzed using resource and storage utilization, response and downtime for varying query requests and time.}

abstract = {Over the past few years the concept of Smart cities has emerged to transform urban areas into connected and well informed spaces. Services that make smart cities “smart” are curated by using data streams of smart cities i.e., inhabitants’ location information, digital engagement, transportation, environment and local government data. Accumulating and processing of these data streams raise security and privacy concerns at individual and community levels. Sizeable attempts have been made to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants’ data. However, the security and privacy issues of smart cities are not only confined to inhabitants; service providers and local governments have their own reservations — service provider trust, reliability of the sensed data, and data ownership, to name a few. In this research we identified a comprehensive list of stakeholders and modelled their involvement in smart cities by using the Onion Model approach. Based on the model we present a security and privacy-aware framework for service provisioning in smart cities, namely the ‘Smart Secure Service Provisioning’ (SSServProv) Framework. Unlike previous attempts, our framework provides end-to-end security and privacy features for trustable data acquisition, transmission, processing and legitimate service provisioning. The proposed framework ensures inhabitants’ privacy, and also guarantees integrity of services. It also ensures that public data is never misused by malicious service providers. To demonstrate the efficacy of SSServProv we developed and tested core functionalities of authentication, authorisation and lightweight secure communication protocol for data acquisition and service provisioning. For various smart cities service provisioning scenarios we verified these protocols by an automated security verification tool called Scyther.}

The IoT-supported devices capacitate, embedded with sensors, enabled numerous context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. There are some activity recognition applications; however, they are still deficient in recognizing activities accurately. In this paper, a novel framework for human activity recognition (HAR) is proposed using raw readings from a combination of fused smartphone sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and Google Fit activity tracking module. The proposed framework applies deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to an extensive training dataset. The latter consists of five activity classes from 12 individuals using a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN). An extensive training dataset is used consisting of five activity classes from a group of 12 individuals. The designed android application (runs in the background) collects data from the smartphone's embedded sensors fused with the Google Fit API to validate the results proposed framework. The proposed framework shows promising results in recognizing human activities compared to other similar studies and achieves an accuracy of 99.43% for activity recognition using DRNN.}

abstract = {The success of smart city projects is intrinsically related to the existence of large volumes of data that could be processed to achieve their objectives. For this purpose, the plethora of data stored by public administrations becomes an incredibly rich source of insight and information due to its volume and diversity. However, it was only with the Open Government Movement when governments have been concerned with the need to open their data to citizens and businesses. Thus, with the emergence of open data portals, these myriad of data enables the development of new business models. The achievement of the benefits sought by making this data available triggers new challenges to cope with the diversity of sources involved. The business potential could be jeopardized by the scarcity of relevant data in the different blocks and domains that makes a city and by the lack of a common approach to data publication, in terms of format, content, etc. This paper introduces a holistic approach that relies on the Smart City Ontology as the cornerstone to standardise and structure data. This approach, which is proposed to be an analytical tool to assess the potential of data in a given smart city, analyses three main aspects: availability of data, the criteria that data should fulfil to be considered eligible and the model used to structure and organise data. The approach has been applied to the case of Brussels Capital Region, which first results are presented and discussed in this paper. The main conclusion that has been obtained is that, besides its commitment with open data and smart cities, Brussels is not mature enough to fully exploit the real intelligence that smart cities could provide. This maturity would be achieved in the following years with the implementation of the new Brussels’ Smart City Strategy.}

These include a wide range of impacts such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and increased and more intense storms. Even if stringent climate policies and actions lead to low- and zero-carbon societies, climate change impacts will continue to affect humans and economies for decades to come, due to historical emissions. Recognizing this, climate change adaptation is now increasingly promoted on part with climate change mitigation. Through text mining of bibliometric data archived in the Web of Science, this chapter seeks to provide an overview of existing research at the intersection of climate change adaptation and smart technologies. This way, it aims to discuss actual and potential contributions of smart city solutions, related to various urban systems and to climate change adaptation. Based on outputs of bibliometric analysis (term co-occurrence) obtained from the VOSviewer software tool, issues related to urban planning, buildings, transportation, waste management, energy and water resource, economy, urban infrastructure, and urban governance are discussed. It is argued that smart solutions and technologies have high potential to contribute to climate change adaptation and resilience. Use of smart technologies might, however, lead to some potential trade-offs and rebound effects. Such trade-offs and effects have also been discussed. Further, the need for integrated systems that accommodate different urban sectors is highlighted.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to transform communities around the globe into smart cities. The massive deployment of sensor-embedded devices in the smart cities generates voluminous amounts of data that need to be stored and processed in an efficient manner. Long-haul data transmission to the remote cloud data centers leads to higher delay and bandwidth consumption. In smart cities, the delay-sensitive applications have stringent requirements in term of response time. To reduce latency and bandwidth consumption, edge computing plays a pivotal role. The resource-constrained smart devices at the network core need to offload computationally complex tasks to the edge devices located in their vicinity and have relatively higher resources. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end encryption framework, SmartEdge, for a smart city application by executing computationally complex tasks at the network edge and cloud data centers. Using a lightweight symmetric encryption technique, we establish a secure connection among the smart core devices for multimedia streaming towards the registered and verified edge devices. Upon receiving the data, the edge devices encrypts the multimedia streams, encodes them, and broadcast to the cloud data centers. Prior to the broadcasting, each edge device establishes a secured connection with a data center that relies on the combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques. In SmartEdge, the execution of a lightweight encryption technique at the resource-constrained smart devices, and relatively complex encryption techniques at the network edge and cloud data centers reduce the resource utilization of the entire network. The proposed framework reduces the response time, security overhead, computational and communication costs, and has a lower end-to-end encryption delay for participating entities. Moreover, the proposed scheme is highly resilient against various adversarial attacks.}

Such cities will be able to utilize a huge number of heterogeneous IoT devices that can generate a sheer volume of data. So, considering this heterogeneity, one of the major challenges in smart cities is how to process this data and identify different situations for decision-makers on the basis of this data. The traditional cloud computing approach can provide enormous computing and storage facilities to support data processing. However, it requires all the data to be moved to the cloud from the edge devices of the user endpoint, thus introducing a high latency. In this paper, we used the edge computing approach to minimize such latency. Besides, as major portion of data is generated from the user endpoint, processing this data in the edge can significantly improve the performance. Our experiment shows that processing raw IoT data at the edge devices is effective in terms of latency and provides situational awareness for the decision makers of smart city in a seamless fashion.}

This article envisions a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) solution that enables node collaboration among IoT devices to provide reliable and secure communication between devices and the fog layer on one hand, and the fog layer and the cloud layer on the other hand. The solution assumes that collaboration is determined based on nodes’ resource capabilities and cooperation willingness. Resource capabilities are defined using ontologies, while willingness to cooperate is described using a three-factor node criteria, namely: nature, attitude and awareness. A learning method is adopted to identify candidates for the service composition and delivery process. We show that the system does not require extensive training for services to be delivered correct and accurate. The proposed solution reduces the amount of unnecessary traffic flow to and from the edge, by relying on node-to-node communication protocols. Communication to the fog and cloud layers is used for more data and computing-extensive applications, hence, ensuring secure communication protocols to the cloud. Preliminary simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of adapting the proposed framework to achieve smart city sustainability through service reliability and security. Results show that the proposed solution outperforms other semi-cooperative and non-cooperative service composition techniques in terms of efficient service delivery and composition delay, service hit ratio, and suspicious node identification.}

To achieve green IoT implementation, it is important to take necessary measures to prevent energy depletion and promote energy efficiency techniques. Clustering can extend the lifetime of such networks and its efficiency depends on the selection of quality clustering schemes. To balance the energy consumption for maximizing the network lifetime, this paper proposes an Improved-Adaptive Ranking based Energy-efficient Opportunistic Routing protocol (I-AREOR), based on regional density, relative distance, and residual energy. Importantly, the first node death (FND), half node death (HND), and last node death (LND) are the major challenges for improving the energy efficiency. Therefore, the proposed approach provides a solution to extend the time of FND by considering the regional density, relative distance, and residual energy of the sensor nodes. I-AREOR protocol considers the energy parameters based on dynamic threshold for each round. The demonstrated results show that the I-AREOR clustering technique shows more efficiency in maximizing the network lifetime as compared to the existing algorithms.}

However, in smart cities, as the ones envisioned in many on-going research projects, energy should also be used in a smart way, that is reducing the energy degradation in terms ofcapacity to generate useful work. Starting from the literature, the paper proposes an analysis method, based on exergy, to support smart city planning, with the aim to provide the decision maker with a useful tool to compare and understand the energy-smartness of different scenarios, and to address future energy urban policies. Possibilities and limitations of the analysis method are discussed via the application to the city of Milano that committed to become a smart city.}

The urban territory is responsible for a high percentage of natural resources consumption and waste generation, and therefore resource efficiency is critical to promote local and global sustainability. The characteristics of urban morphology and the growing trend toward urban transformation give cities enormous leverage in this respect. A Smart City could be an answer for improving energy efficiency, human living and environment, economy and governance. There already exist various initiatives proposing different framework approaches for Smart City concept, although some key fields are common in each approach. In this paper a review of some initiatives regarding Smart City approach is presented in order to have a more accurate image of this complex concept. In the second part, a recently approved research project “SusCity” project takes an integrated and application-oriented research approach by focusing on urban interventions in Lisbon city. The project approach will be explained together with the first work set up.}

Despite such shortcomings, there is a reflective similarity across ecosystems as the various players attempt to converge on a common understanding of the term smart city. The common objective of smart city implementation is to spark economic growth and social development, facilitated by collaborative dialogue and innovations in technology. We integrate theoretical lenses to explore the roles played by ecosystem actors, stakeholders, and socioeconomic and political agents in creating economic value and solving societal problems—particularly highlighting opportunities and challenges to bottom-up innovation from local entrepreneurs.}

To accomplish this objective, the present work employs a hybrid Best Worst Method (BWM) – Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach. In this work, various key enablers influencing SSC development are extracted through literature. The BWM technique is utilised to identify their intensity of influence and ISM is used to develop a structural framework for successfully executing the SSC development projects. Several major categories of enablers, such as energy and environmental, infrastructural, strategy and policy oriented, informational and technological, social and personal, and mobility possess strong influence on SSC development agenda. The results reveals that sustainable resources management, development of smart buildings, advanced research and development system, and intelligent transportation are the key enablers of the developed framework. The fuzzy MICMAC analysis further assists in computing the driving power and dependence of the enablers. This research work will be beneficial for policy makers and practitioners in understanding of smart city development and would certainly help to grow nations’ economy by generating higher employment, foreign investments, and developing superior technological advancements.}

The future of cities relies perceivably on ubiquitous sensing, and anytime-anywhere information access and control. However, city leaders are still struggling to identify the quantifiable sources of value that novel ICT can generate. Current Smart City investment is characterized by relatively small demonstrators that often lack the scalability to have real and long lasting impacts on the economy. In this paper we adopt the view of a Smart City as an information marketplace and look at how we might use existing and tested concepts of fostering technology innovation to support city leaders in navigating this unknown territory. In particular we use systems thinking to scope how the concepts of the ‘Living Lab’ and the ‘Innovation District’ can work together in a complementary fashion to create a candidate model for the implementation of the Smart City.}

The underlying cloud workflow systems accumulate large numbers of business process models. How to achieve efficiently querying large process model repositories in smart city cloud workflow systems is challenging. To this end, this paper proposes an improved two-phase retrieval approach for querying large process model repositories in smart city cloud workflow systems. In the filtering stage, the index based on quantitative ordering relation with time and probability constraints (namely ORTP_index) is adopted to greatly reduce the number of candidate models in large process model repositories. In the refining phase, a process behavior similarity computing algorithm based on quantitative ordering relations is proposed to refine the candidate model set. Experiments illustrate that our proposal can significantly improve the query efficiency of large process model repositories in smart city cloud workflow systems based on behavior.}

For example, people can use the phone to check their financial account, store personal data and communicate with peers. Thus it is very important to safeguard the phones from unauthorized access. To complement traditional textual passwords, touch behavioral authentication has attracted much attention while it is still a challenge on how to build a robust scheme in practice. This is because users’ touch actions are often dynamic and hard to model. For this challenge, previous work has proved that touch actions could become consistent when users interact with social networking applications. Motivated by this observation, in this work, we perform a study to investigate users’ touch behavior within Email applications on smartphones (with Email being one of the most important and widely used means in connecting with others). The study results with 60 participants validate the former observation that users’ touch behavioral deviation can be greatly decreased when they play Email applications.}

Former industry-driven cities nowadays increasingly step-up as active agents to drive and support local innovation through co-working areas, accelerators, open data policies and other areas of action. They intrinsically push for sustainable, digital and inclusive innovation that benefits the greater wealth of society. In this research, the links between cities and local innovation ecosystems are investigated. The self-referential and autopoietic capability to Smart City innovation ecosystems distinguishes it from industry-led innovation. It can only be understood with the new theme which digital transformation brings into play. By driving local innovation, cities can support the growth of local companies, solving societal challenges by referring back to market dynamics.}

In this paper, a new methodological approach is presented to evaluate to what extent the smart cities’ development pursues sustainable development goals. This methodology is called Smartainability. The Smartainability approach allows to estimate, with qualitative and quantitative indicators, how far smart cities are more sustainable (and smart) in environmental, economical, energetic and social fields,thanks to innovative technologies. Moreover, this estimate can be performed before the technologiesdeployment. The methodology has been tested on the case study of the Expo Milano 2015 site. The implementation on the Expo Milano 2015 site, demonstrates that Smartainability methodology is able to give decision makers useful information on benefits generated by smart solutions deployment. This aspect is due to three relevant issues: benefits are expressed with quantitative indicators; indicators are estimated before technologies or solutions implementation; benefits are connected to technologies or solutions deployment.}

The research included a field-based study in Hyderabad, a south Indian smart city, using a qualitative explorative research methodology. The research found that, although a supportive regulatory environment helps to create a positive regulatory and cognitive institutional context, normative institutions continue to discourage the positive environment that this context has created. Such a scenario may lead to a ‘talent-in and talent-out’ situation that reduces the entrepreneurial potential of the cities. Thus, city governments in emerging economies need to focus on building not only a regulatory environment, but also create a conducive environment for the key stakeholders in the ecosystem to encourage and promote citizen-led IoT interventions that would result in building inclusive smart cities.}
