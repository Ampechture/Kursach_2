abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that continuous increases in global population and urbanisation wield pressure across biodiversity. Nigeria and a few other Asian nations will account for 35% of the urban increase in the future, and there is a scientific projection that further megacities will emerge. Besides, sustainable cities and societies are those that strive to leave a net-zero carbon footprint through smart urban planning and city management. So, in developing public transport scheme, it is essential to manage and implement sustainability assessment performance. In Nigeria, there is a sustainability literacy gap, due to a lack of measurable sustainability techniques, and this has resulted in social, economic and environmental dissatisfaction towards completed highways and roads in the cities. The roads and highways are considered an essential part of modern daily life and will play a key role in the development of sustainable cities. To bridge the knowledge gap, this study argues to develop a sustainability assessment rating system in evaluating highway and road designs in Nigeria. Thirty-six (36) sustainability indicators relevant in assessing highway design are identified along with the sustainability application framework. The findings contribute to gaining insight into climate change impact, and the benefits it makes in adopting an assessment rating system in highway development to decrease climate change catastrophe.}

abstract = {In a smart building, physical and computational elements are integrated to create an environment that is energy-efficient, comfortable, and safe for its occupants. The design and development of smart buildings is a complicated task. Every smart building is a unique structure from the requirements and characteristics standpoints. Therefore, achieving reliability and real-time adaptation to environmental conditions are some of the challenges involved in smart building development. Resolving these issues requires deep insights into control theory, machine learning, system specifications, and design requirements. To address this need, this paper proposes a real-time management system for controlling various aspects of smart buildings (indoor conditions, comfort criteria, security, safety, and costs), and also presents the performance specifications, design requirements, and operating constraints for these systems. The study aims to address two less-attended problems in the related literature of building management and control. First, only a few studies have attempted to include real-time learning of buildings' subjective parameters in the model-based control design. Second, to the best of the authors' knowledge, smart building management studies are primarily focused on optimizing thermal or visual aspects of buildings, and little attention is given to the simultaneous management of all building subsystems and objectives; i.e., considering buildings' physical models, environmental conditions, comfort specifications, and occupants’ preferences and safety in the design. Accordingly, in this paper, we combine machine learning with model-based control approaches to incorporate subjective environmental parameters into the building management structure. In addition, another benefit of this study is that it integrates model-based and learning-based control schemes in a unified management structure for controlling various aspects of building performance. The proposed building management system can be applied to a variety of smart buildings in which the building parameters can be monitored and self-tuned using a well-defined set of control inputs.}

Moreover, human intervention severely affects the environment, and their actions lead to the subsequent deterioration of natural resources. On the other hand, the shortage of natural resources and pollution badly affect fauna and flora. Today's scenario is technology-dominated; automation and digitalization are becoming the twin aspects of promoting green supply chain management (GSCM) system with the help of emerging technologies like blockchain technology (BCT). The application of BCT in GSCM is an integrated approach that manages and coordinates supply chain operations. Thus, it overcomes supply chain challenges and helps to improve the performance of processes and enhances customer satisfaction. The present chapter discusses the green practices in the supply chain using BCT and how the digitalization of GSCM will be established in the organization's ecosystem. Emerging technologies like the Internet of Things and blockchain technologies are seeing greater diffusion in promoting GSCM.}

This requires transport demand analysis of a particular area so that, if possible, urban re-planning can be done to support long-term sustainable use of the transportation system. The paper focuses on the study of transportation demand analysis in some stations of the recently opened metro system in Qatar. The study uses hypothetical scenarios of land use density to analyze transportation demand. A regression model is used to assess the relationship between the generated transport demand from each type of land use, which shows that the land-use type can substantially impact the ridership of a mass transit system. Based on the analysis conducted in this paper, it can be concluded that if ridership in a particular area is to be increased, its development for mixed land use might be a good option. The proposed mixed-use planning and the insights developed in the paper are expected to help urban planners in different countries with similar urban growth and development situations.}

After several years of administrative reforms inspired by New Public Management and New Public Governance, local governments may be ready to adopt IoT-based solutions to gain efficiency, improve public service experiences and actively engage citizens in public policy. We propose an original theoretical approach to explain the adoption of this innovation by local governments by integrating adoption factors resulting from the technological attributes of the innovation and those resulting from the appropriation of a technology whose uses are socially constructed by local government leaders under institutional pressure resulting from administrative reforms. The study is based on a sample of 247 French leaders of cities with a population between 15,000 and 150,000. While the advantage in terms of optimization encourages the adoption of IoT technology, its complexity and risks of data leaks discourage it. Decision-makers in line with administrative reforms may decide to adopt IoT technology to improve efficiency, quality of services, and citizen participation. If human experiences in implementing new technologies facilitate IoT adoption, trust in this new technology helps overcome fears about the complexity of the technology and potential data leaks.}

abstract = {Recent years have seen an increasing need to invest in smart, energy-efficient technologies in buildings to improve health and convenience for occupants and to reduce energy consumption and carbon emission impacts. Digitalization and developments in the information and communication technology sector play a critical role in improving the efficiency of the European energy market and remaining in the current progress of sustainable and renewable energy systems. Therefore, the European Union Member States are required to establish an optional common scheme for defining and calculating a descriptor, called a smart readiness indicator to assess the capabilities of buildings to adapt their operation to the needs of the occupants and the electricity grid and to achieve more efficient operation. This indicator is calculated using a methodology proposed and developed by the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy which depends to a great extent on various factors such as building type and climate conditions. The effectiveness of these parameters on the Smart Readiness Indicator is reflected by the weighting coefficients which need to be initially defined by the legislator. Therefore, the main step to assess the viability of this methodology, is to test it in different situations, i.e., various building types, climate conditions, etc. To this end, the proposed methodology is applied in two service buildings with different levels of energy and indoor environment quality performance located in an area with a Mediterranean climate. The possible effects of smart services and retrofit actions on indoor environment quality and energy performance in the buildings were assessed through energy simulation for two separate rooms in the buildings, a monitoring campaign and a survey to assess the occupants’ subjective opinion about the indoor environmental quality using the questionnaire proposed by the Centre for the Built Environment of the University of California. The results imply that, although the proposed methodology was able to recognise the overall characteristics of the sample buildings, some amendments are still required to capture the specific features of non-residential Mediterranean climate buildings. More specifically, the defined weighting factors fail to reflect the actual energy performance of the service buildings and need to be revised. Moreover, the current retrofitting actions which were implemented to improve energy efficiency and thermal comfort in the building were not as effective as expected in enhancing the SRI value.}

abstract = {According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 3 (SDG – Goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS – SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices.}

Smart Parking System uses Image Processing technique to identify registration plate of a vehicle and also provides autonomous door opening and closing operation whenever it detects a vehicle at entrance of a parking lot. The mobile application provides information about available parking spaces, security and safety features of parking lot like fire and gas leakages alert. Raspberry Pi is the control unit which controls and processes the whole operation of the system. Liquid crystal display (LCD) display is located at entry point of the parking lot to display current parking space availability. Infrared (IR) proximity sensors are employed to identify the existence of vehicle at the entry gate of parking lot. From the captured image, characters from vehicle registration plate can be identified, and then Raspberry Pi sends a signal to servo motor to open the gate for a specified interval of time. The user will then park the vehicle in the available parking slot. When the user wants to leave the space and moved the vehicle, the date and time information will be captured which will be further used for processing the bill.}

Green IoT applications based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are developed in various domains, such as medical, engineering, industry, and smart cities to grow the production. To increase the performance of sustainable cities, communicating nodes are interconnected autonomously to observe the environment, where they need to be more energy-efficient. Edge computing operates in a distributed manner and improves the response time with the least latency through various edge servers. Although the integration of edge computing and Green IoT significantly improves the network performance in terms of computation and data storage, low powered sensors have constraints in terms of battery power, low transmission range, and security aspects. Therefore, adopting an emerging solution is needed to offer energy services with secure data delivery for sustainable cities. This paper presents an intelligent and secure edge-enabled computing (ISEC) model for sustainable cities using Green IoT, which aims to develop the communication strategy with decreasing the liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transportation. The proposed model generates optimal features using deep learning for data routing, which may help to train the sensors for predicting the finest routes toward edge servers. Moreover, the integration of distributed hashing with chaining strategy eases security solutions with efficient computing system. The experimental results reveal the improved performance of the proposed ISEC model against other solutions for energy consumption by 21 %, network throughput by 15 %, end-to-end delay by 12 %, route interruption by 36 %, and network overhead by 52 %.}

A centrally controlled and automated screening system across multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent the release of copyrighted or cloned copies of these apps. In this paper, we proposed IoT-enabled green city architecture for clone detection in android markets using a deep learning approach. First, the proposed system obtained an original APK file together with potential candidate cloned APKs via the cloud network. For each subject software, the system uses an APK Extractor tool to retrieve Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. The Jdex decompiler is utilized to retrieve Java source files through Dalvik Executables. Second, the AST features are extracted using ANother Tool for Language Recognition (ANTLR) parser. Third, the linear features are mined from these hierarchical structures, and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) is applied to estimate the significance of each feature. Finally, the deep learning model is configured to detect cloned apps. The deep learning model is fine-tuned to get better accuracy. The proposed approach is analyzed on five different cloned applications collected from different android markets. The main objective of this system is to avoid the release of pirated apps with various pirated labels in multiple app markets.}

abstract = {The increase in demand due to scientific innovation and economic expansion raises challenges linked to environmental impact and sustainable market development. This study analyzes the role played by Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading in system operation. Several case studies with four distinct prosumer models, each fitted with diverse Energy Storage Systems (ESS), photovoltaic (PV) systems, and responsive demand technologies such as Electric Vehicles (EV), are examined. An economic analysis is conducted using the developed interface. An energy management system establishes a dynamic market framework, enabling energy trading via P2P market operators and distribution system operators. The implemented trading platform is chosen depending on pricing variations across different time intervals for home models. The P2P energy trading system employs mathematical modeling via deep learning to achieve an optimal solution that minimizes costs. The study uses other domestic models and optimization techniques to explore the amount of energy traded across households and timeframes. Additionally, it investigates the accomplishment of two-way energy transfer in electric cars, the importance of energy storage and photovoltaic systems, and various housing scenarios concerning peer-to-peer energy trading. Additionally, the system's advantages are demonstrated to participants beforehand by validating and presenting data through an input and output system that accepts these instances.}

Two of the most important challenges to be addressed concern the protection of smart objects and the need to guarantee them a great autonomy. For this purpose, the definition of trust and reputation mechanisms appears crucial. At the same time, several researchers have started to adopt a common distributed ledger, such as a Blockchain, for building advanced solutions in the IoT. However, due to the high dimensionality of this problem, enabling a trust and reputation mechanism by leveraging a Blockchain-based technology could give rise to several performance issues in the IoT. In this paper, we propose a two-tier Blockchain framework to increase the security and autonomy of smart objects in the IoT by implementing a trust-based protection mechanism. In this framework, smart objects are suitably grouped into communities. To reduce the complexity of the solution, the first-tier Blockchain is local and is used only to record probing transactions performed to evaluate the trust of an object in another one of the same community or of a different community. Periodically, after a time window, these transactions are aggregated and the obtained values are stored in the second-tier Blockchain. Specifically, stored values are the reputation of each object inside its community and the trust of each community in the other ones of the framework. In this paper, we describe in detail our framework, its behavior, the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance.}

A comprehensive literature review was conducted prior to implementing an online questionnaire with 212 respondents. Consequently, a qualitative in-depth interview was conducted with six representative early adopters of new energy services. The main identified trends in the market were that more than half of the respondents would accept third-party device control but have serious security concerns. Consumers are also willing to invest in renewable energy systems if the payback time is less than 5 years. Factors such as financial rewards and reductions in bills are the main drivers for consumer's acceptance of new services. While, data security and privacy, ignorance of the nature of control and low benefits versus high initial cost were the main barriers. Results of this study would enable the actors in the Egyptian energy domain to identify the consumers' perspectives towards future scenarios and their readiness to be active players in the market. This will in return enable energy actors to adapt their plans based on the questions that current consumers consider relevant as well as decide on how to encourage consumers to become active players in the energy market.}

To restrain the spread of virus, policies limiting the mobility of people (i.e. lock downs, remote working and travel bans) were applied as in many other countries. Furthermore, social distancing calls for health concern directly caused a major reduction in public transit (PT) use. However, economic activities and new normal conditions required return of a part of the commute travels, which brought the issue of use of PT modes. This study focuses on the comparison of the PT mobility during the month of April in the 2019 (pre-pandemic), in 2020 during restrictions and in 2021 under new normal condition using the Smart Card (SC) data in Konya, Turkey. Monthly, daily and hourly distribution of ridership patterns are compared as well as usage patterns and characteristics of different bus lines are examined in detail. The results suggested that during the restrictions, the ridership was about one eight of the pre-pandemic periods, while it increased to 2.5 million ridership in 2021 which is still very low. Daily ridership in 2020 showed no PT mobility due to lockdowns, while during weekdays, hourly ridership distributions were changed parallel to changes in the work/education activity schedules. Evaluation of the bus lines having highest ridership in 2019 with 2020 and 2021 showed some of the bus lines were cancelled during the pandemic and routes/frequencies changed. The results showed the importance of PT management during pandemic which is very challenging due to economic loss and fear of infection by public. However, it should be emphasized the importance of continuation of public transportation in terms of accessibility and equity for all.}

However, the low end-user penetration of the smart-home market as of 2021 points out towards the fact that the users are resistant to use home IoT and smart-home solutions. Privacy concerns is an important factor that hinders the smart-home adoption as per existing literatures. Unfortunately, current smart-home literatures have not focused enough on the theoretical aspect of the privacy concern construct per se, what are its various antecedents, and what constitutes the users’ privacy concerns. Consequently, in this work a resistive modelling approach is used focusing on the privacy aspect that hinders the diffusion of IoT-based smart-homes in the society. Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) and Multidimensional Development Theory (MDT) are used as the theoretical background. Multiple antecedents of privacy concern are considered ranging from individual (user skill), technological to environmental factors (legal & policy aspect). Moreover, privacy concern is treated from three aspects of informational privacy, physical privacy, and psychological privacy. The proposed model is validated and tested using data collected from 463 users residing in Thailand. The differences in privacy perception and its effect on user resistance depending on gender and residence type is also discussed. Results show that the user characteristics of user skill has the highest impact on privacy concern, followed by legal & policy aspect, and technological aspect respectively. Moreover, physical, and psychological privacy are more important than informational privacy concerns. Appropriate theoretical and practical suggestions are provided based on the results.}

With the development of the smart urban, it is predictable that, in the city of the future, the service of package pickup and delivery or takeout will be supported mainly by automated vehicles. However, the existing works mainly focus on the variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), in which they either take no account of service time of automated vehicle for customers when the automated vehicle arrives at the locations of customers or ignore the impact of rewards gained from customers on path planning of the automated vehicles. In this paper, we also extend a variant of VRP where an automated vehicle is used to package delivery or distribution of food in the smart urban environment, which is called the Delivery Reward Maximization (DRM) problem. The problem aims at designing a route of the automated vehicle while considering the service time for customers before their deadlines and the impact of rewards of the automated vehicle on path planning. We first prove that the DRM problem is NP-hard. Then we study two special cases of the DRM problem, which are called Linear DRM (LDRM) problem and Two-dimensional DRM (TDRM) problem, respectively. In the LDRM and TDRM problems, all customers have the same visiting deadlines and are deployed on the one-dimensional line and two-dimensional plane, respectively. Then we prove that the LDRM and TDRM problems are also NP-hard and propose a constant approximation algorithm for each of them. Afterward, we propose a greedy algorithm to solve the DRM problem, and give the analysis by counterexample.}

The effectiveness of the presence of energy storage system (ESS) along with renewable energy sources (RESs) that are associated with uncertainty is investigated on the availability of the smart grid. The combination of the ARIMA model with K-Means scenario reduction method is used to model the uncertainty of load. The feed-in tariff of all generations is considered to calculate the total profit of the system; also, the costs of carbon emissions and opportunity costs from non-production of carbon emission and non-payment of fossil fuel costs due to the use of renewable resources are considered. Also, the energy storage system and the pumped-storage hydropower are considered. In this paper, an improved multi-objective crow search algorithm (IMCSA) is used to find the optimal operation of a smart grid in order to increase the AEI and profit of the system. The proposed method not only can minimize the power losses of the smart grid but also can improve the availability, reliability and total profit of smart grid.}

The proposed HEDQN contains two enhanced deep Q networks, which are utilized to optimize the charging destination and charging route path of EVs, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is simulated and validated in two urban transportation networks. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, single-layer deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and traditional hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed HEDQN algorithm can effectively reduce the total charging cost of electric vehicles and realize online real-time charging navigation of electric vehicles, that shows excellent generalization ability and scalability.}

Measuring or transmission systems problems are unavoidable in real-world networks and, if not appropriately addressed, may compromise the ability to use smart meters to estimate water losses. The proposed Synchronous Water Balance methodology allows the near-real time assessment of water losses taking into account incomplete readings through a water consumption data validation and reconstruction model. The impact on water loss monitoring due to the lack of an increasing number of smart meters is investigated applying a random sampling and evaluating the corresponding error. The results, tested on a district of the city of Fano (Italy), suggest that the availability of near real-time synchronous water consumption measures can substantially improve the assessment of water losses in comparison to traditional approaches.}

abstract = {The vehicles in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can be used to opportunistically gather and distribute the data in a smart city environment. However, at the same time, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes.

abstract = {With emission standards tightening around the world and the popularity of electric cars rising, the electrification of heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., diesel trucks) appears to be a natural progression. For electric truck (ET) charging, a return-to-base strategy with chargers located where trucks begin and end each day, such as trucks used in cargo, freight, and delivery entities, is becoming increasingly viable and attractive. This return-to-base strategy; however, has impacts on the peak demand of a facility which can contribute to an increase in demand charge and requires electrical asset upgrades in certain circumstances. This challenge is different and unique compared to the light-duty passenger vehicles charging challenge (i.e., low distributed charging load and longer charging periods). To address this ET charging challenge, this paper proposes a smart charging system (SCS) that manages the charging process of ETs at their commercial facilities, with the objective of minimizing the peak demand of the aggregate load profile at the facility. Our simulation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed SCS in reducing the peak demand of the facility. The proposed solution can achieve a monthly saving in demand charge of up to 54% compared to uncontrolled charging schemes.}

The future electricity distribution system, known as smart grid, will integrate advanced digital meters, distribution automation, communication systems and distributed energy resources. There has been a lot of discussion about the importance of the Internet of Things (IoT) in future smart grids and smart cities stating that IoT offers many applications and can be used to integrate efficiency renewable energy sources in the smart grid by making the electricity grid more robust and scalable. This study will focus on the development of an integrated IoT-Distributed energy systems (DES) model for the efficient energy management of a microgrid under the integration of the intermittent renewable energy resources. In this work, we expand the definition of flexible options to include demand and supply together with design and operation strategies using internet of things (IoT). Our framework brings weather data and sensor information into a virtual energy plant optimisation model that connects supplier and consumer to optimise potential flexibility gaps arising from supply and demand mismatch. The problem is posed as a hybrid mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimisation model combining flexibility analysis and optimal synthesis for integrating energy supply and demand, where environmental information is added to each stage. Finally, we combine traditional mathematical programming approaches such as flexibility analysis and optimal network synthesis and within a single optimisation framework combining IoT and urban DES.}

Responses of the smart microcapsules to changes in pH (H+), Cl−, OH− and H2O during the release of the loaded inhibitor (2-mecaptobenzothiazole inhibitor (2-MBT)) coupled with the number of PDDA/PSS polyelectrolytes layers (n) required to obtain optimal response were characterized. The anticorrosion efficacies of several organic compounds were screened to identify the most suitable inhibitor for the protection of Al alloy 2024 in 3.5 wt.% NaCl. 2-MBT which exhibits the best inhibition efficiency was successfully loaded into the HNTs lumen as demonstrated by TGA and DSC results. The release profiles of 2-MBT reveal that the sensitivity of the smart microcapsules to the various external stimuli decreased in the following order: pH > Cl− > H2O > OH−; and three-layered polyelectrolyte (3n) displays the highest sensitivity amongst the studied layer numbers (n). The release profiles were fitted to the Pappas and Weibull's models which describe the release mechanisms. Compatibility of the smart microcapsules with epoxy coating coupled with the anticorrosion effect on Al alloy 2024 substrate were evaluated by means of long-term salt spray and immersion tests.}

This study aimed to develop a new mathematical model of optimal both power consumption and balance considering the participation of “generating consumer” in the form of wind resources, which presents the intelligent system with a bidirectional power flow. The approach proposes a priority system to choose the optimal generation source, minimizing its material and financial costs based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm and holon concept. A high potential of own wind sources has been examined in a coastal zone of the Far East and on the Russky and Popov Islands. As result, Russky Island doesn't receive any additional income (max −433 EUR) since its power consumption cannot be covered even with bidirectional power flows while the Popov Island gains income (max 468 EUR) due to existing power excess. The efficiency of the developed software has been validated by using the gradient descent algorithm.}

Smart local energy systems (SLES) have been touted as key for both a rapid scale-up of renewable electricity and flexibility for stability in decarbonised electricity systems. A novel agent-based model – incorporating local investor and governance agents, improved temporal resolution, and demand-side flexibility – was used to investigate strategic decision making in the scale-up of SLES. From the perspective of this model, key modelling insights include: SLES investors, initially supported by local governments, can successfully boost the uptake of renewable energy up to 80% of total generation; SLES scale-up significantly erodes the market share and profitability of incumbent utilities, however national level agents are still key for capital-intensive low carbon plants; Demand-side response facilitates balancing electricity supply and demand, but it can result in non-optimal policy agents postponing required incentives for heterogeneous investor agents to build new low carbon plants; National carbon prices (in conjunction with local SLES and technology support mechanisms) are needed to maintain overall system stability. Therefore, understanding the critical role of non-optimal investor decision making is key to fully understand the drivers and implications of a rapid scale-up of SLES.}

Even though, there is not much research on more specific and further in-depth application scenarios for Smart Manufacturing Information System (SMIS). Scholars’ research on smart manufacturing is focus on a part of the production system, but there is little research on top-level design from the perspective of the overall system to outline most of the elements covered by enterprises in the implementation of smart manufacturing process and the relationship between them. Especially, there is little research on the detailed step-by-step implementation steps of top-level planning and design for the implementation of smart manufacturing system in enterprises. Therefore, a general reference architecture for SMIS (Smart Manufacturing Information System) is proposed in this paper through a detailed survey of 42 enterprises in the information dimension of smart manufacturing. Then, the implementation path of SMIS is deduced from the connecting of the above integrated subsystems of SMIS. Finally, a comprehensive case study for SMIS in automobile manufacturing industry is given. This study can provide some guidance for enterprises to gradually carry out smart manufacturing system from the perspective of information technology. The SMIS’ reference general architecture, related reference subsystems, and implementation can be used as a guidance for Industry and government in designing, planning, setting up and implementing SMIS. At the same time, based on the existing smart manufacturing system framework, it has some complementary value.}

In this context, many demand-side management programs are being developed to achieve flexibility from different loads like space heating. As space heating models for flexibility simulations are an interdisciplinary field of work, complex civil engineering thermal models need to be combined with complex electrical engineering control simulations in different software frameworks. Traditionally used methods have shortcomings in one of those two domains as the publications that provide complex control strategies for demand response are lacking complex thermal models and vice versa. Co-simulations overcome this problem but are computationally expensive and have compatibility limitations. Thus, the aim of this work is to develop a methodology for designing space heating/cooling models, intended for positive energy district- or smart city simulations, which provide high accuracy at low computational expense. This could be achieved by synthesizing neural network object models from IDA-ICE civil engineering models in Matlab. These machine learning models showed improvements of more than 30% in different error metrics and a simulation time reduction of more than 80% compared to other methods, making them suitable for use in microgrid simulations, including flexibility analyses.}

abstract = {There are types of events called events with high effect and low probability, which have a significant impact on network performance. These types of events are divided into two categories: natural hazards and human events, where human events are physical-cyber-attacks. Because distribution networks are progressing and becoming intelligent, and the penetration points to these networks are increasing, it is necessary to study the system's behavior against physical-cyber-attacks. This behavior is known as a new feature called resiliency. The concept of resiliency can be defined as the temporal performance of a network, including robustness, vulnerability, and recovery. Recently, the issue of resiliency in power and distribution networks has been significantly raised. Still, a comprehensive framework for exploiting distribution networks has yet to be presented against it. The purpose of this article is to present a comprehensive model for the resilient exploitation of the intelligent distribution network against physical-cyber-attacks. Therefore, firstly, the model of resilient network operation in normal mode and without modeling physical-cyber-attacks is presented as a MILP model. Then, considering that physical-cyber-attacks can affect the amount of generation of renewable resources and the consumption loads, from the robust optimization method to model physical-cyber-attacks in the worst conditions, taking into account the variables of the active generation power of the wind and the solar resources and the active and the reactive powers of the load consumption have been used as uncertainty variables. The results show that the resiliency index has a high value despite the abnormal conditions resulting from physical-cyber-attacks. Also, renewable energy resources and storage devices improve the system's efficiency and increase the resiliency index. Then, by providing a resiliency index, the resiliency of the network is calculated in different modes of attacks on the network. To show the effectiveness of the illustrated model, simulations are presented on two modified 33-bus IEEE and real 43-bus systems. The simulations are presented in three scenarios, the first and second scenarios are presented for Denial-of-Service attacks and the third scenario is for false data injection and data manipulation attacks.}

Based on the planning principles of New Urbanism and Smart Growth, this study rigorously and realistically identifies key principles and investigates their relative importance for the planning and designing of the National Taipei University District (Taiwan). An extraction model first elicits knowledge from experts for the purpose of locating key principles. Next, key principles are fed into a simulation model to identify which of the principles should take precedence. This permitted an explicit consideration of local characteristics and background issues in the planning process. Results show that walkability is perceived by experts as the most important principle. While providing for various transportation options is found to be important to the development of the study area, green transportation is clearly not included. These findings suggest that the concept of sustainability is still very abstract and has not become an important planning criterion. Also, stakeholder engagement may be vital to community development planning such as the City of Irvine in the United States, but it is less important in Asian city-region. The results also show a less important role open space preservation has in creating better communities in a small island with a high population density like Taiwan. Thus, although New Urbanism and Smart Growth principles have important impacts on urban design, local circumstances must be taken into account instead of merely following the principles.}

abstract = {Modern heat exchangers encounter the paradox between the high performance and low flow resistance while most of the tasks feature in wide operating conditions where great functional flexibility is required. In this paper, we propose to tackle the dilemma by integrating shape memory alloys into the design of heat exchangers, utilizing a two-way shape memory alloy (SMA) strip as the self-adjusting vortex generator (VG) for heat transfer enhancement. The SMA based vortex generators are trained with predetermined deformation according to the temperature of the working media. To be specific, at low temperature, the SMA strip is flat to reduce the flow resistance. While the temperature is high, the SMA strip is curved to form a rectangular wing vortex generator to enhance the heat transfer. This concept was firstly verified via the experimental study followed by detailed numerical investigation focusing on the mechanism explorations. The deformation characteristic was verified by water bath. With the increase of the temperature of fluid, the heat transfer is increased by 110 ∼ 125 %. On the other hand, the Darcy friction factor can be reduced by 74 ∼ 90 %, when the heat transfer demand decreases based on the concept proposed. The details of flow and heat transfer are given and analyzed by using numerical simulation. And the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental ones with the relative error of 11 % ∼ 3 % (on heat transfer, Re=8004400) and the warping height ΔZ=4/5 hydraulic diameter (Dh)). The ratio of heat transfer and flow resistance are positively related to the warping height (ΔZ) of VG. Under six calculated Reynolds numbers (Re), the maximum heat transfer enhancement coefficient can be reached at Re = 400 and 800, respectively, with the values ranging from 1.18 ∼ 2.68 for different ΔZ. In the case that ΔZ equals to 4 / 5 hydraulic diameter (Dh), the best performance can be achieved with Re≤1600. If Re≤800, the design can always maintain better performance than the original flat channel, and the maximum performance evaluation criteria (PEC) achieved is 1.32. Based on our research, the smart heat exchanger is expected to satisfy the heat transfer requirements of specific variable working conditions in the future.}

abstract = {Increasingly, energy communities engage in smart grid experiments to explore new ways to collectively generate, consume, store, manage, and trade energy. Transition literature puts forward that replication of such experiments is essential for socio-technical transformation. However, in practice many experiments remain rather isolated events that fail to contribute to sustainability transitions. Moreover, while the literature points to the importance of replication, there is little attention to how replication occurs in practice and on the perspectives of actors involved. This paper reports on action research done to explore together with Dutch and Flemish energy communities what replication of community-based Virtual Power Plant (cVPP) experiments means in practice and how this can be achieved. In line with literature, the energy communities considered replication of cVPP as an iterative and multi-dimensional process that includes collective exploration of meaning, searching for necessary resources, building competencies, and implementation of the necessary technological building blocks. In light of identified challenges, the energy communities articulated two strategies, both aimed at collaboration with similar initiatives to pool resources (including shared digital technology). This was considered a viable strategy to confront the current context that is characterized by (institutional) uncertainty and ambiguity. Although the literature distinguishes between growth and replication of experiments, the identified strategies show that this distinction is less clear in practice. ‘Pure’ replication was not considered as the way forward. Rather, it appears that combining replication and growth processes provides opportunities for wider diffusion of the cVPP concept beyond the few resourceful frontrunner energy communities.}

The overall purpose of this study is to determine the surgical outcomes and patient reported experience associated with completing a 3D Smart MRI prior to surgery as opposed to completing a conventional 2D MRI prior to surgery.
Design
This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing outcomes of uterine myomectomies as determined by the length of the case, quantitative blood loss and conversion rate to laparotomy when standard MRI abdomen and pelvis screening is performed pre-surgery (control) as opposed to 3D Smart MRI rendering of their specific anatomy adapted from the coronal, sagittal and axial 2D MRI imaging (intervention).
Setting
University Hospital Setting.
Patients or Participants
Pilot study population will consist of 20 female patients who will undergo a robot-assisted myomectomy with 10 patients receiving conventional pre-surgical 2D MRI and 10 patients receiving 3D Smart MRI.
Interventions
The primary objectives of this study are to compare the effects of conventional presurgical MRI and 3D Smart MRI use on the execution of uterine leiomyoma resection surgeries by evaluating operative times, conversion rates, and blood loss. A secondary objective is to compare patient satisfaction and perceived understanding of surgery between both arms during pre- and post-surgical counseling. A tertiary objective to compare provider perceived experience between both arms using a post-surgical questionnaire.
Measurements and Main Results
The first 20 patients will be considered as a pilot phase to determine if the use of Smart 3D MRI can measurably improve operative speed and decrease complications such as blood loss or conversion to a more invasive surgical opening. If the Smart 3D MRI group is similar to or better than the conventional pre-surgical MRI group with respect to the primary outcomes, the study will proceed to evaluate 90 patients in total (45 patients per MRI modality group).

This study provides a definition for urban big data while exploring its features and applications of China's city intelligence. The differences between city intelligence in China and the “smart city” concept in other countries are compared to highlight and contrast the unique definition and model for China's city intelligence in this paper. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of urban big data in city intelligence by showing that it not only serves as the cornerstone of this trend as it also plays a core role in the diffusion of city intelligence technology and serves as an inexhaustible resource for the sustained development of city intelligence. This study also points out the challenges of shaping and developing of China's urban big data. Considering the supporting and core role that urban big data plays in city intelligence, the study then expounds on the key points of urban big data, including infrastructure support, urban governance, public services, and economic and industrial development. Finally, this study points out that the utility of city intelligence as an ideal policy tool for advancing the goals of China's urban development. In conclusion, it is imperative that China make full use of its unique advantages—including using the nation's current state of development and resources, geographical advantages, and good human relations—in subjective and objective conditions to promote the development of city intelligence through the proper application of urban big data.}

abstract = {In the last years, distributed clean energy resources such as solar irradiation, wind generation and electric vehicles as dispatchable units have been targeted as alternatives to fossil fuels in supplying the high energy demand of our society. Managing these distributed energy resources is a complex challenge, due to its uncertain behavior. In order to maintain a stable and profitable functioning of electrical systems, the development of strategies and algorithms to deal with the risk associated with this uncertainty deserves proper attention. This work addresses a risk-based energy resource management (ERM) optimization problem that deals with the day-ahead management, considering the occurrence of extreme events in a risk-averse strategy. In a risk-averse strategy, the worst case scenario cost is evaluated through the use of conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method. To solve this ERM problem, we proposed the use of an improved version of Canonical Differential Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (C-DEEPSO). This modification relies on the use of an adaptive velocity and on local search operators to improve search capability. The results indicated that, compared to two algorithms based on swarm intelligence, the proposed improved C-DEEPSO is able to provide solutions that not only reduce costs (in terms of thousands of monetary units) but also protects the aggregator against extreme scenarios.}

abstract = {Increasing urbanization has resulted in a large number of building demolition, generating massive volumes of construction and demolition waste (CDW) in many countries. However, adjustments and deterioration to existing structures are poorly documented, yielding a data gap before the demolition work. Additionally, the entire demolition process relies heavily on on-site operations, pre-demolition audit and efficient construction and demolition waste management (CDWM). To improve the efficiency and informatization of building demolition and CDWM, this article proposes a smart framework based on Image-to-BIM technique. Within this frame, a combined UAV and handheld camera system is presented to collect interior and exterior images of to-be-demolished buildings automatically and completely, in which camera motion path planning is accomplished by considering the target region. The proposed algorithm could detect the line features in the image-based reconstruction model and extracts geometric data to get the required BIM model. Additional frame components dedicated to demolition planning and waste management enable schedule optimizing, safety assessment, CDW quantity take-off, and economic estimation using the data from the BIM model. The application of the framework in a masonry structure showcases how the integrated system improves the information flow during building deconstruction and CDWM, realizing a potentially smart deconstruction activity.}

In this article we propose a novel system, called Yellow Swarm, with the aim of improving road traffic at a low cost and easy implementation by using a set of LED panels placed throughout the city in order to spread road traffic over its streets. The system is optimally configured by a new epigenetic algorithm which calculates the time slots for each suggested detour shown in the panels. Yellow Swarm was tested on three scenarios of the city of Malaga, Spain, using the real city layout and actual traffic flows calculated by our flow generator algorithm with data published by the city’s authorities. Our results show shorter average travel times (up to 19 s) and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (up to 4.5%) and fuel consumption (up to 1.6%), which have been achieved without increasing the maximum travel times (reduced by 205 s). Yellow Swarm, as a distributed traffic management system in the city, represents a major improvement that benefits drivers on long trips by reducing travel times and preventing traffic jams.}

Such constructs are interconnected like a gear system, on which each construct depends on the other. This study seeks to analyze the impacts, support elements, benefits, disadvantages, and the possibility of developing new procedures, products, and services that the technologies of Industry 4.0 can bring to the electrical sector and indirectly to its customers.

This algorithm was developed to find solutions within a relatively short amount of time (we considered two hours as reference), as required for practical operations. The proposed hybrid metaheuristic is applied to randomly-generated test instances of sizes up to 500 bins and to a real case study of recyclables collection, leading to results that demonstrate its effectiveness and usefulness in practice when dealing with large-size instances. For the real case study, involving a major waste management company in Portugal, the profit achieved by the hybrid metaheuristic is at least 45% higher than the profit obtained by the company, and, at the same time, compliance with maximum shift duration and route workload balance is clearly better when the metaheuristic is used than in current operations.}

One method of satisfying the continuously increasing industrial, commercial, and residential electrical-energy demands of consumers in smart grids is to use an Internet-of-things (IoT) service-oriented electrical-energy management system (EMS) to intrusively monitor and manage electrical loads, which can effectively react to demand-response schemes for demand-side management (DSM). Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), a viable cost-effective load disaggregation technique, has recently gained considerable attention as a nonintrusive alternative to EMS in the research field of smart grids. This paper presents a smart IoT-oriented home EMS founded on trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM for DSM in a smart grid. Evolutionary computing-based NILM is considered and addressed as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed NILM technique can determine the electrical appliances based on their individual electrical characteristics extracted from composite electrical-load consumption with no intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters. A fully nonintrusive NILM alternative is considered and proposed. In addition, this alternative is different from conventional NILM because conventional NILM considers artificial intelligence including artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep NN as load classifiers of NILM where training and retraining stages and a hyperparameter tuning procedure are required. The proposed smart IoT-oriented home EMS was experimentally investigated with the trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM in a real house environment. The experimental results confirm that the proposed methodology is feasible.}

abstract = {In recent times, the rapid advancements in technology have led to a digital revolution in urban areas, and new computing frameworks are emerging to address the current issues in monitoring and fault detection, particularly in the context of the growing renewable decentralized energy systems. This research proposes a novel framework for monitoring the condition of decentralized photovoltaic systems within a smart city infrastructure. The approach uses edge computing to overcome the challenges associated with costly processing through remote cloud servers. By processing data at the edge of the network, this concept allows for significant gains in speed and bandwidth consumption, making it suitable for a sustainable city environment. In the proposed edge-learning scheme, several machine learning models are compared to find the best suitable model achieving both high accuracy and low latency in detecting photovoltaic faults. Four light and rapid machine learning models, namely, CBLOF, LOF, KNN, ANN, are selected as best performers and trained locally in decentralized edge nodes. The overall approach is deployed in a smart solar campus with multiple distributed PV units located in the R&D platform Green & Smart Building Park. Several experiments were conducted on different anomaly scenarios, and the models were evaluated based on their supervision method, f1-score, inference time, RAM usage, and model size. The paper also investigates the impact of the type of supervision and the class of the model on the anomaly detection performance. The findings indicated that the supervised artificial neural network (ANN) had superior performance compared to other models, obtaining an f1-score of 80 % even in the most unfavorable conditions. The findings also showed that KNN was the most suitable unsupervised model for the investigated experiments achieving good f1-scores (100 %, 95 % and 92 %) in 3 out of 4 scenarios making it a good candidate for similar anomaly detection tasks.}

This study proposes an optical window surface contamination (OWSC) compensation method, and a multi-wavelength smart sensor for long-term accurate COD measurement was developed. This study uses equivalent absorption spectrum (EAS) to describe OWSC, and explores its spectral characteristics. Therefore, we can predict the EAS of OWSC between 250 and 380 nm based on the measured absorption spectrum between 380 and 440 nm, and subtract the EAS of OWSC to get the absorbance of COD to complete the spectrum compensation. Furthermore, we designed a smart COD sensor which has the advantages of real-time warning and maintenance-free. We proved that the OWSC compensation has excellent applicability through experiments using the COD sensor, and long-term accurate COD measurement can be achieved.}

Location-based big data-driven services aim to integrate resources in the city more efficiently through the collection, sharing, and analysis of location-based big data, thus forming services for urban citizens. Currently, location-based big data-driven services face some challenges. Firstly, the data-driven service process consists of a large amount of information (mainly user data), which raises consumer concerns about privacy data leakage and abuse. Secondly, location-based big data-driven services urgently need a more trustworthy and transparent platform to promote cooperation among various entities in smart cities, establish a better relationship between service providers and customers, and promote continuous innovation of services. Blockchain technology is increasingly recognized as one of the potential solutions to the challenges of location-based big data-driven services. Therefore, this chapter aims to introduce the relevant applications and research progress of blockchain in the location-based big data-driven services through the literature review. This chapter first introduces the basic concepts of location-based big data-driven services and the background knowledge of blockchain. On this basis, this chapter mainly focuses on three scenarios: shared mobility service, electric vehicle charging service, and smart logistics, to analyze the application and related prospects of blockchain in these services. Finally, the chapter discusses the future trend of blockchain for location-based big data-driven services.}

Such model is vulnerable to a vast range of security threats such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Intelligent sensors and microsystems provide important systems-level functionalities to smart cities applications, which enhance data acquisition and system control services. This paper proposes a communication framework that handles intrusion threats to intelligent sensors during the data acquisition and service provision phases. The contributions of this research are: (1) Proposing a reliable Query-as-a-Service communication model based on Fog computing architecture, (2) Proposing communication protocols that preserve the integrity of exchanged data through intelligent sensors, and (3) Providing a security analysis based on the mobile nature of vehicles in ITS microsystems. Our proposed methodology is a data-driven one, in which entities exchange data models instead of the data itself, thus, minimizing the communication overhead and providing a smart way to tolerate misinformation. We have conducted experiments to analyze the impact of failure rate and the size of exchanged data on our proposed framework. In addition, the computational cost has been tested against the amount of communicated data reports. The results indicated that the proposed framework showed high performance in terms of the impact of data granularity on the failure rate and computational cost. Our proposed methodology achieved 89.6% detection rate, 3.5% false-detection rate, and <0.02 probability of query failure. Accordingly, our proposed framework overcomes the major limitations of traditional cloud-based model.}

Previous studies are developed to perform electricity demand scheduling for the efficient management of electricity in all the sectors. However, effective monitoring and energy management solutions are essential for the residential loads to control the operation of the appliances depending upon the consumption of power during high peak hours. For this purpose, we proposes an optimal load scheduling technique named Two Stage Deep Dilated Multi-Kernel Convolutional network (DDMKC)-Modified Elephant Herd optimization algorithm (MEHOA) approach to manages, shifts the load of the consumer and thereby lowers the electricity bill. In this model, the forecaster scheme utilizes the DR pricing information that accurately predict the future pricing signal to make optimal decision and achieve minimum degree of discomfort. Based on the forecasted future prices, the MEHOA algorithm schedule the power consumption pattern to the appliances to solve the problem residential load management issues of the consumers and thereby enhances the user comfort (UC), alleviate PAR, and lowers the payment of electricity bill. Experimental analysis is conducted in terms of several metrics like energy consumption, user comfort, and PAR measures and compared with other scheduling based optimization models. The proposed model achieves the percentage greater of 60%, 62%, and 65% for the DAP, RTP, and ToU DR pricing schemes respectively.

The objective of this study was to scrutinize approaches for sustainable urban and regional planning, management, and urban-rural synergy. Document analysis, observation, and interviews were employed to collect the data. The study identified top-down and non-participatory approaches of urban and regional planning, problems of good governance, and weak institutional frameworks.

It includes the concept of mobility to the perception of omnipresence; thus, it makes reference to moving intelligent objects. To handle the new security requirements of ubiquitous computing, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be designed using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. With this motivation, this paper presents an outlier detection with optimal deep learning enabled IDS (ODODL-IDS) model for ubiquitous and smart environments. The major intention of the ODODL-IDS model is to determine the outliers and then classify the presence of intrusions. For outlier removal process, Cluster‐based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF) is applied. In addition, the hybrid convolutional neural network with attention long short term memory (CNN-ALSTM) model is employed for intrusion detection and classification. Moreover, the hyperparameter tuning of the CNN-ALSTM model can be performed using the poor and rich optimization algorithm (PROA). The experimental result analysis of the ODLDL-IDS model is validated using distinct benchmark intrusion dataset and the comparative result analysis pointed out the supremacy of the ODODL-IDS technique over the recent approaches with maximum accuracy of 98.73%.}

Smart/stimuli-responsive hydrogels are remarkable three-dimensional (3D) bioscaffolds intended for tissue engineering and other biomedical purposes. They can simulate the physicochemical, mechanical, and biological characters of the innate tissues. Also, they provide the aqueous conditions for cell growth, support 3D conformation, provide mechanical stability for the cells, and serve as potent delivery matrices for bioactive molecules. Many natural and artificial polymers were broadly utilized to design these intelligent platforms with novel advanced characteristics and tailored functionalities that fit such applications.

Besides, the mechanisms of their responsiveness to different stimuli were elaborated. Their potential for tissue engineering applications was discussed.

Across the north Atlantic, these are typically waterfront urban renewal projects that repurpose formerly industrial land contiguous to the city centre into fully master-planned sites that also include smart city developments. Our case study focuses on the governance and spatial planning of waterfront innovation districts in Boston in the United States and Dublin in Ireland. Both cases reflect a trend to create high-value clusters attracting research and development from globalised tech firms as well as fostering local enterprise. The fluidity and mobility of multinational capital attached to the tech economy leverages digital and civic investment in these districts as a means of corporate attraction and retention: the smart city becomes one for skilled, globally-mobile tech workers adjacent to, but socially and spatially partitioned from, historically working class port communities. This process is marked by the degree to which such districts can be, firstly, disconnected from city-wide planning agendas, and secondly, the degree to which they interface and share resources and amenities with surrounding neighbourhoods. Thus, we argue, there is the potential for further market capture of urban revitalisation policies by high-tech firms, leading to the creation of ‘corporate towns’ and a new era of uneven development. The politics of urban planning can both restrict the democratic process in the city, and curtail the forms of smart city, civic technologies into those primarily beneficial for high-tech corporations and their workforce.}

A data-driven methodology is used to realize this natural ventilation modeling, including data collection, system dynamics identification, and control formulation. The prediction model of indoor CO2 and room air temperature is built through a learning process. The model predictive control (MPC) formulation step combines thermal comfort and indoor air quality requirements.

abstract = {The rapid evolution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is emerging as a promising technology for wireless network applications such as remote sensing, scalable network coverage, security surveillance, real-time monitoring, rescue, and emergency communications. Firstly, this article investigates the integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology with UAVs for next generation intelligent networks. Furthermore, a framework is proposed for the integration of IRS technology with UAV-aided communication to meet the requirements of sustainable wireless networks. The proposed system aims to achieve maximum energy efficiency for a given power level and phase shift using a power consumption model. Taking into consideration the transmit power and the power consumed by the circuit components at the base station (BS), user equipment (UE), IRS and UAV, the energy efficiency of the proposed system is evaluated for different IRS reflecting elements and different UAV locations. It is shown that a UAV equipped with 150 reflecting elements improves energy efficiency by 7.47% with 100 co-located antennas at the BS. Also, the achieved energy efficiency is maximum when the UAV is close to the BS or the communicating user equipment. The paper concludes with a use case scenario for the IRS-assisted UAVs in the context of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in smart cities.}

Health hazard due to exposure to radio waves, fire risk, security and privacy of customer information are some of the concerns raised by the consumers. Another important concern is the increased expenses of the utility providers with limited benefits resulting from detailed cost-benefit-analysis. Existing applications of smart meters have not been able to justify the importance of it in some situations. As evidenced in many articles, world-wide roll-out projects and the implementations of smart meters have been hindered with obstacles many times. Therefore, this sluggish progress and growing negative concerns originate the requirement of enhancement of new applications of smart meters in areas such as protection and monitoring of emerging distribution system. Protection and monitoring of distribution systems are two major aspects that any distribution provider is always concerned of and interested to explore smart approaches for management of it. This paper is proposing some potential applications in protection and monitoring of distribution system by the means of smart meters. The underneath expectation is that it will facilitate the required justifications in order to promote the future smart metering projects.}

The interface was developed with two focuses in particular: a 3D web interface, based on WebGL open standard, and integration into a content management framework, allowing multiple houses to be investigated as nodes of a social network of homes, so that behavior and performance data can be compared and exchanged.

Since 2015, the Republic of Korea has implemented a carbon emission rights system to encourage companies to voluntarily reduce carbon emissions. Not long ago, the government declared carbon neutrality by 2050. However, in order for the carbon emission rights system to function as a greenhouse gas reduction, it takes half a year to calculate carbon emissions, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are not only large in resources and manpower for calculation should be left to consulting companies. It costs millions to tens of millions of won to calculate once. This paper provides a carbon emission response solution for ready-mixed concrete (Remicon) companies. Greenhouse gases emitted from various factories are calculated in real time using IoT equipment. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions are visualized and shown. Therefore, companies can plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on data and make predictions about when to certify low carbon certification. This project targeted one of the building material industrial groups. In the future, it can be expanded to the entire region-based society, including individuals and families, which are the minimum units. This allows the government to check national-based carbon emissions in real time and determine policies based on data.

Also, there is a significant challenge in the processing of the huge amount of data retrieved from these metering types of equipment. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, a new cloud-fog computing (CFC) framework has been developed for SMG energy management and operation to provide the necessary functions for the real-time operation of the SMG. Indeed, the proposed framework can take advantage of the cloud computing technique, e.g., cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency, flexibility, high computational and convergence speed, and scalability. Moreover, in this paper, various load balancing techniques have been applied to increase the efficiency of cloud computing. Also, a newly evolutionary algorithm, known as the gray Wolf optimization algorithm (GWOA) has been utilized to balance the load among SMG, user demands, and service providers. Finally, the proposed GWOA has been compared with well-known techniques to show the effectiveness and excellence of the proposed framework and technique.}

However, a complex urban environment challenges the effective use of PV systems for practical applications. Essentially, this is a spatial optimization problem, where the goal is maximizing the harvesting of solar energy while minimizing occupied urban surfaces. To address this problem, this paper proposes three hierarchical optimizations. First, computational optimization provides a parallel architecture for an established 3D solar estimation model to achieve spatially scalable computation with high spatio-temporal resolution. Second, priority optimization determines the use of different urban partitions considering various constraints. Third, capacity optimization analyzes the spatial and quantitative distribution of solar potential, constrained by the smallest solar irradiation and the minimum surface area to be used. The overall optimization framework is then set to obtain the minimum PV installation capacity required to meet the real demand with the identification of urban surfaces to be equipped with PV modules. By using smart meter data with high temporal resolution in the city of Bologna, Italy, our analysis not only provides executable plans to meet the real demand but also reveals that rebalance and storage capacity are needed to achieve a real-time self-supportive architecture. The proposed analytic and optimization framework can promote distributed PV systems in urban areas and facilitate energy transition adapted to a variety of applications.}

However, in SGI4.0, the reliable and efficient gathering and transmission of the observed information from the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Cyber-physical systems, such as sensors located in remote places to the control center is the biggest challenge for the Industrial Multichannel Wireless Sensors Networks (IMWSNs). This is due to the harsh nature of the smart grid environment that causes high noise, signal fading, multipath effects, heat, and electromagnetic interference, which reduces the transmission quality and trigger errors in the IMWSNs.

abstract = {Context
While many patients use herbal and dietary supplements (H/DS) for wellness, disease prevention and treatment, providers still cite a lack of resources and formal training as barriers to responding to patients’ inquiries about H/DS. Although the federal government, academic institutions and the private sector now offer more opportunities for education and research on H/DS, greater support in real time is needed to facilitate providers during the clinical encounter.
Objective
This small, pilot study evaluates the effects of implementation of smart phrases in the electronic health record (EHR) and an educational intervention on providers’ knowledge, attitude and use of H/DS in the clinical encounter.
Design, Setting and Participants
The study was conducted at The Institute for Family Health (IFH), a Federally Qualified Health Center and academic health center which operates the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health in affiliation with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Baseline and post-intervention surveys were conducted to explore providers’ attitudes, knowledge and use of integrative medicine (IM) smart phrases on H/DS.
Main Outcome Measures
Providers’ awareness of smart phrases of H/DS, knowledge of the content, confidence in using smart phrases to discuss H/DS, self-reported use of smart phrases were measured.
Results
A total of 32 subjects participated in the intervention and completed the baseline survey. Only half of the participants were familiar with the IM smart phrases in our system and 12.5% felt they were aware of the information covered in these smart phrases. Eighteen of 32 participants completed the post-intervention assessment. The intervention was successful in statistically increasing participants’ self-reported awareness of the information covered in the IM smart phrases (p<0.01). Increased confidence in using IM smart phrases to initiate patients on a new supplement showed statistical significance (p=0.03). There were no clear patterns in reported behavior changes following the training with the exception of a significant increase in the self-reported frequency of past month use of IM smart phrases during a patient visit (p=0.01). Lastly, there were no changes in the frequency of smart phrase use in the EHR.
Conclusion
The implementation and adoption of evidence-based use of H/DS in the clinical encounter requires a sustained educational component to make the availability of smart phrases via technology (EHR) an effective strategy.}

Much urbanization research disproportionately focuses on cities in developed countries, where data is easier to obtain, to the detriment of cities in developing countries. To help address this gap, our work proposes a machine learning methodology that explores how land use patterns contribute to predicting an aspect of public transportation in growing cities (aggregate public vehicle speeds), with Cauayan City in the Philippines as the test case. We trained gradient-boosting tree models with road properties, day and time, and land use data as features to predict vehicle speeds on various roads in the city. Among various feature combinations used in training, the best model used road, time, and land use features over a range buffer radii of 50 to 1000 m, yielding an R2 of 0.676 (0.003) and a root mean squared error of 6.61 (0.03) kph. Apart from predicting speeds, Shapley's additive explanation (SHAP) values show that proximity to dense residential and commercial areas decreases predicted vehicle speeds. Our approach uses interpretable machine learning models to obtain insights about urban transportation in developing cities.}

Intelligent packaging was introduced to improve the ability of the package to provide additional information about the product contained inside, such as the time of storage, ripening level of fruit, and temperature fluctuation during storage. They perform as interactive indicators and often use color changes to show indications. The consumer acceptance of using intelligent packaging is a fairly untouched area. Although intelligence makes purchasing decisions more informative, potential customers also associate the purchasing decision with different variables, such as acceptance and willingness to pay for the added or improved technology, perception of value, and perception of barriers and beliefs. Promoting intelligent packaging, eliminating misconceptions, and finding solutions to reduce the price associated with intelligently packed food would work to gain more attention from the consumer. Strategies such as marketing intelligently packed food under a strong brand can be implemented to easily earn the trust of consumers. Without the feedback flow of information on consumer behavior, packaging manufacturers cannot develop efficient innovative solutions and strategies to overcome any undesirable components of intelligent packaging. Effective highlighting of the potential benefits of this innovation would impact consumer understanding, awareness, and recognition.}

abstract = {By providing information on environmental and equipment criteria, the Internet of Things offers major possibilities for ecological efficiency and enhancement of comfort for the occupants of smart buildings. In recent years, IoT automation and smart buildings have evolved exponentially, arising from a dramatic rise in the number of emerging indoor and outdoor innovations that address the core challenges of networking and application. Due to the differences in their requirements, we have worked hard to figure out which one of these technologies, such as building supervision, is better suited to those application domains. In comparison to Arduino-based equipment, the implementation of LoRa-based communications appears to be an alternative that offers simpler, more efficient and considerably lower IoT deployment costs, especially in the case of Arduino-based equipment.}

abstract = {The modelling of mode and route choices of public transport passengers is an essential component of travel demand modelling and transportation planning. Traditionally, choice models are trained using data from revealed and stated preference surveys which are not only cost and time intensive but also suffer from bias due to limitations in sample size. In this article, we present a novel approach utilizing a combination of emerging data sources for non-private modes, namely public transit smart card data, taxi GPS trajectory data, and taxi trips transaction data in order to calibrate an integrated taxi and transit mode and route choice model. We apply our approach for a case study of the taxi and public transport system of Singapore using data sets obtained from the local transport authorities. We solve the first mile and last mile data gaps by overlaying the individual transport nodes against geospatial land use data in order to identify their actual origin and destination points of each journey. To model the behavioural inter-dependencies between the choice of taxi and transit options, we tested a two-level nested logit model and a cross-nested logit model. Along with the commonly included exploratory variables such as in-vehicle travel time, transfer time and number of transfers, our model also incorporates differences in travel cost and separate mode specific constants for peak and off-peak periods. Generic and mode-specific in-vehicle travel time and cost coefficients are tested in the utility functions for the transit and taxi alternatives. Willingness to pay estimates are calculated and compared against similar estimates from Singapore. We also present an application of the model by predicting the mode split between taxi and transit under selected transit and taxi fare change scenarios. Our modelling methodology is highly generalizable and can be applied to other cities with similar data availability.}

abstract = {A novel sun-powered smart window blind (SPSWB) system has been designed and developed for the smart control of building envelopes to achieve the optimal internal comfort with minimum energy expenditure. Its self-powered sensing, controlling, and actuation significantly simplify the installation and maintenance of the system. The energy is harvested by the attached thin-film photovoltaic cells, after which it is voltage-regulated for the permanent storage into a rechargeable battery with 55% energy efficiency. The excessive heat absorbed by the solar cells is dissipated by a PVdF-HFP porous coating with more than 9% temperature reduction. The smart control of the energy harvesting and the cooling is achieved based on the blinds’ surface temperature by an Arduino-based sensing, controlling, and actuating system, whose energy consumption is closely monitored. The energy equilibrium analysis is proposed for the self-powered design in any locations, and the optimal solar energy harvesting can be achieved by the proper adjustments of the window blinds angle with respect to the geographical location. The abundant energy that can be harvested validates the feasibility and the robustness of the system and proves its wide application potentials to the next generation of smart building envelope systems.}
