abstract = {The digital revolution has the potential to transform many aspects of our daily lives, including how we work and how we interact with others. While the services, benefits, and risks of smart home technologies (SHTs) have been vastly explored, this research asks: is there any space for SHTs to create conflicts within homes and their inhabitants? Drawing from a rich empirical dataset consisting of a literature review, semi-structured research interviews with experts, three focus groups across the UK (Manchester, London, and Surrey), and a nationally representative survey (n = 1032), this study investigates how SHTs can enable conflicts with couples and partners, children and parents, landlords and tenants, neighbors and hosts and guests.}

abstract = {The challenge in intelligent cities is to recognize the benefits of using big data. The management of big datasets enables efficient data storage and processing to enhance information for the decision-making process. The key aim of this paper is to highlight how geological, engineering geological and geotechnical knowledge can be managed in a well-organized database, which is able to develop various correlations and to present useful information for both the design and construction stages of important projects of civil protection, municipality and technical companies. The present paper demonstrates the implementation of such work in the city of Thessaloniki, northern Greece, where a large amount of geological and geotechnical data for more than 600 boreholes, mainly based on borehole geological information, laboratory testing, geotechnical characterization and in situ field tests collected from fill, Quaternary and Neogene deposits, is stored in a georeferenced database. The presented database, is targeted to the management and processing of geo-engineering datasets for various geotechnical projects but also for the protection against natural hazards. The purpose of the approach, besides incorporating multisource datasets, is to provide a tool to effortlessly and immediately analyze, correlate and display data on maps, tables and diagrams for stakeholders. For this analysis, the present study proposes a geographic information system approach coupling the use of geostatistical techniques along with the cross validation to establish geotechnical zonation maps in order to highlight hazardous areas prone to liquefaction and settlement and to indicate the site's adaptability for different infrastructure projects. In that context, specific value ranges for several physical and mechanical properties are proposed from the assessment and correlation of the information originating from the database and spatial variability, providing geological and geotechnical knowledge in safe urban extensions suitable for construction in the research area environment. However, the key challenge is not only referring to provide each influencing parameter with a quantitative range of values, but also to establish a set of reliable structural and high-precision informative geotechnical models to comprehensively understand the superficial and subsurface conditions of the research area.}

abstract = {Smart meters implemented at the end-user in the energy sector create the opportunity to develop data-intelligent methods for district heating systems by using a large amount of fine-granular heat consumption time series from end-users. The current state-of-the-art methods for temperature control in district heating systems rely on predefined critical points in the network and a set reference temperature curve that expresses the minimum forward temperature as a function of the outdoor temperature at the end-users. The critical points are used to ensure that the consumers’ supply temperature requirements are met all times. To predefine the critical points at the network, the location of the lowest temperature in the grid needs to be identified at any point in time. Since the lowest temperature often varies over time, one must have a set of critical points in a district heating network. This paper proposes a method to estimate the temperature at an artificial critical point for the network using time-wise quantile estimation using smart meter data at end-users. This novel approach eliminates the need for physical critical points in the net or sensors in wells and creates the possibility of changing the critical point location if needed. The benefits for the provider of using smart meters as feedback, makes the measurement wells redundant and flexibility of the location. The location of low temperature areas in the network can change overtime hence the flexibility of being able to change where the feedback is located. The proposed method to replace the well measurements to provide feedback for temperature control at the production site groups a predefined set of smart meter readings together for each point in time. The grouping is done to have reliable measurements from each smart meter device, excluding some of the meters when a faulty reading occurs. The set of acceptable readings is used to estimate the street pipe’s temperature using the estimated quantile of the forward temperature. The approach is tested on two demo cases. The first demo consists of smart meters to estimate the forward temperature of the main street pipe. The second demo uses three smart meters at large apartment buildings as feedback for the control. Initial results show that the estimated temperature of the network can replace the well-measurements which traditionally are used as feedback for temperature control and give a better and more flexible control.}

abstract = {Complexity science has become prominent in studying cities as concepts like “smart city” and “big data” indicate. In particular network analysis has allowed to studying various aspects of cities in new ways. As such these analyses are often disconnected and subsequent business models often remain disembedded. However, complexity science can also compare various patterns extending over different scales (scaling) if they belong to the same entity (allometry). Such relationships pertain to cities too suggesting that buildings, infrastructure and traffic amongst other things develop interdependently and, that across specific city systems scaling phenomena can be compared according to cities' population size. The article argues that while many scaling phenomena of physical and social networks can indeed inform urban transition research the proposed central role of cities' population size is highly ambivalent. This is particularly true for economic indicators like GDP, which do not reflect the need for sustainability. Still, network and scaling analysis of the built environment can contribute to transition theory if explanatory social mechanisms relating human behaviours and social institutions to existing scaling phenomena are provided.}

This paper assesses the opportunities along with the criticism for a fully IoT enabled and controllable intelligent building against the well established, legacy automation systems in a fair and transparent approach. In the second part, it proposes an interoperable intelligent building design for the creation of advanced building managements schemes, by integrating the assets of current automation tools and the emerging innovations. This unification and the progressive phasing out of legacy technologies, would catalyze the market of intelligent buildings in the context of smart cities by not limiting their potential solely on new constructions and by mitigating the investment if legacy systems are already installed.}

In order to measure this consumption, it is necessary to install sensors capable of obtaining electrical parameters in real time. In this way, the installations are monitored and energy saving and efficiency measures can be implemented. In this sense, this research has developed a PQ analyser meter with Long Range wireless communications technology (LoRa). This technology allows coverage of up to 5 km, which makes it ideal for public lighting applications. PQ Analyser with LoRa (PQAL) has been developed to achieve a fully functional prototype. PQAL comes in two versions for single-phase and three-phase street lighting lines, so that it adapts to any type of installation. PQAL uses the open-source Arduino platform which allows it to adapt to the monitoring needs of every installation. PQAL can monitor installations up to 100 A and 23 kW per phase. The use of non-invasive current sensors allows this device to be installed without modifying the installation to be monitored. Due to the long range of the LoRa network, it can be installed in locations far from the gateway without the need for additional cabling or Internet connection.}

Norway is a vanguard country in implementing smart energy technologies, and a growing literature of social science and humanities research has investigated how such technology impacts everyday life. Taking stock with this literature and comparing two Norwegian high-tech demonstration cases, where local production and smarter consumption is enabled through novel technologies, the research objective of this paper was to analyse the ways in which smart energy technologies affect users, and the extent to which users can influence the role of smart energy technological arrangements in their everyday lives. Results indicated that there is a divergence between the intentions and the effects of the introduced technologies. For instance, smart technologies and prosuming affected the way people organised their everyday lives by demanding more work of participants. We conclude with recommendations for practitioners relating to consumer participation and energy prosuming, advising a focus on broader implications in addition to smart technological fixes.}

Thus, WoT is expected to have a great impact on the smart retrofit of buildings once data from existing and future planned systems are able to be gathered and analysed seamlessly. In this paper, we (i) analyse the application of the W3C WoT on the core of the Building Energy Management System (BEMS) to enable the universal integration of both private and public systems; (ii) propose a novel architecture for the BEMS based on the W3C specifications; and (iii) present a real-world application based on this architecture. The application covered in this paper allows data gathering from sensors with standard commands, enabling data analysis with a simple collecting process. By applying these specifications, smart building retrofit can be benefited from: (i) the ability to merge and scale different systems and devices; (ii) the easiness to access data; (iii) the reduction of development and maintenance costs; and (iv) offering standard interfaces to the BEMS.}

abstract = {The electrification of several sectors and the increasing role of volatile energy production mean that future energy systems will have to balance supply and demand to a higher degree. The increasing use of electric vehicles in particular will pose both challenges and opportunities for energy systems. Smart electric vehicle charging and user flexibility have been proposed as potential remedies for future imbalances in energy consumption, but the success of such remedies requires close collaboration between users and system operators. In smart charging schemes, users are expected to relinquish their control over charging while also being more flexible in their energy use. This study constitutes a mixed method case study, in which supplier-managed charging was tested at public charging stations and followed by three surveys (N = 1428, N = 24, N = 31) and semi-structured interviews (N = 27). The data was analyzed through statistical tests and by applying the framework of knowledge and perceptions. The data sets were then compared by using the concept of flexibility capital, in order to explore the flexibility capacity of users. The results show that while the participants were positive toward smart charging as a concept, the technology was also associated with uncertainty and anxiety. Furthermore, while the participants were willing to relinquish some control, their capacity for flexible energy use was dependent on factors beyond their direct control, including working patterns, financial resources, and access to charging stations. The conclusion is that the implementation and optimization of smart charging schemes are reliant not only on user attitudes but also on the extent to which these factors can be compensated for to facilitate user flexibility and avoid unfair flexibility markets.}

abstract = {Initially, Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on diagnostics during the 70s and 80s. Unfortunately, it did not gain trust and few industries embraced it, mostly due to the extensive manual programming effort that AI required for interpreting data and act. In addition, the computer capacity, for handling the amounts of data necessary to train AI, was lacking the disc dimensions we are used to today, which made it go slowly. Not until the 2000 s confidence in AI was established in parallel with the introduction of new tools that was paving the way for PLS, PCA, ANN and soft sensors. Year 2011, IBM Watson (an AI application) was developed and won over the jeopardy champion. Today's machine learning (ML) such as “deep learning” and artificial neural networks (ANN) have created interesting use cases. AI has therefore regained confidence and industries are beginning to embrace where they see appropriate uses. Simultaneously, Internet of Things (IoT) tools have been introduced and made it possible to develop new capabilities such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR). These technologies are maturing and could be used in several application areas for the industries and form part of their digitalization journey. Furthermore, it is not only the industries that could benefit from introducing these technologies. Studies also show several areas and use cases where augmented reality has a positive impact, such as on students' learning ability. Yet few teachers know or use this technology. This paper evaluates and analyze AR, remote assistance tool for industrial purposes. The potential of the tool is discussed for frequent maintenance cases in the mining industry. Further on, if we look into the future, it is not surprising if we will be able to see that today's concepts of reality tools have evolved to become smarter by being trained by multimedia recognition and from people who have thus created an AI expert. Where the AI expert will support customers and be able to solve simple errors but also those that occur rarely and thus be a natural part of the solution for future completely autonomous processes for the industry. The article demonstrates a framework for creating smarter tools by combining AR, ML and AI and forms part of the basis creating the smarter industry of the future. Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolbox has been utilized to train and test an AI expert to give suitable resolutions to a specific maintenance request. The motivation for AR is the possible energy savings and reduction of CO₂ emissions in the maintenance field for all business trips that can be avoided. At the same time saving money for the industries and expert manhours that are spent on traveling and finally enhancing the productivity for the industries. Tests cases have verified that with AR, the resolution time could be significantly reduced, minimizing production stoppages by more than 50% of the time, which ultimately has a positive effect on a country's GDP. How much energy can be saved is predicted by the fact that 50% of all the world's business flights are replaced by one of the reality concepts and are estimated to amount to at least 50 Mton CO₂ per year. This figure is probably slightly higher as business trips also take place by other means of transport such as trains, buses, and cars. With today's volatile employees changing jobs more frequently, industry experts are becoming fewer and fewer. Since new employee stays for a maximum of 3–5 years per workplace, they will not stay long enough to become experts. Introducing an AI expert trained by today's experts, there is a chance that this knowledge can be maintained.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of edge computing technologies, smart healthcare significantly improves people’s lives by collecting and analyzing health data in real time. However, security and privacy issues impede the wide deployment of smart healthcare systems (SHS). Most of existing solutions still have drawbacks with respect to computation efficiency and users’ privacy. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled attribute-based access control scheme with hidden policies is proposed for SHS. The scheme introduces multiple authorities to avoid single point failure. Especially, the mode of online-offline encryption relieves users’ online computation burden by transferring computation tasks to the idle time of users, and policy hiding protects users’ sensitive information. Furthermore, fair payments are realized based on blockchain and smart contracts to support the outsourcing of decryption between users and mobile edge computing servers. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and experimental results show that it is computationally efficient and hence can be used in the edge computing environment.}

abstract = {As smart grid sensors, smart meters generate abundant valuable data, laying the foundation for data-driven applications. However, the data collection brings huge communication pressure to electric utilities. In this context, considering that different types of devices have different power consumption patterns, and different types of data compression methods have their own applicable scenarios, we propose a divide-and-conquer method for compression and reconstruction of smart meter data. First, based on algorithm of voice activity detection (VAD), a load power fluctuation segment location method is proposed, which is combined with load event detection method to divide the load data into the event segments, fluctuation segments, and steady-state segments. Then, for the fluctuation segments, a cloud-device collaboration adaptive strategy based on the compressive sensing (CS) theory is designed, in which the sparse basis and measurement matrix are updated accordingly to ensure the high reconstruction accuracy in different scenarios. For the steady-state segments, a data compression method based on the improved symbolic aggregation approximation (SAX) is established, in which the dividing rectangle (DIRECT) algorithm and the irregular time partitioning method are combined to reduce the data volume for transmission without losing important information. For the event segments, the original data values are retained since the event power curves are relatively more complex and short duration. Finally, the received compressed data are reconstructed into the original power time series data in the master station on cloud to support advanced data analytics. Comparative experiments are conducted on the private and public datasets of 12 households in North America and China. The results show that our method has higher data reconstruction accuracy and compression efficiency compared to the existing methods.}

The aim of this paper is to bridge the gap by developing entropy weighting based evaluation system for the performance of smart home energy technology. To achieve this objective, the processes include discovering key performance indicators of smart home energy technology by literature review; conducting a questionnaire survey in Guangdong province of China considering the macro-environment of policy and industry; investigating the underlying performance factors by factor analysis; and calculating the indicator weighting by entropy method.

However, untrusted servicer may return the false search results or the results related to some special commercial purpose. Additionally, privacy leakage in medical data will also damage the benefits of the users and primary data owners. Ensuring fair and accurate searching of shared data and protecting the privacy of medical data have become important in the medical sharing system. This paper aims at solving these problems and a search framework for smart health system is proposed. In the framework, two smart contracts, named search smart contract(SSC) and verify smart contract(VSC), are constructed based on Ethereum blockchain, which are used to match the user’s trapdoor with index and check the correctness of search results. To improve the search accuracy, we realizes a ranking multi-keyword search where it only returns the top-k documents which best meet the user’s needs. Additionally, a new attribute-based encryption(ABE) is introduced to keep confidentiality and access authority of the sharing data. And the proposed ABE supports the hiding policy which solves the privacy protection during the data share. For reducing the computing burden of the data user, the decrypted-cloud service assistant system is proposed. Security proof and performance comparisons prove the security and efficiency of the scheme.}

Fast technological advances are being made, especially in the field of smart phones, that facilitate the conduct of our daily activities in many areas such as driving. The ever-increasing number of vehicles on roads increases the likelihood of traffic accidents, resulting in higher number of deaths and serious injuries to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Among the main causes of road accidents are over speeding, unsafe lane jumping, and failure to keep a safe distance between vehicles, to name a few. In an attempt to contribute to the improvement of road traffic safety, we have developed an Augmented Reality-based Smart Vehicle Driver Assistance application. The application is designed to enhance vehicle driver’s safety, in particular, but is also considered to lead to incremental improvement of safety of road traffic. The application can run on both Android and iOS platforms and incorporates several beneficial features required by a vehicle driver such as monitoring of vehicle speed, warning the driver in case of lane deviation, detection of road signs, and to alert the driver if the vehicle is not being driven at a safe distance from the vehicle in front. In addition to providing information to improve safe driving, the application also helps the vehicle driver save parking location of the vehicle in order to efficiently identify the parking location when retrieving the vehicle. This feature is very useful at large and unfamiliar parking areas, such as at airports or one-off large public gatherings, especially in inclement weather. The application also includes other useful functions such as the payment of parking fees, storage of information regarding vehicle maintenance, and keeping the vehicle legal document up to date. The application uses the stored information to display reminders of the appropriate action that needs to be taken before it becomes overdue.}

Leveraging provincial data and annual reports from energy enterprises in China, this study constructs a comprehensive analytical framework that encompasses benchmark regression models, mediating effect models, threshold models, and spatial econometric models. These models are utilized to investigate the multi-faceted impacts of energy digitalization on carbon productivity (CP). The aim is to furnish micro-level evidence and policy guidance for advancing energy transformation and fostering low-carbon development enriched with digital elements. This research employs natural language processing and machine learning techniques to compute an Energy Digitalization Index, examining two critical dimensions: digital industry investment and the inclination toward digital transformation. The following key findings emerge: firstly, energy digitalization (ED) exhibits a statistically significant ability to enhance regional CP, a phenomenon marked by temporal and regional variations. Secondly, the analysis confirms the transmission mechanisms associated with energy technology innovation, energy structure, and energy utilization efficiency, as revealed through the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method. Furthermore, the optimal effect of energy digitalization on low-carbon economies materializes in settings characterized by mature market conditions, modest environmental regulations, advanced digital infrastructure, and reduced resource dependency. Additionally, the spatial Markov chain analysis unveils a conspicuous spatial distribution pattern termed “club convergence” in regional CP, accompanied by a pronounced “Matthew effect.” According to the spatial Durbin model, energy digitalization generates favorable spatial spillover effects, primarily in peripheral regions, with a more pronounced short-term influence. Building upon these insights, this paper presents pertinent policy recommendations encompassing the national “digital energy” strategy, regional differentiation policies, and initiatives to stimulate digital technology innovation among enterprises. Our findings furnish robust empirical evidence and constructive policy insights, empowering governments to forge a smarter and cleaner energy ecosystem. Furthermore, these findings offer valuable guidance for other developing nations seeking to implement effective digital strategies.}

Cities become unprecedented hot spots of demand for virgin water and food, as well as producers of large volumes of valuable waste. The recycling of urban nutrient-rich liquid and solid waste as fertilizer in agriculture will thus be of benefit to both sectors. The analysis suggests that recycling has the potential to become the ultimate sink for organic waste and wastewater, while simultaneously securing the supply of food and fertilizers, and reducing both local and global environmental impacts. Presently, harmful chemical substances from various consumer products in our chemical society are disposed of in urban waste flows and hamper recovery and reuse. A combination of counter measures such as not mixing nutrient-rich blackwater with grey water polluted with chemical compounds, are crucial. The sludge from the small volume of blackwater can contribute enough fertilizers to secure global food supplies by the year 2100. The voluminous grey water will contain few pathogenic microorganisms and can be treated for non-potable reuse. Three urban arrangements are analysed: Singapore (entire city), Helsingborg in Sweden (city district), and Bangalore in India (eco-house).}

abstract = {With advancements in information and communication technologies (ICTs), one of the epitomes of ICTs are smart product-service systems (SPSSs), which have attracted much research attention in recent years. The capture and analysis of users' dynamic situations are crucial for generating personalized services. Thus the context awareness ability with better self-adaptation and capability to mine information on implicit needs appears to be promising to cope with this issue. However, approaches for the development of a model that integrates context analysis and SPSS have not been fully explored. Therefore, this study presents a new perspective with the incorporation of context awareness, and then proposes a conceptual framework for an SPSS with context awareness (CA-SPSS) and the approach to develop this system. Specifically, the approach consists of four steps. The first step is context acquisition to create a wireless sensor network with wearable devices to acquire the physiological data of users. Second, context modeling procedures are set up on a cloud platform, such as for data collection, storage, and analysis. Moreover, machine learning datasets with information obtained through multiple channels, such as user, physical, sensed and inferred contexts, are generated. Afterwards, neural network models are used for context reasoning to determine the modalities for the users. To produce the appropriate service contents for each user modality level, a multi-criteria decision making process is employed to form customized service strategies for context distribution. To implement the proposed approach, an SPSS case for supporting non-professional sports competitions is developed and assessed in terms of the model performance and user satisfaction. The results show that the model deployed in the system has a better performance than traditional machine learning models. According to the findings from the user experiments, the subjects are very satisfied with the personalized service bundles and intelligence, but find that the reliability is suffering. The case study shows that the proposed CA-SPSS approach contributes to extending the available definitions of context in the literature and effectively guides the further development of SPSSs, especially in sports and mobile health.}

In exchange for rewards, mobile users collect and share location-specific data values. However, most existing crowdsensing systems built on traditional centralized architectures are highly prone to attacks, intrusions, single point of failure, manipulations, and low reliability. Recently, decentralized blockchain technologies are being applied in mobile crowdsensing systems to ensure workers' privacy, data privacy, and the quality of sensed data at a low service fee. By leveraging blockchain technology, this paper inherits the advantages of the public blockchain without the need for any trusted third-parties. We propose a smart contract-based privacy-preserving data aggregation and quality assessment protocol to infer reliable aggregated results and estimate data quality, wherein, we design a fair quality-driven incentive mechanism to distribute rewards based on the data quality. The protocol ensures a secure, cost-optimal, and reliable aggregation and estimation of the sensed data quality on the public blockchain without disclosing the sensed data's and participants' privacy. We adopt Interplanetary File Systems to offset the blockchain's expensive storage costs. Experiments were conducted using real-world datasets which were implemented on a full-stack on-chain and off-chain decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate our design is highly efficient in achieving privacy-preserving data aggregation and significantly reduces on-chain computation costs.}

China has many poles; if they are fully utilized, can they bring more power to the smart grid? Fortunately, thanks to advances in technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, can we use Google Earth to recognize utility poles and optimize the deployment of power facilities? Fundamentally, Google Earth generates static images. Faced with many static images, we need further image processing for high-definition recognition of utility poles. In addition to the current chaotic distribution of poles, we also need to optimize the deployment of power facilities. However, due to the resolution of Google Earth and the aerial photography angle, many backlight phenomena are not conducive to the recognition of utility poles. Therefore, this paper proposes a backlight image enhancement algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and constructs a novel network architecture that integrates decomposition, restoration, and adjustment to recognize poles in high-definition under backlight. Furthermore, to solve the problems of the overflow of CNN parameters and unclear training effect, particle swarm optimization (PSO), the evolutionary computing-based machine learning (ECML) is used to search CNN parameters automatically and seek the optimal solution to achieve the optimization of the overall model. The experiments prove that the CNN-based image enhancement algorithm effectively recognizes the utility poles under different illumination and backlight. At the same time, the experimental results show that the PSO-based optimization method can optimize CNN parameters obviously, and the classification accuracy is increased.}

However, being able to exploit the digital capabilities of smart products and their services is still limited in design and even more to improve the user experience. For this reason, this study will focus on the Context-awareness capability that has been defined by multiple scholars as one of the most relevant properties that defines the smartness of a product. Following a systematic literature review approach, this work makes the following contributions: (1) it provides a bibliometric analysis using a cluster keyword map to analyze the most researched topics in S-PSS relevant to the design, user experience and analyze their connections; (2) an analysis of the case studies presented in the literature according to the life cycle of context-aware applications; and (3) establishes a research direction for the user experience and design of the S-PSS.}

Smart concrete, which includes coarse aggregates with 15 mm size, brass fibers, silica fume, superplasticizer and water, has been developed as a promising multifunctional material. The normal and cross compression and split tensile tests were conducted on 75 mm cube samples; large scale compression test was conducted on 15 × 15 × 30 cm prism; large scale bending tests were applied to prisms with sizes 15 × 15 × 75 cm and 15 × 30 × 150 cm. The normal and cross compressive strain gage factors were 54 and 59 while linearities were 6.6% and 7%, respectively. Normal and cross tensile strain gage factors were 3.0 and 2.9 while corresponding linearities were 6.6% and 13%. As the sample size increased, the electrical resistivity increased and strain sensitivity decreased due to obstruction of electrons by aggregates that revealed a “size effect” for piezoresistivity of smart concrete. Large scale bending test results verified the piezoresistivity of smart concrete while crack formation and propagation increased the electrical resistance dramatically. Smart concrete can be utilized to monitor both strain and damage.}

Some of them are the Internet of Things (IoT). This technical concept solves some of the issues like traffic system, parking lots, and operating electronic devices at home when the user is away. The Internet of things provides wireless access to this system and allows users to maintain one-track parking space availability in the crowded area and on the busy lanes, with the increase in Vehicle population, road congestion in big cities is one of the major consequences. The system majorly focuses on the concept of a parking space detection mechanism that uses sensors in combination with the use of Internet of Things. i.e., it sends parking status to the internet web page. This allows users to see which parking spaces are free and where to park. This is achieved by sending the sensor's data to an IoT platform via the ESP8266 WiFi module, which displays data using HTTP. These types of systems make the user find parking slots easier than creating a mess this process saves the user time as well as improves the easy being by tracking the charges of the vehicle.}

Trading them across different jurisdictions is an innovative way to reuse or recycle the materials, which in turn obtains “cleaner production” in the construction sector. It can achieve a win-win situation between the demand and supply sides, but several hurdles must be overcome first. A particular hurdle is that demand and supply of such materials arises sporadically in discrete sites, thereby matching the two sides is not always opportune. We find parallels in the energy sector, where smart grids have been developed to store power generated sporadically by small producers and distribute it to individual users based on their (erratic) needs. Learning from smart grids, this research aims to shed light on innovative institutional arrangements promoting the development of an effective cross-jurisdictional construction waste material trading market. Underpinning this research is a mixed-method approach including cross-sectoral learning and a case study encompassing a series of site visits and semi-structured interviews in China’s Greater Bay Area. By comparing the commonalities between electricity and construction waste in terms of production, market, transmission, distribution, and consumption, we elaborate smart grid innovations and their possible applications to construction waste materials trading. Our research contributes to the body of knowledge on waste management, the circular economy, and the sharing economy. It will help establish a cross-jurisdictional waste material trading market in the Greater Bay Area. It also provides useful references to other regions in searching solutions for waste trading/sharing.}

The models, which consider the temporal characteristics of travel demand for some of the heaviest bus routes in Melbourne, were developed using real-world data from 18 bus routes and 1,781 bus stops. LSTM and BiLSTM deep learning models were evaluated and compared with five conventional deep learning models using the same data set.

Here, we have developed a prototype of a highly sensitive self-sensing smart thrust roller bearing (SS-TRB) based on triboelectric nanogenerator for the real-time monitoring of lubricating oil. The SS-TRB consists of four thrust cylindrical rollers, a cage, a seat ring, block-shaped stainless steel electrodes, copper film electrodes, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insulation film, and lubricating oil. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the SS-TRB are correlated to the applied load, rotational speed, and lubricating oil content. The SS-TRB can serve as a diagnostic tool for monitoring contaminants in lubricating oil because the Voc of the SS-TRB can directly reflect the presence of stainless steel powder, carbon powder, and alcohol in the lubricating oil. Additionally, the SS-TRB exhibits the remarkable sensitivity to the water content, as even a minimal intrusion of 0.01% can trigger a significant Voc change. This work has promising prospects in demanding applications, particularly in the heavy underwater equipment.}

Therefore, this study conducts a dynamic thermal demand analysis of residential buildings at a regional scale based on IoT air conditioners. Firstly, the data preprocessing paradigm for the IoT air conditioner was constructed. Next, the change of dynamic thermal demand was comparatively analyzed through the coupling regulation of the air conditioner set temperature and wind velocity, as well as the frequency adjustment of active functions in two functional rooms and three demand groups. There were two further findings, by evaluating the PMV fluctuation performance under different operating conditions, the retaliatory and economic thermal demand in different groups were found to exist. Meanwhile, another finding was that there were seasonal adaptive adjustments and delayed compensatory adjustments for air conditioners. Moreover, the energy-saving potential of air conditioner operation under energy-saving awareness was quantified. From lower to upper class, 0.90%, 0.94%, and 0.38% of the accumulative time spent by bedroom users have thermal demand energy-saving potential of 75%, and 0.31%, 0.44%, and 0.33% have thermal demand energy-saving potential of 6%.}

For this objective, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method, and then their surfaces were modified using an amine-end capped silane coupling agent. Alginate was oxidized using sodium periodate. Then, an alginate-based pH- and redox-responsive magnetic hydrogel with and without Dox loading was synthesized by adding amine-modified Fe3O4 NPs and cystamine (Cys) moiety through “Schiff-Base” condensation followed by double crosslinking with CaCl2. Drug loading and encapsulation efficiencies were quantified as 3.4 ± 0.27 and 83 ± 2.7%, respectively. Drug release study by dialysis method approved pH- and redox-dependent drug release behavior. Interactions between hydrogel and human serum albumin (HSA) was investigated using spectroscopy techniques, and it was found that the developed hydrogel can interact strongly with HSA. The thermodynamic parameters of the protein-hydrogel interaction were also calculated, and it was revealed that interaction process is spontaneous and endothermic. The anti-cancer activity of the developed magnetic DDS was assessed against MCF7 cells by MTT assay. It was found that free Dox had a stronger cytotoxic effect in the first 24 and 48 h in comparison with Dox-loaded DDS, while after 72 h, the DDS showed higher anti-cancer activity, possibly due to the controlled release of drug by the hydrogel over time.}

abstract = {New composite microbeads were formulated as smart pH-sensitive vehicle for efficient delivery of ciprofloxacin (CIP) drug. Herein, carboxylated graphene oxide (CGO) was successfully impregnated into alginate (Alg) microbeads, which were then coated with aminated chitosan (AmCs) layer to form core–shell Alg/CGO@AmCs composite microbeads. Diverse analysis tools comprising FTIR, TGA, XRD and SEM were employed to characterize the developed carriers, while their swelling profiles and pH-sensitivity were examined under different pHs. The results clarified that increasing CGO and AmCs concentrations in microbeads matrix greatly protected Alg microbeads from fast disintegration at colon pH and prolonged their swelling time. Moreover, about 94.65 % of CIP drug was successfully loaded by Alg/CGO@AmCs composite microbeads compared to 61.95 % for Alg microbeads, confirming their reduced porosity. The in vitro CIP-release profiles were investigated in simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Furthermore, increasing AmCs concentration in the outer shell of composite microbeads clearly minimized the CIP burst release at the colon region and offered a sustained release performance. Besides, the CIP release mechanism was well-described by korsmeyer-peppas kinetic model. The cytotoxicity study confirmed the potential safety of the Alg/CGO@AmCs composite microbeads with human cell viability reached 98.98 %, suggesting their applicability as smart carriers for oral delivery of antibiotics.}

One promising approach for addressing such optimization problems is to apply bio-inspired population-based optimization algorithms, many such metaheuristics emerging lately. In this paper, we have identified the metaheuristics with the highest impact published recently and reviewed their applications in the management of renewable-powered smart energy grids using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology and the Web of Science Core Collection as the reference database. Four main smart grid application domains we been analyzed: (i) energy prediction models’ optimization to reduce uncertainty (ii) energy resources coordination to handle the stochastic nature of renewables, (iii) demand response using controllable loads and flexibility while considering the consumers’ needs and constraints and (iv) optimization of grid energy efficiency and costs. The results showed the advantages of such metaheuristics for decentralized optimization problems with low computational time and resource overhead. At the same time, several issues need to be addressed to increase their adoption in the smart grid management scenarios: the lack of standard testing methodologies and benchmarks, efficient management of exploration and exploitation of the optimization search space, guidelines for metaheuristics application with clear links to the type of optimization problems, etc.}

Here a methodology to study such multi-carrier urban energy systems is presented which enables to analyze spatial energy demand and supply, and spatial energy flows. The results indicate that in a northern midsized city wind power coupled both to an electric grid and a district heating network could raise the allowable wind capacity over the non-heat case by 40–200%. In an Asian megacity dominated by cooling demand, employing dispatched local photovoltaics and tri-generation could cover even beyond 30% of all energy demand and lead to major carbon emission reductions.}

Given the high concentration of population and economic activities in cities, they are often hotspots of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, many researchers are struggling to explore the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to understand impacts of COVID-19 on cities. In this study we seek to provide an overview of COVID-19 research related to cities by reviewing literature published during the first eight months after the first confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The main aims are to understand impacts of the pandemic on cities and to highlight major lessons that can be learned for post-COVID urban planning and design. Results show that, in terms of thematic focus, early research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cities is mainly related to four major themes, namely, (1) environmental quality, (2) socio-economic impacts, (3) management and governance, and (4) transportation and urban design. While this indicates a diverse research agenda, the first theme that covers issues related to air quality, meteorological parameters, and water quality is dominant, and the others are still relatively underexplored. Improvements in air and water quality in cities during lockdown periods highlight the significant environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities and provide a wake-up call to adopt environmentally friendly development pathways. The paper also provides other recommendations related to the socio-economic factors, urban management and governance, and transportation and urban design that can be used for post-COVID urban planning and design. Overall, existing knowledge shows that the COVID-19 crisis entails an excellent opportunity for planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more just, resilient, and sustainable.}

abstract = {In an urbanized city, about a third of total electrical consumption is allocated for indoor lighting and air conditioning system in residential and commercial buildings. The majority of the worldwide energy generation comes from burning of non-renewable fossil fuel which is not sustainable in the long run. The use of smart windows technology may catalyze the effort to reduce energy consumption of building and houses. More than 50% of heat entering a building through windows originate from the solar radiation in the near infrared (NIR) region. This candidate smart window material must exhibit dual-band (visible and NIR) modulation that allows selective modulation of NIR heat without affecting visible light transmission. A good electrochromic material in this respect should possess high visible light transmission, high NIR modulation, fast switching between colored and bleached state, and good stability over prolonged usage. In this work, we propose a novel Nd–Mo co-doped SnO2/α-WO3 electrochromic materials (ECs). As compared to the traditional SnO2/α-WO3 ECs, our Nd–Mo co-doped SnO2/α-WO3 ECs exhibits up to 90% visible light transparency (at λ = 600 nm), 62% NIR modulation (at wavelength 1200 nm), high coloration efficiency (~200 cm2 C−1), fast switching time with only 31% electrochromic performance drop (vs 59% of undoped sample) after up to 1000 reversible cyclic test. The enhanced electrochromic performance comes from the presence of Nd–Mo co-dopants that limit the trapping of Li + ion within α-WO3 framework, reduce the extent of crystallization of α-WO3 layer and enhancement of the electronic conductivity by transferring their excess electron to the conduction band of the SnO2. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the present composition of ECs offers one of the better candidate materials for electrochromic to be used as thermal management layers on smart windows application.}

A non-myopic atomic game is formulated to address competition for parking through assignment of vehicles to candidate parking facilities that takes into account the differences in travel times for the vehicles from their point of origin to the parking facilities and the differences in walking times for the drivers from the parking facilities to their final destination, as well as dynamic pricing, cruising times, and occupancies of the parking facilities. This study integrates a socially efficient price that accounts for the waiting times of drivers in their search for parking. We incorporate a game model into the social optimum problem by considering the competition of drivers for parking spaces where the drivers’ preferences are reflected in a collective decision such as social welfare. Using actual parking data for the city of San Francisco, we found that under our proposed dynamic parking system the average social welfare per vehicle improved by up to 54% compared to other parking strategies.}

Due to complex relationship among specifications and parameters of electric vehicle, impacts caused by design adaptations must be carefully evaluated and reduced. Big sales data of electric vehicles, which include combinations of multi-dimensional specifications and parameters, are a valuable resource for reducing the undesired impact of design adaptation through the analysis of the complex relationships amongst specifications and parameters.

Although much scholarly attention has focused on modeling urban traffic congestion, news contents about traffic jam have rarely been examined systematically. This study selects 12 large metropolitan cities across Asia (Beijing, Bengaluru, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Singapore), Oceania (Auckland and Sydney), Europe (London) and North America (Los Angeles and Toronto) for an in-depth content analysis. More than 40,000 pieces of congestion-related articles in the 2009–2018 period have been identified in the local news media of these cities. We apply techniques of text analytics to analyze underlying themes in relation to sustainable transport and congestion-mitigation measures. Also, a sentiment analysis is conducted to examine the level of frustration expressed. Results show that traffic congestion is no longer perceived to be primarily an economic issue. Concerns over the environmental impacts of traffic congestion were increasingly discussed. Based on the content analysis, cities in Asia mentioned a lot about congestion-related PM2.5 pollution and climate change was a recurrent theme among non-Asian cities. Economic cost related to traffic congestion has received much more attention in high-income cities. With regard to congestion mitigation measures, terms related to promoting public and active transport was the most popular, followed by restriction and regulation measures, and then intelligent transport system (ITS) or smart mobility adoption. It is noteworthy that road capacity expansion has attracted the lowest coverage. Generally, high-density cities discussed more about public and active transport in alleviating traffic jams; and police enforcement was seen as important in tackling traffic congestion across all cities. In relation to the sentiment, there is a positive association between the overall traffic congestion level and the congestion frustration level expressed in local news.}

We present several tests on Siamese Neural Networks (SNN) based on a VGGFace architecture to solve both the kinship-vs-not-kinship recognition and the kind-of-kinship recognition. To perform our tests we used two popular kinship recognition Datasets that are Faces in the Wild and KinFace-II, respectively. To examine the behavior of the SNNs in a real scenario, we applied them, properly trained on the above mentioned datasets, to a popular TV show in which the aim is to discover kinship in a set of people. The weaknesses demonstrated in those tests have confirmed that the recent literature and algorithm to solve the kinship recognition problem are still far to achieve the high performances required in a smart environment.}

In this article, a secure demand-side management (DSM) engine is proposed using machine learning (ML) for the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled grid. The proposed DSM engine is responsible to preserve the efficient utilization of energy based on priorities. A specific resilient model is proposed to control intrusions in the smart grid. The resilient agent predicts the dishonest entities using the ML classifier. Advanced energy management and interface controlling agents are proposed to process energy information to optimize energy utilization. The efficient simulation is executed to test the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The analysis results reveal that the projected DSM engine is less vulnerable to the intrusion and effective enough to reduce the power utilization of the smart grid.}

abstract = {The main aim of edge computing is to facilitate the low power computational IoT sensors in processing heavy tasks. Sensors should be enough efficient to offload the required task and get back the computation results in the stipulated time. However, acquiring the desired quality of services (QoS) is a challenging task. Therefore, efficient resource management is inevitable to reduce the response time and communication cost. In this paper, a computation offloading algorithm based on nature-inspired multi-objective bacterial foraging optimization (MO-BFO) is proposed for load management over edge servers. The performance of the proposed MO-BFO algorithm is quantitatively evaluated against standard ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and round-robin (RR) scheduler. The detailed results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the response time, communication cost, and ensures effective load management compared to its counterparts.}

abstract = {With the widespread implementation of smart cards and with more travel details being recorded, travel patterns can be studied more precisely and deeply. Although considerable attention has been paid to travel patterns, the relationship between travel patterns and the functional structure of a city is yet to be well understood. In this research, we study this relationship by analysing metro passenger trip data (in Beijing and Shenzhen in China and London in the United Kingdom), and we present two unprecedented findings. First, through averaging, a linear relationship is found to exist between individual travel distance and the distance between the origin and the city centre. The underlying mechanism is a travel pattern we call “ring aggregation”, i.e., the daily movement of city passengers is aggregated into a ring (with approximately equal distances to the city centre). Then, for commuting trips, the daily travel pattern can be regarded as switching between the outer residential ring and the inner work ring. Second, this linear relationship and the ring aggregation pattern seem to be exclusive characteristics of metro systems (and may also fit other moderate- and long-distance transportation modes) but do not apply to short-distance transportation modes, such as bicycles and taxis. This finding implies that the ring aggregation pattern is a product of the relationship between travel patterns and the city functional structure at a large scope.}

In this profile, we feature the city of Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, India. Chennai is the largest industrial commercial center in South India; it is often referred as the “Detroit of India” and the “Gateway to South India.” In recent decades, large industrial facilities have been established in Chennai and its suburbs—resulting in large-scale population growth. However, this explosive growth has strained the urban infrastructure of this prominent city. In this profile, we provide an overview of Chennai’s urban history from social, economic, political, and environmental perspectives. We highlight the current and future challenges faced by the city, and we argue that it is well poised to leverage emerging smart city technologies. However, to effectively implement these technologies, city administrators need to undertake several measures; for example, a database capturing all dimensions of the city must be developed. By clearly delineating the urban planning and policy efforts to the present and offering a way forward, this paper contributes to the growing literature on smart cities and the unique urban challenges faced by cities in the developing world.}

This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.}

In this paper we focus on smart building energy management as an increasingly pivotal material means through which energy transformation comes to matter in cities, and through which buildings are politicised in the negotiation of energy transformation. We advance a material political analysis of the case of Sydney's premium commercial office building sector to explore how such buildings are conferred with political capacity. We explicitly extend this material politics framework to pluralise the ‘whereabouts’ of the politics of energy transformation, expanding recognition of the sites and moments of negotiation through which these politics are enacted, authority shaped, and where trajectories of energy transformation begin to be fashioned. Drawing on this extended conception of politics, the paper traces how the political capacity of buildings comes to matter through smart building energy management platforms as they are negotiated through the context of Sydney's policy settings, the political-economy of the top tier commercial office sector, and building management cultures. We conclude with observations on how smart building energy management platforms might contribute to the shaping of particular trajectories, possibilities and limits for energy transformation advanced through the built environment.}

Green and sustainable energy is an important factor for creating a smart system because only an integrated smart grid system can be an alternative solution from all the traditional methods. Wind energy is one of the renewable energy sources growing in popularity because of its many advantages such as lower cost of production, sustainability, and being environmentally friendly. There is a specific ratio for each wind turbine, at which the extracted power is maximum. To work at this optimal ratio, Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) is essential to adjust the power converter duty cycle and rapidly maximize the energy of wind in the system. In this paper, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller is proposed to achieve utmost available wind power and the controller parameters are optimized by Fractional Order Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (FODPSO) based on Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) techniques. A wind turbine has a variety of sensors for monitoring and measuring the state of the turbine which are connected to the internet using Internet of Things (IoT). This paper proposed an IoT based communication framework for the purpose of reliable communication between wind turbines and control centre. The proposed FODPSO tunes the FLC continuously for generate duty cycle and adjust the converter switches propositional to the variations in wind speed. This FODPSO technique used in the controller gives high speed and reliability as well as excellent accuracy to track maximum wind power. Proposed FODPSO-FLC extracts 20% and 13% more power than existing FLC and PSO-FLC respectively. Finally Proposed FODPSO-FLC reduces 20% and 9% THD than existing FLC and PSO-FLC respectively. The obtained results show that the new IOT solution can accurately predict and control the wind turbine state.}

The conclusion is that the absence of public foundations, combined with a technocratic approach to the project, should be indicated as the main cause of failure. Smart cities are the solution. Instead of just offering technology, these cities socially embed technology (e.g., light rail). In a true smart city, technology is publicly supported, valued and used. Only then will investments in light rail reach their true potential.}

Empowered with smart capabilities, smart PSS has great potential in creating positive user experience (UX). The requirements analysis is an essential task for successful development of smart PSS with strong UX. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the requirement analysis of smart PSS by incorporating smart-enabled UX perspective. Hence, this paper proposes a framework of user experience-oriented smart service requirement (UXO-SSR) analysis for smart PSS development. At first, the relevant factors (e.g., user personas and activity journey) are integrated to conceptualize the UX in smart PSS context. Second, a four-phase model is proposed for identifying UXO-SSR, which can provide an effective tool for acquiring UX requirements of smart PSS from holistic perspective. Third, a novel asymmetric trapezium cloud-based uncertain linguistic BWM approach is developed to evaluate the priority of the identified UXO-SSRs. The approach can appropriately handle the hybrid uncertainties (i.e., hesitancy, fuzziness and randomness) of linguistic evaluation information, thereby improving the accuracy of evaluation results. Finally, a case study of smart sleep service system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed framework.}

This paper aims to explore the solar optical properties and air-conditioning cost-saving potential of various smart PDLC film glasses. This paper presents the solar optical properties of four different smart PDLC film glasses (white, blue, pink, and yellow) with and without applied voltage conditions. A numerical model was developed to compute solar heat gain through smart PDLCs in voltage ON/OFF states. And cost analysis was carried out to estimate the annual air-conditioning cost savings. All the smart PDLC film glasses in voltage ON/OFF conditions had shown a substantial reduction in heat gained/lost compared to generic clear glass in buildings of three climatic conditions. The reduced heat gained/lost in the smart PDLC film glasses accounted for the net annual cost savings (heating cost + cooling cost). The white smart PDLC film glass WSPG (V) was observed to be the most energy-efficient smart glass with the highest annual air-conditioning cost savings ($ 101.76 in the SE of hot and dry climate), lowest payback periods (12.71 yrs in SE of hot and dry climate), and adequate daylight factors as compared to the other studied smart glasses in eight orientations of three climatic conditions. The results help to design and select suitable glazing for sustainable and energy-efficient solar passive buildings.}

One of the most important services is that users can remotely access and control smart devices. Since remote users and smart homes communicate through insecure channels, it is necessary to design a secure and effective remote authentication scheme to guarantee secure communications. The existing authentication schemes designed for smart homes have some security issues and are not suitable for fog-enabled smart home environments. Therefore, this paper designs a secure remote user authentication scheme, SecFHome. It supports secure communication at the edge of the network and remote authentication in fog-enabled smart home systems. Specifically, We present an efficient authentication mode in the fog-enabled environment, which includes the edge negotiation phase and the authentication phase. SecFHome adds updated information to the authenticator, which can verify the message synchronization simultaneously with the authentication, thus improving the authentication efficiency. In addition, SecFHome does not store sensitive information of users and smart devices in the memory of the smart gateway, which can avoid various attacks caused by the compromised gateway. The formal security proof and informal security analysis show that the SecFHome is secure and can resist known attacks. Compared with the related authentication schemes, SecFHome only needs fewer communication costs and computation costs, and achieves more security features.}

abstract = {Background
The usage of smart-devices has increased considerably both globally and specifically in Middle Eastern countries. Recently, it has been shown that 65% of United Arab Emirates (UAE) residents lack proper sleep. Several health aspects of the relationship between over usage of smart-devices and poor sleep quality have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to determine the correlation between smart-device overuse and sleep quality among UAE residents.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire-based study. Our sample comprised 494 participants, from the three major cities in the UAE. Statistical and regression analyses were conducted using SPSS.
Results
Overall, 47.5% of the population were considered heavy users of smart-devices, of which 81% were poor sleepers. Furthermore, the physical proximity of the smart-device at night affected sleep quality; as the distance decreased, the sleep quality worsened, reaching a value of 86.8%. It was also found that 74.5% of the participants used their smart-device at bedtime.
Conclusion
Poor sleep is strongly correlated with smart-device overuse. Specifically, poor sleepers were five times more likely to be overusers. The intensity and duration of smart-device usage during the whole day impacted sleep quality more drastically than just before bedtime usage. With the increasing dependence and inappropriate use of smart-devices, future studies are needed to further understand the short and long term impact of this trend on the health and wellbeing of younger individuals as well as the whole community.}

According to the literature, blockchain technology is mostly utilized for data management operations in healthcare and IoT, specifically to improve data security, which includes data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation. In both areas, six distinct types of data security preservation strategies are applied. Additionally, publications highlight how blockchain and IoT, including health IoT, can be used in an integrative way. Three integration mechanisms were seen to accomplish this goal. These solutions range from fully integrating blockchain into data exchanges between IoT devices to using it solely for metadata storage. The most frequently covered area of IoT is a smart city, where blockchain is utilized to improve real-time data sharing, and electricity trading, and so on. Additionally, it is learned that, despite the numerous benefits of blockchain in healthcare, authors typically use it for drug supply chain management and data management purposes in order to avoid counterfeiting and empower patients with regard to their data, respectively.}

Each year, numerous firefighters lose their lives due to fatal injuries in the line of duty and long-term health problems. Although well-established prescriptive designs for occupant fire safety are available, most codes ignore 'firefighters' safety in complex and life-threatening situations. This paper establishes a framework for smart firefighting operations based on the critical fire events or consequences. It also reviews the major causes of firefighting casualties in the building fire. A library of the critical and precursor fire events is generated to guide the future design of smart firefighting and building fire safety. The influence factors like occupancy type and construction material are also discussed. A decision event tree containing the critical events is proposed for the incident command officer to carry out risk analysis based on real-time information from the fire scene. Using the library of the critical events and building IoT sensor networks, the trained artificial intelligence (AI) models can forecast the dynamic critical events in super real-time, display the future fire scene in the digital twin, and the estimated time and probability of their occurrence. This smart firefighting framework enables a super real-time forecast of future critical fire events, provides the information to firefighters in a language that they understand and improves operational efficiency and safety.}

Results show that: the overall level of SM exhibits a gradual increasing trend in China, and there exists obvious regional heterogeneity. SM has spatial spillover effects on carbon reduction and economic factors play a greater role in this spillover effect.

With more people moving to cities, the concept of a smart city is not foreign. The idea of a smart city is based on transforming the healthcare sector by increasing its efficiency, lowering costs, and putting the focus back on a better patient care system. Implementing IoT and AI for remote healthcare monitoring (RHM) systems requires a deep understanding of different frameworks in smart cities. These frameworks occur in the form of underlying technologies, devices, systems, models, designs, use cases, and applications. The IoT-based RHM system mainly employs both AI and machine learning (ML) by gathering different records and datasets. On the other hand, ML methods are broadly used to create analytic representations and are incorporated into clinical decision support systems and diverse healthcare service forms. After carefully examining each factor in clinical decision support systems, a unique treatment, lifestyle advice, and care strategy are proposed to patients. The technology used helps to support healthcare applications and analyze activities, body temperature, heart rate, blood glucose, etcetera. Keeping this in mind, this paper provides a survey that focuses on the identification of the most relevant health Internet of things (H-IoT) applications supported by smart city infrastructure. This study also evaluates related technologies and systems for RHM services by understanding the most pertinent monitoring applications based on several models with different corresponding IoT-based sensors.

Security breaches at this lower level will render higher-level security measures ineffective. In this paper, we propose to use a multimodal biometric approach (ECG and Fingerprint) to secure the interaction between “things” and people. ECG biometrics is a relatively new technique and its performance is still inferior to that of fingerprint biometrics. However, as opposed to ECG, fingerprint users touch objects and inadvertently leave behind their invisible fingerprints marks. Hackers can lift these invisible marks and gain illicit access to the devices of their victims. Moreover, ECG based authentication requires users to be alive, a quality that can prove important for smart cities. The latter is not true for fingerprint authentication. In this paper, we combine ECG and Fingerprint features in a bimodal biometric system. Our objective is to enhance the advantages of both biometric methods while minimizing their weaknesses. For the ECG method, we use an SVM classifier and for the Fingerprint technique we employ the minutiae extractor and matcher from NBIS. We fuse the results of the ECG and Fingerprint authentication at the decision level to distinguish between genuine users and impostors. The literature on ECG and Fingerprint bimodal biometrics is very limited, however, the obtained results show that this work presents an improvement in terms of EER (Equal Error Rate) compared to existing work.}

Yet, market penetration is offset by user concerns related to privacy and trust issues: With increasing system complexity, users may perceive a loss of control and fear technical unreliability. While barriers to acceptance in terms of privacy and trust are well understood when considered separately, they are hardly investigated in conjunction so far. We conducted a quantitative study using Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis via an online questionnaire. We explored how aspects of privacy and trust determine the willingness to use smart homes from the perspective of (future) users (n = 137, 18 to 64 years of age), and also with respect to the level of automation and application field. Results show that semi-automated systems are rather preferred than fully automated smart home technology. The perceived reliability of automation is the most important acceptance determinant, followed by the location of data storage. Whereas the awareness to use (e.g., recommendations), the type of data, and application field are less important factors for the overall willingness to use smart homes. Findings inform scientists in the field of human-automation interaction and technical developers of smart home automation for technology innovation adapted to user needs.}

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called BLA (BERT and Bi-LSTM with attention) for smart objects scoring tasks to make recommendations in social Internet of things. The model uses a BERT network to obtain the sentence vectors for a smart object related text, and then uses Bi-LSTM with two types of attention mechanisms to extract representations of the smart object vectors. The devised attention mechanism contains a self-attention (SA) layer and a global-attention (GA) layer. The SA layer is able to estimate the importance of sentences or fields, which in a certain sense can substitute for manually defined features at the sentence and field level. The GA layer can measure the relationships between sentences (or fields) and user requirements, which further helps the model obtain more effective smart object vectors. The thing–thing relationship of Internet of things is introduced into the model to inprove the recommendation effect. Experimental results on the datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other baseline methods.}

Ambient assisted living technologies embedded in lifetime neighbourhoods can significantly decrease the risk of falls and other accidents. Digital social networks and other support to the community can facilitate inclusion and mitigate loneliness. The spatial planning, development, and management of lifetime neighbourhoods with embedded ambient intelligence as a risk mitigation strategy in fast ageing cities are of specific interest. We wish to evaluate how the development of lifetime neighbourhoods mitigates the risk of accidents and social exclusion, thereby creating value for the community. The creation of value by the mitigation of the risk of falls, diseases, and social exclusion will be measured with the actuarial present value generated using the multiple decrement model approach, which is a novelty. The actuarial present value will provide scientific evidence of the benefits of the development and management of various lifetime neighbourhoods and housing arrangements.}

As an integration of smart grid and intelligent transportation, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology can make the power grid to communicate with the plugin electric vehicles (EVs), allowing the EVs to store greenpower energy from renewable energy sources and inject overplus power back to the power grid during the peak demand hours for financial gains. Nevertheless, security of transmitted information and users’ privacy preservation are very crucial to ensure fairness in the energy market and enhance users’ acceptability of this propitious technology. For instance, there is need to expeditiously authenticate massive power bids injected by EVs without exposing the owners’ private information. Therefore, a big data anonymous batch verification for injection of power over vehicular network and 5G smart grid slice based on a new ultraefficient certificateless aggregate signature (CL-AS) algorithm is proposed. The proposed scheme achieves batch-verifiable authentication of all the injected bids in an anonymous manner without compromising the privacy of participants. Moreover, we prove that the scheme is secure, assuming the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) is intractable. The performance evaluation demonstrates its superiority in terms of efficiency over the related schemes.}

Building a resilient urban transportation system that can timely recover the accessibility of the rescue facilities is vital to the survival chances of citizens. From the perspective of selectively road restoration, we proposed a mixed integer programming model that is based on community hierarchy to provide quick disaster response for damaged urban road networks. This model can efficiently find roads that should give repairing priority to maximize the connectivity in a limited repairing scale. Network community structure has been innovatively introduced into our model, which can remarkably simplify the searching process by extracting critical connectivity information. The model has been tested on square-shaped road networks and Istanbul road networks. The results show that our community structure model gives superior solutions in significantly reduced computational time, and is practical in solving complex real-world large-scale connectivity repairing problems. These findings provide new insights into the understanding of the important role played by mesoscopic topological knowledge of road networks when seeking strategies and solutions for connectivity emergency restoration, which is significant for the development of resilient and sustainable cities.}

However, smart satellite networks attract the attention of hackers, resulting in them being targeted by severe cyber-attacks that can compromise their integrity, affect their availability, or breach the confidentiality of the data they generate, collect or rout. Lately, several prominent cyber-attacking scenarios have been observed to target IoT-enabled systems, resulting in loss, alteration, or exfiltration of data, disabling of devices, (distributed) denial of services, the formation of botnets, and lateral movement into otherwise secured networks. In this paper, we propose a network forensic framework based on Deep Learning (DL), the so-called Intelligent Satellite Deep Learning Network Forensic (INSAT-DLNF), for the detection and tracing of cyber-attack activities targeting smart satellite networks. For this framework, we trained a Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and compared their performances to five supervised and two unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The experimental results indicate that ML and DL algorithms can be employed effectively for the discovery and tracing of cyber-attacks, resulting in more adaptive and resilient cyber-security solutions, compared to legacy forensic tools that cannot discover zero-day attack surfaces and vectors.}

abstract = {An enormous amount of sensing devices (scalar or multimedia) collect and generate information (in the form of events) over the Internet of Things (IoT). Present research on IoT mainly focus on the processing of scalar sensor data events and barely considers the challenges posed by multimedia based events. In this paper, we systematically review the existing solutions available for the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) by analyzing sensing, networking, service, and application-level services provided by IoT. We present state-of-the-art event-based middleware methods and their suitability for multimedia event processing methods. We observe that existing IoT event-based middleware solutions focus on structured (scalar) events and possess only domain-specific characteristics for unstructured (multimedia) events. A case study for object detection is also presented to demonstrate the requirements associated with the processing of multimedia events within smart cities, even with common image recognition based applications. In order to validate the existing issues in the detection of objects, we also presented an evaluation of object detection models using existing datasets. At the end of each section, we shed light on trends, gaps, and possible solutions based on our analysis, experiments, and review of the existing research. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future research directions for the generalized multimedia event processing (by taking detection of each and every object as an example) based on applications using IoMT. Our experiments demonstrate that existing models are very slow to respond to any unseen class, and existing rich datasets do not have a sufficient number of classes to meet the requirements of real-time applications of smart cities. We show that although there is a significantly large technical literature on IoT, and research on IoMT is also quite actively growing, there have not been much research efforts directed towards the processing of multimedia events. As an example, although deep learning techniques have been shown to achieve impressive performance in applications like image recognition, the methods are deficient in detecting new (previously unseen) objects for multimedia based applications in smart cities. In light of these facts, it becomes imperative to conduct research on bringing together the abilities of event-based middleware for IoMT, and low response-time based online training and adaptation techniques.}
