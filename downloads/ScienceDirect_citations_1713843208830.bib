abstract = {Population growth at an interminable rate is depleting resources uncontrollably. Researchers are concentrating on sustainable development mainly in urban areas where the growth rate is higher than any other regions. In addition to the development of new technologies for reducing the rate of natural resources usage, technologies are being developed to recover the resources from waste. In this perspective, solid waste management with proper collection and transportation techniques facilitates the waste managers to segregate and extract the required resources for recovery. GIS and remote sensing approaches come to the aid of managing this solid waste through its generation stage to the dumping stage. Using a proposed smart city, Vellore in India as a case study, this paper discusses possible collection methods for solid waste management in India, and presents methods for optimal collection and transportation of waste using GIS techniques through network analysis. The optimal waste collection and transportation routes derived from our analysis result in 59.12% reduction in travel distance along the routine collection road network followed. In addition, this study proposes possible transfer station locations based on various design factors like open land availability, ease of access from all the composting units/dustbin locations, transfer means by tractor trailers, and sanitation and environmental requirements. This study also reveals the vegetation cover changes at a depletion rate of 2100square meters area in and around dumping sites.}

abstract = {This paper presents a tool for multi-objective cross-domain optimization of heterogenous energy and non-energy domains for urban areas in a comprehensive optimization approach. The multi-objective optimization concept facilitates the definition of any number of objective functions, versatile in their origin and properties, flexibly adaptable to area specifics or regional and communal priorities. The applied optimization for several domains at the lowest system level yields a comprehensive holistic solution optimal for the particular subsystem, as it is fitted for this subsystem according to its characteristics. The main advantage is the exploitation of cross-domain interactions and synergies and, therefore, the improved overall performance of the system. However, the cross-domain approach requires high-level modeling in order to overcome compatibility issues, which decreases the accuracy of domain-specific simulation and optimization compared to methods which apply detailed models. Based on the mathematical concept of multi-objective Pareto optimization, its adaptation, implementation and application in the context of Smart Cities are presented in detail. Several optimization formulations and methods are applied to the test scenario to demonstrate the concept, compare the results and evaluate the computational performance of the application. The ε-constraint method appears to be better suitable for heterogeneous domains, as the weighted sum method is highly sensitive to weight setting for heterogeneous objectives. The computational performance is very good in terms of computation time but meets numerical limitations for samples of around 500 buildings, leading to numerical infeasibility for samples of 1300 buildings. This is solved with the presented method for model aggregation. The tool is available on GitHub.}

RS scene classifier that purposes for classifying scene types for RS images has wide applications in several domains like urban planning, national defence security, environmental monitoring, and natural hazard detection. State-of-the-art deep learning (DL) successes are performed in a novel wave of RS scene classification applications, but it is the absence of explainability and trustworthiness. An intrusion detection system (IDS) plays a vital role to ensure security in the RS-based IoT environment. In this aspect, this study presents an ebola optimization algorithm with deep learning-based scene classification and intrusion detection (EOADL-SCID) technique on IoT-enabled remote sensing images. The aim of the EOADL-SCID system lies in the effectual scene classification of remote sensing images and intrusion detection. It involves a two-stage procedure. In the initial stage, the EOADL-SCID algorithm involves a modified DarkNet-53 feature extractor, EOA-based hyperparameter tuning, and graph convolution network (GCN) based classification. Next, in the second stage, the intrusion detection process takes place via two subprocesses namely variational autoencoder (VAE) based intrusion detection and skill optimization algorithm (SOA) based parameter tuning. The simulation outcomes of the EOADL-SCID approach are tested utilizing two benchmark databases and the experimental outcomes highlighted the improved performance of the EOADL-SCID algorithm on scene classification and intrusion classification processes.}

Hence, IoT is an avenue for consideration. It is hoped that IoT-based healthcare devices will be able to provide the early detection of potential exacerbations and inform patients and medical professionals such that they can be treated promptly. In regard to smart healthcare within smart cities, this paper presents a study where an optoelectronic controller chip was designed to control the micro light emitting diode (LED) matrix used in retinal prosthesis. An individually addressable low-power micro LED array is designed and the results are reported. The chip is fabricated using the German foundry X-FAB 0.35-μm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and the total die area is 4mm2. It is envisaged that the presented design and technology could potentially be used for a number of applications in healthcare and consumer electronics.}

abstract = {Future smart cities are expected to change radically the way people live, interact and move in urban environments. This will be possible thanks to the massive amount of data that will be generated by ubiquitously deployed sensor devices through the Internet of Things paradigm. Indeed, solutions able to improve the quality of urban mobility for citizens are of particular interests. As a matter of fact, they are a key objective for many municipal administrations as well as one of the priority themes of the European Commission. In this context, this work proposes an advanced smart urban routing service named SURF, which is specifically thought for pedestrians and cyclists willing to move inside a city. The system allows to retrieve the best route between a source location and a destination according to user-defined objective function (e.g., selecting the route with the best air quality or with the lowest average temperature). This is possible through the interaction with a federation of IoT testbeds, deployed worldwide. This paper comments on the implementation and the evaluation of the proposed system, focusing on both the backend (data retrieval and spatio/temporal data interpolation and forecasting operations) and the front-end (graphical user interface). We assess the performance of several spatial interpolation and temporal prediction models, to understand their relationship with the particular sensor measurements (air pollution, temperature, sound pressure level, etc.). We show through experiments that for what concerns spatial interpolation, Universal Kriging is generally able to perform well across all sensor measurements and can be selected as a generic interpolation strategy. As for temporal prediction, experiments highlight a tradeoff between model accuracy and look-ahead capability. We note that short and mid-term prediction methods show satisfactory performance across all sensor measurements. Finally, subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the positive impact of IoT-based solutions for smart routing on urban citizens.}

Nonetheless, the large penetration of EVs is expected to affect the existing power grids, due to high loads. Uncontrolled charging of plug-in electric vehicles represents a challenge for the energy system. The controlled charging of EVs—within the concept of smart city—can have a significant impact on the power grid load, voltage, frequency, and power losses. In this direction, smart charging has been proposed, in order to avoid grid congestion and to integrate renewable energy. This chapter elaborates the transition to a new age of mobility and the challenges of charging mechanisms within the concept of the smart city. This chapter reviews the concept, framework, advantages, challenges, and optimization strategies to vehicle-to-grid. Brief reviews of different strategies, smart charging schemes, and relative benefits are also presented. Some case studies are also employed in order to throw light at successful practices and potential barriers in regards the end-user’s motivation to use such smart charging systems.}

However, the existing workforce in the cities is unable to meet this new and complex job demand due to the ever-evolving and diverse technological changes. Professionals trained in high technology are few in number and demand high wages. As a result, the need for a workforce is increasing, and it becomes a necessity to train the existing workforce to adapt to high-quality jobs. It is necessary to change the training programs in technical schools and universities to train a highly qualified workforce, but the results of this can be seen in a long period. Naturally, to achieve an effective result in a short time, existing technology employees should be educated on the needed subjects and adapt to new technologies. New graduates trained with old education programs should also be included in these programs. Resources available for education are universities, technical schools, professional organizations, and companies that produce technology. Due to their official programs and institutional nature, the adaptation of the first three sources to the new conditions will take a longer time. Today, technology-producing companies are more advanced in technology than most educational institutions. Therefore, in the training of the current workforce, technology companies are an important alternative that the state or private institutions can offer to get fast results and to train a sufficient number of qualified workforce, together with both the main mechanism of the master–apprentice approach for the company and the cooperation between companies working in the same sector.}

In order to share critical information among all the road-side units, we design a blockchain-based decentralized vehicular ad-hoc network that supports data immutability property. We have also designed an authentication protocol for the vehicle’s user and a consensus mechanism to validate transactions. Besides, a smart contract mechanism has also been proposed. Informal security analysis confirms anonymity property with other security requirements. We have also calculated and discussed communication, computation, and storage overhead of the proposed scheme.}

Others falls short in addressing one or more of the SSC six dimensions. None considers checking the city readiness for change. This constitutes a gap in knowledge that this research highlights and addresses through a sound theoretical foundation, specifically, by linking the Theory of Change to the SSC concept and introducing a theoretical logic model for the transformation towards SSCs. The latter is used to propose a coherent, systematic transformation roadmap that captures the cross-cutting readiness of a city along its infrastructures.

There is insufficient knowledge about how the PSS implementation gap can be bridged and how PSS can be embedded into the planning process. This study provides insight into how the City Analytics Lab (CAL) can contribute to the promise of smart planning. It aims to first determine how CAL can yield the promise of smart planning. Then it provides insight into how CAL can contribute to close the PSS implementation gap. Accordingly, we organized fifteen workshops and surveyed planning practitioners (N = 89) at CAL to assess its usefulness for smart planning as well as its contribution in bridging the PSS implementation gap. The results show that users are positive towards the usefulness and usability of the support tools in the CAL, in particular the collaborative nature of the lab through its interactive tables and software applications. With regards to the PSS implementation gap, we find that there is a continued and increasingly successful conversation between the CAL and it's PSS tools and planning practice (i.e. ‘technology-to-people’) by collaborating with local governments, industry partners and other universities. However, further refinement of the lab through continued conversation between users and developers (i.e. ‘people-to-people’) is necessary, where tools are codesigned and user preferences and participation protocols are further considered. More broadly this research suggests that Planning Support Theatres, such as CAL can assist in reducing the technology adoption barriers commonly experienced in the application of PSS in practice. Such Planning Support Theatres, also provide a space to support new ideas and interactions importantly between both the key actors and the technology and the actors themselves.}

Despite increasing efforts to maximize the vehicle flow in large cities, to provide greater accuracy to estimate the traffic jam and to maximize the flow of vehicles in the transport infrastructure, without increasing the overhead of information on the control-related network, still consist in issues to be investigated. Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate.}

Out of the realization for the need to develop smart city initiatives, many South African cities, such as Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth, have jumped onto the bandwagon for designing smart city projects driven by the local contextual setting. The direct implication of many smart city interventions and projects in South Africa is that there will be improved experience of the cities by the citizens and that information will be accessed ubiquitously to make intelligent decisions anywhere and anytime.}

abstract = {Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which refers to the communication network for the collection of power data from smart meters in a Smart Grid, is expected to be used in the service of many Smart City applications such as gas and water data collection or electric vehicle charging. As the communication within the AMI needs to be secure to protect user’s power data, key management becomes a challenge due to its overhead and limited resources on smart meters. While using public-keys eliminate some of the overhead of key management as opposed to symmetric-key management, there are still challenges regarding the management of certificates that store and certify the public-keys. In particular, distribution and storage of certificate revocation list (CRL) is major a challenge due to cost of distribution and storage in AMI networks which is envisioned to utilize wireless mesh networks. Motivated by the need of keeping the CRL distribution and storage cost effective and scalable, in this paper, we present a distributed CRL management scheme by utilizing distributed hash trees (DHTs) that have been heavily employed in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The basic idea is to share the burden of storage of CRLs among all the smart meters by exploiting the convenient wireless communication capability of the smart meters among each other. Using DHTs not only reduces the space requirements for CRLs but also makes the CRL updates more convenient. We implemented DHT-based CRL structure both on ns-3 and testbed using IEEE 802.11s mesh standard as a model for AMI and demonstrated its superior performance with respect to traditional methods of CRL management through extensive simulations.}

An ICT-infrastructure handles data and information and encompasses devices and networks, protocols and procedures including Internet, Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. The current challenges of ICT-infrastructures are delivering services and applications that are requested by users, such as residents, public organisations and institutions. These services and applications must be combined to enhance and enrich the environment and provide personalised services. This requires radical changes in technology, such as dynamic ICT-infrastructures, which should dynamically provide requested services to be able to build smart societies. This paper is about pursuing smart and connected cities and communities by creating smart volatile ICT-infrastructures for smart cities and communities, called Ipsum. The infrastructure is of multidisciplinary art and includes different kinds of hardware, software, artificial intelligence techniques depending on the available parts and the services to be delivered. The goal is to provide a powerful and smart, and cost-saving volatile ICT-infrastructure with person-centred, ubiquitous and malleable parts, i.e., devices, sensors and services. Volatile means in real-time constitute a volatile network of devices and deploying it into cities and communities. Ipsum will be smart everywhere by collaborating with several different hardware and software systems and cooperating to perform complex tasks. By including ubiquitous and malleable parts in the infrastructure, Ipsum can facilitate an informed and engaged populace.}

Developing smart city paradigm employs this communication platform for providing services to the users and granting distributed resource sharing. Mitigating adversary device selection in this platform prevents irrelevant data exchange and eases information access and exchange. External and internal communication hindering factors needs to be addressed to sustain uninterrupted communication. To improve the precision in communication security, an observation-based security system is modeled in this manuscript. This security system observes the local and global behavioral change in IoT device communication. The local and global behavioral changes are defined using device attributes and behavior modeling. The device and service provider input observations are processed by a neural network-based learning scheme to identify errors in the resource access. The communicating users and IoT devices are secured by selecting reputed service providers and data sources to improve the distributed resource utilization in IoT based smart city. The performance of the proposed scheme balances between security and resource utilization requirements of the users by reducing response loss and non-reputed device selection.}

abstract = {Cities are becoming more and more of a focal point for our economies and societies, particularly because of the on-going urbanization, and the trend towards increasingly knowledge intensive economies as well as their growing share of resource consumption and emissions. Energy is an essential component of life in the cities, as it supports the whole spectrum of their economic activities and secures a certain level of quality of life to residents. To meet public policy objectives under these circumstances, cities need to change and develop in a smart way, without disregarding the issues of energy efficiency and sustainability. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a Decision Support Framework able to assess and optimize the energy use in Smart Cities. The proposed methodology is addressed to the cities local authorities, so as to optimize the energy use in their premises and achieve significant reduction of CO2 emissions. The novel Framework includes two pillars: ‘Assessment’ and ‘Optimization’. The ‘Assessment’ pillar highlights the strengths, the underperforming sectors and the potentials of a city in terms of energy optimization. The ‘Optimization’ pillar includes a number of targeted action plans that can be used by the building energy managers of a city. The proposed actions in this pillar derive from the DSS for Energy Management component of the Framework that offers short-term scenarios in a weekly basis, and from the DSS for Energy Efficiency component that offers long-term scenarios in a yearly basis. Moreover, these two pillars combine a number of web based components. The ‘Assessment’ pillar uses The Smart City Energy Assessment Framework tool (e-SCEAF), which can provide fruitful results for assessing the energy behavior and performance of a city. The ‘Optimization’ pillar uses the Thermal Comfort Validator (TCV) with the relevant action plan and a Toolset for Assessing the Energy use of Buildings. TCV can assist the energy managers in adjusting thermal comfort parameters, in such a way as to optimize energy use and maintain comfort levels in accepted ranges. The Toolset for Assessing the Energy use of Buildings is able to collect real energy consumption data and calculate automatically the energy savings from a list of improvement scenarios. The novelty of the proposed Framework lies on the merging of multidisciplinary data sources from the following domains: weather, building monitoring, users’ feedback, energy prices and energy production.}

This paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) network model for an EV routing using fuzzy logic-based data fusion technique. The data fusion process estimates the location-specific congestion by considering sensory data and human inputs from the crowd. Further, an open source routing engine (Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)) computes the shortest congestion-aware route by responding to live traffic updates in a road network. Moreover, a sensor node has been designed for gathering the emissions and speeds of moving vehicles on the road. An Android application is developed to collect road blockage information from the crowd. Leveraging the Android application service, a driver in the EV is guided towards a medical center through the shortest congestion-aware route.}

It is argued that democracy in the smart city is a matter of choice, rather than a deterministic outcome or sheer unfeasibility. There is indeed a risk that functional concerns will prevail over democratic choices, given the powerful technological instruments on which the smart city is built and their possible connections with either market-biased options or authoritarian surveillance. Examples of democratic procedures in the smart city—networking, decentralization, increased transparency and accountability, new modes of popular participation via the virtual agora, and hence collaborative democracy and citizens' empowerment—are discussed.}

To address the challenges in this new network scenario, we propose to opportunistically rely on the increasing number of connected vehicles in densely populated urban areas. The idea is to support the macro base station (BS) with a secondary communication tier composed of a set of smart and connected vehicles that are in movement in the urban area. As a first step towards a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of this architecture, this paper considers the case where these vehicles are equipped with femto-mobile access points (fmAPs) and constitute a mobile out-of-band relay infrastructure. We first study this network system with a continuous time model, in which three techniques to select an fmAP (if more than one is available) are proposed and the maximal feasible gain in the data rate is characterized as a function of the vehicle density, average vehicle speeds, handoff overhead cost, as well as physical layer parameters. We then introduce a time slotted model, in which we consider a more realistic communication channel, with an exponential path loss model, and we investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and expected data rate, as a function of the system parameters. The analytical and simulation results, with both the continuous and time slotted models, provide a first benchmark characterizing this architecture and the definition of guidelines for its future realistic study and implementation.}

This chapter develops a hazard-based maintenance management method for bridge decks based on routine inspection data. A compound state approach with three indicators—age, condition rating, and age at deterioration initiation—is used to describe the condition of the bridge deck. The proportional hazard model with a Weibull baseline hazard function (WPHM) combines the three indicators to a hazard value for decision-making. After each routine inspection, bridge managers calculate hazard through WPHM and choose to perform preventive repair, general repair, or no action. The objective is to determine the hazard thresholds that assist bridge managers in selecting the optimal repair scheme with minimal annual expected cost. The optimization process is formulated and solved using Markov decision processes. Unlike existing bridge management approaches, the proposed method incorporates the effect of time and provides dynamic decision thresholds, which is consistent with the appropriate point of view that cities are dynamic organisms.}

Despite being diverse in their scale, scope, and clientele, their common goal is dealing with challenges related to global change and sustainability. In the meantime, it is increasingly recognized that utilizing smart solutions, enabled by advances in information and communication technologies, is critical for accelerating progress on achieving sustainability. It is, therefore, essential to integrate smart city principles into urban sustainability assessment tools. Accordingly, the main question that we aim to address in this chapter is whether sustainability assessment tools cover smart city indicators. To answer this question, we first extract a list of smart city indicators from a wide range of existing tools for assessing city smartness. Next, we examine seven globally well-known sustainability assessment tools to find out the level of correspondence between their indicators and those extracted from smart city assessment tools. The examined urban sustainability assessment tools belong to the BREEAM, LEED, and CASBEE family and are used for performance assessment at the neighborhood and/or city scales. Results show that, overall, there is a lack of correspondence between smart city and urban sustainability assessment tools. In particular, there is a glaring lack of coverage of smartness indicators related to the economy, governance, and quality of life dimensions. Some promising results were, however, found regarding the inclusion of smartness indicators related to the environment and mobility dimensions. Results show that the recently developed LEED for cities and communities tools have made good efforts to include smartness indicators related to these two dimensions. This chapter concludes by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the selected tools and making some recommendations for future research.}

This paper studies an RoadSide Unit (RSU) placement problem in traffic flow monitoring systems, in order to secure vehicles through location proofs. Given some traffic flows on streets, the objective is to place a minimum number of RSUs to cover and distinguish all traffic flows. A traffic flow is covered and distinguishable, if the set of its passing RSUs is non-empty and unique among all traffic flows. The RSU placement problem is NP-hard, monotonic, and non-submodular. It is a non-trivial extension of the traditional set cover problem that is submodular. Three bounded RSU placement algorithms are proposed with respect to the number of given traffic flows. To further reduce the number of deployed RSUs, this paper extends a credential propagation mechanism via vehicle-to-vehicle communications, which essentially enlarges the coverage of an RSU. Extensive real data-driven experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

abstract = {Computation offloading is one of the important application in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Computational offloading provides assisted means of processing large amounts of data generated by abundant IoT devices, speed up processing of intensive tasks and save battery life. In this paper, we propose a secure computation offloading scheme in Fog-Cloud-IoT environment (SecOFF-FCIoT). Using machine learning strategies, we accomplish efficient, secure offloading in Fog-IoT setting. In particular, we employ Neuro-Fuzzy Model to secure data at the smart gateway, then the IoT device selects an optimal Fog node to which it can offload its workload using Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) via the smart gateway. If the fog node is not capable of handling the workload, it is forwarded to the cloud after being classified as either sensitive or non-sensitive. Sensitive data is maintained in private cloud. Whereas non-sensitive data is offloaded using dynamic offloading strategy. In PSO, the availability of fog node is computed using two metrics; i) Available Processing Capacity (APC), and ii) Remaining Node Energy (RNE). Selection of cloud is based on Reinforcement Learning. Our proposed approach is implemented for smart city applications using NS-3 simulator with JAVA Programming. We compare our proposed secure computation offloading model with previous approaches which include DTO-SO, FCFS, LOTEC, and CMS-ACO. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme minimizes latency as compared to selected benchmarks.}

The concept of smart cities, therefore, has emerged during the last years as a response to these problems. Advanced measurement and communication technologies enabled through smart cities have particularly played a key role in dealing with such economic, social and organizational challenges faced during the growing of cities. In this sense, using historical information provided with the mentioned technologies, various forecasting tools have been incorporated into smart city environment in order to manage more effectively its essential components such as smart grids and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For a further improvement in forecasting accuracy and hence in the management of these smart systems, recently, the information available in space has been also introduced in forecasting tools in addition to that in time. These advanced forecasting approaches, called spatio-temporal methods, have the capability of making use of all the available data collected from different locations. The potential benefits of these approaches have been underlined in various recent studies in the literature. In this paper, a comprehensive overview and assessment of forecasting approaches including both spatial and temporal information have been presented for the purpose of supporting the ongoing efforts for exploiting the available information in smart city applications. With this objective, the spatio-temporal forecasting methods presented in the literature are classified considering their implementation areas and model structures. Furthermore, the similarities and peculiarities of the methods classified are examined in detail, resulted in the compiling of valuable reference information for future studies on improving these approaches.}

In this paper, we propose a low-cost system for monitoring of pet animals (dogs) based on their primary animal biometric identifiers. The proposed recognition approach uses the one-shot similarity and distance metric based learning methods for matching and classifying the extracted features of face images for recognition of pet animals (dog). We also developed a prototype for evaluating the accuracy of the recognition system.

abstract = {Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve the shortest path problem (SPP) is a very well-known algorithm. When applied to real situations, although the shortest path can be computed with Dijkstra’s algorithm, it is not always the one that is chosen. In traffic situations, for example, the driver may not know the exact length of the lanes or the shortest path to follow. Even more compelling is the fact that although the driver knows the shortest route, he/she may prefer choosing a different route. In this paper we present the new algorithm PEDA (Probabilistic Extension of Dijkstra’s Algorithm) which introduces probabilistic changes in the weight of the edges and also in the decisions when choosing the shortest path. When PEDA is applied to traffic flow, more realistic simulations, in which the shortest path is not always chosen, are obtained. This more accurately simulates the more normal behavior of drivers. As an example of an application, we introduce the ATISMART+ model, an extension of the ATISMART model, where an accelerated-time simulation of car traffic in a smart city was described. In that previous work, all cars in the system used Dijkstra’s algorithm to choose improved ATISMART+ model, for accelerated time simulations of traffic flow in smart cities, uses the new PEDA algorithm. The results obtained show that ATISMART+ produces more realistic simulations considering different drivers’ behaviors.}

Current trends for traffic control are based on the use of smart traffic lights and signals as a part of smart cities’ projects. Different cities are currently involved in the design and implementation of smart traffic control. Since the cost of physically installing these systems is very high, in terms of both money and resources, accelerated-time simulations of traffic flow using smart traffic lights and signals significantly reduce these costs. In this work we present a new model for accelerated-time simulations for traffic flow within. The philosophy of this model is based on previous works of the authors, where accelerated-time simulations for car traffic in a motorway or a roundabout and baggage traffic in an airport were developed. The philosophy of this model combines ideas from cellular automata and neural network theories, obtaining a mixed model. This system was developed using a Computer Algebra System (CAS) called Maxima  for mathematical computations and a Java  based interface for graphical display. Maxima  allows the system to support the use of ad hoc distribution functions for the different events dealt with in the simulations. The interface provides a friendly framework for entering input data and visualizing the simulations, providing also some statistical data.}

We also further describe solutions for each category in this paper. Furthermore, we show the applications of these solutions in an urban traffic data captured on two urban smart cities (e.g., Odense in Denmark and Beijing in China). The perspectives on open questions and research challenges are also mentioned and discussed that allow to obtain a better understanding of the intuition, limitations, and benefits for the various space–time series clustering methods. This work can thus provide the guidances to practitioners for selecting the most suitable methods for their used cases, domains, and applications.}

PSS encapsulate data-driven modelling approaches for envisioning alternative future cities scenarios. They are widely available but have limited adoption in the planning profession (Russo, Lanzilotti, Costabile, & Pettit, 2017). Research has identified issues preventing their mainstream adoption to be, among others, the gap between PSS supply and demand (Geertman, 2016), their difficulty of use, a need for greater understanding of PSS capabilities and a lack of awareness of their applications (Russo et al., 2017; Vonk, Geertman, & Schot, 2005). To address this, a review of five PSS is conducted in the context of four vignettes applied in Australia and applicable internationally. A critical review has been undertaken, demonstrating how these PSS provide an evidence basis to understand, model and manage growing cities. The results suggest that PSS can assist in undertaking key tasks associated with the planning process. In addition to supporting planning and decision making, PSS can potentially enable better co-ordination between city, state and federal planning and infrastructure agencies, thus promoting a multi-scaled approach that improves local and national data sharing, modelling, reporting and scenario planning. The research demonstrates that PSS can assist in navigating the complexities of rapid multi-faceted urban growth to achieve better-informed planning outcomes. The paper concludes by outlining ways PSS address limitations of the past and can begin to address anticipated future challenges.}

These values are computed using deep learning models for time series prediction. One challenge for implementing this approach is that the inputs to the models are noisy since they are also estimates based on the protocol’s operation itself. To address this problem, we propose a new training scheme where we add noise, similar to that produced by the protocol’s operation, to the inputs of the training examples as a form of regularization. Our experiments show that the regularized models perform close to the theoretical optimal where the number of vehicles in the area is always known.}

abstract = {In recent times, smart-built environments have gone through an incessant transformation, becoming more independent and sensitive ecosystems which can balance energy consumption and user comfort, whilst also achieving higher order of safety for users. The consumption of a high volume of energy in buildings has resulted in numerous environmental issues which have adverse effects on human survival. The estimation of building energy use becomes necessary to conserve energy and enhance decision-making in reducing energy usage. In addition, constructing energy-efficient buildings will help to reduce the total energy utilized in newly constructed buildings. The machine Learning (ML) technique was regarded as the most suitable method to produce favourable results in forecasting tasks. Therefore, in numerous studies, ML was implemented in the domain of energy utilization in operational buildings. This article introduces an Improved Moth Flame Optimization with Weighted Voting Ensemble Learning (IMFO-WVEL) model for Energy Consumption Forecasting in Residential Buildings. The presented IMFO-WVEL model majorly aims to forecast energy utilization in residential buildings. To accomplish this, the presented IMFO-WVEL model follows the initial stage of data preprocessing to make it compatible with further processing. To forecast the energy consumption in residential buildings, the WVEL technique comprises three DL models namely stacked autoencoder (SAE), deep neural network (DNN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) is used. Finally, the IMFO algorithm is derived by the integration of MFO with the Levy flight (LF) strategy and is applied for the hyperparameter tuning process. The experimental validation of the IMFO-WVEL technique is performed under distinct aspects. The comparison study exhibited the promising performance of the IMFO-WVEL technique over recent approaches in terms of several performance measures.}

In VANET, communications among vehicles and between vehicles and RSUs are done using the dedicated short range communication (DSRC) protocol. However, this technology faces some drawbacks including high latency, limited spectrum, poor scalability and reliability, and network congestion. To this end, many researchers have explored the complementary benefits of long term evolution-vehicle (LTE-V) such as higher capacity and mobility supports, better spectral efficiency, improved quality of service (QoS), and inter-operability to support vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The information transmitted in LTE-V must be secured and the privacy of users protected before the deployment of this auspicious technology. In this research article, a lightweight certificateless authentication and group key agreement for LTE-V is proposed. The designed authentication scheme is constructed without using time-consuming operations. A batch verification technique which reduces the computational burden on the RSU when required to authenticate prodigious messages is introduced. The developed group key distribution mechanism achieves group communication and supports dynamic updating with negligible computation. We prove that the proposed scheme is semantically secure in the random oracle model (ROM) based on the intractability of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP), and demonstrate that it meets all the desired privacy and security requirements. An extensive analysis of the performance shows that the scheme is substantially efficient compared with the state-of-the-art schemes. The performance evaluation through experimental simulation further shows the superiority of the proposed scheme over the traditional IEEE 802.11p-based schemes.}

abstract = {Smart Sustainable Cities (SSC) consist of multiple stakeholders, who must cooperate in order for SSCs to be successful. Housing is an important challenge and in many cities, therefore, a key stakeholder are social housing organisations. This paper introduces a qualitative case study of a social housing provider in the UK who implemented a business intelligence project (a method to assess data networks within an organisation) to increase data quality and data interoperability. Our analysis suggests that creating pathways for different information systems within an organisation to ‘talk to’ each other is the first step. Some of the issues during the project implementation include the lack of training and development, organisational reluctance to change, and the lack of a project plan. The challenges faced by the organisation during this project can be helpful for those implementing SSCs. Currently, many SSC frameworks and models exist, yet most seem to neglect localised challenges faced by the different stakeholders. This paper hopes to help bridge this gap in the SSC research agenda.}

abstract = {Urban energy modelling requires a large amount of detailed data to perform systematic dynamic simulations of a large number of buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency strategies is an important concern for sustainable urban planning. National statistical datasets collect important aggregated data regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data of their territory. However, these data is generally not detailed enough, being available at different scales and in different formats. The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in addressing its energy saving potential. Furthermore, scenario analysis for retrofit or new design is only possible at building scale, highlighting the potential of a bottom-up database. This paper presents the process of collecting, mapping, cleansing and integrating urban data resulting in an UBD to support an information system for Smart Cities. The goal is to reduce the gap between the available urban data and the specific data required to run a complete urban building energy simulation. Key characteristics of an UBD are explored and applied to a case study in Lisbon, Portugal. As a result, a Buildings Dashboard is developed, materializing the UBD user interface. This dashboard allows the interactive visualization and data exploration of the building stock at multiple scales. Future work includes the development of an Urban Scenario category, bringing new insights on urban energy simulation and scenario evaluation to this platform.}

It is assumed that the smart city is a highly competitive city, and the competitiveness of the city should be created in a sustainable manner. The city is a complex, dynamic, and open system, in which both the regulation process within the system and its impact on the environment are necessary. It may be said that the smart city covers some subsystems, all of them linked by mutual dependencies. Creating competitiveness of smart cities is also related to their adaptability, which is not so much about adapting to new challenges but about using new opportunities they create.}

In order to explore these functions as part of the evolutionary development of cities, the Multi-Level Perspective model (MLP) has been applied to map diverse urban scenarios as they transition in terms of past (Evolution), present (Challenges) and future (Directions). Since each city's progression is determined by its unique city DNA profile, each smart city function is modeled by describing and visualizing this progression. In parallel, to support the theory and application of convergence, the inter-relationship of human, technological and natural systems is explored along the dimensions of Object, Action and Outcome to articulate the key variables that influence the trajectory of each smart city's distinct technological evolution and transformation.}

IoT implementation has performed novel opportunities in industries, environments, businesses, and homes. Anomaly detection (AD) is helpful in IoT platforms that can recognize and prevent potential system failures, decrease downtime, enhance the quality of products and services, and improve overall operational efficacy. AD systems for IoT data contain statistical modelling, deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) approaches which detect patterns and anomalies in the data. This article introduces an Improved Bacterial Foraging Optimization with optimum deep learning for Anomaly Detection (IBFO-ODLAD) in the IoT network. The presented IBFO-ODLAD technique performs data normalization using Z-score normalization approach. For the feature selection process, the IBFO-ODLAD technique designs the IBFO algorithm to choose an optimal subset of features. In addition, the IBFO-ODLAD technique uses multiplicative long short term memory (MLSTM) model for intrusion detection and classification process. Furthermore, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) was executed for the optimum hyperparameter selection of the MLSTM model. The experimental outcome of the IBFO-ODLAD method was validated on the UNSW NB-15 dataset and UCI SECOM dataset. The experimental outcomes signified the improved performance of the IBFO-ODLAD algorithm with maximum accuracy of 98.89 % and 98.66 % validated on the UNSW NB-15 dataset and UCI SECOM dataset respectively.}

Based on challenges identified by increasing in the population, industrial growth, and urbanization, there is a need for safeguarding water resources. Hence a blockchain-based system is implemented, which helps to effectively manage the utilization of the water and also helps in handling the wastewater properly by providing an effective sanitation mechanism. Here in the proposed system, the smart water tank and reservoir is designed, which can operate with two modes, viz., the filling mode and the running mode. The user in the smart city is updated periodically about the daily consumption of water with the help of IoT. The system also uses a sensor-based arrangement to formulate the utilization of drinking water by the citizens in the smart city, as many times the drinking water has been utilized for other activities like vehicle washing, house cleaning, plantations, etc. Also, in the aim of effective utilization of drinking water, an automated flow-sensor valve-based system is proposed in this chapter. This system will supply drinking water to each house in a predetermined quantity with dedicated pipelines. The flow sensor calculates the amount of water supplied, and once the limit for a particular house is reached automatically, the valve is shut down. This system also ensures there is no drinking water wastage due to leaking in pipelines through sensors and alerts the concerned person if any such wastage is observed. Hence the drinking water usage can be regulated and scarcity problems can be reduced. The entire system is connected to the cloud for real-time monitoring and indication of abnormalities, which is driven through the blockchain. Thus, the proposed system ensures proper drinking water utilization and reduces water contamination by industries, thereby providing an effective water resource management system powered with the blockchain for security and reliability. Also paving way for enriched water sources and illness free for humankind in smart cities.}

We analyze and see, through which formulas and concepts, governance has adapted to this social changes and how citizens pass from a passive role to an active one. We analyze proved formulas as open government, smart cities, sustainable development goals, and we explain the meaning of new concepts that appear to be put into practice, such as governance or digital governance. We also analyze, and this is the deal of this chapter, how all this changes have influenced in the role of citizens in urban infrastructure in the world of smart cities. What is the role of citizens and how has this evolved in the different phases of implementation of an urban infrastructure. We can see it through theory and practice, but also through concrete examples, real cases of citizen’s role in infrastructures governance. We can also analyze the benefits of this new citizen role: being more involved; more of a participatory; and, more of a protagonist. In addition, the deployment of the infrastructure has its own benefits: greater transparency that diminishes corruption; and, in return, increases citizen confidence. As a summary, in the world of digital revolution and smart cities, citizens have become a fundamental part of the design, implementation, and governance of our cities and, in particular, their infrastructure.}

People flow surveillance provides valuable information about city conditions, useful not only for monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions, but also to optimize the deliverying of city services (security, clean, transport,..). In this context, it is mandatory to develop methods and tools for assessing people behaviour in the city. This paper presents a methodology to instrument the city via the placement of Wi-Fi Access Points, AP, and to use them as sensors to capture and understand city user behaviour with a significant precision rate (the understanding of city user behaviour is concretized with the computing of heat-maps, origin destination matrices and predicting user density). The first issue is the positioning of Wi-Fi AP in the city, thus a comparative analyses have been conducted with respect to the real data (i.e., cab traces) of the city of San Francisco. Several different positioning methodologies of APs have been proposed and compared, to minimize the cost of AP installation with the aim of producing the best origin destination matrices. In a second phase, the methodology was adopted to select suitable AP in the city of Florence (Italy), with the aim of observing city users behaviour. The obtained instrumented Firenze Wi-Fi network collected data for 6 months. The data has been analysed with data mining techniques to infer similarity patterns in AP area and related time series. The resulting model has been validated and used for predicting the number of AP accesses that is also related to number of city users. The research work described in this paper has been conducted in the scope of the EC funded Horizon 2020 project Resolute (http://www.resolute-eu.org), for early warning and city resilience.}

However, the resource constraint nature of IoT devices makes it more difficult to develop secure protocols that can provide a sustainable deployment in practice. This article proposes an authentication scheme extension providing secure control from resourceful cloud servers to devices while also enabling the direct secure communications between them. The scheme is designed to use ECC and low-cost operations to provide efficient resource and energy consumption. The protocol correctness is proven by using a formal security analysis with BAN-logic. Detailed analysis is presented to show its resilience to common attacks. A performance analysis is also given to show the scheme's practical value as it only consumes at most 29 mJ on each device in addition to the amount required by the original protocol.}

The analysis focuses on the impacts of a diverse set of innovative drivers of urban value creation and sustainable solutions for city development (urban functions), which are collectively subsumed under the heading of ‘sustainable smart city’. Recognizing that the dynamics and growth processes related to these urban functions may have different impacts on different types of stakeholders, potentially leading to the emergence of serious conflicts between guests/visitors and residents, we aim to derive model-based implications for urban and tourism management in the cities concerned in order to move towards the sustainable future city as ‘a place 4 all’. The results of our latent growth curve model confirm the existence of different impacts of urban functions on visitors' and residents' attractiveness. Cultural dynamics appears to be a major determinant for attracting new residents and supporting a strong international tourism industry. From an economic perspective, purely economic strength (in terms of absolute growth) appears to enhance city attractiveness for residents, while the dynamics observed in research and development activities influences the quality of employment instead of being a direct driver of population growth. While the social aspects of sustainability (framed under the concept of livability) and the urban environment typically exert higher impacts on urban attractiveness, accessibility appears mostly relevant for visitors. Our analysis suggests an uneasy balance between livability, environment, and population and visitor volume and growth.}

abstract = {The development of modern telecommunications allows the concept of a “smart city” to increase the flexibility of public transportation significantly and, thus, improve population mobility. In this regard, public transportation represents a demand-responsive transit (DRT) system. This system occupies an intermediate position between route systems and taxi services and ensures flexibility in providing on-demand transport services. The article describes the main technologies that can be used in the DRT system, including those with fixed routes (Flexible-Route Segments, Request Stops) and without fixed routes (Demand-Responsive Connector, Feeder Service, Zone Route, Point Deviation). Despite the wide international experience in implementing DRT in practice, there are no clear criteria to determine the conditions, under which it is reasonable to introduce a particular technology of flexible service for passengers. The article systematizes the factors that determine the feasibility of transferring a bus route to the DRT system in particular time intervals and also determines a sequence of actions for the introduction of flexible modes of public transport services. The considered technologies to manage public transportation on demand show that it is possible to combine regular traffic and demand-responsive service, using these modes at different times. Such an approach allows reducing the carrier’s costs while maintaining or even improving the quality of public transportation compared with systems implementing only flexible service modes.}

abstract = {Worldwide efforts have been made to prioritise equal access to hospitals, given its importance to health equality and the necessity of building healthy cities in the post-pandemic society. As the most used spatial accessibility technique to identify the under-served areas, however, the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method was criticised for adopting presumed parameters that might lead to biased and misleading results. With the increasing availability of urban mobility data, it is now possible to incorporate people's actual service-seeking behaviour into the methodological framework of the classic 2SFCA. In this regard, this study proposes a Generalised Flow-based 2SFCA (GF2SFCA) method, which builds upon the demand-driven characteristic of healthcare facilities and utilises underlying patterns in geographical flow data to adaptively measure hospitals' influential range, distance-decay effect, and attractiveness. Specifically, two new indicators, namely, the global popularity index and local preference index, are proposed to synthetically evaluate hospital attraction from the perspective of actual healthcare demand, taking into account visitation counts, travel distance, and the collective preference of communities associated with a hospital. While alleviating certain subjectivity caused by parameters pre-selection, the GF2SFCA framework helps evaluate healthcare accessibility precisely. The experimental results, using Wuhan, China as a case study, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed framework in producing realistic estimations and demonstrated its robustness to the potential uncertainty in mobility data. The data-driven property of GF2SFCA also allows for practical implementation in various contexts, which would benefit the survey of regional healthcare equality and its dynamics.}

abstract = {With the development of Artificial Intelligence, the intelligent vehicle with diverse functions and complex system architectures brings more computing tasks to vehicles. Due to insufficient local computing resources for vehicles, mobile edge computing is seen as a solution to relieve local computing pressure. In the background of Telematics, when the vehicle offloads the computation task to the edge server, the communication time between the vehicle and the base station will become shorter due to the high-speed movement of the vehicle. If the vehicle leaves the current base station before the computation is completed, the vehicle will not be able to obtain the computation results in time. Therefore, a task offloading scheme based on trajectory prediction in the context of Telematics is proposed to solve the problem of short communication time between vehicles and base stations due to high-speed movement of vehicles. The solution combines Long Short Term Memory and convolutional neural networks to predict the base station the vehicle will pass and the time to reach it, which enables the return of calculation results through the communication between the base stations and enables tasks with larger data volumes to be offloaded to the edge server. After simulation experiments, the results can prove that the scheme proposed in this paper is adapted to the intelligent vehicle environment, shows greater stability in the face of large computational tasks and reduces about 25% task latency compared to the traditional task offloading scheme.}

Recent studies have reported that remote monitoring of patients with heart failure disease could help quantify their level of risks and provide useful information for efficient therapy. Additionally, such platforms could help increase accessibility to health care delivery at a relatively lower cost. Therefore this study proposed a context aware clinical decision support model using support vector machine (SVM) for heart failure risk prediction. The proposed model’s performance was evaluated using dataset of potential heart failure patients with metrics including prediction accuracy, sensitive, specificity, and receiving operating characteristic (ROC). An average prediction accuracy of 87.9% and 82.0%, were respectively achieved for the training and testing sessions of the built Radial basis function (RBF) based SVM classifier with a sensitivity value of 76.9%. The results obtained from this study might aid the development of an efficient context aware clinical decision support systems in smart cities and the society at large.}

The design of the architecture follows a design science research approach. The developed concept for the architecture of the platform consists of the following elements: data sources, layers of modular services, integration layer and solutions. Additionally, possible modular services are described. This paper is limited by the fact that the architecture has not yet been implemented and evaluated. However, this is planned for future research. This paper contributes to theory by giving guidance for future research on service platforms and to practice as it shows how available mobility data could be made accessible for mobility solution developers.}

The overall size of the antenna is 32 x 20 mm2. FR4 material is chosen for substrate and PEC material is considered for radiator and ground of MIMO antenna. The proposed antenna has isolation of less than -11.8 dB in the entire proposed frequency band. The proposed MIMO antenna gain of 2.59 dBi and directivity of 3 dBi was obtained.

Comparing pre and peri-pandemic patronage, we identify pronounced social and spatial inequalities in the speed of return to public transport. We find that male, younger and non-White passengers are more likely to return to public transport as soon as movement restrictions were lifted, whereas passengers from White ethnic background and affluent areas do not return to public transport within the first year after the outbreak. Pronounced social inequalities persist into the middle of 2021, and only thence they began to attenuate as part of a wider return to public transport among passengers post retirement age. In 2022, 80% of these passengers have returned to public transport but the frequency of use has remained lower than prior to the pandemic. We discuss implications for transport policy and planning.}

Compared to existing permit systems, the proposed smart city permit framework provides a pre-permitting decision workflow, and incorporates a data analytics and mining module that enables the continuous improvement of both the end user experience and the permitting and urban planning processes. This is enabled through a data mining-powered permit recommendation engine as well as a data analytics process that allow a gleaning of key insights for real estate development and city planning purposes, by analyzing how users interact with the system depending on their location, time, and type of request. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in the integration of a pre-permit processing front-end with permit processing and data analytics & mining modules, along with utilization of techniques for extracting knowledge from the data generated through the use of the system. The proposed framework is completely cloud-based, such that any city can deploy it with lower initial as well as maintenance costs. We also present a proof-of-concept use case, using real permit data from New York City.}

With recent advances in remote sensing especially in the field of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using suitable polarimetric target decomposition techniques, data can be classified for further utilization in remote sensing applications. As a part of this exploration, a study has been taken to understand the utilisation of polarimetric data in building a smart city by exploiting the available resources in a given urban area. Different types of polarimetric decomposition techniques are applied on the data along with polarimetric speckle filters where classification of targets is performed based on the scattering mechanism of the polarized wave with each target in the scene. Encouraging preliminary results were obtained in the study using polarimetric SAR data adding another dimension in planning a smart city.}

abstract = {This article reveals the elite discourse coalition which frames the priorities and institutional arrangements of the Smart Cities Mission in India. After locating the SCM within India's neoliberal urban policy trajectory and the new elite coalition it encompasses I describe three separate elite discourses: Modi's technocratic nationalism IT and consulting firms' technological utopia and middle class urban citizenship. Together the discourses have: shifted the moral sphere of urban policy from inclusive rights to exclusive privilege, privatised governance instead of local democracy and turned digital technocracy into a simplified solution for structural problems of urban inequality. While the elite discourses contest each other on certain areas which could lead to delays and stops in Smart City projects, together they have left the imprint of an elite led governance arrangement for urban planning and development in India.}

abstract = {The economic, urban and social development of the territory that makes up the European Mediterranean area is based on many variables of very different fields. The infrastructure policy, urban growth of cities or sustainable use of land and energy resources are decisions that need to be planned in order to establish priorities to optimize these processes. However, it is important to note that all of these fields are influenced by a multitude of interrelated economic, political or social parameters. Now that numerous protocols are appearing worldwide to develop these processes within cities (the so-called “smart cities”), the real challenge for the future is to make the leap from the urban scale to the regional scale and deploy these policies in an integrated manner, in so-called “smart territories”. This article presents a model of territorial analysis that consists of more than 50 indicators implemented in territorial information systems. The model is based on research conducted in the Otremed project, a multilateral project funded by ERDF and developed between 2009 and 2013 by various countries and institutions of the Mediterranean area. Through the results and tools developed in this project, the so-called GIS retrospective analysis is proposed. This tool, designed to help in decision-making and to advance future diagnostics in territorial management, will allow the development policies of cities to be optimized, generating synergies in transport infrastructures and planning with sustainable criteria in land and other resources use. All these processes will be integrated at regional level with an innovative methodology based on the analysis of territory evolution through referenced geographic information tools.}

An important aspect for the development of smart cities are innovative public policies, represented by requirements, actions, and plans aimed at reaching a specific goal for improving the society's welfare. With the advent of Big Data, the definition of such policies could be improved and reach an unprecedented effectiveness on several dimensions, e.g., social or economic. On the other hand, however, the safeguard of the privacy of its citizens is part of the quality of life of a smart city. In this paper, we focus on balancing quality of life and privacy protection in smart cities by providing a new Big Data-assisted public policy making process implementing privacy-by-design. The proposed approach is based on a Big Data Analytics as a Service approach, which is driven by a Privacy Compliance Assessment derived from the European Union's GDPR, and discussed in the context of a public health policy making process.}

Automatic extraction and updating of geospatial navigation lines from GIS and indoor layout plans are much needed. The navigation path is often stored and conceived as centreline graphs in GIS. However, navigation paths in which the centrelines are located can be considered as a combination of basic navigation polygons. This paper proposed a generic polygonization method that can automatically generate and update navigation centrelines from GIS and BIM. By constructing basic navigation polygons from GIS and decomposing path polygons in street layouts and floor plans from GIS and BIM into basic navigation polygons, indoor and outdoor pedestrian navigation paths and centrelines can be extracted and generated to be used for indoor and outdoor pedestrian navigation.}

abstract = {The partial shadow condition seriously affects the efficiency of the photovoltaic system in the modern city with dense built and other occlusions. From this, the characteristic curve of the photovoltage system shows multi-peak, which further increases the difficulty of getting photovoltaic systems to operate at maximum efficiency. As an efficient technique, the intelligent optimized maximum power point tracking method relies on initialization information and is difficult to balance the tracking performance. Therefore, a hybrid adaptive-prediction maximum power tracking method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the neighborhood range of the maximum power points is located by the fuzzy predicted mechanism at the upper layer. Secondly, on the bottom layer, based on improving the Cuckoo search algorithm, the proposed method uses an interpolation function fitting curve to guide the particles to converge accurately on the bottom layer. At the same time, the output voltage of the system under an open loop is directly controlled by the duty cycle of the control signal, which improves the universality of the method. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to other advanced methods in tracking speed and with smaller power oscillations and comparable tracking accuracy, for which the proposed method is suitable for the city with complex environments and dense buildings.}

The main subject of this paper is to propose an architecture for data processing in Smart Cities. The architecture is oriented on the flow of data from the source to the end user. We describe seven steps of data processing: collection of data from heterogeneous sources, data normalization, data brokering, data storage, data analysis, data visualization and decision support systems. We consider two case studies on crowd management in smart cities and on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and we provide experimental highlights.}

While today's advanced capabilities are certainly more powerful than anything seen in the past, these devices and systems are not fundamentally different from ancient antecedents.

abstract = {The European Union promotes the paradigm of ecological modernization and the effectiveness of eco-innovations (European Environment Agency, 2014). This is evident, in particular, from the political and financial support that the Institution is devoting to smart cities. Thus far, most of the ‘smart’ projects developed in European cities focus on the theme of the environment and its efficient management (European Union, 2014). However, what has not yet been adequately investigated is the issue of the social impact of these smart environmental projects (Beretta, 2014a, b, c). In particular, what seems important is the question of whether the projects with environmental objectives also yield beneficial results from the social point of view, with special reference to the issue of social inclusion. Who are the real beneficiaries of the projects of eco-innovation? Do the benefits extend to all citizens or are they likely to go to only some sectors of the population, often the wealthier ones, risking - among other things - promotion of the phenomenon of eco-gentrification? In more general terms, can we say that smart cities represent the ‘ideal’ settings for the achievement of simultaneous environmental, economic and social development? This paper reports results from research conducted on smart environmental projects implemented in Italy and posted on the national web platform italiansmartcity.it. The project consisted in a qualitative analysis of the environmental projects presented, in order to analyze their social impacts, especially referring to the question of social inclusiveness and the risk of eco-gentrification. More generally, the analysis helps clarify whether the eco -innovations represent an effective tool for achieving sustainable development in the Italian context. Having said that, it cannot be assumed that readers are familiar with the European and Italian contexts. Par. 1 opens with a table that gives definitions of terms which are potentially not clear. It then shows ways that the European Union is institutionalizing eco-innovation and smart cities, remaining on the latest debate on them. Par. 2 highlights the risk of the technological rut the European Union is falling into; par. 3 illustrates the main results of research carried out on the smart cities in the Lombardy Region regarding the social effects of eco-innovations; par. 4 attempts to draw a provisional conclusion.}

New digital technologies together with an economic and organizational transition from closed firms to open platforms has changed the pattern of work within the modern metropolis. The office building is no longer the sole workplace typology and work activity has intensified in other urban locations. The questions then are: "How might smart cities reinterpret workplace culture at the urban scale outside the framework of office buildings typology?" and "Which tools and methodologies can be used to make digital workplace culture visible at the urban scale?" In order to answer these questions, workplaces are observed not as private architectural spaces but as compositions of "subjective urban experiences". A Twitter data analysis provides evidence of workplace spatial culture within the innovative global cities of Amsterdam, London and Paris, interpreted as behavior settings. This analysis shows that office pattern locations are generally distributed independently to knowledge intensive business services and workplace demand, as expressed through social media analyses. In addition to office buildings, transit hubs, urban amenities and new digital services play a key role in reframing workplace location. Moving beyond generic visions for digital work in outer spaces, big data therefore provides specific insights and incentives for considering workplace design at the urban scale.}

This chapter deciphers the meaning of data-driven smart cities by helping to understand the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and the algorithmic disruption in citizens. This chapter helps to understand new forms of Social Innovation slightly surfacing in European cities and regions in light of the post-GDPR data-driven landscape. This data-driven landscape has become dramatically critical in the aftermath of the post COVID-19 era.

It is assumed that in smart city initiatives, new governance modes arise through the interplay of technological artefacts and political and social factors, viewed through a sociotechnical perspective. We also argue that traditional urban governance modes help explain emerging modes and the nature of citizen-government interactions. Thus, a combination of the sociotechnical view with the modes of urban governance as a theoretical approach was used to understand the dynamics of emerging governance modes in smart city initiatives. Two cases were studied using a longitudinal qualitative case study and temporal bracketing analysis for an in-depth understanding. Our findings evidenced that the configuration of the elements, governance mode, information and communication technology (ICT) and types of citizen-government interaction varies from one initiative to another and changes over time, across multiple sociotechnical networks in practice, which leads to emerging new governance modes. We highlight that a new understanding of smart urban governance for sustainable development in the digital age needs to be developed as a dynamic process. Moreover, we identified two emerging governance modes and proposed a dynamic approach to investigate smart urban governance in other contexts.}

It is significantly vital to capture and analyze the data from various resources in smart cities. For instance, the real-time air pollution data are remarkably important in controlling air pollution for urban sustainability and protecting humans against the air pollution damages. However, in reality, the average construction investment and maintenance costs in the air pollution stations are too high. This paper intends to investigate whether and how we can measure air pollution using cost effective means and without using the expensive pollution sensors and facilities. In order to realize such a goal, a predictive model for particulate matter prediction was developed. The proposed model consists of multiple components to integrate heterogeneous multiple sources of urban data and predict the particulate matter based on transfer learning perspective in which neural network and regression was leveraged as the core of the prediction. The results of the particulate matter prediction exposed that while these data sources are capable of proper prediction of the particulate matter, they can also yield better results over the models, which were based only on the features of the air pollution sensors. This work provides an opportunity for evaluation of the model with the urban data from the city of Aarhus, in Denmark, and comparison of the model performance against various specified baselines. The superiority of the model over the baselines shows the practicality of the model.}

However, data privacy and data quality remain significant challenges to assuring the quality of decision-making. This paper introduces a scalable, cloud-based model to provide a privacy preserving anomaly detection service for quality assured decision-making in smart cities. Homomorphic encryption is employed to preserve data privacy during the analysis and MapReduce based distribution of tasks and parallelisation is used to overcome computational overheads associated with homomorphic encryption. Experiments demonstrate that a high level of accuracy is maintained for anomaly detection performed on encrypted data with the adopted distributed data processing approach significantly reducing associated computational overheads.}
