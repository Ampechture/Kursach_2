abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, grassroots digital innovations (GDIs) have gained traction as innovation niches, providing an alternative to the prevailing mainstream regime dominating smart city transitions. Drawing upon interviews with experts and promoters of GDIs from 12 European countries, we explore the relationships between these initiatives and mainstream regime actors. Five distinct types of niche-regime interactions have emerged from the analysis: inertia, indirect support, antagonism, direct support, and active collaboration. These interactions do not follow a linear and incremental trajectory, but rather represent dynamic configurations that change over time and at different geographic scales. Consequently, our findings contribute to the literature on socio-technical transitions and grassroots innovation by further revealing the multidimensionality and multiscalarity of mainstream regimes. In light of these findings, we urge scholars and practitioners to reconsider how information flows and power imbalances among local and supralocal actors in mainstream regimes influence the development of innovation niches and dictate the pace of socio-technical transitions.}

Data transmission delay is one of the biggest challenges in wireless sensor networks. To overcome this challenge, we proposed efficient routing technique for smart waste management system using Enhanced Route Selection (ERS) algorithm which will overcome the data communication delay by considering one of the vital QoS parameter end-to-end delay. The proposed method considers the length of the routing path, link reliability, hop count in the path and energy availability. The proposed architecture is simulated in NS3 Tool and it outperforms than existing methods in the related field with respect to the optimization of End-to-Delay, average remaining energy and average energy consumption.}

Continuous intensification of the multifaceted urban set-up is extensively challenged by real-time processing of data and smart decision capabilities. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a smart city architecture which is based on Big Data analytics. The proposed scheme is comprised of three modules: (1) data acquisition and aggregation module collects varied and diverse data interrelated to city services, (2) data computation and processing module performs normalization, filtration, processing and data analysis, and (3) application and decision module formulates decisions and initiates events. The proposed architecture is a generic solution for the smart urban planning and variety of datasets is analyzed to validate this architecture. In addition, we tested reliable datasets on Hadoop server to verify the threshold limit value (TLV) and the investigation demonstrates that the proposed scheme offer valuable imminent into the community development systems to get better the existing smart urban architecture. Moreover, the efficiency of proposed architecture in terms of throughput is also shown.}

Then for the prediction stage, after clustering the precipitation and flood records in five provinces in Iran, with the application of Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine as Machine Learning (ML) computations, flood disaster is estimated based on rainfall in different climates. Consequently, according to three differen scenarios, the appropriate strategies in Pre-Flood Activities (Pre-FA), During Flood Activities (DFA), and Post-Flood Activities (Post-FA) are prioritized by three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. The outcomes of integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Ward computations illustrate that the rainfall data of different provinces of Iran are heterogeneous because of various geographical and topographical conditions.

Structural equation modeling was applied to a sample of 303 face-to-face interviews with tourists visiting the smart tourism destination of Cáceres, a city that has also been declared a World Heritage site. The results indicate that the original components of the TPB, moral norms and positive and negative emotions significantly impact loyalty and intention to recommend the smart destination. Additionally, the proportion of variance explained shows that including moral norms and positive and negative emotions significantly improve the explanatory power of the original model. The joint communication of information in local campaigns and through social networks offering memorable experiences is the main strategy destination managers should follow in order to promote socially and environmentally responsible attitudes, positive emotions, and a greater intention to recommend the destination and build loyalty to it.}

The concept of smart city has supported a higher quality of urban spaces and a better offering of public services. Smart grid is an important component and the energy supply of smart city. The health of the smart grid will directly affect the health of the smart city. Efficient and accurate prediction about icing level of transmission lines provides a reliable basis for anti-icing and deicing of power grids. The prediction can not only significantly enhance the reliability, safety and stability of transmission networks, but also timely provide the state monitoring of ice on wires to the workers to make proper decisions and to prevent freezing disasters so as to effectively protect people’s safety and build a stable and friendly society. To reduce catastrophic damages caused by the iced transmission lines of the grid, this paper proposed a novel hybrid model called PR-KELM, an integration of Principal Component Analysis, ReliefF and Kernel based ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) method to predict the icing level of transmission lines. This hybrid model covered two stages including: 1) structured and unstructured data feature extraction by local binary patterns, principal component analysis and ReliefF; 2) radial basis function Kernel based ELM predicting the processed data. The experimental data adopted in this paper were from the online monitoring system of South China State Grid Online Monitoring System by terminal CC0289 between December 1, 2011 and March 1, 2016. Experimental results indicated: compared with Elman neural network model, random forest model, support vector machine model and Bayesian networks model, PR-KELM approach demonstrated high accuracy and lower prediction error in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and R (Coefficient of Correlation) while applied to predicting in real datasets.}

In this work, we study smart cities, smart microgrids, city ranking systems, and literature on smart campuses for extracting a list of relevant KPIs as well as propose new KPIs where needed to support the main business process of a university campus. Accordingly, 74 KPIs have been listed which are measurable, achievable, relevant, and time phased. We divide these KPIs among 15 service areas consisting of smart microgrid, smart buildings, intelligent transportation, economic growth, smart governance, propagation model, pollution & waste management, climate resilience, water resource management, financial sustainability, entrepreneurial leadership, enhanced teaching and learning, security and privacy mechanisms, health care provision, and public participation. In addition, we present an example of a university campus from energy consumptions and carbon footprint perspectives. We also highlight the need for long distance, low power communication architecture to support 2-way communication of microgrid and infrastructure with devices installed at remote locations. The aim of this work is to establish a mechanism that allows campus management to monitor the smartness of their university campus in general, and microgrid in particular.}

The idea was first sparked in NASA for space capsules, to test the effect of capsules before using them in orbit. Later, Gartner predicted that in future DT will exist for billions and billions of things. The applications of DTs are found in healthcare, manufacturing, automotive, smart cities, and so on. Smart factory is a digitized urban area that uses various electronic components to collect data, maintain assets, resources, and services effectively and efficiently. The implementation of IoT made DT more popular in digital applications due to its cost-effectiveness and user-friendliness. For smart cities, the DT is most evident and effective from urban planning to optimization of land usage. The plan and implementation of smart factory is simulated using DT to understand the difficulty before exploring in real time. Using digital tools, the architecture, housing, wired and wireless networking, solar lights, solar panels, public transportation, mobile hospitals are planned and analyzed. Thus, the digitized transformation supports in understanding what could be done to improve citizens’ living, supporting in implementation of social technological changes and also creating economic opportunities for the government. The DT for smart factory brings the virtualization visibility on human infrastructure technological interaction, helps understand the fluctuations, and makes DT more smarter from the IoT input data in terms of performance and growth.}

Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) is an advanced version of transportation mechanisms to enhance the benefits mentioned above. Several authors have proposed various security transportation schemes, however, the response time and communication overhead still need to be considered to encourage business developments, and expanding the recycling’s. In this paper, we have proposed an intelligent transportation mechanism that categorizes each device into various categories depending upon its communication behavior using decision based tree making system. Additionally, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) method is proposed to further examine and analyze the continuous flow of data. The proposed mechanism is further validated through MATLAB simulator against number of metrics over a baseline method. The simulated results suggest that the proposed scheme leads to 89% efficiency in terms of better detection of legitimate nodes, altered records, records accuracy and response time during sensing of vehicles.}

Since elevated land surface temperature (LST) is closely related to the physical expansion of developed areas, it is necessary to identify the effects of smart growth strategies on LST. This study, therefore, investigated the relationships between LST, landscape variables, and smart growth variables at the census block group level in two distinct urban locales: the City of Los Angeles, California, and the City of Portland, Oregon, from 2010 to 2018. Through multivariate analyses—including the principal component analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and regression models—this study revealed the potential of urban forms promoted by the smart growth principles comprehensively to mitigate LST. Given the different features of built environments and planning systems between the two cities, the results of this study also indicate the necessity of considering local contexts rather than suggesting a “one-size-fits-all” policy.}

Consequently, this study interrogates: (1) the growing use of city labels in the scientific literature over three decades; (2) the conceptual dimensions of individual city labels and their mutual interdependencies; and (3) likely future trajectories. This is accomplished through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 35 city labels: we examine their (co-)occurrences during 1990–2019 based on 11337 articles harvested in Scopus; analyse their conceptual associations drawing on a corpus of 22820 author keywords; and make a future forecast based on logistic growth modelling (the underlying datasets are available through open access). The findings significantly take forward recent bibliometric research by demonstrating: the rapid growth in scientific outputs; the diversification of city labels beyond ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’; and the evolution of an intricate conceptual field made up of different constellations of city labels. The findings have implications for urban policy and practice: regarding ongoing concerns about how to achieve synergies, rather than trade-offs, between SDGs, the conceptual field points to possible ways for relating SDG 11 to other dimensions of sustainable development. More broadly, the clarification of individual city labels’ conceptual underpinnings should help policymakers and practitioners make considered choices when mobilizing city labels in support of urban transformation efforts.}

It then dynamically writes specific rules for protection against potential cyber threats. The context-aware model is trained on IoT Research and Innovation Lab - Smart Home System (IRIL-SHS) testbed dataset. The labeled dataset is utilized to create a random forest model, which is subsequently used to train and test the context-aware threat intelligence SHS model's effectiveness and performance. Finally, the model's logic is used to gain rules to be included in Suricata signatures and the firewall rulesets for the response system. Significant values of the measuring parameters were found in the results.

The rapid advancement of the digital revolution, normalization of portable smart gadgets, and internet-based communication have resulted in a perceptible shift and enhancement in human spine posture. They have also resulted however, in the emergence of health issues connected to the technique of usage. Neck pain, as well as other related symptoms, are the most commonly reported, as evidenced by the Coronavirus pandemic. People were urged to work from home when educational institutions and businesses were shut down. Students were given access to online learning facilities.
Aim
The aim of this study is to demonstrate and clarify the increase in the number of young patients who suffer from neck pain and its associated symptoms; especially during the COVID 19 pandemic. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of the excessive use of smart portable devices on neck pain and associated symptoms. This is most likely related to the incorrect posture of the neck, spine and body during utilization of these technologies. In addition, it aims to educate people about possible methods to prevent these medical morbidities.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted at Mediclinic City Hospital, Dubai Healthcare City, United Arab Emirates. Fifty-six patients were seen and evaluated as outpatients in the Neurosurgery clinic for neck pain. The Numerical Rating Pain Scale questionnaire (NMQ) was utilized to evaluate neck pain and other associated complaints such as back and musculoskeletal pain in general. The data was collected using a questionnaire with a 100% response rate from the patients. Cross tabulation and Chi Square analysis tool were designed to meet the study’s objective.
Results
The findings show that smart phone and laptop use have significant effects on pain severity ranking among patients. For the factors “Time spent using smart phone/day” and Time spent using Laptop/day” were found to have a P value of 0.041 and 0.023; respectively.
Conclusion
This research found a link between length of time spent using a mobile phone or laptop and the degree of neck discomfort.}

Since the conventional grid has been obsolete and does not give an insight into the energy consumption pattern, no integration of the distributed generation to the grid is involved. Each component of the smart grid system is getting more popular every year. Governments around the world are investing and funding smart grid projects at the initiative level and advanced level. Various countries are developing smart cities and smart grids with the representation of the feature of the smart grid. This chapter gives an insight into the status of the smart grid in different countries of the world. The status of the components of the smart grid from 2010 to 2020 is also given in this chapter.}

abstract = {In modern Smart Cities, pervasive collection of sensor-based and IoT data streams is a challenging opportunity for improving mobility resilience. Among the potential applications, sensor-based data streams provide valuable information about the quality of the area-wide road surface. Modern vehicle black boxes are also able to estimate the type of anomaly (e.g., bump, hole, rough ground, depression), based on real-time analysis of acceleration data streams. Road maintainers may use all this information to improve monitoring and maintenance activities. However, the volume of data streams, the variety of road network and different degrees of seriousness of detected anomalies call for methods to support maintainers in the exploration of available data. To this aim, in this paper, we propose a methodological approach, based on big data exploration techniques. The approach is grounded on: (i) a multi-dimensional model, apt to organise data streams according to different dimensions and enable data exploration; (ii) data summarisation techniques, based on an incremental clustering algorithm, to simplify the overall view over massive data streams and to cope with their dynamic nature; (iii) a measure of relevance, to focus the attention on road portions that present critical conditions. The innovative contributions regard the formalisation of the exploration methodology, the definition of exploration scenarios, based on road maintainers’ goals and the measure of relevance, and an extensive experimentation on a real world case study, addressed in a research project on smart and resilient mobility. Experimental results show how relevance evaluation is able to efficiently attract the road maintainers’ attention on road portions that present the most critical conditions and the proposed incremental clustering algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in the literature.}

In this regard, the open innovation model seems to provide efficient support for the involvement of private firms in public collaborations, by ensuring that there is efficiency and affordability in the delivery of new and ‘smart’ city services. This inquiry aims to fill a gap in the main field of research: only a very few studies have tried to analyse the challenges encountered, and the strategies followed, by firms developing open innovation strategies with public partners in Smart City Projects (SCPs). In trying to fill this gap, exploratory and qualitative analysis was performed on the decision-making processes of multinational companies participating in SCPs. This study uses a multiple-case research method, based on 21 in-depth semi-structured interviews with the smart city managers of seven large multinational companies. With reference to and in line with these cases, interesting predictions emerge relating to public–private collaborations and the creation of different forms of explorative and exploitative project alliances in cities. In particular, companies that develop alliances with public partners consider the open innovation model to be a testbed for future technologies and the development of products and services, by supporting positive knowledge spill-overs that reduce the technological gap between the private and the public sector and − at the same time − stimulating the development of a smart city ecosystem when firms are looking for the cross-fertilization of ideas. The research sheds light on public–private partnerships and the open innovation approach in a new and complex context, that of the smart city, reframing managerial debates concerning innovation-driven collaborations between the private and the public sector.}

The information flow generated requires an efficient communication system. Long Range (LoRa) protocol sends information across long distances with very low energy consumption. For this reason, it is especially interesting to implement in street light (SL) installations. This research designs a control, monitoring and energy saving system for SLs composed of three devices: Gateway for Street Lights System (GWSLS), Operating and Monitoring Device for Street Lights (OMDSL), and Illumination Level Device (ILD). Street Lights Regulation (SLR) algorithm was developed to dynamically control the lighting level. Lighting levels are selected using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm, which is fast, reliable and accurate. Measured data is sent to the GWSLS gateway by the OMDSLs installed with the LoRa network and uploaded to the cloud using Firebase.}

The study found that smart energy has a specific and significant impact on energy poverty, but the effect differs in different regions depending on the construction cycle and energy endowment.

Japan is now heading toward a population decrease and a highly aging society. The elderly population over 65 years old will exceed 40% by 2055. Medical and social welfare cost is skyrocketing. The nationwide automobile dependency established over the past half a century resulted in the low-density sprawl to wide suburban areas and hollowing out of the downtown area. Now, Japan is facing serious mobility problems, especially among the elderly who cannot continue to drive. Although the fatal traffic accidents in Japan decreased to less than a quarter of the peak in 1970, the elderly casualties are increasing to more than half of the total traffic death.
Description of Program
A new community revitalization program called "Smart Wellness City" (SWC) was started by a group of mayors and academics in 2009. The main purpose of the program is to build a city where "walkability" is the central theme in order to enable citizens live healthier and happier. Factors to realize SWC are: Provision of public traffic infrastructures including walkways, natural trails, bikeways and public transit to reduce car dependency; Restructuring of urban form toward compact cities where people can interact to create social capital; Increasing health literacy of all citizens through community fitness programs involving outdoor activities (population approach); and objective evaluation scheme to assess the result based on the data analysis with comprehensive health/medical evidence.
Outcomes
Now the member municipalities have increased to 62. Many of these municipalities proved the effectiveness of SWC program especially among elderly citizens. They are enjoying the benefits of delaying frailty in both physical and mental level, and enhancing the restored community spirits. Other important benefits of SWC are the cost savings in health care sectors, and revitalization of downtown activities including commercial sales increase.
Implications
The success of SWC influences the formation of a new program called "Smart Wellness Community" in 2015 including national and local governments, private industries and academia to further expand the movement to nationwide level. It will become a model for many countries to cope with problems caused by the increase of aging population.}

To fill this gap, this paper develops a co-existence-based methodological framework to systematically explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of group travel behaviour. We apply our framework to a case study of Shanghai, China, using a one-month tranche of metro smart card data. Results show that most travellers perform a small number of group trips, together with a small number of co-travellers. They usually travel in a dyad or triad group and form far more small social communities than large ones. Group travel behaviour is distinctly different from individual travel in terms of both time and space: group travellers are more likely to travel during weekends, on holidays, and in the afternoons and evenings. They also prefer to perform group behaviour near stations located in the city centre or the centres of new towns in suburban areas, and close to attractions and public facilities. The analysis we present has various potential applications such as improving the management of public events and supporting the design of group ticket policy.}

The tool presented here can coordinate different sub-systems in a district to avoid the violation of high-level system constraints and is designed in a generic fashion to enable transferable use across different energy sectors. The work demonstrates the potential for a single open-source optimisation framework to be applied across multiple energy vectors, providing local government the opportunity to manage different assets in a coordinated fashion. This is shown through case studies that integrate low-carbon communal heating for social housing with electric vehicle charge-point management to achieve high-level system constraints and local government objectives in the borough of Greenwich, London. The paper illustrates the theoretical methodology, the software architecture and the digital twin-based testing environment underpinning the proposed approach.}

The presence of such networks opens the way for a wide range of applications such as safety applications, mobility and connectivity for both driver and passengers to exploit the transport systems in a smoothly, efficiently and safer way. For safety applications the best routing protocol must be selected. The three most common routing protocols that are used in VANET are: DSR, AODV and DSDV. Indeed, it is important and essential to test and evaluate different routing protocols related to VANET system before applying them in the real environment which can be done via VANET simulation tools. This paper evaluates the performance of three different routing protocols for VANET system in city of Khartoum. The performance is evaluated and compared in terms of PDR, average throughput, delay and total energy. Our objective is to estimate the performance of routing model for city scenario. The main goal is to find the suitable routing protocol in a high density traffic area in Khartoum. We have considered three routing protocols DSR, AODV and DSDV. The results indicate the poor quality of DSDV protocol which is a type from proactive routing protocols. The AODV protocol achieves maximum average throughput which is equal to 330.07 Kbps. The minimum value of delay obtained from using DSR protocol was 15.81 ms.}

To monitor the energy consumption across various domains and assist efficient energy distribution and storage, it is necessary to integrate various ESG agents’ ontologies. To this end, this work models ESG’s Ontology Matching Problem (ESG-OMP) as a discrete Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP), which simultaneously optimizes the alignment’s completeness and correctness through determining an optimal entity corresponding set. After that, a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm With Competitive Mechanism (MOPSO-CM) is proposed to address this issue by trading off the alignment’s completeness and correctness, which introduces the CM to update the particles with the pairwise competition that performed in the swarm of current generation. Moreover, an instance-based hybrid similarity measure is used to distinguish the heterogeneous ontology entities. The experiment uses OAEI’s testing datasets, 13 smart grid’s ontology matching tasks and 5 energy smart grid’s ontology matching tasks to test MOPSO-CM’s performance. The experimental results show that MOPSO-CM can effectively address various heterogeneous ontology matching problems and determine high-quality ESG’s ontology alignments.}

abstract = {Large-scale sensor and data acquisition systems, integrated with deep learning methodologies, play a pivotal role in enhancing the sustainability and security of smart city environments, exemplifying the critical significance of anomaly detection techniques. Anomaly detection in complex industrial scenarios presents various challenges, such as intricate working environments, limited anomaly samples, and lack of a priori information. Unsupervised anomaly detection based on knowledge distillation enables anomaly detection using only normal samples. However, the similarity in structure between teacher and student models, along with identical input data flow, hampers accurate anomaly detection and localization. To address these issues, we propose MNMC, an unsupervised anomaly detection model consisting of a mixed noise generation module emulating real defects, a mutual constraint module, and an anomaly segmentation module. Firstly, to enhance the student network’s ability to learn robust features, we construct a hybrid noise model comprising dead-leaves noise and perlin noise. This generates features with structural texture and distributional characteristics closer to real anomalies. Secondly, we design a mutual constraint framework to further improve the learning ability of the student network for normal features by constraining representations containing only a single noise. Lastly, for the detection of anomalies at different scales, we propose a new evaluation metric based on equal importance of normal and anomalous regions. Through ablation experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the simulated real defect generation module and the mutual constraints module. Performance experiments on the MVTec dataset show that our method achieves competitive results compared to the current state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.}

How do these new technologies enter our communities, and when they do, how do they complement or disrupt existing activity? This paper provides a framework for addressing these questions, building on a case study of the automated pizza vending machine that is proliferating in France. Relying on an exclusive and newly constructed database, we examine the diffusion of smart pizza vending machines across over 30,000 French communities. Contrary to our expectations, we find that neither the large, dense, and most connected urban centers nor the rural areas with limited access to food options are the first adopters of these machines. Instead, small but well-connected communities, with attractive consumer bases but which lack 24/7 amenities, are at the vanguard of the adoption of this "frugal" IoT innovation -- i.e., one that requires little capital investment but potentially meets widespread demand. Furthermore, we find that independent business owners and small entrepreneurs are the early adopters of the new technology, but they act as forerunners for larger corporate actors. Based on these findings, our proposed framework highlights the decentralized and bottom-up processes that give rise to the rapid penetration of frugal IoT technologies and their associated socio-economic effects.}

abstract = {Many smart applications, including smart cities, healthcare, smart agriculture, manufacturing, etc., have widely adopted the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart Farming (SF) integrates a set of technologies, such as cloud and edge computing and greenhouse concepts, to improve agricultural processes. Due to its capacity to generate fresh agricultural products at an incredible pace of development and output, the greenhouse business has recently attracted the attention of the farming community. However, the cost of labor and energy consumption causes the greenhouse’s production cost to rise by roughly 40%–50%. To avoid this, SF concepts have been introduced. Data management in SF has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its high potential for more accurate and cost-effective agriculture. Traditional client–server and cloud-based data management systems are plagued by single faults, data protection, centralized data management, and system vulnerabilities. In this paper, an IoT-based framework is proposed for SF to improve the productivity of crops. AI-based precision model is introduced in the framework, which can be integrated with remote sensor data for correct prediction of crop growth in smart agriculture. The result shows that the random forest model works better with 97% accuracy compared to Support Vector Classifier (SVC) have 93%, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have 90%, and Logistic Regression 84%. This technology helps to reduce costs while also improving the overall quality of the agricultural process and product management with blockchain-based supply chain management to enhance farmers’ economic backdrop. The blockchain performance is evaluated on gas consumption, execution time, throughput and latency.}

abstract = {The placement of routers and gateways in wireless communication networks for Smart Grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a complex problem often addressed in the literature through heuristics, clustering, or linear programming approaches. In large-scale scenarios, the complexity is directly related to the region’s number of smart meters and poles. The terrain profile can introduce signal quality degradation between a smart meter and the routers and gateways, further complicating the problem. This study presents the AIDA-ML method, representing a preliminary step toward developing an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) for an effective positioning strategy. AIDA-ML incorporates a feature engineering-based strategy and utilizes machine learning algorithms to learn from the results computed by a heuristic method called AIDA. The heuristic approach is too time-consuming, relying on external resources like numerous terrain profile API calls and a deep understanding of wireless communication loss models. To implement a machine learning-based and more straightforward approach, a feature engineering process is employed to capture the operational characteristics and results of the analytical method while requiring less processing time. Through experiments conducted with real-world data from 26 cities in the state of Paraná, Brazil, comprising 466,237 smart meters and 352,867 poles, the results obtained using machine learning algorithms suggest that AIDA-ML can ensure the connection coverage of smart meters while meeting the same minimum requirements established for the analytical method. Moreover, AIDA-ML offers the advantage of reducing the processing time by 87.60% and by 96.86% the overall search space size compared to the heuristic approach.}

Revamping innovative cities can contribute to this goal, but empirical evidence in this area is limited. Therefore, this paper scrutinizes the innovative city pilot policy’s consequences on firms’ export performance and product quality. We employ the time-varying Difference in Difference (DID) model and harness a comprehensive firm-by-product level database to estimate the co-movement between the pilot intervention and the performance of the export product. Based on the findings, we unveil that a smart intervened city can significantly boost firms’ export product quality, which still holds after multiple robustness checks. Furthermore, innovative cities heighten the quality of the manufactured products when we consider firm-level (i.e., private, foreign, and ordinary trade enterprises), industry-level (i.e., low-polluting, capital-intensive, and technology-intensive industries), and regional (i.e., Middle, and Western regions) heterogeneities. In addition, the intervened smart city strategy impacts the efficacy of export product quality through policy and innovation-driven effects. Over and above, policymakers and experts should support state-of-the-art ideas while considering local conditions, providing guidance for decision-making in China’s innovative development strategy.}

abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) technology continues to advance, it has found widespread application in various fields, including smart health, smart cities, and smart transportation. Among these applications, smart homes are particularly noteworthy due to their intimate connection to our daily lives. However, the use of smart devices in a home environment exposes users to various security threats, such as impersonation attacks and insider privilege attacks, as users must communicate with multiple devices through a public channel. Additionally, traditional authentication schemes that rely on trusted third-party present a single point of failure, as users and smart devices must be registered and authenticated by a central authority. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized, tamper-proof, and flexible solution for authentication and access control of data. By using blockchain, the single point of failure problem in traditional authentication schemes can be resolved. In the context of smart homes, the real-time nature of the environment necessitates the use of fog nodes to provide localized computing services. Fog nodes are closer to IoT devices than cloud nodes, making fog computing more efficient and faster than cloud computing. This paper proposes an authentication scheme for blockchain-enabled fog nodes in smart homes. The scheme involves registering all fog nodes and intelligent devices on a local private blockchain, and authentication is performed jointly by smart contracts on the blockchain and off-chain operations. The scheme provides comprehensive security and better performance, as demonstrated by security analysis and performance evaluation. Moreover, the proposed scheme offers a certain level of user privacy protection.}

Various drivers have enabled this transition, including sustainability concerns, scarcity in resources, economic considerations, and rapid growth in enabling technologies of sensor networks, and computational and communication systems. Two notable examples of such infrastructures are smart grids and smart cities. The idea behind a Smart grid is the creation of a dynamic, cyber-physical infrastructure that meets the challenges of intermittency and distributed availability of renewables, and realizes reduced operational costs and emissions, via a flexible, intelligent, and networked grid that plans, controls, and balances supply and demand over an entire region. The concept of a Smart City is gaining popular attention driven by goals of sustainability and efficiency, the needs of enhancing quality of life and affordability, growing urbanization of the world’s population, and the explosion of technological advances in communication and computation. While systems and control problems abound in any complex dynamic system, two characteristics that are specific to critical infrastructures are the need to deliver reliable service and the ability to accomplish this goal amidst constrained resources. These in turn lead to new research topics in systems and control including empowered consumers, transactive control, and resilience. The focus of this paper is on these emerging topics. Their role in smart infrastructures, the opportunities they provide, and the research challenges that they bring in are all discussed. Specific illustrations of recent successes are presented that are based on coordinated adjustment of generation and consumption using concepts of multi-agents and multi-timescales in smart grids and socio-technical models of empowered drivers in smart cities.}

The literature on mobility focuses on developed countries relative to large cities, so the focus of this research is in smaller population sizes. This research aims to propose a new approach for the selection of urban mobility projects in medium-sized cities, from the perspective of intelligence and sustainability, based on multi-criteria decision-making methods. The model is composed of 43 evaluation criteria and uses the multi-criteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for assigning weights to the criteria, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method for solving the decision matrix, and the 2-tuple linguistic model for processing the qualitative information. An application of the approach is performed with four mobility projects in a medium-sized Brazilian city. The main highlight of the proposed approach is a predefined set of evaluation criteria, allowing context decision-makers to select the most appropriate criteria for the specific projects that will be evaluated.}

The quantitative analysis disclosed that regardless of location, overcoming private vehicle use, user aversion to multimodality, and reluctance to share rides with strangers' presence significant barriers to some smart mobility options. Furthermore, respondents in inner ring areas of cities have more positive views towards public transport, the environment, and smart phones, while the middle/outer ring residents on the contrary have more positive views towards private vehicles.

Each unit is controlled and managed through a distributed decision-making structure. The BES agent is governed by an intelligent structure based on a reinforcement learning model. To facilitate interaction and coordination among agents, a tendering process is employed, where each agent, under its supervised control structure, presents its offer for the tendered item at each time period. The tendering organization allocates demand using the first-price sealed-bid algorithm among bidders to optimize energy cost in the Microgrid. The proposed approach offers a real-time intelligent system capable of ensuring fault tolerance, stability, and reliability in the Microgrid.

abstract = {Due to its widespread serviceability, the sensor network receives considerable interest. Within smart cities featuring multiple, collection and transmission, the function of the wireless sensor system is generally significant. Effective evaluation architecture is an automated process for monitoring individual consumers' power usage. The required information was typically transmitted through Wireless LAN (WLAN) media. In addition to gathering and detecting, this is one of the main characteristics of an Advanced Meter Infrastructures (AMI) network. If the connection and node will be in the right condition, effective communication is feasible. In most of the existing methods, network congestion and occurrence of fault in continuous communication are main drawbacks. To overcome these limitations, the Grid Topological Network Architecture to give an efficient route if there is a fault-tolerance networking system is presented in this work. The experiment exhibits improvement based on the energy usage and package distribution concerning the reduced and highly compressed Networking Routing Algorithm and the Ad-Hoc On-Demand Vector Method. From the results it is observed that delivery loss, mean response and delay response is lowered by using proposed method and it is proven to be efficient as compared to the exiting methods. Delays, dependability, expandability, integration, flexibility, delivery prioritization, accessibility, ease of application, and tracking of the proposed method are compared with the existing methods like RPL, AODV and it is proved that the proposed scheme exhibits better performance.}

abstract = {Energy efficiency is a critical problem that drives consideration of smart cities and urban areas' development. Energy security and the smart environment face enormous problems because of the dramatic rise in energy consumption brought on by rising population levels and the widespread use of new data-collecting technologies. Traditional smart grids can be updated with IoT-based smart metering (SM) and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technologies by revealing previously hidden information about electrical power by implementing a communication system between utilities and consumers during the power transaction process. The smart distribution and energy consumption in smart city environments are strongly supported by the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Hence, this paper suggests the IoT and AI-assisted Smart Metering System (IoT–AI–SMS) as a new data acquisition equipment for predicting energy consumption in smart cities. The information is taken from Energy Efficiency Datasets to examine smart cities' energy consumption. This research offers a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for load forecasting using smart meter data. This technique allows training a single model with all participating smart meters without exchanging local information. Considering the customers' needs, the model developed scheduled the controllable loads and offered optimal dispatch of distributed generation in the smart grid.}

These prevailing issues will worsen over the coming decades as the urban population is increasing at a phenomenal rate, thus highlighting the urgency to take appropriate actions. Smart development has been identified as a sustainable world-wide solution to the existing urban planning issues, whose principles aims at providing a better quality of life and advertises livable communities; though the concept is vague to define, as no universal definition exists. The soul reason for the concept to be vague is the number of dimensions in which it is represented and therefore, the concept needs to be standardized in order to scale development worldwide. India has undergone rapid urbanization over the last few decades and the witnessing cities are mostly of Class-I & II tiers. To cater the issues developed by this phenomenon, the governing authorities have taken up initiatives over the years, in the form of programmes that have mainly focused on providing basic infrastructure services and utilities to the cities and have not paid much attention in achieving sustainability in the approach. Recently, India has introduced the smart city mission, which is somewhat on the similar lines of smart development. Since the development is been interpreted differently among the nations due to no standardization of the concept, it’s important to understand how the concept has been represented in the Indian context. The paper intended to analyse the concept of smart development and explore the sustainability quotient in the smart city mission introduced by the Government of India. And, concluding that whether the initiative taken up, achieves sustainability in the field of urban planning. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, an in-depth analysis was conducted of the various concepts associated with smart development.}

Smart buildings (SB) use resources efficiently, save energy, and provide services to the community more easily for their occupants while reducing their environmental footprint. Smart cities have benefited from this growth in terms of smart buildings. Maximum accuracy and reduced latency are both required for smart building monitoring systems. Poor scheduling rules can lead to network congestion and latency that is too high for real-time monitoring on construction sites, which have restricted computing and networking capabilities. These devices can collect the data on on-site actions, achievements, and circumstances and send it back to the central dashboard for analysis. Model predictive control and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have significant drawbacks, and DRL addresses some drawbacks. Researchers are intrigued by DRL, a brand-new approach to quality control. The most important considerations for developing smart power grid systems are energy conservation, renewable energy integration, and a streamlined control system. Experiments have shown that the new video surveillance has a low loss rate and a consistent latency. The DRL-SB-IoT technique can successfully track multiple cameras in a wide monitoring situation. This technique results in excellent tracking performance and meets the criteria for developing an intelligent campus in the best way possible. Researchers analyzed studies using supervised learning to solve common building issues, such as health monitoring, security on building sites, accommodation modeling, and energy consumption prediction. Reinforcement learning has been used to solve these issues. The proposed method advances the smart gateway channel of 97.5%, the energy storage ratio of 96.9%, and the overall surveillance performance ratio of 98.6%.}

They are often used by travelers to switch transportation means, visitors to access curbside properties, and municipalities to place roadside infrastructure. The promotion of multi-modal transportation and the emergence of new mobility services have complicated both curb environments and their management. Consequently, some cities have started to explore new strategies for curb management, but lacked the anticipation on how different curb regulations and built-environment features may collectively influence curb-use patterns across user groups. We make a step toward smart curb environment by proposing a graph-based deep learning approach, i.e., MultiGCN-LSTM, to predict diverse curb uses across time and space. We used two graph convolution layers and an LSTM layer to capture the spatial, temporal, and semantic dependencies between curb regulations, built-environment semantics, and diverse curb uses. Two place-specific models were developed separately for a medium-sized college town and a metropolitan in the U.S. The effectiveness of the proposed models was validated with ablation studies and demonstrated in three scenario experiments. The research contributes to smart curb management in the face of more diversified and intensified curb uses with new mobility services and emerging vehicular technologies.}

However, existing research focuses on passive perceptions and lacks comprehensive insights into the dynamic relationships between smart park services and user interaction. To address this gap, this study aims to discuss classification standards for smart service facilities in urban parks, develop a research model to analyze visitor usage patterns, identify factors influencing their continued engagement with smart parks, and rank visitors' recognition of smart service facilities within parks. Using Lianhuashan Park, Shenzhen, as a case study, structural equation modeling was employed to validate visitors' intentions to continue using the smart park. The findings revealed that expectation–confirmation indirectly affects visitors’ intentions by mediating variables such as satisfaction, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and privacy. Perceived ease of use emerged as the strongest influence. Among the five categories of smart park service facilities, landscape interactive facilities had the highest correlation with the overall smart technology experience in parks. This study proposes a new theoretical research model, identifies directions for optimizing service quality in smart parks, and addresses the limitations of previous studies that focused on technology while neglecting user experience.
Management implications
The management of smart parks involve a variety of disciplines including IoT, big data statistics, ergonomics, remote sensing science, etc. It requires the cooperation of multidisciplinary personnel, which greatly increases the difficulty of facilities management in the smart parks. Moreover, the smart park system is not perfected enough, lacks certain theoretical support, and there are few excellent cases. This research applied the ECM-ISC extended model to the field of smart park research, which will help promote the user-friendly and sustainable development of smart parks and provide visitors with a more comfortable environment and better services. This study suggests that park managers and decision makers should promote the continuance intention of smart parks by increasing visitor satisfaction and increasing investment in landscape interactive facilities.}

It has been challenging to achieve high assurance in system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certifiability due to the necessity to create complicated MCPS that are safe and efficient. The MCPS system is shown in the paper as a newly developed application case study of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Applications for various CPS-based healthcare systems are discussed, such as telehealthcare systems for managing chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, hearing loss, and respiratory diseases), supporting medication intake management, and tele-homecare systems. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough overview of the essential components of the MCPS from several angles, including design, methodology, and important enabling technologies, including sensor networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and multi-agent systems. Additionally, some significant applications are investigated, such as smart cities, which are regarded as one of the key applications that will offer new services for industrial systems, transportation networks, energy distribution, monitoring of environmental changes, business and commerce applications, emergency response, and other social and recreational activities.The four levels of an MCPS's general architecture—data collecting, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action—are shown in this study. Different encryption techniques must be employed to ensure data privacy inside each layer due to the variations in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer. We compare established and new encryption techniques based on how well they support safe data exchange, secure computing, and secure storage. Our thorough experimental study of each method reveals that, although enabling innovative new features like secure sharing and safe computing, developing encryption approaches significantly increases computational and storage overhead. To increase the usability of newly developed encryption schemes in an MCPS and to provide a comprehensive list of tools and databases to assist other researchers, we provide a list of opportunities and challenges for incorporating machine intelligence-based MCPS in healthcare applications in our paper's conclusion.}

In recent years, the role that Information and Communications Technology (ICT) could play in advancing participatory planning has been widely acknowledged. The literature suggests that several factors are affecting the introduction of DPP into smart city planning. This study examines organization-related and society-related factors, aiming at identifying the level of maturity towards the introduction of DPP in cities, with particular attention to small European cities. These two groups of factors were examined in Schiedam, Netherlands via a mixed-methods approach and analyzed using NVIVO and SPSS software. The results suggest that for cities to be mature enough to introduce DPP, there should be an existing good practice of conventional participatory planning where the concept is extensively practiced, as well as a relatively high trust in the community engagement processes and sufficiently high digital technology literacy among the residents. Thus, maturity levels in cities should be assessed and policies should be developed accordingly to ensure a successful transition toward sustainable smart cities, in light of the findings reported in this study.}

The algorithm is tested with real data. Some results of the simulation are presented.}

abstract = {The transition towards Electric Vehicles (EVs) is connecting previously unrelated technologies. We combine an approach to transitions with economic geography, to explore how colocation can support the emergence of coevolution between EV-related sectors. We study technological and geographical relatedness between electric vehicle, battery, smart grid, and combustion engine inventions between 1980 and 2020. Geographical colocation of related technologies can signal coevolution between firms and inventors, that is specifically visible in some classes of cities that we identify. Finally, we fit a multiple regression to estimate the impact of cities’ patenting in related technologies on EV patents. Results show increased relatedness inside cities and growth of colocation in time between electric vehicle, battery, and smart grid patents, demonstrating that relatedness is dynamically evolving during transitions. We also find that combustion engine capabilities are still relevant to support this transition, suggesting path interdependence between cities’ innovative sectors.}

Scotland’s Place Standard, BREEAM-Communities assessment tool and the Smart City technologies for co-production in urban planning and design are analysed through literature review. Aktivniy Grazhdanin, a citizen engagement portal, established to devolve decision-making on aspects of Moscow’s urban planning to citizens, provides a case study on the potential use of online tools to solicit citizens’ views on the city management and transformation. Tools were selected as they provide participatory frameworks for developing consensus among decision makers and stakeholders on planning strategy, but use different methods - Scotland’s Place Standard initiates a dialogue with interested groups; BREEAM-Communities includes a consultation with stakeholders at a later stage; and Aktivniy Grazhdanin attempts to solicit stakeholders’ views by using online tools. Comprehensive criticism in the research of Kitchin (2014) and Angelidou and Psaltoglou (2017) identified themes around ownership, governance and participation that informed the line of questioning in the case study. The research highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the analysed tools. It recommends how frameworks can be best shaped by such tools to achieve local ownership and provide structure for a more inclusive urban planning.}

The present work reveals the need for designing “sustainably smart” instead of “smart” road networks, referring to the adoption of “smart” technologies in the context of sustainable mobility. Aiming at highlighting problems due to improper or inefficient implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in urban environment, the most crowded and congested street of Thessaloniki (Greece) is studied. It is characterized by severe pedestrian delays and high imposed pedestrian speed at crossings, due to ITS which ensure high priority of motorized traffic over pedestrians at signalized intersections, thus improving vehicle travel times, but highly extending pedestrian waiting times and minimizing green-man phase duration, resulting in significant loss of pedestrian man-hours and in increased safety risk for them. The existing situation is assessed and proposals towards the implementation of the notion of “sustainable intelligence” in a “smart” urban road network, turning it into a “sustainably smart” urban road network, are made.}

To bridge this gap, this research project aims to propose an assessment framework to measure the smart readiness of neighborhood which can make a significant contribution in structuring and valuing existing potential technologies and smart solutions through various conceptual levels of smartness. This framework is developed using a mixed method approach through three phases: i) creating the taxonomy of smartening KPIs; ii) assigning weights to the KPIs by formulating determinant indexes reflecting sustainability and ESG targets (Customized based on four well-known certifications namely, LEED, BREEAM, DGNB, and GRESB); iii) introducing an output-based measurement method; finally, the framework is tested on a case study. The implementation of the smartening assessment framework through the different use of smart solutions and technologies resulted in a progressive sum of scores which emphasized the importance of stakeholders' engagement in planning smartening scenarios. This framework empowers managers and policymakers to clarify the objective level of smartness mostly through different social and environmental aspects and quantitatively distinguish the critical differences between smart and smarter neighborhoods.}

This highlights the need for innovative approaches to effectively address and mitigate the consequences of such seismic events. Here, I propose the development and utilization of tent as a cost-effective and viable alternative to traditional and high-rise cement-based constructions, aiming to reduce earthquake damages. With a rich history in nomadic practices, tents can be strengthened by integrating cutting-edge technologies that make them adaptable, climate-responsive, and earthquake-resistant solutions. By using natural materials like wool and cotton enhanced with waterproof and fireproof properties, tents can provide both comfort and versatility in various weather conditions. The goal of habitation is to furnish a secure and comfortable living space with essential amenities for safety and well-being. Tent-based communities could present an eco-friendly housing alternative and reduce the impact of destructive earthquakes by minimizing debris and rubble. In warm regions, tents can serve as year-round habitable spaces. Establishing tent cities or villages in such areas can effectively mitigate earthquake damages while also promoting sustainability and a healthy lifestyle. Skillfully extrapolating and adapting traditional urban design to tent-based materials could offer the potential to construct fully functional smart-tent cities that provide contemporary living comforts and safeguard against earthquakes and climate challenges. With modern manufacturing capabilities and urban planning, tents can benefit from advanced design principles to deliver safety, comfort, and an enduring ability to weather adverse climate conditions and earthquake damages.}

Cities become smart, but at the same time it is not considered the quality of data that these devices send over the internet. The authors, starting from the experience gained previously, in this work focus on energy efficiency, and in particular how energy measurements are performed and sent. The authors propose a low cost smart electric meter for the measurement of electrical parameters.

Smart places (cities, districts, neighbourhoods, ecosystems) depend on the way digitalisation disrupts systems of innovation in cities, making it more open, global, participatory and experimental. We argue that the rise and interconnection of various types of intelligence (artificial, human, collective) could bring profound changes in the way smart places are being created and evolve. In this context, cyber-physical systems of innovation are deployed through multiple nodes acquiring digital companions, collaboration is deployed over physical, social, and digital spaces, and actors can use complex methods guided by software and get insights from data and analytics. The paper also presents the case study of OnlineS3, a two-year Horizon 2020 project, which developed and tested a digital platform composed of applications, datasets and roadmaps, which altogether create a digital environment for empowering the design of smart specialisation strategies for local and regional systems of innovation. The results indicate that digital transformation allows the operationalisation of multiple methodologies which have not been used earlier by policy makers, due to lack of capabilities. It can also increase the scalability of indicators facilitating decision making at different spatial scales and, therefore, better respond to the complexity of innovation systems providing dynamic and scale-diverse information.}

Wireless circumstance is the main way for the transmission data in collection process, and it is undoubtedly insecure. The problems that protecting the consumption data in smart grid and tracking some special users simultaneously are still open issues. We propose a novel scheme for smart grid involving three kinds of entities: Smart Meters (SMs), Electricity Utilities (EUs), and a Trustful Anchor (TA). In this scheme, SM encrypts the periodical consumptions and its identity, and sends the information to the relative electricity utility, and then EU can get the consumptions of smart meters in its scope. If necessary, TA may disclose the identities of the special smart meters. The security of this scheme is illustrated by formal proof and security property analysis. After expressions of performance and network simulation, it is easy to see that our scheme is suitable for practicality.}

Our research introduces a Dynamic System Management (DSM) framework tailored for CDCs, encompassing a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) management unit, a load balancing unit, and a task scheduling unit (TSU). The TSU employs a stochastic Petri net-based planning procedure and advances a 'role-based' resource placement approach, optimizing task scheduling for enhanced system performance and energy efficiency. Through comprehensive simulation tests, we validate the proposed system scheme. Furthermore, this paper extends its focus to augment the resilience of energy policies in the context of smart cities and foster community engagement. Building upon the existing Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), we propose enhancements to fortify its robustness and capabilities. Notably, our modified BBO approach demonstrates remarkable reductions in power consumption—27%, 32%, and 39% less when compared to BBO, particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithms, respectively. These findings underscore the pivotal role of data-driven energy transition and community engagement in building resilient cities for the future.}

The object of the research was to find out how Smart Village ideas and projects are taken up by the local development stakeholders, in which fields the smart solutions are regarded as most desirable for the implementation, and what the barriers which occur in pursuing these projects are. To this end, the project methodology applied the stakeholder analysis through questionnaires submitted to key stakeholders for the development of the village municipalities, which included selected village mayors and experts from the ministries and regional governments, including representatives of local action groups that associate with the municipalities in the village areas. The research concluded that the smart projects pursued are most often associated with the forming of resilient communities and environments. Furthermore, the results pointed out that the mayors are more cautious about the implementation of smart projects than the experts. The mayors consider them more critically, they lack financial resources for their implementation, and they are unsure of their standpoints on smart projects, also due to poor information. The mayors would welcome improved institutional and counselling support from the state and regions facilitating the decision making process in the field of selecting suitable smart solutions and contributing to more intense use of smart solutions in the development of village municipalities.}

abstract = {The human-centric philosophy is considered a crucial development direction for smart Product-Service Systems (smart PSS). Smart PSS has effectively advanced the circular economy by enhancing user experience, incorporating servitization and digital servitization, and extending product lifecycle, among other key aspects of sustainable development. However, there is currently a lack of a reasonable, accurate, and actionable framework and methodology to express the human element, namely user profiling, within this philosophy. To address this gap, this paper utilizes statistical methods such as factor analysis, cluster analysis, and regression analysis, building upon the concept of traditional user profiling. The aim is to integrate the three prominent approaches of goal-oriented, scenario-based, and data-driven user profiling, with the goal of complementing each other and designing a top-level user profiling framework for smart PSS. Furthermore, Industry 4.0 technologies and text mining techniques are employed to collect data on users' product and service usage. As these data contain real-time information about user needs, behaviors and goals at different time periods, they can be used to construct dynamic features of user profiling, and ultimately achieve the construction of dynamic user profiling for smart PSS. To validate the proposed user profiling framework and dynamic user features of smart PSS, this paper presents a case study focusing on the user group of maternal women. This case study promotes the in-depth exploration of smart PSS research in expressing the human element.}

Smart Energy Systems (SESs) have emerged as crucial tools for addressing climate change, integrating smart grids and smart homes/buildings to improve energy infrastructure. To achieve a robust and sustainable SES, stakeholders must collaborate efficiently through an energy management framework based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Demand Response (DR) is key to balancing energy demands and costs. This research proposes an edge-based automation cloud solution, utilizing Eclipse Arrowhead local clouds, which are based on Service-Oriented Architecture that promotes the integration of stakeholders. This novel solution guarantees secure, low-latency communication among various smart home and industrial IoT technologies. The study also introduces a theoretical framework that employs AI at the edge to create environment profiles for smart buildings, optimizing DR and ensuring human comfort. By focusing on room-level optimization, the research aims to improve the overall efficiency of SESs and foster sustainable energy practices.}

Since the development of such policies is challenging, there is a need to learn from the experience of many cities around the world offering efficient and successfully adopted smart mobility services. However, in practice, the information provided about such initiatives is shallow and unstructured. To address this issue, we study the state of the art in mobility services, reviewing scientific publications and 42 smart mobility services delivered by nine smart cities around the world, and we propose a taxonomy for planning and designing smart mobility services. The taxonomy provides a common vocabulary to discuss and share information about such services. It comprises eight dimensions: type of services, maturity level, users, applied technologies, delivery channels, benefits, beneficiaries, and common functionality. The contribution of the proposed taxonomy is to serve as a tool for guiding policy makers by identifying a spectrum of mobility services that can be provided, to whom, what technologies can be used to deliver them, and what is the delivered public value so to justify their implementation. In addition, the taxonomy can also assist researchers in further developing the domain. By identifying common functionality, it could also help Information Technology (IT) teams in building and maintaining smart mobility services. Finally, we further discuss usage scenarios of the taxonomy by policy makers, IT staff and researchers.}

The employment of internet of things (IoT) technologies has proven to be a valid response to mobility challenges in rural areas, and has brought up the concept of “smart land”. Framed within the context of the Interreg Central Europe project RUMOBIL, this study tries to shed light on how the deployment of smart mobility solutions within the rural context compare to that within the urban context. Following a literature review, we compared the ease of implementation of different IoT solutions on the urban and the rural contexts, for planners, travellers, and operators, and the relative complexity of common smart mobility issues. In addition, we identified three major challenges for both rural and urban mobility, namely the need for standardized metrics for optimal routes' detection and a dynamic definition of optimal route, as well as the simplification of investments' planning and programming. Both smart cities and smart land can benefit from smart mobility solutions, even if in most cases, each of the two contexts can gain more advantages than the other from the same solution. Even considering the different levels of population scattering, technological infrastructures, social maturity, and economic opportunities, both rural and urban areas offer comparable advantages. For the future of transport, it is up to all policy levels to consider the challenges deriving from expected trends and leverage the untapped potential of IoT technologies to satisfy future travellers’ needs and ensure sustainability.}

First, we present results of a scoping review we conducted to describe mechanisms by which features in urban built and social environments are hypothesized to contribute to lung cancer and skin cancer. We systematically searched fourteen electronic databases, yielding 47 articles that examined associations between built and social environment features and lung cancer (n = 34), and/or built and social environment features and skin cancer (n = 13).

abstract = {Cloud of Things (CoT) emerges as a pivotal paradigm, connecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the Cloud Computing space, facilitating the efficient management of smart cities. In navigating the intricate landscape of smart city environments, this paper confronts two paramount challenges— heterogeneity and privacy preservation. Heterogeneity, rooted in the diverse origins of CoT devices from various vendors, intro- duces compatibility gaps and data format variations, impeding seamless communication among devices. Simultaneously, privacy preservation concerns itself with averting the inadvertent disclo- sure of sensitive data generated by CoT devices. Existing solutions often exhibit limitations in effectively addressing both challenges concurrently. To bridge this gap, our proposed solution employs a novel ontology-based approach, commencing with the introduc- tion of a groundbreaking ”Ontology” using the Protege software. This foundational tool serves a dual purpose—standardizing and unifying general and privacy-related information among diverse CoT devices. The ontology addresses the heterogeneity challenge by fostering a shared understanding and vocabulary, promoting interoperability for smoother communication among disparate devices. Complementing the ontology, a privacy-preservation method, implemented with ”MININET-WIFI” and grounded in Modular Arithmetic, dynamically adjusts the privacy-preserving rules of each CoT device. This adaptive mechanism signifi- cantly enhances security, mitigating the risk of unintentional data disclosure—a critical aspect evaluated extensively within the context of a widely used CoT application, specifically, the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) environment. The computational cost is meticulously evaluated, showcasing that our solution introduces a modest overhead, notably below 1.8 s, compared to alternative models. Furthermore, the penetration rate analysis reveals the solution's resilience against honest but curious Remote Service Units (RSUs). Communication overhead is quantified for various privacy-preserving methods, providing a comprehensive view of the solution's performance. Through rigorous simula- tions, encompassing assessments of communication overhead, computational costs, and penetration rates, our solution exhibits not only affordability for a diverse array of CoT devices in smart cities but also heightened resilience against malicious activities and adversaries, surpassing current studies. This paper, therefore, not only presents a novel ontology-based solution but also delves into the nuanced intricacies of heterogeneity and privacy preservation within CoT-based smart cities. The proposed approach, characterized by its dual focus on standardization and dynamic privacy adaptation, signifies a significant stride towards fostering secure, interoperable, and privacy-aware CoT ecosystems amid the dynamic landscape of smart cities.}

abstract = {Sustainable smart living (SSL) is a crucial component in the emergence of smart cities. These cities offer potential solutions to address pressing urban challenges, including traffic congestion, energy consumption and environmental degradation. Recently, many SSL frameworks have been developed based on multiple factors. However, no framework can simultaneously address all these factors. Furthermore, no research has ranked and graded the identified SSL frameworks to select the most sustainable framework. These are considered challenging tasks. To address these challenges, three-way decisions (TWD) and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) can serve as a valuable solution for city planners and decision-makers. This study introduces TWD-based MCDM as novel conditional probabilities by opinion scores (CPOS) within the context of circular-Pythagorean fuzzy sets (C-PFSs), namely, C-PFSs-CPOS method, to estimate the conditional probability of each alternative. Additionally, Bayesian decision theory within a C-PFS environment is employed to construct the decision thresholds for each alternative. Furthermore, the prioritisation of factors that impact the ranking and grading of SSL frameworks is achieved through the application of the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) method within a C-PFS environment, namely, C-PFS-FWZIC method. A total of 37 SSL frameworks (alternatives) are evaluated on the basis of 19 assessment factors (criteria) distributed in 4 layers. Results show that six alternatives exhibit a high level of sustainability, as evidenced by their position in the positive region, whereas two alternatives consistently fall within the negative region for all σ values. At σ=0.05, the remaining SSL framework alternatives are positioned within the boundary region. When σ value increases to a range of 0.55–0.59, TWD is transformed into a two-way decision-making. Sensitivity and correlation analyses are conducted to evaluate the stability and robustness of the proposed methods.}

From the discussion on the smart village, it is concluded that digitization is only possible if a reliable and robust network and communication infrastructure is installed in the village area.}

These systems implemented architectures without considering the geographical distribution of each air quality monitoring station, increasing the uncertainty of the forecasting framework. This study developed an integrated spatiotemporal forecasting architecture incorporating an extensive air quality PM2.5 monitoring network and simultaneously forecasts PM2.5 concentrations at all locations, allowing the monitoring of the health risk associated with exposure to these levels. First, this study uses a graph convolutional layer to incorporate the spatial relationship of the neighboring stations at their current state with real-time measurements. Then, it is coupled to a deep learning temporal model to form the long- and short-term time-series graph convolutional network (LSTGraphNet) model, anticipating high pollutant concentration events. This work tested the proposed model with a case study of an existing ambient air quality monitoring network in South Korea. LSTGraphNet model showed prediction performances of PM2.5 at multiple monitoring stations with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.82 μg/m3, 4.46 μg/m3, and 4.87 μg/m3 for forecasting horizons of one, three, and 6 h ahead, respectively. Compared to conventional sequential models, this architecture was superior among the state-of-the-art baselines, where the MAE decreased to 41%, respectively. The results of the study showed that the proposed architecture was superior to conventional sequential models and could be used as a tool for decision-making in smart cities by revealing hotspots of higher and lower PM2.5 concentrations in the long term.}

It draws on expectancy disconfirmation theory with data collection from two studies. Findings reveal a triadic model of service failure in smart eateries with respect to core smartness failure, smartness servicescape failure, and smartness interactivity failure. These primary failure categories are attributed to patrons’ overexpectations from smart services, as well as their personal needs and smart performance-induced cognitive evaluations. Importantly, social media hype seems to play a major role in customers’ overexpectation. This research on one hand enriches the discourse on smart dining and restaurants, while on the other hand, it bridges the gap between smart service and service failure by providing a field inquiry to answer questions such as why smart services fail and how usage of technology could backfire when services are dominated by smart devices with little employee intervention. In essence, this work contributes to the smart service literature by understanding the drawbacks of technology.}

abstract = {Thermodynamic assessment of cities is presented based on the classic concept of cities. Energetic analysis of cities is a challenging task, due to the lack of a concise, general thermodynamic parameter to evaluate energetic output streams that is applicable to every city. Therefore, exergetic efficiency was applied as comparative index, given that it encompasses concepts of first and second laws of thermodynamics, thus providing a figure of merit similar to those applied to equipment and thermal systems. The proposed concept was employed to assess five cities, classified by its main economic sector: power plant city (Foz do Iguaçu), industrial city (Ingolstadt), sink city (Hawaii), service city (Florianópolis), and petroleum city (Singapore), the last being also classified as a Smart City. Results show that the power plant city presented low CO2 emissions (1.553 ton CO2equi/person-year), high global exergetic efficiency (98.77 %), but low internal exergetic efficiency (17.26 %). The service city presented similar behavior, with low emissions (1.104 ton CO2equi/person-year) and also low internal exergetic efficiency (19.49 %). The sink city presented the highest emissions (13.51 ton CO2/person-year) and an intermediate internal exergetic efficiency (28.02 %). The smart city presented a high global exergetic efficiency of 85.3 %, due to mainly the good performance of its refinery sector, but at the same time presented high emissions (9.730 ton CO2equi/person-year). The industrial city presented the highest WtE (Waste-to-Energy) yield of 6.210 GJ/person-year, thus improving its internal exergetic efficiency in about 6 %. Comparisons among the five cities show a linear trend of increasing per capita CO2 emissions with increasing per capita generation of municipal solid waste. Also noteworthy is a similar figure of per capita CO2 emissions normalized by destroyed exergy within the city (3.1 ton CO2equi/TOE) for four cities, while for the industrial one this figure is 5.73 ton of CO2equi/TOE, caused mainly by a broad utilization of electric mobility. Regarding limitations of the proposed methodology, it is clear that exergetic assessment of power plant and petroleum cities demands further study, since the calculation of their exergetic efficiency as a global figure impairs the proper observation of internal exergetic flows. Also, the analysis of the industrial city is complex because it is difficult to define usefulness of industrial production in terms of thermodynamic properties. As general conclusion, the study shows the broad applicability of exergetic analysis to assess any city, despite its economic function, geography or other characteristic of interest.}

Data-driven cyber-attack strategies like the false data injection attack (FDIA) can modify the states of the grid, hence posing a critical scenario. With an accurate knowledge of measurement subspace, this work demonstrates an effective blind FDIA formulation strategy. The current trend in the identification of such attacks is generally confined to their presence detection within the measurements, while their intrusion points remain concealed. To alleviate this concern, this study promotes an effective execution of novel robust, nonlinear deep learning models which can not only effectually identify the presence but also the exact locations of intrusions of blind attacks in real-time while working concurrently with the conventional bad data detector, thus furnishing a cost-effective approach. Moreover, such neural network models demonstrate a multilabel classification strategy by capturing the inconsistency with co-occurrence dependency of the attack vectors introduced into the raw measurements. Furthermore, these deep learning structures prove to be model-free, hence attacks can be determined without any statistical knowledge of the grid. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated utilizing the standard IEEE test bench undertaking diverse noise and attack scenarios.}

UBEM is becoming a valid policy support tool to guide planning and intervention efforts at the neighborhood and city scale. However, current UBEM workflows focus primarily on the physical properties of buildings and geospatial geometry data without consideration for socioeconomic factors or demographic characteristics of the modeled/studied areas. This limitation impedes UBEM's effectiveness as a policy support tool. This paper presents a novel method – using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on smart meter and census data – to develop hourly usage schedules for different socioeconomic personas. The schedules can be used to refine building archetypes for UBEMs. The method is piloted in two cities with similar building stocks but different socioeconomic compositions. It was found that socioeconomic indicators are important in classifying building archetypes. Considering these indicators changes the predicted city-wide energy use for residential buildings by up to 10%. The method presented is scalable and applicable to cities and municipalities worldwide (large or small) and elucidates the importance of accounting for demographic and socioeconomic indicators to reflect lived realities accurately.}

What was once a dream for the future has now become reality. However, the need to provide these smart services quickly, efficiently, in an interoperable manner and in real time is a cutting-edge technological challenge. Although some software architectures offer solutions in this area, these are often limited in terms of reusability and maintenance by independent modules —involving the need for system downtime when maintaining or evolving, as well as by a lack of standards in terms of the interoperability of their interface. In this paper, we propose a fully reusable microservice architecture, standardized through the use of the Web of things paradigm, and with high efficiency in real-time data processing, supported by complex event processing techniques. To illustrate the proposal, we present a fully reusable implementation of the microservices necessary for the deployment of the architecture in the field of air quality monitoring and alerting in smart ports. The performance evaluation of this architecture shows excellent results.}
