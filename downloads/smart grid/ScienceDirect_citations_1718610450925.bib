abstract = {While policies and academic interest in smart cities gain momentum, there remain significant gaps in practice and academic conceptualisations explaining it as a new source of innovation. Moreover, there is a need to synthesise reporting behaviours and tools thereof, supporting communication and transparency for citizens along with their involvement in innovation processes. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country analysis highlights gaps in transparency, reporting and communication of results, and the consequent allocation of resources in smart cities. Thus, this study identifies literature streams embracing the notion of smart cities and reporting. It employs a bibliometric and structured literature review analysis. Accordingly, this study proposes a framework comprising four macro-areas, several micro-elements, and the most appropriate implementation of technologies for sustainability challenges. Notably, it contributes to strengthening the smart city as an unconventional source of innovation, providing policymakers an opportunity to account for the smart city's weaknesses and identify areas for significant improvement efforts to be channelled.}

The cities with high population density (Metro cities inclusive) specifically face the problem of finding the nearest available parking space. The rising number of vehicles daily makes this problem more severe that questions the safety of vehicles as well. In this study, the issue of finding parking spaces in smart cities is addressed using an IoT-based methodology. The proposed Intelligent Parking System (IPS) consists of an IoT framework that collects real-time data, send it to the cloud, and thereby suggests to the user a suitable place for parking the vehicle at a nearby location. As a component of the framework, a mobile application has been developed that enables users to check the availability of nearby parking spots and subsequently reserve a parking place. This paper also describes different use-cases of a person for finding a parking space and parking it in right place. The proposed system has been implemented using Raspberry Pi, NodeMCU, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Infrared (IR) sensors. The results discussed in the later sections support the usability of this IPS.}

Transitioning to a low-carbon heating system is critical to the forthcoming generation of energy systems and future carbon–neutral cities. It has been observed that the development of unban centralized heating systems includes both the diversification of energy sources and the development of “smart heating.” This paper firstly summarizes recent work in smart heating technology in the urban centralized heating system, which is representative of large-scale infrastructure smartification during the ongoing smart city transition as observed. It then delves into the essential cyber-physical system technologies that underpin smart heating solutions. Building on this foundation, the discussion pivots to the transition from smart heating to smart IES, examining four critical dimensions: the design of IES digesting renewable energy, the modeling of its dynamics, the vulnerability of multi-energy coupling, and the smartification of its operation control. The efficacy and limitations of this approach are demonstrated through empirical analyses of both real heating systems and park-scale IES cases. This paper should provide both theoretical and practical guidance for the integration of multi-energy systems and smart technologies to achieve comprehensive renewable energy utilization.}

Developing a smart network infrastructure is thus becoming a key component for the better development and efficient governance of smart cities. The main objective of this article is to examine the feasibility of utilizing moving vehicles to develop an efficient Vehicular-based Virtual Network Infrastructure (VVNI) for smart cities. The basic idea here is to divide the whole city into distinct cells, then predict and evaluate the vehicle eligibility to act efficiently as a centralized communication and information hub for each cell. Specifically, we present the basic framework of the proposed VVNI, and identify the corresponding efficiency requirements in terms of service availability, cost, and quality; then we introduce novel metrics to characterize the vehicle's ability to cope with these requirements. Several simulation scenarios were conducted to assess the efficiency of the proposed VVNI. The simulation results demonstrate how the proposed model outperforms existing models and improves system performance in three benchmark areas: throughput, packet delivery ratio, and latency, especially in medium- and high-density network scenarios with slower vehicle velocities. The simulation results are promising to further enhance the development of the proposed network infrastructure.}

In this novel study, we investigate the effect of China's smart city policy on household daily consumption and carbon emissions. The empirical analysis is based on a difference-in-differences regression, in which the dependent variable is the household indirect carbon emissions estimated based on the consumer lifestyle approach and a dataset of 201 Chinese cities between 2010 and 2018. The main findings are as follows. First, the smart city policy significantly reduces household indirect carbon emissions, and the reduction is greater when the policy pilot region includes the whole city rather than only certain subareas. Second, the mechanisms through which the smart city influences household indirect carbon emissions are mainly the reductions in transportation- and education-related emissions resulting from developments in smart technology. Third, the above effects last for years, and they are regionally heterogeneous and more significant in the cities of eastern China. The findings in this paper suggest that smart cities can potentially achieve city sustainability by promoting greener consumption behavior.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization and the growing tourism industry in the Himalayan region have raised significant concerns about the sustainable handling and management of solid waste in the area. This concern is particularly pronounced in the unique and vulnerable ecosystem of cities nestled in the eastern Indian Himalayas, where geography, ecology, and socio-economic factors converge to create distinctive challenges. This study undertakes a thorough investigation of solid waste management practices and challenges in two smart cities nestled in the eastern Himalayan region of India, specifically Gangtok and Namchi. The primary objective was to unveil the complex challenges confronting these cities by conducting an in-depth exploration of waste management practices. This comprehensive investigation was achieved through the collection of samples, conducting surveys within each ward of the cities, and performing physicochemical characterization analyses. The study also proposes a solution-oriented approach leveraging life cycle analysis. Despite the Himalayan backdrop, waste generation varies significantly, with Gangtok producing substantially more waste (50 tons per day (TPD)) compared to Namchi (4.6 TPD). Both cities excel in waste collection, but Gangtok leads in proactive treatment, with 22% (11 TPD) undergoing composting and recycling. However, shared challenges at riverside disposal sites, including overfilled dumpsites and leachate contamination, pose potential environmental hazards amid the Himalayan allure. Organic waste predominates at 40.9% and 40.01% in both cities, indicating composting potential. Plastic closely at 22.25% (Namchi) and 22.65% (Gangtok) was way above the global (12 %) and national (8.4 %) average respectively, emphasizing the urgency of plastic waste reduction strategy. The 16.95% cardboard in Gangtok highlights potential commerce-related waste. The study also highlights the importance of comprehensive policies for informal sector well-being. The lifecycle assessment of Namchi and Gangtok reveals significant methane emissions (99%) from waste anaerobic decomposition potentially due to poor source segregation. Implementing a futuristic waste strategy reduces emissions by 38% in Namchi and 40% in Gangtok, through biogas utilization and renewable energy adoption. The findings advocate for citizen engagement, improved collection, targeted campaigns, and circular economy principles. To ensure sustainability and resilience in waste management within mountain regions, tailored strategies such as material recycling facilities, community engagement initiatives, and landfill diversion mandates should integrate ecological, socioeconomic, and logistical considerations, fostering awareness and participation among communities.}

Spatial correlation analysis revealed a notable autocorrelation of rental housing prices in Hefei, exhibiting a distribution pattern of decreasing values from the city center outward. Besides, the impact of 13 factors on house rent was examined. Overall, factors such as building area, proximity to wet markets, and distance from the top three hospitals were demonstrated to exert the most significant influence on rental housing prices in Hefei. The decision-making of smart cities needs to be scientifically analyzed to find out the factors affecting the price of rental housing in the region, and the research conclusions can provide certain references for urban decision-makers in the overall management of urban resources and targeted solutions to regional housing rental and other issues.}

The mechanism analysis suggests that SCC affects corporate employment through factor substitution rather than job creation by promoting digital capitalization and capital and technological factor substitution. Further analyses indicate that SCC primarily reduces the number of low-skilled and non-production employees and has a stronger impact on local private, old, and industrial firms. We also find evidence of labor reallocation effects of SCC. Overall, the results highlight the trade-off between promoting SCC and mitigating employment challenges and the role of data as a new production factor in the digital economy era, providing important policy implications for stakeholders.}

In Brazil, few studies have addressed this issue. Thus, here I analyze the political agenda and economic dynamics involved in the transformation of Brazil's second largest city, Rio de Janeiro, into a climate-smart city. I develop an original conceptualization of “techno-utopian smart city” and apply this framework to analyze the case of Rio. Empirically, I perform a thematic content analysis, including the coding of policy documents, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest that the smart city agenda is still limited to address the challenges of climate change. While smart city and climate policies have been sparsely integrated, “smart” urbanism has privileged the financial, economic, and political dividends of a techno-driven urban transformation, rather than focusing on citizen well-being, climate change mitigation, and adaptation. My conceptualization and empirical analysis suggest that Rio de Janeiro has been i) framing climate governance as a technical issue instead of a complex social challenge, ii) neglecting the environmental footprint of smart technologies, and iii) collecting citizens’ private data with low levels of transparency.}

Communities can indeed address problems linked to urbanization thanks to this technology through the Smart City concept and thus support a sustainable development of their cities. Artificial intelligence and namely its machine learning branch is expected to reinforce this trend by making smart cities even smarter. However, smart cities can only be successful if they can be trusted and, with this in mind, machine learning can potentially be an efficient tool to mitigate cyberattacks. This paper can be divided into two main parts. In the first part the ability of Gradient Boosting and Deep Learning to make long-term predictions of noise level is studied based on noise data collected in the suburb of an English city. In the second part, we proposed an approach for detecting noise levels anomalies based on predictions. Two types of injections were taken into consideration namely punctual noise level attacks and gradual noise level attacks. Specifically, for the punctual attacks, when the difference between the actual sensed and predicted noise levels is greater than a given threshold, we considered that there is an anomaly in the data. For the gradual attacks, we used a criterion comparing the mean absolute error of predictions in the attacked set of data to statistics of the absolute error in the training set. The obtained results show that our approach, which uses a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) hybrid network for the noise level prediction, can effectively be used to detect the aforementioned types of anomalies. In the case of punctual attacks an increase in sound intensity of 5 dB was detected, while for gradual attacks, smaller changes can be detected.}

abstract = {The Smart city is important for sustainability. Governments engaged in developing urban mobility in the smart city need to invest their limited financial resources wisely to realize sustainability goals. A key area for such sustainability investment is how to implement and invest in emerging technologies for urban mobility solutions. However, current frameworks on how to understand the impact of emerging technologies aligned with long-term sustainability strategies are understudied. This article develops a simulation-based comparison between different cities and autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption scenarios to understand which aspects of cities lead to positive AV implementation outcomes. As urban mobility and cities will become smart, the analysis represents a first attempt to explore the impact of AVs on a large scale across different cities around the world. Archetypes are formed and account for most, if not all, world cities. For three of our archetypes (car-centric giants, prosperous innovation centers, and high-density megacities), promoting AV-shuttle use would deliver the greatest advantage as measured by improvements in the model's KPIs. To develop urban powerhouses, however, micromobility would deliver greater benefits. For highly compact middleweights, a shift from private cars to other non-AV modes of transportation would be the smartest choice.}

The expert assessment of 34 portals representing 22 smart cities, with 36 features, allowed us to rank them and determine their level of transparency maturity according to four predefined levels of maturity - developing, defined, managed, and integrated. In addition, recommendations for identifying and improving the current maturity level and specific features have been provided. An open data ecosystem in the smart city context has been conceptualized, and its key components were determined. Our definition considers the components of the data-centric and data-driven infrastructure using the systems theory approach. We have defined five predominant types of current open data ecosystems based on prevailing data infrastructure components. The results of this study should contribute to the improvement of current data ecosystems and build sustainable, transparent, citizen-centered, and socially resilient open data-driven smart cities.}

To establish a sustainable urban existence, smart cities use some new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Drones (IoD), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The created data by these technologies are submitted to analytics to obtain new information for increasing the smart societies and cities' efficiency and effectiveness. Also, smart traffic management, smart power, and energy management, city surveillance, smart buildings, and patient healthcare monitoring are the most common applications in smart cities. However, the Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approach all hold a lot of promise for managing automated activities in smart cities. Therefore, we discuss different research issues and possible research paths in which the aforementioned techniques might help materialize the smart city notion. The goal of this research is to offer a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of smart city and society management, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that require further investigation and consideration. IoT, cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, IoD, IoV, and hybrid models are the seven key emerging developments in information technology that, in this paper, are considered to categorize the state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the Conventional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are the most commonly used ML method in the publications. According to research, the majority of papers are about smart cities' power and energy management. Furthermore, most papers have concentrated on improving only one parameter, where the accuracy parameter obtains the most attention. In addition, Python is the most frequently used language, which was used in 69.8% of the papers.}

The extensive experience with the benefits that these advanced urban roads provide informs decision-makers toward efficient investments in advanced systems for urban roads. However, there is no tool designed to evaluate the developmental status of urban roads in a smart city. Therefore, this study has developed a hierarchy table of indicators and measures specific to assessing the current status of urban road innovation for smart cities. A keyword network analysis was used to develop the hierarchy table. The procedures take three phases: data preparation, data analysis, and hierarchy table development. As a result, the hierarchy table includes 53 measures in 14 indicators connected to the five smart city components (e.g., environment, mobility, governance, economy, and living). The hierarchy table can be used for city officials to assess the current status of urban roads in the transition of a smart city, which leads to an explicit investment decision on urban road innovation. The procedures presented in this study can be adapted to develop indicators and measures for other service areas necessary for a smart city.}

The prior literature stresses the importance of environmental policies, yet less attention has been paid to digital policies required to drive eco-innovation and their spatial dimension in the context of a developing economy. Our results show that, when digital policies (artificial intelligence and internet of things) are implemented in cities that have adopted strict environmental policies, the production of green patents increases. We contribute to debates in the literature of policy mix for sustainability transitions in the context of a developing economy by illustrating the importance of both types of policy for eco-innovation, as they correct two market failures and, more importantly, address the systemic coordination problems that occur during the production of green patents.}

Renewable energy storage, the solar, wind, and distributed resources can be better integrated into the grid. The leading theory in the digital domain for improved and broad use of all the situations with high digital media accessibility (i.e., video, sound, words, and pictures), nevertheless it is challenging to talk freely about such small appliances because of resource constraints (starving power and battery capacity), and large quantities of the information. The green communication approach for the smart city (GCA-SC) is proposed in this article. Thus, using saved video streams to solve these difficulties is recommended by Hybrid Adaptation and Power Algorithms and Delay-tolerant Streamed Algorithms. A new architecture is similarly proposed for the smart city network. Empirical findings such as power drainage, battery capacity, latency, and bandwidth are acquired and evaluated. It was reached that, with less effort than Baseline, GCA-SC optimises energy drainage, the battery capacity, variance, power delivery ratio of the IoT compatible gadgets in the smart city environment. The simulation analysis of the proposed GCA-SC method enhances the packet delivery ratio of 39% and throughput of 99 kbps. It reduces the delay by 2.5 s and the standard deviation by −0.9 s.}

Results display the SCP contributions to promoting urban green and low-carbon development. When we run the various robustness tests, the conclusions remain valid. The heterogeneity test shows that, in large cities and resource-based cities, the promotion effect is more obvious. We further test its transmission mechanism and find that SCP enhances urban green and low-carbon development by raising urban technical innovation levels, upgrading the construction of smart infrastructure and optimizing the quality of smart management and services.}

The results revealed that compatibility, service quality, and relative advantage have positive effects on the perceived usefulness and usability of smart city services. On the other hand, complexity and unreliability have negative direct and indirect effects on intentions to use smart city services. These findings can guide the decision making of local officials and technology developers when creating smart city services.

Recent WHO global air pollution guidelines highlight air pollution as a critical environmental threat along with climate change. To address these threats, smart cities and clean air programs are on a rise. In smart cities, data and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are major drivers of city transformations. The 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing have the potential to accelerate these transformations toward urban resilience. However, the success of smart cities and clean air programs depends on cohesive multi-sector stakeholder contributions. This study conducted interdisciplinary participative stakeholder analysis to understand the data, and sectorial challenges, to outline the technological opportunities to facilitate clean air programs in Indian smart cities. The research highlights gaps due to siloed stakeholder operations, lack of data calibration, non-alignment of smart city and air quality management services, non-availability of health exposure data, and difficulty in translating scientific data into implementable actions. Stakeholders expressed potential ‘fit for the purpose’ use of IoT devices, satellites, smartphones, and mobility data augmented by AI methods in bridging these gaps. The analysis points toward a need to develop an easily accessible and ubiquitous urban data governance ecosystem enabling seamless cross-sector data exchanges to build trusting relationships among the stakeholders across the air quality management value chain}

The empirical results show that under the dual-pilot policy, the urban carbon emission reduction efficiency is significantly improved, and the efficiency is higher than that under the single-pilot policy. Dual-pilot policies of the low-carbon city and smart city can create a synergistic emission reduction effect by improving the level of urban digital innovation, market-oriented innovation, and industrial innovation. The carbon emission reduction effect of Dual-pilot policies has regional heterogeneity and is more obvious in the eastern cities in China.

Children's and young people's positions in smart cities are unstable and, depending on a project's agenda, ever-shifting – at the centre of a bottom-up movement, on the fringes of top-down planned programmes. This article revolves around the everyday experiences of children and young people and explores how they encounter life in a smart city district. It draws on observations from a qualitative case study with children and young people in a Viennese neighbourhood where an EU smart city lighthouse project was implemented from 2016 to 2019. Drawing on ethnographic research with children and young people in a school, an afterschool centre, and an open child and youth care programme in a city park, I develop three dimensions of encounters: how children and young people move through, interact with, and take care of the city. My findings show that many children and young people perceive crises with the same urgency as smart city programmes and are equally interested in technological innovation, environmental protection, and social inclusion. They demonstrate responsibility and care about socio-ecological challenges and approaches to solutions. However, young people's discourses and practices also show that urban life cannot be limited to certain issues, nor do young people's urban lives end at structural or administrative boundaries. Participants also emphasise that focusing on human beings alone does not lead to sustainable urban development, and they express frustration with measures that bypass the reality of their lives and divert much-needed attention away from pressing issues.}

One of the key factors to accomplish a smart city involves the use of IoT and information technology infrastructure which can be described as the foundation of a smart city. Its effective implementation will allow the city to meet its wide range of requirements while being able to respond to innovations, such as advanced sensors, analytic tools, measurement, and artificial intelligent based solutions. This paper investigates and compares between the use of low and high resolution infrared sensors as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate crowds in cities to enhance and optimise the efficiency of the transportation process and other public services for low density scenarios. A case study was conducted in Nottingham city at one of the tram stops. An experimental methodology is used where different number of people are captured and the results are compared using different image processing techniques. The findings show that both technologies are useful in the estimation of crowd density, however, the high resolution camera has been found to be more accurate in estimating the number of people albeit it is more expensive for the integration into infrastructures. The practical implication is that low-cost and low resolution infrared cameras could provide reasonable results. However, for higher accuracy, high resolution infrared cameras will be needed; and they are potentially more expensive. So a compromise might be needed between cost and performance to encourage the installation of more IoT systems using infrared technologies.}

abstract = {With smart city (SMC) initiatives proliferating worldwide since the 2000s, the theoretical debates around SMC development have evolved from a technology-centric approach to a more human-centric approach. Investing in human capital and improving quality of life have become the major elements of SMC rhetoric. However, few studies have examined the approaches adopted in real-world SMC policymaking or why different cities follow different approaches. We statistically examine the factors behind the human-centricity of SMC policies through a text analysis of policy documents from 341 Chinese prefectural cities published between 2009 and 2020. We find divergent approaches to SMC development across these Chinese prefectural cities. Unexpectedly, the more economically developed and dense cities tend to be more technology-centric in SMC policymaking. Cities at the initial and advanced stages of SMC development also prefer a technology-centric approach, albeit with very different underlying mechanisms. These findings suggest the need for a greater prioritization of human capital in SMC creation in developed cities and for context-specific interpretations of technology-centricity for cities at different SMC development stages.}

An Urban Digital Twin (UDT) is a technology with great potential to transform the management and planning of the infrastructures and systems of sustainable smart cities towards environmental sustainability. However, despite the recent increase of research on UDTs due to its widespread diffusion much more recently, there is a lack of studies examining the existing bottlenecks to its implementation. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic literature review on the key challenges and open issues pertaining to the implementation of an UDT. Results indicate 8 important categories of challenges related to (1) interoperability and semantics; (2) infrastructure, including storage, computation, network; (3) data acquisition and actuation; (4) data quality and harmonization; (5) modeling, simulation and decision-support; (6) data visualization and information display; (7) human and capital resources; and finally (8) governance, organizational and social issues. All topics are significantly raised in the literature, with most emphasis on issues pertaining to data and model semantics, missing data, data quality and modeling. The findings serve to inform practitioners about the bottlenecks delaying the implementation of UDTs.}

To ensure citizens' participation, smart city developers should adequately protect their security and privacy from gaining their trust. If citizens don't want to participate, the main benefits of a smart city will be lost. This article presents a comprehensive review of smart city security issues and privacy. It provides a basis for categorizing current and future developments in this area and developing a thematic classification to highlight the requirements and security strategies for designing a smart and safe city.

The central argument made is that the smart city could exploit the synergies between city planning and three techno-scientific domains including Big Data, Geographic Information Science and Systems, and Data Science—which collectively constitute an emerging field known as Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)— to meet four overarching policy goals: 1) to enhance the efficiency of urban services and functions; 2) to improve quality of life for all urban citizens; 3) to address the pressing societal, ecological and economic challenges that could plague urban systems on different levels; and, 4) to contribute to the production of spatial data, information and knowledge on human-urban dynamics. In addition, the paper defines a human-centered conceptual framework illustrating how the cross-pollination between city planning and the three techno-scientific fields could enhance the planning practice and accomplish the smart-city policy goals. The methodology employed in this study entails a systematic review of the literature. In addition to discussing the latest achievements as well as the progress made on the nexus of city planning and GeoAI, the paper also highlights the barriers to the application of GeoAI in the planning, design and management of smart cities and identifies potential avenues for future research.}

In smart medicine, intelligent dialogue system is playing an important role in providing personalized and efficient healthcare services to improve the quality of life for human beings. The Bert model has become a popular way to construct intelligent medical dialogue system. However, the current Bert model is difficult to achieve desirable results for this task since its input does not reflect the difference in roles. To overcome this drawback, we present a role distinguishing Bert model for intelligent medical dialogue system to help construct the sustainable smart city. Particularly, we segment and label the utterances depending on different dialogue roles, and then construct the corresponding segment embedding as the input of our model. Furthermore, we substitute the NSP task with the SOP task to better learn the coherence between sentences. Finally, we verify the proposed model by comparing it with Ernie on some online E-commerce datasets for intent recognition, semantic matching, and session dialogue classification. The results demonstrate that our proposed model improves the average 1% accuracy for different tasks in dialogue system, proving the potential of the proposed model for establishing intelligent medical dialogue system in smart city.}

Taking advantage of vehicular communications, in this paper we propose novel mechanisms for the acceleration of the rescue operation resulting in a reduction in fatalities in accidents. We propose a Software-Defined Traffic Light Preemption (SD-TLP) mechanism that enables Emergency Medical Vehicles (EMVs) to travel along the rescue route with minimal interruptions. The SD-TLP makes preemption decisions based on global knowledge of the traffic conditions in the city. We also propose mechanisms for the selection of the nearest emergency center and fast discharge of the route of EMVs. Furthermore, depending on the dynamic traffic conditions on the streets at the time of the accident, an appropriate rescue route is selected for the EMV before its departure. The proposed approach is evaluated using the OMNET++ and SUMO tools over part of the Megacity of Tabriz, Iran. The simulation results demonstrate that the method can reduce the average rescue time significantly. The proposed approach keeps the resulting disruption in city traffic acceptably low while trying to shorten the rescue time as much as possible.}

This city's resources are wirelessly connected to different constrained devices (such as sensors, robotics, and actuators). However, the communication of this wireless information is threatened by several malicious attacks, cyber-attacks, and hackers. This is due to unsecured IIoT networks that were exposed as a potential back door entry point for the attacks. Consequently, this study aims to develop a security framework for the smart cities’ sustainability edge computing vulnerabilities using Petri Net and Genetic Algorithm-Based Reinforcement Learning (GARL). First, a common trust model for addressing information outflows in the network using a distributed authorization algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is implemented on a secure framework modeling in Petri Net called secure trust-aware philosopher privacy and authentication (STAPPA) for mitigation of the privacy breach in the networks. Genetic Algorithm-based Reinforcement Learning (GARL) is used to optimize the search, detect anomalies, and shortest route during the agent learning in the environment. The detection and accuracy rate results obtained over a secure framework using reinforcement learning are 98.75, 99, 99.50, 99.75, and 100% during simulation in the network environment. The average sensitivity of the detection rate is 1.000, while the average specificity outcome is 0.868. The result of the GARL simulation model obtained shows the best distance of 238.84 * 10−3 fitness when the search space is optimized by reducing the number of chromosomes to 10 in the model. These approaches help to detect anomalies and prevent unauthorized users from accessing edge computing components in the city architecture.}

In this study, responses from 548 citizens living in China in an online questionnaire are examined using a structural equation modeling technique for data analysis, and a theoretical model is proposed based on social learning theory. The results reveal that high-quality responsiveness and information content of a digital learning service have a significant positive effect on commitment to community and ICT self-efficacy. Additionally, we find that commitment to community and ICT self-efficacy have a significant positive effect on online civic engagement. Moreover, commitment to community mediates the effect of information content, responsiveness, and environment quality on online civic engagement. Our research findings suggest that, in their efforts to improve online civic engagement, smart city implementation practitioners can enhance citizens’ individual commitment to community and foster ICT self-efficacy via high-quality ICT devices and digital learning services.}

From this perspective, to efficiently manage both the supply and demand sides of energy in buildings, this study proposes a novel approach for grid-connected building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) considering the price of electricity. Regarding real-time electricity prices, the presented method allows for selecting grid electricity or photovoltaics per peak, off-peak, and between these two. In addition to reducing costs, this strategy lessens photovoltaic installation capacity and increases the justification of BIPVs. Considering demand-side management, proper control in terms of economic aspects is conducted based on the system's defined model and the price of electricity. The suggested technique outperforms other applied methods when both energy supply and demand are considered, as well as real-time electricity prices. The validity of this technique is confirmed by simulation results of system performance in a setting and for lighting loads. This approach advocates for establishing smart buildings and cities in tandem with the growth of smart grids and liberalized energy markets.}

We employ specialized energy flow algorithms for each grid, designing energy hubs that leverage renewable resources and mobile storage to enhance sustainability. To address complexity, our model utilizes a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming structure and robust adaptive optimization techniques, combining the Gray Wolf and Krill Herd algorithms. Through simulations, we demonstrate significant improvements in power system efficiency, including notable reductions in power loss, peak voltage fluctuations, and temperature variations.

IoT technologies do, however, come with a number of drawbacks, including vulnerability of highly secure devices, energy consumption, governance, etc. in smart cities. Governance in smart city is more citizen-center and the decisions of government are focused on citizens’ demands. Government can identify influential spreaders from this huge voluminous population and take requisite preventive steps such as delaying the spread of rumor, identifying the information source, or blocking the source node. Hence, security of highly vulnerable IoT device and governance are the two main issues of the IoT environment of smart green city. This paper proposes a framework for identifying influential spreaders who play a key role in the governance of smart city as well as determining vulnerable IoT devices that needs to be protected from malware attacks. A framework named as Modified Dynamic Weighted Sum Method, is proposed for determining influential devices and spreaders in smart green cities. The connectivity between devices is considered as a network, then, distinct centrality measures are considered as the multi-attribute of the network, so as to take advantage of each centrality measure. Experiments are conducted on Santender testbed and it was found that static devices play an important role in IoT environment. Hence, they need to be protected from malware attacks. From future perspective, opportunities and challenges in smart city applications are discussed.}

abstract = {The principal goals of smart cities are to improve citizens' quality of life and foster economic growth while ensuring efficient service delivery and sustainable development. Accordingly, understanding and adequately meeting citizens' needs and desires is a fundamental step toward improving citizens' happiness. While prior studies have investigated the direct relationship between technology readiness and continuous intention to use the services, extant results are still fragmented. Hence, this study examines the relationship between citizens' readiness and intention to continue usage by introducing satisfaction and discomfort as mediators in a smart city services (SCS) context. We rely on a mixed-method approach to propose and validate a new readiness model for assessing smart city citizens' readiness for continuous usage and long-term adoption of SCS. In the first phase, qualitative research was used by conducting in-depth interviews with SCS experts to investigate and theorize the main factors perceived as enablers and inhibitors to the continuous usage of SCS. While in the second quantitative phase, data were collected from 350 citizens and structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings suggest three main enablers (empowerment, optimism, and innovativeness) and three main inhibitors (insecurity, mistrust, and legal considerations) that affect the intention to continuously use SCS. In the quantitative phase, satisfaction and discomfort emerged as mediators to intention of continuous usage. Moreover, we found that empowerment, innovativeness, and optimism enhance the continuous usage of SCS when mediated by satisfaction but have no significant effect when mediated by discomfort. Discomfort was found to be an effective mediator between inhibitors and continued usage intention. Our study highlights the role of technology readiness as a personality trait in shaping user satisfaction, discomfort, and intention to continue using SCS. Furthermore, it proposes a new scale and model for measuring users’ readiness to adopt and continuously use SCS. The proposed model has practical implications for SCS providers, and can inform the design of future SCS and ensure their sustainable and successful adoption by citizens, not only initially, but also in the long-term.}

Social sustainability is a dynamic concept that combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world and promotes infrastructure to support social needs and concerns. While smart cities primarily aim at enhancing performance through innovative use of digital data and technology, a social sustainability perspective stresses the critical interconnections between people and place. Through a critical systematic literature review, this paper establishes a dialogue between the smart city and social sustainability. It evaluates the smart city concept through a social sustainability lens within a built environment paradigm. A multi-stage conceptual framework is advanced around notions of place, identification of core social sustainability themes and related factors, and sensitivity to broader policy and detailed implementation scales.

This study aims to examine the impacts and potential mechanisms of SCI on air pollution governance from the objective satellite monitoring data within a quasi-natural experiment framework. We find that SCI directly reduces the air pollutants concentration such as PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and smog in urban China and improves the air quality very well, which also has significant and positive spillovers on air pollution governance in adjacent cities. This encouraging phenomenon can also be achieved through contributing to green technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, and decentralizing urban spatial structure, such that most of can be attributed to the technological effect. Heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that the governance effect of air pollution is more obvious in large smart cities, and increases with the expansion of city size. Additionally, the effect performs better in resource-based smart cities and smart cities with stronger financing capacity and air pollution pressure.}

The first experiment is to compare the model in this paper with other three neural network models, and it is found that the model in this paper is smaller than other models in terms of ARE and MAE; the second experiment is to design an environmental pollution prediction system based on the model in this paper, and take sulfur dioxide as an example, use the system to predict the value of sulfur dioxide in two provinces. The results are as follows: the average error value of the system's prediction for Jiangxi Province is 0.31%, and the average error value for Hubei Province is 0.34%. In combination, the neural network designed in this paper compares the pre-accuracy of environmental pollution than other neural networks, and the system predictive accuracy is high.}

Understanding the shades of urban resilience and livability in smart city models is of paramount importance. This study presents a novel two-stage data-driven framework combining a multivariate metric-distance analysis with machine learning (ML) techniques for resilience and livability assessment of smart cities. A longitudinal dataset for 35 top-ranked European smart cities from 2015 till 2020 applied as the case study under the proposed framework. Initially, a metric distance-based weighting approach is used to weight the indicators and quantify the scores across each aspect under city resilience and urban livability. The key aspects under city resilience include social, economic, infrastructure and built environment and, institutional resilience, while under urban livability, the aspects include accessibility, community well-being, and economic vibrancy. Fuzzy c-means clustering as an unsupervised machine learning technique is used to sort smart cities based on the degree of performance. In addition, an intelligent approach is presented for the prediction of the degree of livability, resilience, and aggregate performance of smart cities based on various supervised ML techniques. Classification models such as Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and, ensemble models including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting machine (GBM) were used. Three coefficients (accuracy, Cohen's Kappa (κ) and average area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR)) along with confusion matrix were used to appraise the performance of the classifier ML models. The results revealed GBM as the best classification and predictive model for the resilience, livability, and aggregate performance assessment. The study also revealed Copenhagen, Geneva, Stockholm, Munich, Helsinki, Vienna, London, Oslo, Zurich, and Amsterdam as the smart cities that co-create resilience and livability in their development model with superior performance.}

In addition, South Korea submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Nowadays, to mitigate the GHG emission every country explicitly planning to reduce non-renewable energy resource vehicles. The electric vehicle (EV) markets growing rapidly with various technologies, strategies and innovations to support decarbonization. In 2022, by the transportation CO2 (Carbon dioxide) emission report of International Energy Agency (IEA), the cars and vans contributes 48% in the over all CO2 emissions. Increasing the electric micro-mobility service would be one of the best effective approach in accordance to reduce CO2 emission. This research study support to reduce the GHG emission by increasing the clean energy vehicle. A case study conducted to analyze firm-wise e-scooter sharing service performance and its satisfaction in smart cities of South Korea. Lacking in the consistent good quality and performance affects the number of electric vehicle users. Hence, electric vehicle firm should focus into their product better performance and quality. This research supports to analyze the e-scooter based on the various criteria from the user’s perspective. This research study helps to firms to identify their lacking criteria and improve their quality and performance. We considered the performance, accessibility, tangibility, reliability and responsiveness factors which affects user’s perspective in e-scooter sharing services. A survey was conducted over sixty user’s for different e-scooter services with twenty four factors. Generally, MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision-Making) techniques holds two phases to determine the weight of the criteria and another phase to ranking the alternatives. The existing MCDM techniques lacks to handle the user’ satisfaction index analysis and not considering the influence grade of each factors in the analysis. To overcome this draw back and analyze the micro-mobility services based over the user’s point of view, we introduced a novel fuzzy based MCDM method name as Approach for Preference, Performance and Ranking Evaluation with SAtisfaction Level (APPRESAL) approach. The findings show that Lime, a micro-mobility firm, outperformed other firms with high-quality service and user satisfaction, followed by Wind, XingXing, Alpaca, and Beam. The influences of defected factors from the accessibility, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance dimensions had an adverse effect on quality of firm’s micro-mobility service with unsatisfactory performance.}

The need for the use of information and communication technology in various forms is needed in such cities. There are different dimensions that are to be considered for smart city planning and implementation. This complexity of the dimension, the use of technology, and their integration bring the risk perspectives into the implementation of the smart city concept. If such risks are not adequately understood and addressed, they can create issues in terms of privacy and security and, therefore, the functioning of smart cities. In this review, the identification of dimensions, smart city assessment tools, the available technologies, and the technical and non-technical risk parameters related to smart cities implementation are discussed. The current methods of risk assessment and the possible enhancements are highlighted. The findings of the literature review illustrate that not all smart cities adapt all of the smart city dimensions. The dominant technology used in smart cities’ applications is found to be the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and blockchain. The paper also provides some research directions for the design, implementation, and operation of smart cities.}

To explore urban vitalisation, we offer a conceptual framework connecting two theoretical terms, trust/distrust and citizenship regimes, and we ask in what ways relations between trust/distrust (of residents in their municipality) and citizenship regimes explain residents' engagement in smart urban vitalisation. To answer this question, we present a case study of a group of Haifa residents who used a digital platform to push for improvement in the ways the local government accommodated their needs. Based on our analysis, we make two arguments of potential interest to scholars and stakeholders involved in smart city initiatives. First, both trust and distrust can motivate residents' involvement in smart city initiatives. Second, examining trust and distrust in light of the relevant citizenship regime (individual-liberal and civic-republican) sheds light on relational and dynamic configurations of residents' involvement in the process of smart urban vitalisation.}

Making cities smarter implies not only technological innovation and deployment, but also having smart people and effective policies. Cities can acquire knowledge and incorporate governance lessons from other jurisdictions to develop smart city initiatives that are unique to the local contexts. We conducted two rounds of surveys involving 23 experts on an e-Delphi platform to consolidate their opinion on factors that facilitate policy transfer among smart cities. Findings show a consensus on the importance of six factors: having a policy entrepreneur; financial instruments; cities’ enthusiasm for policy learning; capacity building; explicit regulatory mechanisms; and policy adaptation to local contexts. Correspondingly, three policy recommendations were drawn. Formalizing collaborative mechanisms and joint partnerships between cities, setting up regional or international networks of smart cities, and establishing smart city repositories to collect useful case studies for urban planning and governance lessons will accelerate policy transfer for smart city development. This study sheds light on effective ways policymakers can foster policy learning and transfer, especially when a jurisdiction's capacity is insufficient to deal with the uncertainties and challenges ahead.}

It enables the development of smart infrastructure and provides assistance in emergency services during disasters. However, there is a growing need to develop energy-conserving paradigms that cover all aspects of a smart city. In this work, the authors present a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) inspired greedy strategy-based mutation operation for IoT-enabled heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) distributed architecture in a technology driven city. The proposed protocol aims to design a weighted fitness function that considers four parameters: node density, residual and average energy, and distance parameters. Additionally, a 3-tier heterogeneity is considered to prolong the network functional duration, and a deployment strategy is addressed to position these nodes in an energy-efficient manner. The proposed algorithm achieves 31.41%, 20.42%, 13.37%, 1.59% increase in network lifespan compared to GA-based optimized clustering (GAOC), optimized GA with single sink (OptiGAS-StSS), multiple sinks (MS) based GAOC and optimized GA with multiple sink (OptiGAS-StMS), respectively. The significant enhancement in network lifespan is an outcome of choosing the most efficient CH nodes based on the proposed fitness function. Overall, the proposed protocol contributes to developing an energy-conserving paradigm for a smart city.}

The results show that urban innovation performance benefits from the construction of smart cities, and the promotion effect is sustainable. The level of economic development and information infrastructure, as well as the financial innovation expenditure, have a beneficial effect in encouraging smart city construction innovation performance, while the degree of opening-up hinders the improvement of smart city urban innovation performance. In addition, it is also found that there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of smart city building on urban innovation performance.

This study traces the impacts of urbanization, innovation, income, and energy consumption on CE for the G7 countries from 1995 to 2019. The time period is important due to the rapid increase in urbanization, globalization, and, at the same time, technology diffusion. The study is focused on novel and relevant panel data econometric methods that tackle cross-section dependence, non-normality of data, and heterogeneity in slope coefficients. The empirical outcome first confirms the long-run cointegrating relationship among the variables in the presence of structural breaks by employing the advanced panel cointegration test. Technologies related to environmental management and energy consumption are positively linked with CE. However, the role of income per capita is found to be inverse with CE. In contrast, the effect of urbanization in different models is mixed for CE. Innovation and its interaction with urbanization are crucial for limiting CE and promoting sustainable cities in G7 economies. This indicates that urbanization with environment-friendly innovation can help G7 countries foster sustainable cities and achieve COP27 targets in general, specifically the Sustainable Development Goal of sustainable cities. The results were tested for the multiplicative effect of different variables with urbanization and innovation. Regarding policy insights, the study recommends focusing on smart and sustainable cities with environment-related innovations and transitioning towards cleaner energy from conventional energy consumption.}

Living laboratories are a popular smart city intervention that have the potential to address this power imbalance and empower citizens to influence smart city development. This research theoretically and empirically explores this role of living labs through a multiple-case study of urban living labs in the region of Catalonia. The findings uncover a ‘power banking’ mechanism which, coupled with other critical factors, facilitates the effectiveness of such initiatives. The considerable efforts required to engage citizens at a fairly basic level suggest that incorporating citizens into smart city models is more challenging than simplistic Quadruple Helix discourses convey.}

Subjective QOL was measured by three indicators: life satisfaction, frequency of happy emotions, and frequency of depressed emotions. Results show that ICT is negatively associated with life satisfaction and the frequency of happy (positive) emotions, but not associated with depressed (negative) emotions. Human capital, by contrast, has a positive impact on life satisfaction and the frequency of happy emotions but has a negative impact on the frequency of depressed emotions. Further, ICT and human capital can affect subjective QOL through perceived government corruption and government performance. In addition, the impact of smart city investments on subjective QOL varies greatly according to age and education level.

As vehicles are being electrified, further advances will be needed to meet social, environmental, and economic sustainability targets, and a more efficient use of vehicles and public transport is central in this endeavor. Accordingly, Electric Mobility as a Service (eMaaS) has developed as a concept with the potential to increase sustainability mobility in cities and been designated as a phenomenon with potential to radically change how people move in the future. But presently there is the lack of a common business model that supports complex integration of all actors, digital technologies, and infrastructures involved in the eMaaS business ecosystem.

Accordingly, a systematic literature review was adopted grounded on secondary data from the literature to offers a new approach to urban mobility and demonstrate the suitability of the eMaaS concept in smart communities. The digital ecosystem is designed based on system design approach. Findings from this study provides a sustainable policy perspective, discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development of eMaaS and its impact on electrification of vehicles. Overall, findings from this study considers the role of electric vehicles as part of the mobility sharing economy. Recommendations from this study provides designs and strategies for eMaaS, the interrelations between eMobility and other everyday practices, strategically highlighting the positive benefits of eMaaS and broader policies to limit private car usage in cities.}

Yet, it is not clear how policymakers narrow down the topics to focus on with respect to their smart city agenda. As a result, the aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical contribution that explains how local governments define their smart city policy agenda. It is suggested that the agenda is influenced by policy priorities at the local level from other urban domains. To support this notion, policy studies literature is used to show that three streams of problems, policy, and politics, when aligned, set the policy agenda. The smart city agenda will be formed from key ideas existing at the local political level, such as policy priorities, that have now been matched with solutions framed in the smart city context, all underpinned by a favourable political environment. In addition, from smart city policy related documents, a topic modelling analysis illustrates a set of topics that are associated to the smart city policy agenda in two cities, London and Melbourne. This shows how some topics on the smart city agenda can be likened to issues that are the primary topic of another policy domain.}

Previous studies have concentrated on analyzing the spatial distribution of urban services, with less attention on their contribution as local urban amenities. In this study, we propose a spatial dynamic modeling approach based on urban amenities using social media data from Google Place API to provide locational information on potential resident interactions. We use a representative region in Europe (Stockholm County, SE) to simulate and project urban development in the region until 2050. Our circular conceptual framework of spatial information and feedback supports decision-makers in testing possible urban planning scenarios that align with the vision of a smart city. Simulation results reveal the interplay between human-land interactions on a specific spatial-temporal scale, and we analyze scenario outcomes in relation to commercial and residential land uses. Overall, our study provides a new perspective on human-social behavior-driven urban development, through a smart, spatial dynamic model as a planning support system that can enhance realism, and ultimately help realize planned development objectives in the region.}

However, assessing the progress of smart cities is often challenging due to the lack of theoretical foundation and consensus on an assessment methodology. These contradictions can pose major constraints on the development of the smart city concept and its implementation in practice. This paper analyzes a set of 164 articles published between 2010 and 2020 that deal with smart city assessment. The present study aims to identify the most influential research and key research themes, and suggests future research directions in the field of smart city assessment. A bibliometric analysis is used to reveal the most influential articles and their associations. Furthermore, a content analysis is performed to explore recent developments in the field of smart city assessment in terms of research hotspots and research themes. The analysis reveals the existence of 11 research themes and their timelines. The most influential research addresses (1) multiple-criteria decision-based performance measurement frameworks, (2) data connectivity challenges, (3) composite indexes for smart sustainable cities, (4) holistic performance evaluations of smart cities, and (5) the characteristics of indicator sets. Based on these results, current advances in smart city assessment are discussed, and future research directions in this field are suggested.}

It gives extra control to the client for matching its needs according to the application but with confiscated network performance. For a reliable end-to-end service assurance, guaranteed QoS and controlled scalability, MQTT based IoT must be examined for various network parameters. In this work, an improved TCP based transparent MQTT network is proposed for massively deployed connected devices in smart cities. The mathematical modeling is carried out by analyzing end-to-end quality assurance. Network latency, content delivery rate, number of subscribe/publish requests and services offered by the MQTT broker for various topic IDs are then verified on physical network. These parameters are examined over a transparent gateway-based network for verifying the agreement of devised probability based mathematical model with the actual content delivery, service rate and request hold time at virtual machine based MQTT broker, local network broker and remote server respectively. The Improved MQTT model surpasses Apollo, RabbitMQ and Mosquitto server by evidencing the message queueing delay of 3.5 ms for QoS-0 and 3.6 ms for QoS-1 service IoT.}

The well-defined structural hierarchy of managing organizations in a smart city face several data management issues. The integration of emerging technologies, such as (IoT), has introduced more complexity to data maintenance in the smart city. At present, cloud-based information systems have become the norm for managing IoT data. Due to the centralized administrative control, the cloud-based information management is untrusted. Hence, it fails to guarantee the integrity of IoT data and traceability of operations to achieve transparency within the smart city organizations. Adoption of blockchain-based information systems can be viable solution to address these challenges. However, it introduces a new challenge of interoperability of transactions among different smart city organizations. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized hierarchy of blockchains, named Blockchain-of-Blockchains (BoBs), for ensuring data integrity and blockchain interoperability at the same time. We implement the proposed concept using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethermint as a proof-of-concept for evaluating the performance of the proposed concept.}

The security features like integrity, authentication, and confidentiality are indispensable requirements of the smart grid environment. On the other hand, different objects like smart meters in the smart grid environment are resource-constrained, posing in designing lightweight security protocols.

In this regard, fog computing, a robust cloud computing complement, plays a preponderant role by virtue of locating closer to the end-devices. Nonetheless, utilized approaches in smart cities are frequently cloud-based, which causes not only the security and time-sensitive services to suffer but also its flexibility and reliability to be restricted. In order to obviate the limitations of cloud and other related computing paradigms such as edge computing, this paper proposes a study for the state-of-the-art fog-based approaches in smart cities. Furthermore, according to the reviewed research content, a classification is proposed that falls into three classes: service-based, resource-based, and application-based. This study also investigates the evaluation factors, used tools, evaluation methods, merits, and demerits of each class. Types of proposed algorithms in each class are mentioned as well. Above all else, by taking various perspectives into account, comprehensive and distinctive open issues and challenges are provided via classifying future trends and issues into practical sub-classes.}

The use of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in smart cities has the potential to enable secure and efficient communication and transactions, optimize resource usage, and improve services. However, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as issues related to data privacy and security and the potential for job displacement. Blockchain technology can be used to securely store and manage data related to smart cities, such as information about energy usage, traffic patterns, and public services. It can also be used to enable secure and efficient communication and transactions between different stakeholders in a smart city, such as government agencies, businesses, and residents. AI, on the other hand, can be used to analyze data collected from smart city sensors to identify patterns and trends and to make predictions about future events. This can help cities optimize their use of resources, improve services, and make more informed decisions. Despite the potential benefits of using blockchain and AI in smart cities, this research aims to explore the potential benefits and limitations of using blockchain and AI in the development of smart cities, with a focus on case studies of cities that have successfully implemented these technologies. The research will provide an overview of the state of the art in this area and will present a methodology for analyzing the benefits and limitations of blockchain and AI in smart cities.

For that, designing a persuasive control model for power flow becomes a big and crucial part in a smart city to optimize the power balance between production and consumption. So, a seven-layer smart city energy management strategy (SLSCEMS) for multiple home energy cooperation is presented in this paper. The optimised aims of this strategy are smoothing the smart homes power demand profiles, reducing the electricity bills (E.B), and gaining a total free charging of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). This approach has been designed as hierarchic local and global layers. The first one is divided into three layers that aim to transfer the energy between each smart home and its own Renewable Energy sources (RES) and PEVs. The second one is split into four layers that aim to transfer the energy between each smart home and its PEVs, the neighboring homes and their RES, and the smart grid. All optimised layers are based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed strategy is evaluated in a city that contains one hundred homes classified into five categories, each category is designated by its power profile and its flexible number of RESs and PEVs. Simulation results show a decrease in the daily E.B of 26.24%, 2.42%, 60.33%, 29.51%, and 2.38% respectively of the five categories. So, these numerical results prove that the proposed SLSCEMS has considerable efficiency.}

Researchers have shown a surprising interest in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities in recent years. By providing a variety of intelligent applications, such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, and smart financing, smart cities (SC) can improve the quality of life for their residents. Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.}

HDSC mechanism includes a three-layer interrelated structure and is underpinned by a set of Strategic Measures. The assessment criteria have also been established for applying HDSC mechanism to investigate the performance of Smart City initiatives. The HDSC mechanism established in this study is a first attempt to assess the performance of Smart City development from the lens of human happiness. By applying HDSC mechanism in investigating Manchester's Smart City initiatives, the mechanism is proven effective to help decision makers understand the status quo of Smart City development in their urban context, based upon which the strength and weakness in the process of HDSC development can be drawn out. Consequently, Smart City blueprint can be better achieved towards a happiness-driven direction via dynamic assessment and adjustment.}

Among all sources of renewable energy, tidal energy is one of the most efficient. In order to accurately simulate and predict tidal current (TC), a novel two-stage methodology is suggested in this paper which not only can benefit the smart cities, but also can help for a more fitting landscape design in offshore areas. The integration of digital twin technology in landscape planning facilitates a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy systems in smart cities, enabling proactive decision-making and sustainable development strategies. To extract the most desirable characteristics from the dataset measuring TC speed and direction, the suggested method uses a unique fuzzy feature selection (FFS) technique. The Long short-term memory (LSTM) is further trained for precise prediction using the chosen characteristics. In order to improve the performance of the LSTM, an evolutionary optimization technique is developed to train the parameters of the proposed model to reach the best training objectives. The efficiency and precision of the model are evaluated using real tidal data from the Qinhuangdao beach. The outcomes demonstrate the proposed model's suitable performance and excellent precision in contrast to other well-known techniques like shallow NNs and well-known linear techniques.}

There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between energy efficiency and per capita CO2 emissions, and most cities in China have crossed the inflection point; smart city construction achieves energy savings and reduces per capita CO2 emissions by improving energy efficiency. 3. The effect of smart city construction on CO2 emission reduction is more obvious in cities with higher administrative levels, higher levels of neutral technological progress and green innovation, and higher levels of advanced industrial structure. This research provides an empirical basis for how developing countries or regions can move toward sustainable development through digital and intelligent transformation and demonstrates the importance of providing new infrastructure construction such as smart cities from the perspective of a low-carbon economy.}

abstract = {The evaluation of smart cities involves multiple stakeholder groups and has multiple objectives. Therefore, a multi-criteria approach is required to facilitate inclusive decisions. In view of covering classic fuzzy sets, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) with parameters q can provide a wider range to represent uncertain information. Considering the flexibility and robustness of the Frank aggregation method, this study investigates a new framework for smart city evaluation by integrating the Frank operator with q-ROFS. First, it defines the Frank operational rule of q-ROFS, and based on this rule, it presents q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank weighted averaging/geometric operators. In addition, it analyzes some properties of the proposed operators and discusses their exceptional cases. Subsequently, by combining an improved TOPSIS model and the proposed operators, it presents a novel multi-attribute evaluation approach within q-ROF situations. Finally, it proves the feasibility of this method through its application in a smart city evaluation.}

To fill this gap, we develop a new index system involving three dimensions of digital infrastructure, smart living, and digital economy. Moreover, compared with studies that use subjective weighting methods to rank the smartness of cities, we combine the Shannon entropy weighting method with three multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to show the objectiveness of the evaluation process. Through analyzing the quantitative data from nine cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China, we find that digital infrastructure is the most important first-level indicator, accounting for 46.92%, followed by the digital economy and smart life accounting for 32.48% and 20.60% respectively. More importantly, when the nine cities in the PRD region are ranked by three MCDM methods, the correlation between the results is over 90%, thus proving robustness. We contribute to the current smart city literature by enriching the components of the smart city index system, as well as evaluation methods. Our findings also guide decision-makers in formulating more targeted smart city construction plans.}

While MCC has numerous advantages, it also raises several security risks. Data breaches, cyber assaults, and privacy concerns can all arise when sensitive data is sent between mobile devices and cloud servers. We investigate the security challenges related to MCC in smart cities and provide viable solutions to these issues in this study. To examine the current state of security in MCC in smart cities, we did a literature analysis of previously published work on the topic and utilized a combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches. According to the findings of this study, there are various security problems related to the usage of MCC in smart cities, including data breaches, cyber assaults, and privacy concerns. We end by emphasizing the need for additional research in this area and suggesting some potential remedies to the discovered security vulnerabilities. This study gives a thorough analysis of the security challenges connected with MCC in smart cities and lays the groundwork for future research in this vital field. Smart cities have become an increasingly essential component of urban development in recent years, harnessing new technologies to improve inhabitants’ quality of life. MCC has emerged as a vital technology for smart cities, allowing users to access data and apps from anywhere, at any time, and on any device. However, the usage of MCC poses a number of security risks, which can negate the benefits of this technology. We investigate the security challenges connected with the use of MCC in smart cities in this research. We begin by doing a thorough evaluation of previously published work on this topic. We then assess the existing level of security in MCC in smart cities using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Our findings indicate that the usage of MCC in smart cities raises a number of security problems, including data leaks, cyber-attacks, and privacy concerns. The complicated network architecture of smart cities, the vast amount of sensitive data exchanged, and the wide range of mobile devices used to access the cloud are identified as important contributors to these security challenges.}

One dimension of a smart city, i.e., smart people/society, suggests that a smart city requires high-quality social interactions and social relationships that help cities connect with their residents and the outside world. For this purpose, smart cities in Indonesia have developed digital platforms (internet websites and mobile applications) to disseminate the cities' programs and information and facilitate sharing of information among its residents. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platforms. We used a quantitative approach by conducting surveys in 8 smart cities in Indonesia, with 1161 respondents. The survey data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that social factors (sense of belonging and seeking reputations) have dominant roles in determining residents' intention to seek information on smart city platforms. In turn, the intention to seek information is the key factor that affects the residents' intention to share information on the smart city platforms and on their online social network. This paper provides insights on the factors that need more attention from smart city administrators to improve resident engagement and enhance the dimension of smart people.}

Along with this trend, the problem with standardization of this concept appeared, which in this context means defining specific criteria for assessing the degree of introducing smart solutions to cities. Regarding the issue of measurable methods of assessing cities in terms of implementing the smart idea, it can be said that the existing works in this area usually present only values/levels that particular cities have achieved in specific criteria, on the basis of which rankings are then created. The indicators defined for the purpose of such estimates, however, give neither a picture of their initial conditions, with which particular cities started their development, nor their perspectives for the development. The solution to the described problem may be an assessment methodology in which, in addition to static indicators, dynamic or derivative indicators are being computed and assessed. The proposed dynamic indicators tell about the rate of progress or the regression in particular assessment categories. This approach, to a certain extent, shows the innovation and efforts made by particular cities towards introducing the smart idea.}

In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term “smart city” are provided.

This paper clarifies the correlations between smart cities and urban happiness. The analyses show that the smart environment associated with green spaces, air pollution control, and recycling services significantly influences happiness. Moreover, improving urban infrastructure thoroughly is more critical for increasing well-being and livability than providing technical products for end users. Finally, different geographically gathered cities would face different challenges in maintaining happiness, including local (e.g., housing and population density) and global (e.g., the North-South divide) issues. Urban planners and governments must understand local and cultural contexts while cultivating global visions to identify cities’ actual needs and achieve sustainable development goals.}

abstract = {As major producers in the national economy, industrial enterprises bear great responsibility for carbon emissions. A smart city pilot policy (SCPP) with innovative advantages and environmentally friendly features provides a feasible way to scientifically achieve carbon emission reduction targets while maintaining industrial growth. However, there is a lack of specific understanding of the microscopic carbon reduction mechanisms of the policy. Thus, based on the data of A-share listed industrial firms from 2009 to 2018 in China, this study explores the impact mechanism of the SCPP on the CO2 emissions from industrial firms with the time-varying DID methodology and the mediating effect model. The results demonstrate that the SCPP can curb CO2 emissions from industrial firms in China by 23% by strengthening the intensity of environmental regulation and promoting green technological innovation. Further analysis indicates that the mediating effect of resource allocation efficiency only works in industrial firms in low-carbon industries, not high-carbon industries. In addition, the heterogeneity test suggests a pronounced reduction effect of the SCPP on non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs), and industrial enterprises in low-carbon industries, resource-based cities and eastern China. This paper is of great significance for providing theoretical and practical implications for making rational use of smart city policies to improve the carbon reduction performance of enterprises.}

This paper proposes an authentication protocol with a full aggregation signature to secure the smart city applications. A certificate-less aggregate signature (CLAS) is used for smart city real applications such as secure routing and database outsourcing. The proposed CLAS achieves message authentication, user anonymity, constant signature size, unlinkability, and is resistant to replay attacks.

Due to reduced public funding, many public transport systems are already facing challenges to maintain their services. For a smart city, the goal of public transport is not simply the movement of people, but the provision and enhancement of mobility for living. This will be particularly challenging due to changes in habitation trends and work patterns. For example, the growth of mega-cities has led to extreme traffic congestion in city centres and urban sprawl on their outskirts. In order to provide sufficient coverage and frequency of service, an integrated co-ordinated multi-modal public transport system is needed, leading to substantial increase in operational complexity. Environmental concerns and the recent pandemic may also change work and commuting patterns in the future, with more people working from home and companies adopting flexible work shifts. For smart cities, public transport must offer ubiquitous access, real-time response to demand, convenience and quality service, and energy-efficient operations. This paper will discuss the challenges in network design, operations planning, scheduling and management of smart public transport systems. A brief survey of recent research and innovations will also be presented.}

Despite efforts in recent years, no current developed MaaS has fully addressed all evaluation criteria. Moreover, no research has evaluated the sustainability of MaaS in the context of determining its optimality. As such, this research's pivotal contribution is to present an evaluation of simulation tools for sustainable MaaS in autonomous vehicles operating in smart cities. This evaluation leans on the advanced extension of a newly proposed an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set (IVFFRS) incorporated within integrated MCDM methodologies. The IVFFRS is designed to capture intricate and uncertain evaluative data. The initial phase of the evaluation methodology involves formulating the evaluation criteria using an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set, fuzzily weighted for zero inconsistency. The subsequent phase adopts the interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough decision via the opinion score method to prioritize alternatives in light of data variations. This study evaluates ten distinct simulation tools for MaaS in autonomous vehicles based on seven criteria. The methodology's robustness is further ascertained through sensitivity and comparative analyses.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has shocked the world due to its pronounced mortality rate, rapid worldwide spread, and profound socioeconomic effects across all societies. As the spearhead of urban policies, local governments play an important role in crisis management during the pandemic. In the context of smart cities, innovative solutions have been required, especially to improve the local government's capacity to manage health crises. This study asks whether smart cities perform better in governing the COVID-19 pandemic. This article focuses on how urban governance impacted cities’ performance in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a city-level data set from Indonesia, we constructed a COVID-19 response performance index using principal component analysis that is used in an empirical strategy with quasi-experimental cross-sectional methods to minimize the influence of unobserved covariates and selection bias. This study concludes that smart city status does not have a statistically significant impact on the COVID-19 performance index. We offer three possible accounts based on expert insights, previous empirical studies, and digital upshots on data monitoring and reporting cases. Both theoretical and practical implications can be drawn, thus highlighting the lack of effective integration of technological dimensions into health and urban governance systems in the context of a public health crisis.}
