abstract = {In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly set up 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, which are commonly addressed as SDGs. In this blueprint, cities are seen as a hotspot for achieving those goals by 2030. In this context, cities, through smart technologies, are engaging in generating a sustainable ecosystem that is inclusive of social and environmental concerns. The main objective of this paper is to assess the effect of SDGs institutionalization on the concept of smart sustainable cities. To this end, we review the literature on smart cities and SDGs to analyze the degree of alignment and potential areas of development. The results reveal the existence of brokerage keywords, which rank high in both fields of the literature, but are missing from the portfolio of overlapping keywords. This is the case for water management, energy, governance, and collaboration. While concepts such as sustainability, waste management, civic engagement, and innovation are in common, albeit explored differently.}

The concept of a smart sustainable city proposes a framework to ensure citizens a better life and protect the environment to maintain sustainability through information and communication technologies. This paper constructed a sustainable smart city development indicator system using the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) maturity model and assessed the maturity level of 35 cities in China. Spectral clustering was adopted to recognize development patterns on three dimensions and 53 indicators. The results indicated four development patterns. Completing developing elements converged in comprehensive-development cities. Environmental-friendly cities enhanced environmental quality under government guidance supported by information and communications technology. Welfare cities showed good social welfare via the government's highly focused strategy but lacked economic support. Innovation, trade, capital investment, mental poverty, and poor living conditions characterized undeveloped cities. Practical implications are recommended for each type according to development differences to build a better smart sustainable city.}

This paper presents a comparative study between front wheels independent steering system (FWISS) and the conventional steering system using Ackermann steering mechanism at different vehicle speeds and turning radii. A particle swarm approach is introduced to optimize the independent steering wheels angles taking into consideration the vehicle speed and slip angles. A validated eight degrees-of-freedom nonlinear MATLAB model is used to simulate different cornering scenarios. Moreover, two adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems are designed to obtain wheels steering angles at different cornering conditions. Finally, the results of FWISS show a significant improvement of the vehicle cornering performance that can influence the design and safety of roads in smart cities.}

While the literature is ripe with descriptions of those projects and pioneering cities, there is far less systematic research on why some cities are more advanced than others. As single locating entities, cities are posited to have strong geographic rootedness. Hence, spatial and socio-economic context, considered as the main stimulant of organizational innovation, can be particularly important for cities. We investigate 22 Swiss cities with smart city projects and use fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to determine the configuration of conditions that make some cities more advanced than others in their smart city development. Results indicate that a configuration of high share of service sector, presence of research institutions and high urban density is sufficient for the outcome, whereas population size, new residential development and participation to international networks appear as less important. By providing insights into the spatial and socio-economic underpinnings of smart city development, the study contributes to the understanding of the geographies of smart cities.}

In contrast, more attention should be paid to the question of appropriateness of smart city technologies. This entails that quite uniform urban issues in different contexts ask for distinctive approaches and as a consequence, for specific smart city technologies. In other words, the context plays a decisive role in the choice for the urban issues themselves and in the ways to ‘solve’ or govern these, and in the choice for specific smart city technologies. This study examines the role of context in the handling of urban issues with the help of smart city technologies in three smart city projects: Hangzhou City Brain (China), Singapore Smart Nation, and Amsterdam Smart City (the Netherlands). The results reveal that the specific contextual factors influence urban city developments and the application therein of smart city technologies. This includes: a technology-driven management approach to fixing Hangzhou's traffic congestion; a mixed technocratic and platform-oriented approach to effecting transformation in Singapore's government services, businesses and urban living; and a platform-oriented, open-minded mechanism to improve Amsterdam's livability and economic prosperity. This paper concludes that rather than treating the technology itself as smart, the real smartness in smart cities is to develop and implement appropriate technologies according to its local context to solve targeted urban issues.}

In this study, a hybrid optical fiber-free space optical (OF-FSO) system for offering high-speed data services has been proposed to assist the implementation of smart city infrastructure in India. This study aims to inspect the system performance of the proposed model under the climatic conditions of mountainous, desert, flatland, and seaside regions of India. The proposed hybrid OF-FSO system comprises a fixed single-mode fiber (SMF) of 20 km and an FSO link (having a varied transmission range between 0–2 km). The proposed hybrid model can support an FSO link of 1.72 km for a fixed SMF of 20 km, corresponding to a bit error rate of the order of 10−4 for atmospheric conditions of the seaside location of Chennai and the range of FSO link varies from 1.32 km to 1.57 km for other locations of India, for the same length of SMF and bit error rate. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid OF-FSO has demonstrated a reduction of 30.8% in Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) cost in contrast to the conventional passive optical network (PON) system.}

The research questions of the current study include: “Is it beneficial for countries, local governments, and autonomous districts with a high level of e-government to become smarter cities with the electronic, digital, and smart introduction of information and communications technology (ICT) technologies?” “Do cities with well-developed e-governments have a similar process from e-government to smarter cities?”, and “Do cities with similar levels of e-government or smarter cities go through different development processes in terms of their socio-cultural attributes?” This study focuses on the fact that e-government and smart cities, whose academic roots arose differently over time, are evolving to address governance, including next-generation e-government, urban e-government, and civic engagement, which has expanded to digital government and platform government concepts. Therefore, the scope of this study is set to e-government and smart/smarter cities as platforms. By comparing the key success factors of e-government with the smart city through a prior study, some intersections were found, but the success factors of the e-government and smart city were different. In order to explain the change of system from e-government to smart city as a platform in the socio-cultural attributes in which each case is involved, two cases—the Royal Borough of Greenwich and Seongdong-gu—were selected under similar conditions by comparing the e-government development level, economic indicators, and smart city development level. As a result of the case analysis, it was confirmed that the development level of e-government affected the smarter city process. The changes in the system from e-government to smart city was capable of being explained in different ways depending on the social and cultural attributes. In the process from e-government to smarter city, the case of Seongdong-gu, which has followed the informatization project and e-government development formula, was analyzed from the viewpoint of institutional overwrap, and the case of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, which was an active innovation agent for solving urban problems through public-private cooperation, was analyzed from the viewpoint of institutional transformation. In the Korean context with a collective hierarchical culture, citizens and stakeholders have participated in the public sector to the extent that they raise issues and express their preferences in policy-making decisions. The governments, including the autonomous district, have still treated citizens and stakeholders as guidance targets or customers rather than cooperative partners. On the other hand, the UK, which has an individualistic rational culture, citizens and stakeholders have become accustomed to maintaining cooperative relationships and operating cities based on partnerships as innovators. Since the socio-cultural contexts of each country have affected the actual system operations and changes, implementation plans and solutions under feasibilities need to take into account critical success factors and the socio-cultural properties of each autonomous district for the introduction, expansion, and establishment of smarter cities. This result of this study is that transferability considering sociocultural properties should be considered when introducing best practices, etc.}

The methods of qualitative comparative analysis and logical generalization made it possible to identify the features of the content of Russian and international smart transport standards, to systematize management tools for achieving standardized indicators of smart transport in a smart city by the transport infrastructure. “Gaps” in the instrumental base in the Russian track of managing the development of smart transport are associated with the underuse of digital platforms and citizen initiatives that are widely represented in European practice. The scientific novelty of the results is achieved by a comparative approach to the tools for managing the development of smart transport in a smart city, consists of assessing the differences between Russian and European management tracks, of justified directions for using European experience in the Russian Federation. The paper provides practical recommendations for the inclusion of digital platforms with proven efficiency at the corporate level in management tools; for increasing the role of innovative initiatives of citizens in the formation of smart transport. Practical recommendations can be used in the development of transport strategies, transport sections of the strategies for the socio-economic development of the constituent entities and municipalities of the Russian Federation using not only program-project, but also platform-initiative goal-setting tools.}

Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city.}

However, a comprehensive understanding of citizen discontent with the smart city is missing. This study systematically reviews academic research addressing citizen discontent with the smart city. Based on a set of 58 articles, two perspectives on citizens' discontent are identified. One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies’, ‘the right rules’, and ‘the right information’, or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment’ and the ‘right to participate and challenge’. Based on our findings, a fine-grained understanding of attitudes and behavior, and government actions to address citizen discontent is developed.}

In recent decades, academics and industry have spent considerable time and energy discussing security and privacy. Other systems, known as intrusion detection systems, are required to breach firewalls, antivirus software, and other security equipment to provide complete system security in smart operation systems. There are three aspects to an intrusion detection system: the intrusion detection method, the architecture, and the intrusion response method. In this study, we combined linear correlation feature selection methods and cross-information. The database used in this article is KDD99. This paper examines applying two feature selection methods in predicting attacks in intrusion detection systems based on INTERACT and A multilayer perceptron (MLP). Since the number of records associated with each attack type differs, one of our suggestions is to continue using data balancing techniques. As a result, the number of records associated with each type of network status becomes closer together. The results in the categories can also be improved using information synthesis methods, such as majority voting.}

It is argued that to bypass these – first – the value of mesh-technology should be explored. It is also argued that – second – it is necessary not only to bring citizens back in the discussion on smart city, but also to highlight the mechanisms by means of which they might be involved in the co-design of smart city solutions and in urban decision-making.

Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project’s impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.}

Our central investigation further focuses on the association of public trust and digital trust, using COVID19 contact tracing app as an example. This paper uses data from a Hong Kong-based territory-wide survey in 2021 to conduct the analysis. The result suggests a positive relationship between public trust, subjective perception and digital trust, and supports that public acceptability is a cornerstone of an effective public policy.}

Research scholarship has focused on technology adoptions frameworks without discussing the role of user-centric community value. The present paper attempts to do a systematic literature review and proposes an adoption conceptual framework that integrates community value thought in the context of participatory smart city applications, Online Participatory Technologies (OPT). Based on an extensive literature review, a summary of supportive and preventive factors in adopting user-centric technologies have been synthesized. Accordingly, the integration of community values as determinants of OPT adoption has been discussed. From a broader perspective, the present paper contributes to citizen's technology adoption literature in the smart city context by discussing the role of community value in the form of benefiting the adoption framework. The implications for smart city developers have been discussed. The main contribution of this paper is expanding the adoption framework to include community value-driven factors for OPT adoption and diffusion.}

However, cyber security has always been a serious problem, and it is becoming more and more severe in smart cities. The existing attack defense methods are not suitable for detecting multi-step attacks since the detection rules are limited and the efficiency is limited by a large number of false security alarms. Hence, an advanced solution is urgently needed to improve cyber security defense capability. In this paper, we propose a novel attack detection framework called ACAM. To better represent the cyber security knowledge, the framework is based on the MDATA model, which can represent dynamic and temporal–spatial knowledge better than the knowledge graph. The framework consists of the knowledge extraction module, the subgraph generation module, the alarm correlation module, and the attack detection module. These modules can remove false alarms and improve the detection capabilities of multi-step attacks. We implement the framework and conduct experiments on the cyber range platform, the experimental results validate the good performance of attack detection accuracy and efficiency. The framework can greatly improve the cyber security defense capabilities for smart cities.}

In this article, Energy Efficient Integrated Planning Framework (EEIPF) has been proposed for sustainable smart cities to enhance energy efficiency and performance. Energy efficiency planning over smart cities involves the primary and secondary strategies used in modern cities to improve energy efficiency. Integrated Planning Framework provides a numerical model for selecting energy efficiency methods to optimize economic and environmental impacts.

abstract = {Sustainability is the crux of urban renaissance. Imbibed with utopian technological planning, understanding the convergence between smart development and sustainable practices for city development is necessary. Smart cities have succeeded in bringing high standards of living to its residents. This article evaluates the long-term sustainability performance of 35 leading European smart cities over time from 2015 till 2020 to understand on how these cities address sustainability to make the concept of smart sustainable cities more actionable. A novel Double-Frontier Slack Based Measure Data Envelopment Analysis (DFSBM-DEA) model considering undesirable factors in the technology set is proposed for the assessment. An integrated relative sustainability performance assessment model considering both the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoint simultaneously, in terms of interval efficiency is used to determine the most efficient smart city under 6 various dimensions of sustainable development. These key dimensions include; Energy and Environmental Resource, Governance and Institution, Economic dynamism, Social cohesion and solidarity, Climate Change and, Safety and Security. A productivity progress assessment from a double frontier perspective using a modified Malmquist-DEA model is then used to capture the response of each smart city in terms of their productivity growth towards achieving sustainable development. Results show Dublin (ranked 1st) as the most smart and sustainable European city under all the proposed dimensions of sustainable development from the double-frontier perspective. Along with Dublin lies Oslo, Zurich and Amsterdam as the cities with high aggregate sustainability performance. The results also revealed significant difference in the productivity progress values from the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoint, thus exemplifying the significance for the proposed aggregate productivity progress measurement model. The findings of the present study contribute to knowledge and practice for smart city modellers, decision makers and urban planners, by aiding methodological clarity in assessing sustainable capacity of cities from a double frontier perspective and, in particular, by drawing attention to underlying assumptions about the role of sustainability in smart city development. This research stands as a breakthrough in the field of relative sustainability assessment using non-parametric approaches and a benchmark for global smart cities to shape their development in light of sustainability.}

The proposed model determines the smart city index (SCI) by aggregating 32 distinct performance indicators that significantly transform the environment, economy, energy, social, governance, and transportation sectors. This model is inherently multidisciplinary and is methodologically processed using multi-criteria decision analysis, which is aggregated using four distinct weighting schemes. The model results reveal that based on the equal weighting scheme, Sydney emerges as the city with the highest SCI score of 0.72, whereas Lima is identified as the city with the lowest SCI score of 0.26. On the other hand, based on the sustainability triad scheme, Toronto tops the list with an SCI score of 0.77, whereas Abuja scores the lowest with an SCI score of 0.31. Interestingly, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal continue to maintain their position among the top 5 cities across all three schemes: equal weighting, sustainability triad, and energy-focused schemes. Furthermore, the energy-focused scheme identifies Montreal as the top-performing city, scoring 0.7, followed by Oshawa at 0.67, and four Canadian cities top the SCI scores in this scheme. In contrast, Lima still remains at the bottom of the list with an SCI score of 0.27. Finally, based on a smart health-focused scheme, Sydney, Osaka, and Hämeenlinna rank highest in SCI scores. Overall, the proposed approach and model provide valuable insights and guidelines for policy-makers and urban planners to design and implement smart city initiatives that can significantly enhance sustainable development and improve quality of life in urban settings.}

There is limited research that envisions how future cities can be backcasted with frugal innovation (FI) underpinning the sustainability pillars. This research aims to narrow the gap. The methodology is based on a systematic literature review and secondary exploratory case studies. The results of the TOWS (threats, opportunities, weaknesses, strengths) analysis on the suitability of FI on smart sustainable cities (SSC) developmental policies show that FI is an affordable and inclusive way to sustainably develop cities without injury to the environment. The findings reveal that the five pillars of a smart sustainable future city can integrate frugal innovation and lean engineering concepts to ensure sustainable development at lower costs. Through frugal innovation embedded in city infrastructure, cleaner methods of production can be realized, and inclusiveness can be fostered.}

This study explored current progress toward building an “Inclusive Smart City (ISC)” through the 2015 U.S. DOT Smart City Challenge. It examined the range and frequency of inclusive strategies that were proposed by cities in their applications and the differences between successful and unsuccessful proposals. After reviewing and analyzing documentation from both rounds, we conclude: (1) insufficient attention was given to these underrepresented population groups in the proposals; (2) more ISC strategies are needed to address these groups’ needs and guarantee their rights; (3) government policies to support ISCs are needed to insure that the implementation of Smart City ideas addresses the needs of these groups; and, (4) universal design practices could be used to address the needs of many underrepresented populations.}

Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques.}

A further heterogeneity analysis showed that smart city development in different regions has different impacts on urban innovation; specifically, compared with the central and western regions, smart city construction in eastern China was seen to have a higher impact on urban innovation output. Moreover, the findings also demonstrated that smart city construction policies have different impacts on urban innovation output in cities of different urban scales.

From this point of view, the study aims to measure the smartness level of cities by performing integrated grey-based methods. In this manner, a grey extension of an integrated Level Based Weight Assessment (LBWA) & Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method has been proposed. Six criteria are weighted with the LBWA-G method, and the performances of 17 European cities are measured by the EDAS-G method. The criteria and cities’ related data are derived from the Global Power City Index (GPCI). Furthermore, sensitivity and comparative analysis are conducted to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methodology. The findings of our study offer many managerial implications.

Here, we aim to examine the acceptance of IoT-based and sustainability-oriented SC services. This study proposes a SC services acceptance model (SCSAM), built over the human, technology and institution dimensions of SC. We tested SCSAM by using structural equation modeling via 640 survey-respondents. The quantitative findings were supported by qualitative analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that personal innovativeness, social influence, quality of service (QoS) and perceived trust are the significant determinants of use intention. Interestingly cost has no significant effect and demographics do not contribute much on the acceptance of smart services. This is the only study in the literature adopting both quantitative and qualitative analysis to examine SC services adoption via an acceptance model based on the SC's multidimensional structure.

abstract = {In the construction of smart cities, facial expression analysis plays a crucial role. It can be used in traffic monitoring systems to alleviate traffic pressure by analyzing the emotional states of drivers and passengers. In the field of smart healthcare, it can provide more precise treatment and services to patients. In the realm of social entertainment, it can offer more intelligent and personalized interactions. In summary, the application of emotion computing technology will play an increasingly significant role in the development of smart cities in the future. In the task of dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER), analyzing the spatial–temporal features of video sequences has become a common research approach. However, facial expression sequences often contain a significant number of neutral frames and noisy frames, potentially increasing computational costs and reducing performance. Effectively extracting key frames for spatial–temporal feature analysis is a critical aspect of dynamic facial expression recognition. To address this issue, we proposed a sampling-wise dynamic facial expression recognition via frame-Sequence contrastive learning method, called SW-FSCL. The SW-FSCL method aims to improve the performance of DFER by using intelligent dual-stream sampling strategies and frame-sequence contrastive learning, extract key frame and reduce the impact of neutral frames and noisy frames. We proposed a key frame proposal (KFP) block to analyze the spatial–temporal features of sequences, calculating weight ratios for key frame extraction. Due to potential information loss in long sequences, we introduce a temporal aggregation (TA) block to prevent data loss and ensure the integrity of temporal information. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that the proposed approach not only outperforms all current state-of-the-art algorithms on two widely-used benchmark datasets (DFEW, FERV39k), but also visualization results produces insights into the interpretability of the SW-FSCL method.}

abstract = {Achieving a sustainable state in smart cities would require ongoing monitoring and evaluation of all activities in different dimensions. Hence, it is essential to use smart systems and adaptable, reliable, and controllable schemes in all dimensions of smart cities. This paper focuses on the on-demand wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) to allow for ongoing and sustainable monitoring and provide application-based services matching goals, conditions, and the environment within in smart cities. Overcoming the challenge of energy limitation, WRSNs are more reliable than wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Hence, the paper proposes a calibration fuzzy-metaheuristic clustering routing scheme (CFMCRS) for on-demand WRSNs. The proposed CFMCRS benefits from resource-saving and energy supplementary techniques in addition to using metaheuristic and fuzzy logic methods to manage roles and energy distribution in nodes and across the network. It also uses a multiobjective function to match and calibrate the network with the nearest-job-next with preemption (NJNP) charging scheduler to meet WRSN requirements in smart cities. The extensive simulation results of the proposed CFMCRS were compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of energy efficiency, latency, minimum sustainability rate, dead rate, survival rate, mean energy of network, number of packets received by base station (BS), request rates, and sensitive analysis. Accordingly, the proposed scheme outperformed the other methods by far for application requirements and improved evaluation factors for application. Ultimately, it can prolong the WRSN lifetime. The simulation results were also validated through ANOVA and its subsequent post-hoc analysis.}

We construct the panel dataset of 286 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period 2006 to 2018, then applies the multi-stage difference-in-differences method to investigate the environmental benefits of SCC policies. The results show that SCC can significantly reduce air pollution by 2.6% ∼ 18 %, except for ozone (increase by 13.9%), water pollution by 0.7%∼ 11.8%, and solid waste pollution by 5.8%∼ 19.7%. Meanwhile, SCC policy shows a more prominent reduction effect in eastern cities, megacities, young local officials and regions with high government capacity. The dynamic effect reveals that the environmental benefits take effect after 2∼4 years of SCC implementation, and then the benefit will increase significantly over time. The mechanism tests indicate that although the rebound effect will deteriorate the environmental quality, SCC can reduce pollution through industrial structure optimization and technological innovation. Overall, this finding inspires other emerging economies to solve the dilemma of economic development and environmental governance at the level of new infrastructure construction.}

Therefore, it is necessary to advance the service qualities of Internet of Things (IoT) applications because the data produced by all these devices will need to be processed quickly and sustainably. Previously, cloud data centers with large capacity interface IoT devices with support servers. While IoT devices proliferate and generate massive amounts of data, communicating between devices and the Cloud is becoming more complex and harder, resulting in high costs and inefficiencies. Fog computing emerges as an approach to address the growing demand for IoT solutions. In this article, an IoT-fog-cloud application’s general framework is developed, followed by an algorithm for Energy efficiency through an integrated approach computation model. Fog-Enabled Smart Cities (FESC) are proposed to minimize service delay and response time by using a fog offloading policy for the fog-enabled IoTs. Also, we developed an analytical model evaluating the proposed framework's effectiveness in reducing the delay of IoT services. Comparing the proposed model and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM-VS) algorithm, the proposed model performs significantly better. Thus, by optimizing response and processing times, fog-enabled smart grids determine whether computation will be performed autonomously or semi-autonomously on fog nodes or in the Cloud.}

Using an exploratory case study approach combined with an explanatory correlational design, this work identifies and explores variables of interest for learning more about, and developing an understanding of, smart spaces. This work also seeks to navigate a way of using theory to inform the work of researchers, practitioners, and those concerned with the making and enacting of smart environments. To this end, ambient theory for smart cities is advanced to accommodate smart spaces as a proposed, viable theory, using a number of variables such as connecting and collaborating. While a good correlation among such variables is found, this work also acknowledges limitations, opening the way for opportunities going forward. In conclusion, this work has implications for the mutual enriching of understandings about smart spaces and smart cities in support of dialogue, debate, and interpretation.}

abstract = {Effective waste management arises as a crucial challenge for smart city development in the current era of rapid urbanization, shifting towards sustainability and public health. Harnessing modern technologies, especially the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with intelligent waste bins, can revolutionize urban waste collection, optimizing efficiency and reducing costs. This paper delves into a multiagent simulation-based framework for understanding and assessing the dynamics of an IoT-enabled smart waste management system. Initiating with the intricate process of garbage generation, we shift our focus to the real-time monitoring capabilities of IoT-connected waste bins. The study further explores protocols to regulate bin status, along with timing mechanisms to trigger garbage collection rounds. Subsequently, a predictive routing system is introduced to determine the most efficient garbage collection routes. For the bins’ filled level tracking, the ultrasonic sensors are commonly used that send out sound waves and track their echo return time, whereas weight sensors measure the garbage load in the bin, providing insights into waste production trends. For data transmission from bins to the central system, various communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and long-distance networks are considered. Through a simulation, we contrast the innovative IoT-enabled sensor-based collection mechanism against the conventional periodic review strategy. Field experiments at the Al Rayyan locale, proximate to Doha, Qatar, facilitate the model demonstration. By leveraging region-specific data, we simulated various aspects including economic factors, environmental impact, public satisfaction, and operational efficiencies. The findings indicate that with an average daily garbage generation of 1.3 kg per individual, the sensor-driven mechanism remarkably outperforms the periodic review approach by covering fewer distances with fewer trucks, while concurrently achieving the key objectives of cost-efficiency, environmental preservation, public satisfaction, and reduced employee workload. This research contributes to the developing field of smart city technology by providing critical insights for urban planners, policymakers, and technologists attempting to build more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.}

Second, if smart city app empowers citizens, what specific features or characteristics of the App are critical drivers of empowerment and the subsequent satisfaction? To answer these two questions, we develop a theoretical framework based on empowerment theory. We argue that smart city app artifacts are linked to citizens’ psychological, social, and political empowerment, and empowerment, in turn, shapes citizens' satisfaction with both the smart city technology and government. Using Jakarta's smart city app Qlue as the research context, we explore how Qlue enhances citizens' empowerment based on survey data from 358 users. The results verified that the app's IT artifacts, especially external properties such as addressability, sensibility, communicability, and associability, play a crucial role in citizen empowerment, leading to higher psychological, social, and political empowerment. Internal properties are related to psychological empowerment only, giving citizens more feelings of control with its programmability, traceability, and memorability features. Empowered citizens, in turn, are generally more satisfied with both the App and the government.}

The findings disclose that the following factors determine about two-thirds (65%) of the smart city transformation readiness: (a) Close distance to domestic airport; (b) Low remoteness value; (c) High population density; (d) Low unemployment level, and; (e) High labour productivity. The study findings and generated insights inform urban policymakers, managers and planners on their policy, planning and practice decisions concerning smart cities.}

It demonstrated the requirements for implementations and discussed four smart applications considering the required input data and produced services. We proposed and illustrate smart city main pillars: transition entities (Governmental Entities, Private Sector Investors, and Ad-Hoc Research Units), list of policies standards and protocols (Holistic, Flexible, Applicable, Sustainable, Integration, Highly Obliged ), the components that should govern by regulations. The paper also demonstrated the proposed smart city architecture layers, including the infrastructure layer, Application Layer, Services Layer, the big data clouds, and the end-users.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the gendered dimensions of this smart city district through gender analysis. This paper analyzes the planning, implementation, and post-occupancy stages of the district through a review of guidelines of gender-mainstreaming policies of Korean cities, interviews of experts involved, and a survey of 100 residents to gain an insight into how users perceive the spatial aspects of the women-friendly walking environment. Results show that, at the planning stage, little interprofessional communication occurs between smart city experts and ‘women-friendly city’ experts. At the implementation stage, this leads to incomplete gender-mainstreaming of the district. Post-occupancy survey results reveal, however, that despite these shortcomings, both women and men perceive the ‘Specially Designed Zone for Women’ to be safe. Even so, there is a gender difference in the perception regarding smart installations. CCTVs are more important to men than women, while on-site emergency bells are more significant to women than men. This indicates that women need more active safety systems than passive surveillance systems. This paper argues that a gendered perspective is needed for the more inclusive planning of smart cities.}

In IoT-enabled smart cities, due to the advancement of technologies, sensors and actuators collect vast quantities of data that are analyzed to extract potentially useful information. However, due to the noise and diversity of the data generated, only a small portion of the massive data collected from smart cities is used. In sustainable Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) management, environmental deterioration resulting from improper land usage in the digital ecosystem is a global issue that has garnered attention. The deep learning techniques of AI are recognized for their capacity to manage vast amounts of erroneous and unstructured data. In this paper, we propose a morphologically augmented fine-tuned DenseNet-121(MAFDN) LULC classification model to automate the categorization of high spatial resolution scene images for environmental conservation. This work includes an augmentation process (i.e. erosion, dilation, blurring, and contrast enhancement operations) to extract spatial patterns and enlarge the training size of the dataset. A few state-of-the-art techniques are incorporated for contrasting the efficacy of the proposed approach. This facilitates green resource management and personalized provision of services.}

Further, the CPS stationing has improved the quality of various services like healthcare, transportation, environmental, etc., provided in a typical smart city ecosystem. But, the embodiment of CPS has also increased the surface area for cyber-attacks. In this paper, the various security and privacy issues at the different levels in the architecture of a smart city are discussed. The domain-centric security issues evolved with the deployment of CPS in transportation, healthcare, smart grids, and smart homes are also explored. Scopus publications for the years 2016–2020 are considered for the bibliometric analysis in security. It has been observed that a major number of security solutions have been proposed in the domain of smart homes during these years, whereas much scope is still there to address security and privacy challenges for CPS equipped smart grids. But over time, the security of smart grids is also becoming an area of interest for researchers. The article is concluded with the research gaps and future scope to cater secure smart city services.}

The advent of digital platforms and dedicated mobile apps, as well as new business models based on the concept of access over ownership and sharing economy (sharing mobility and Mobility as a Service), promises to reshape this sector. It will facilitate and speed up the diffusion of more sustainable and efficient means of transportation based on an intermodal mobility management perspective. The main goal of this paper is to examine the current state of smart mobility together with those factors that may influence the extent of modern sharing mobility proliferation and penetration through ICT applications and social media. The authors applied the content analysis using a sample of more than 1000 citizens' and visitors' reviews published on the official digital platforms of the smart city of Milan. The paper includes a comparison with data drawn from the public urban mobility services users. Based on the nodes resulting from the content analysis, the STEEP method was adopted in order to apply a more complex perspective concerning social, technological, environmental, economic and political issues. This strategic analytical tool was combined with the SWOT analysis dimensions to provide a comprehensive practical contribution to modern municipal smart mobility management systems. The results highlight the need for both smart mobility solutions suppliers and institutions to properly understand and communicate how digital services can be implemented across different users' touchpoints and communication channels to increase the value-added provided to citizens and visitors alike.}

The study found an increasing openness of authorities to integrate smart components within the city profile with a focus on smart mobility domain, mostly connected with smart apps and online platforms. However, little information is available regarding the smart projects, with discrepancies between the statistics and the available information, suggesting the need for clarifications and harmonized statistics in order to articulate more effective evidence-based policies.}

The characteristics of dynamic evolution and complexity are key issues for megacity planners and require a new systematic and modeling approach. Multiscale models involved in smart cities and megacities have recently become a popular topic because they can understand complex adaptive systems and efficiently solve complex problems at multiple scales (i.e., micro, meso, and macro) to improve system efficiency and reduce computational complexity and cost. However, there are numerous opportunities to improve this interdisciplinary field considering the lack of applicability of the multiscale modeling approach in megacities and smart cities, and the potential of multiscale modeling in various complex systems within smart cities. Therefore, a review that summarizes the state-of-art researches and opens opportunities around the theme of multiscale modeling participating in megacities and smart cities is warranted. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive review covering the introduction of megacities, their current challenges, and their emergence in smart cities. Then, the introduction of the smart city along with its characteristics and different generations is disclosed. Moreover, we shed light on multiscale modeling, its categories (i.e., sequential multiscale modeling and concurrent multiscale modeling), and the need for multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities along with its emerging applications. Finally, based on a literature review, the study highlights the current challenges and future directions related to multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities, which provide a roadmap for the optimized operation of megacities and smart city systems.}

This framework presents an interrupt access control scheme that exhibits survivability characteristics important to mission-critical applications. Analytically, the author's concept is represented by an irreversible Markov process, for which a system of equilibrium equations and stationary probabilities are defined. Based on the latter, a qualitative metric was formulated, which included such indicators as the average number of requests accepted for service in the 5 G cluster, the probability of losing an incoming request, and the average volume of network resource units used in the 5 G cluster. For the single input data that characterizes a real NS 5 G cluster, a comparison of the author's and known competing access control schemes in terms of formulated qualitative metrics is implemented. The obtained results showed that the author's concept prevails over the competitor in the range of low loads. Note that in this range, the advantage of the author's scheme over the competitor significantly increases with the increase in the number of network segments into which the information environment of the 5 G cluster is divided.}

With the proliferation of smart sensor nodes (IoT) generating real-time data, there is a pressing need to overcome device limitations, including finite battery life and computational resources. Our proposed framework leverages HAP-based MEC servers, offering on-demand computation and communication resources without extensive physical infrastructure. Additionally, WPT, through terrestrial networks, addresses IoT device battery constraints by enabling energy harvesting from nearby access points. The primary focus is joint optimization, aiming to maximize computing bits while minimizing energy consumption under system constraints. Given the optimization problem’s complexity, we employ a decomposition approach, breaking it into sub-problems. The first part handles mode selection and task segmentation, determining optimal placement and mode selection variables. The second part addresses resource allocation, optimizing transmission power, offloading time, energy harvesting time, and device computational resources. Numerical results demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness compared to relevant benchmark schemes. This approach holds promise for enhancing IoT device performance and energy efficiency in smart city applications.}

Such uncertainty has led to the techno-centric versus human-centric debate currently dominating the Smart City discussion. This paper adopts a systems approach to stratify society into three strata: the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and system (macro). I implement a systematic review of the Smart City literature to examine how Smart Cities are conceptualized. From an analysis of 41 papers, this research identifies a dualistic phenomenon occurring at all points in the stratified city system: sources of innovation (SOI) and Loci of change (LOC). Here, SOI refers to the perceptions of deficiencies which initiate the learning curve of innovation, while LOC refers to the structures which allow the learning curve to disseminate through the system. This analysis highlights an overemphasis on the organizational stratum and insufficient attention to the individual and system strata. To address this shortfall, I introduce the Social Innovation Cycle. This multi-level social innovation framework incorporates the interdependencies of SOI and LOC to link all strata, mitigate power asymmetries, and reduce marginalization. In so doing, I delineate where policy implementation can be directed for holistically developing the Smart City. I recommend that Smart City policy should target the intersection of SOI and LOC in pursuit of human-centricity.}

The Chinese government proposed enhancing citizens' sense of gain to achieve the citizen-centric development goal. To develop a more realistic improving path for the sustainability of smart city services (SCS), it is necessary to clarify the factors that affect citizens' sense of gain of smart city services (CSGSCS). To achieve this objective, 9 hypotheses were developed based on the modified expectation confirmation theory. Hypothesis testing, mediating effect testing, and heterogeneity analysis was conducted based on data collected from Nanjing citizens. The results indicate that: 1) Expectation-Perception Performance, including Content of SCS, Channel of SCS, and Support of SCS, all have positive direct effects on CSGSCS; 2) Expectation Confirmation directly affects CSGSCS and mediates the positive effect of the Expectation-Perception Performance on CSGSCS; 3) Heterogeneity of age and usage frequency have significant effects on CSGSCS. Finally, three policy implications were proposed, including encouraging citizens to participate in SCS supply, bridging the digital divide created by SCS, and improving the policy and legal system on SCS. This research enriches the academic framework and provides guidance for sustainable supply of SCS in similar cities around the world.}

Along these lines, this research tries to capture the dynamics behind the municipality's role in the formulated partnerships. By using a unique, tailor-made questionnaire and advanced statistical techniques, the paper identifies and analyses the direct and indirect effects of different stakeholders in the strategic design and implementation of smart initiatives. The main findings underline the public and private organizations' critical role in supporting a smart strategy. A systematic analysis of partnerships may help public authorities and citizens to formulate an effective smart city strategy, overcome potential challenges in smart initiatives and achieve sustainability and growth.}

This work aims to improve the comprehensive performance of the Smart City-oriented high-dimensional Big Data Management (BDM) platform and promote the far-reaching development of SCC. It comprehensively optimizes the calculation process of the BDM platform through Machine Learning (ML), reduces the dimension of the data, and improves the calculation effect. To this end, this work first introduces the concept of SCC and the BDM platform application design. Then, it discusses the design concept of using ML technology to optimize the calculation effect of the BDM platform. Finally, the Tensor Train Support Vector Machine (TT-SVM) model is designed based on dimension reduction data processing. The proposed model can comprehensively optimize the BDM platform, and the model is compared with other models and evaluated. The research results show that the accuracy of the reduced dimension classification of the TT-SVM model is more than 95. The lowest average processing time for the model’s reduced dimension classification is about 1ms. The model’s highest data processing accuracy is about 98%, and the average processing time is between 1.0–1.5ms. Compared with traditional models and BDM platforms, the proposed model has a breakthrough performance improvement, so it plays an important role in future SCC. This work has achieved a great breakthrough in big data processing, and innovatively improved the application mode of high-dimensional big data technology by integrating multiple technologies. Therefore, the finding provides targeted technical reference for algorithms in BDM platform and contributes to the construction and improvement of Smart City.}

However, intermittent power generation from renewable energy sources and increased peak load due to EV charging can pose technical challenges for the power systems. Improved load matching through energy system optimization can minimize these challenges. This paper assesses the optimal urban-scale energy matching potentials in a net-zero energy city powered by wind and solar energy, considering three EV charging scenarios: opportunistic charging, smart charging, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G). A city on the west coast of Sweden is used as a case study. The smart charging and V2G schemes aim to minimize the mismatch between generation and load, and are formulated as quadratic programming problems. The simulation results show that the optimal load matching performance is achieved in a net-zero energy city with the V2G scheme and a wind-PV electricity production share of 70:30. The load matching performance in the optimal net-zero energy city is increased from 68% with opportunistic charging to 73% with smart charging and further to 84% with V2G. It is also shown that a 2.4 GWh EV battery participating in the V2G scheme equals 1.4 GWh stationary energy storage in improving urban-scale load matching performance. The findings indicate that EVs have a high potential to provide flexibility to urban energy systems.}

Further, a definition for a smart city project is suggested. This research is within a case study methodology, and was based on a mixed method approach that employed nine key informant interviews and two questionnaires. The results revealed that the project managers perceived different needs and goals within the context of smart city innovation and realization. The project managers perception of smart city was mainly within a smart economy and smart governance perspective. However, the project managers also criticized the relatively less focus on public participations and dialogue-oriented smart city solutions. The perceived major barriers to real smart city implementations were regulations; silos; and the choice of stakeholders, including companies promising too much. The major advantages include the different perspectives and types of knowledge of various stakeholders.}

A combination of these technologies could provide a core technology for the urban digital twin to support sustainable smart city design. Through an insightful literature review, this paper summarizes the different disciplinary classifications of GIS and BIM functional integration, distills the value of data, and discusses the ontology-based data integration approach that GIS and BIM should take in the future to conduct research on integration applications in smart cities. To verify this view, keyword analysis, co-country analysis, and co-citation and coupling analyses are conducted using CiteSpace. GIS and BIM integration has attracted much attention. However, a professional disconnect and fragmented composition pose challenges in the field of GIS and BIM integration.

abstract = {The detection of critical situations through the adoption of multi-sensor Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) can significantly reduce the time between the initial stages of urban emergencies and the actual responses to relieve its negative effects, usually through the rescuing of endangered people, the attending to eventual victims, and the mitigating of its causes. However, although the benefits of such units are well known, their proper positioning in a city is challenging when considering a limited set of available units. In this sense, data-driven approaches can be leveraged to provide a better perception of the urban environments under consideration, allowing emergency management systems to be tailored to the specificities of a target city, thus improving the positioning of EDUs. This article proposes the processing of geospatial data of emergency-related urban infrastructure to support the computing of risk zones in a city, which is retrieved from the OpenStreetMap database together with the map of streets within a defined area. Since risk zones indirectly indicate the proportional number of detection units to be deployed, for each configuration setting of the EDUs, we propose an algorithm that computes the positions for such units only on streets, in a balanced way. Furthermore, considering that EDUs are expected to report detected emergencies through a wireless connection, we have also modelled the coverage area of existing networks in a city, which is also processed according to a suitable dataset. The proposed algorithm performs a fine-grained positioning of EDUs based on the number of active networks, flexibly favouring the EDUs' connectivity requirements such as reliability, throughput, latency, and transmission costs according to the actual demands of any urban emergency management system. Experimental results with real data demonstrated the applicability of the proposed mathematical model and the associated algorithm, reinforcing its practical application for the planning and construction of smart cities.}

We implement both synchronous and asynchronous communication modes for agents interacting with the knowledge graph. When occurring in conjunction, directed acyclic graphs of derivations can arise, with changing data propagating through the knowledge graph by means of agents’ actions. While the framework itself is domain-agnostic, we apply it in the context of smart cities as part of the World Avatar project and demonstrate that it is capable of handling sequential events across different timescales. Starting from source information, the framework automatically populates derived data and ensures they remain up to date upon access for a potential flood impact assessment use case.}

abstract = {A data fusion and information integration (DFII-VT) framework is proposed to solve the batch-based vehicle matching/tracking problem using heterogeneous fixed-location and mobile sensing data available in smart cities. To make the model more realistic, traffic knowledge such as lane-choice decision, traffic merging, travel time and vehicle characteristics are calibrated using the historical dataset and then integrated into the model. The problem can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization model, and solved using a dynamic programming/Kuhn-Munkres algorithm-based two-step approach. By doing so, the proposed method can obtain individual travel times of the matched data pairs, and these can be directly used to estimate the corridor travel times of individual vehicles. The experimental results show that the fusion of mobile sensing data and fixed-location data yields significantly better results than using single-source data. Significant improvements in matching accuracy are obtained as more traffic information is integrated into the model. Therefore, the method may be considered a framework for integrating the manifold traffic information acquired within smart cities to obtain more accurate matching results and further used to optimize other fine-grained traffic applications, such as estimating vehicle trajectories along arterial corridors, estimating individual vehicle-based fuel consumption/emissions, and helping to infer real-time queuing processes at signalized intersections. The paper also studies some practical issues related to the use of heterogeneous traffic data, such as data errors, and detection failures.}

An examination of the academic literature since the early 2000s reveals the unfolding of spatiotemporal trends relating to this concept. It has been emerging to represent a sector-specified version of its sister concept of smart cities, also popularized in the past decade. However, the idea of the smart energy city has its own historic precursors and nationally specific trajectories. It rose from concerns with energy efficient/green buildings as well as smart grids for low carbon and distributed energy generation and distribution, which were later scaled up to the whole urban scale, and to embrace multiple other urban sectors and urban domains. By so doing, and combining the developments in ICT-led smart cities and sustainable energy, the notion of the smart energy city has come close to represent a digitally-mediated variant of low carbon cities. It can, thus, be conceptualized as a blend of smart cities and low carbon cities. National and urban case studies help to further distinguish “actually existing” projects, patterns, and conceptualization relating to both smart cities and smart energy cities and barriers to their practical integration. A greater focus on intersystem integration and a multistakeholder approach more recently offers a stronger representation of interdisciplinarity and conveys the complexity of the system involved, where humans and social systems become increasingly more central.}

The manuscript strives to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to Twitter messages using supervised learning to achieve real-time automated event detection in smart cities. A semantic-based taxonomy of risks is devised to discover and analyse associated events from data streams, with a view to: (i) read and process, in real-time, published texts (ii) classify each text into one representative real-world category (iii) assign a citizen satisfaction value to each event. To select the language processing models striking the best balance between accuracy and processing speed, we conducted a pre-emptive evaluation, comparing several baseline language models formerly employed by researchers for event classification. A heuristic analysis of several smart cities and community initiatives was conducted, with a view to define real-world scenarios as basis for determining correlations between two or more co-occurring event types and their associated levels of citizen satisfaction, while further considering environmental factors. Based on Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA), we established the relationships between scenario variables, obtaining a variance of 60%–90% between the dependent and independent variables. The selected combination of supervised NLP techniques leverages an accuracy of 88.5%. We found that all regression models had at least one variable below the 0.05 threshold of the f−test, therefore at least one statistically significant independent variable. These findings ultimately illustrate how citizens, taking the role of active social sensors, can yield vital data that authorities can use to make educated decisions and sustainably construct smarter cities.}

abstract = {Aiming to safeguard a decentralized setup such as smart cities, collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) has become a mainstream security mechanism to protect different types of computer networks, especially decentralized computing platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). The main benefit of CIDS relies on the information sharing process among devices, nodes, software and hardware entities. However, traditional CIDS often requires a trusted third partner, e.g., a centralized computing server, to help build up a trusted communication channel among various entities. Such requirement is not practical in real-world implementation, making the integrity of shared information compromised easily. With the wide adoption, blockchain technology has given a solution to protect the distributed/collaborative detection system. In the current market, blockchain technology has been extensively researched across many detection scenarios, but there is a need to explore how such technology can overall contribute to CIDS and a general distributed detection system. In this work, we introduce a blockchain-assisted security management framework for CIDS, which summarizes and provides an integrated protection given by blockchain. In the case study, we evaluate our proposed framework in both a simulated and a real CIDS setup with challenge-based mechanism. The results demonstrate the promising benefits provided by blockchain in CIDS.}

abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have grown in popularity, both in research and in practice. The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.}

This study identified 13 factors in four categories to analyse the urban form of Egypt’s New Administrative Capital City, while ignoring lifestyle, since the city is still under construction. A framework for developing the singularity of capital cities is presented in our results, as a means of increasing the city’s singularity across its urban forms. By applying the four keys and the factors of singularity, this article concludes with a framework for enhancing the urban structure of smart cities. It was also suggested that the smart city concept could provide new directions for designing unique capital cities worldwide.}

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer technology have been promising for empowering and enabling seamless operation of wireless sensors and developing sustainable systems such as wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). Relying on this technology and focusing on WRSNs, this paper proposes an adaptive charging scheduling algorithm called the three-stage fuzzy metaheuristic algorithm (TSFM) by using the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and a multiobjective function designed to meet the application requirements of WRSNs in smart cities. The TSFM algorithm benefits from the WOA for the automated configuration and optimization of the fuzzy rule-base table in a three-stage fuzzy inference system for clustering, routing, and scheduling mobile charging simultaneously. Unlike the other methods, the TSFM algorithm determines the ratio of effect of fuzzy input parameters of every stage based on application and environment in addition to considering effective parameters for every stage, especially for charging scheduling (e.g., the energy of a charge-request node, the distance between a charge-request node and a mobile charging (MC), the density of a charge-request node, the average energy consumption rate of a charge-request node, and the time elapsed after a charge request). Furthermore, for the proper distribution of energy in a network, better responsiveness, and optimal use of a charging robot, two energy thresholds are defined in the TSFM algorithm, namely as the charging request issue threshold and the charging operation completion threshold. The TSFM algorithm is adaptable to applications, environments, and requirements of WRSNs not only by using the features of nodes (as the fuzzy input parameters) but also by considering the application-specific features, environments, and infrastructure (e.g., network size, number of nodes, base station (BS) positions, and designer’s goals) within the process of optimizing tunable parameters. The TSFM algorithm was evaluated and compared with some common methods such as FCFS, NJNP, and ESS in terms of functional metrics such as energy utility, charging latency, survival rate, death rate of nodes, system stability, number of packets received by BS, number of request nodes, number of alive nodes, average residual energy, adaptability analysis, and statistical validation in two scenarios and six applications. According to the simulation results, the proposed TSFM algorithm improved the performance criteria and outperformed the other methods by far in terms of application. For instance, the TSFM algorithm improved the minimum system stability rate by 167%, 0.73%, and 123% compared with FCFS, NJNP, and ESS methods, respectively.}

These sensors increasingly include physiological and sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional states of urban citizens. In urban planning, emotional data has so far been conceptualised as ‘people as sensors’ where data is used to create an aggregated emotion layer for real-time urban planning. This paper argues this approach does not enable citizens any meaningful participation in urban planning. In contrast, this paper demonstrates what emotion can ‘do’ when citizen actively use emotions to participate in the problem framing in smart city governance. The paper offers a framework of smart city participation with emotion data by focusing on the Bio Mapping project, where physiological sensors are used as participatory mapping approach that led to urban planning. This approach enabled citizens to engage in a dialogue around their emotional response to urban space and articulate the potential for emotion data in urban governance. There needs to be a consideration of 1) multi-dimensional emotion data, 2) an active participant role, 3) extended participation within the planning process 4), and empowerment within urban governance. The paper argues that a participatory approach to emotion data can function as a dynamic leverage point of negotiation in smart city governance between citizens, urban space, and civic agencies.}

However, the use of any technology raises new issues and challenges. In a smart city, the vulnerable action of an individual or organization can put the entire city at risk. Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction. The aim of this paper is survey and discus on explanation of cyber security, smart cities, and survey of available relevant literature on security in that technology. For this purpose, the present study focuses on the four main components of a smart city, i.e. smart grid, Smart building, Smart transportation system, and Smart healthcare. In particular, summary of two deep learning method and cyber-security programs as well as technology correlation in smart cities are discussed. Furthermore, effective functional solutions in maintaining cyber-security and user privacy in smart cities are explained. The next progress trends of smart city with cyber security are described. Solutions need to be devised to address each of the security issues. The research in this study showed that meeting these challenges depends on the hard work of governments, developers of equipment and software and companies providing IT security services. In addition, designing flexible systems with high information protection capabilities is essential to prevent serious security incidents as these incidents can lead to disastrous financial, data, credit and loss of public trust.}

The environmental features of urban cities mean that signal transmission can be affected across communication networks, with packet delays, packet loss and higher error rates occurring during data exchange. There is a need for sustainable and robust low-energy signals for smart EV communication. The present paper proposes a novel method for continuous, robust video data transmission at low energy via multi-sensory-enabled 5G technology. The transceivers (transmitters and receivers) are designed with multiple low-energy sensors for detecting data availability at the receiver device. By applying a threshold level detection technique, data availability is identified dependent upon energy level and successive data exchange occurs between transceivers. The application of low-energy signal transmission reduces power usage during video data transmission and leads to a sustainable solution for intelligent EV applications. The performance of the proposed multi-sensory technique is tested and verified using various calibrated parameters considering key metrics including collision error, propagation error, sensing error and accuracy. The proposed model significantly improves accuracy, with higher sensing capabilities and lower delays and propagation errors compared to the existing buffer model.}

Implementing big data and the internet of things improves the monitoring and integration of different infrastructure systems in SC and thus makes our cities more efficient, livable, and sustainable. However, big data is more vulnerable to attacks and hacking, posing significant challenges to the SC's privacy and security. Moreover, more regulations and rules about protecting user data are being enforced worldwide. Compared with centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) provides a natural method to protect users' privacy by distributing learning over decentralized data and offers artificial intelligence advantages for sensitive, heterogeneous data domains. Researchers have recently implemented FL, motivated by the improvement in privacy and security of integrated systems in SC. However, many technological problems and risks have been identified. This study provides a comprehensive review of FL's application to improve privacy and security in SC systems (i.e., transportation, healthcare, communication, etc.). The benefits, drawbacks, open research issues and future directions of the implementation of FL in SC are thoroughly discussed. The study concluded that the existing FL systems required comprehensive testing for different types of attacks, further improving the data protection and performance in SC.}

Each existing air quality monitoring method carries inherent limitations alongside its advantages. This study addresses the drawbacks of both satellite-based and fixed monitoring stations by proposing a drone-based air quality monitoring solution. The entire urban area was surveyed using a multi-rotor drone equipped with sensors capable of measuring atmospheric components, resulting in the creation of high-resolution air pollution maps. The expansive urban area, exceeding the coverage capacity of a single flight, was systematically subdivided into subregions. Distinct measurements were conducted in each subregion, and a consolidated mapping was generated by combining the individual results obtained. The drone, operating autonomously, conducted precise measurements on a citywide scale, enhancing the consistency of pollutant mapping by eliminating potential errors associated with manual control. Pollution sources were identified throughout the city, and real-time data revealed how transportation-induced air pollution affected different regions. Environmental factors like wind and pressure differences were identified as influential in the varied spread of air pollutants across different parts of the city. The study underscores the pivotal role of transportation in urban air pollution, laying the groundwork for the development of targeted pollution control strategies in urban environments. Furthermore, the research validates the potential of UAVs in advancing the efficient management of smart cities, particularly through the monitoring and analysis of air pollution stemming from transportation.}

Navigation Reference Spatial Data (NRSD) was created using the spatial likelihood method using GPS trajectories and OpenStreetMap. This NRSD was also used to design the traffic environment using distance, speed, and time interval mapping. After the NRSD creation, the framework used the real-time data of the registered user to compute the traffic density using the Graham scan with the k means algorithm. Eight standard air quality parameters were used to identify the air quality index of a particular node using a Bayesian Classifier. A case analysis was performed on the road network of three major cities of north India lying within a bounding box of (lat:30.518065, lon:76.659055) to (lat: 30.512501, lon:76.658808) was performed to validate the proposed framework. Based on the performed experiment, the proposed framework achieved maximum accuracy of 98 percent. Similarly, NSRD improves the framework's accuracy by 3.8% in comparison to the baseline dataset. In 87 percent of scenarios, this framework can also determine the shortest path by avoiding traffic.}

The Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm adds a relational connotation between objects typical of human relationships. Objects operate as equals and request/provide information among them in the perspective of providing IoT services to users while maintaining their individuality. Social object relationship enables the design of solutions aiming to improve the exchange of information among network nodes in terms of security from malicious attacks external to the so-called social network of objects. In this context, a new SIoT smart city solution is presented in this article: private and public vehicles together with pedestrians are involved in a real-time collection of data to improve the viability of the city in order to suggest new directions and information to citizens to better organize how to live the city. The developed architecture presented in this article is equipped with an artificial intelligence that process collected traffic data and, thanks to machine learning techniques, evaluate the directions and flows undertaken by vehicles and pedestrians on a daily basis. The authors are also presenting an application that allow both citizens to live the city in a better way and municipal authorities to promptly manage traffic flows. The proposed system was installed in a specific area of Cagliari (Italy) and the traffic flows have been compared with daily traffic data monitored before the installation, observing an average gain of up to 35 percent in daily traffic reduction.}

abstract = {Enhancing urban resilience is increasingly crucial for cities to achieve sustainable development. However, existing studies have a limited understanding of the resilience of shrinking cities and their response policies. Taking Yichun, a typical shrinking city in China, as an example, this study constructs a system dynamics model to assess urban resilience from a subsystem perspective and explores the relationship between the dynamic development of resilience and urban shrinkage from 2008 to 2028. Then, a smart decline response policy of Yichun is put forward. The findings indicate that the evolution curve of urban resilience shows a fluctuating growth trend as a whole and that the dominant subsystems of resilience are changing. The occurrence of urban shrinkage inhibits the dynamic development of urban resilience and has various effects on the subsystems of resilience. Compared with the regrowth strategy, the smart decline strategy can effectively improve the resilience and mitigate the adverse impact of urban shrinkage on the resilience under the condition of limited resources. Resilience can be proven to be a viable perspective to help formulate a response strategy of shrinking cities. These findings will enhance comprehension of the resilience of shrinking cities and provide a reference to address urban shrinkage and formulate corresponding governance strategies.}

abstract = {Sustainable smart cities are confronted by technological, organisational and external risks, making their governance difficult and susceptible to manipulation. Based on a comprehensive literature review of 796 systematically retrieved articles, the current study proposes a multilayered technology-organisation-environment (TOE-based) risk management framework for sustainable smart city governance. A total of 56 risks are identified and grouped into TOE categories. There are 17 technological risks, including IoT networks, public internet management and user safety concerns, with a 38.7% contribution to smart city governance risks. With a 15.6% share, there are 11 organisational risks, including user data security and cloud management. There are 28 external risks with a contribution of 46.7% to the smart city governance and consist of smart city's environment, governance, integration and security risks. A multilayered TOE-based risk management framework is proposed to identify and manage the risks associated with smart city governance in the current study. The framework links smart citizens to each other through the smart city governance team and the integrated TOE layers. The iterative risk management process of identification, analysis, evaluation, monitoring and response planning is carried out in the TOE layers, both at the external layer levels and internal management levels. The proposed framework operationalises the risk management process for smart city governance by presenting the collection of pertinent risks and their thematic TOE categorisation. The criticality of the identified risks in line with the study's rankings can help researchers and practitioners understand the top risks of smart city governance. These risks present investment opportunities for city governance bodies to develop critical and effective responses as well as provide safety, security and enhanced privacy for citizens.}
