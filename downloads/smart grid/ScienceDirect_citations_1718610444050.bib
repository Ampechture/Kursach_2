abstract = {Smart cities are a way for China to construct an innovative and environmentally conscious nation. The paper examines the impact of smart cities on corporate green governance and provides a theoretical foundation for formulating and executing smart city policy in China. Based on panel data from Chinese A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2008 to 2020, this study constructs a multiperiod double-difference model to examine the influence of smart cities on corporate green governance. Additionally, it uses a spatial double-difference model to investigate the spatial spillover effect of smart cities on neighboring areas. The findings indicate that smart cities effectively enhance corporate green governance. Analyzing the influencing mechanisms reveals that resource allocation efficiency, technological innovation, management environmental awareness, and regional environmental enforcement efforts act as mediators. Furthermore, the study reveals that the impact of smart cities on promoting corporate green governance is more pronounced in regions with lower levels of marketization and resource-based cities. Moreover, the research explores the spatial spillover effects of smart cities, with an effective radius of approximately 350 km. The optimal spatial correlation zone for green governance of businesses in neighboring areas in relation to smart cities is within a range of 250–350 km. This is manifested by the significant promotion of green governance in neighboring area businesses facilitated by smart cities.}

First, we develop a conceptual framework based on the literature that addresses sustainable transportation in cities,with a focus on cycling. Afterwards, we use this framework to explore how cycling is mentioned in the official discourse of cities by examining published official city documents using discourse analysis. Thus, we investigate the narratives published around smart cycling in seven cities: Helsinki, Montreal, Moscow, Tokyo, Dublin, Boston, and Vancouver. Conducting discourse analysis helps contextualize the implementation of smart cycling in cities, allowing us to grasp whether and how the narratives of smart cycling in the cities’ discourse are aligned towards a more technical or social recipe. This research shows that smart cycling narratives in cities emphasize both its social and technical aspects, reflecting the socio-technical aspects and nature of smart cycling and its discourse. This comprehensive understanding of smart cycling indicates that it can play different roles in different cities, based on a city’s goals and vision. Hence, smart cycling is a versatile tool for addressing urban challenges and building smarter, more sustainable cities, both technically and socially.}

abstract = {A series of studies have been conducted in recent years to address the academic and policy debate on smart cities, some of which argue that the adoption of smart technologies to manage cities can exacerbate inequalities in urban development by favoring the classes that benefit from this model. However, to date, the links between smart cities and urban inequality (UI) has never been empirically tested at the city level of statistical inference. Therefore, with a combination of the difference-in-difference (DID) model and heterogeneity-robustness estimate, a quasi-natural experiment concerned with China's smart city policy was carried out. The following are the primary conclusions: First, smart city construction alleviates urban inequality. Following several robustness tests, the finding is still reliable. Second, the effect of smart city construction on inequality is heterogeneous. Third, there is a significant positive spatial spillover effect of the impact of smart city construction on inequality. Therefore, it is suggested to formulate targeted smart city development strategies from the following aspects: strengthening the overall planning and strategic layout of smart city projects, focusing on social equity and protecting the interests of vulnerable groups, improving regional cooperation mechanisms, attracting and cultivating innovative talents, giving priority to the impact of heterogeneous cities, and emphasizing the participation and autonomy of grassroots communities, so as to tap the potential of digital technology in sustainable cities and societies.}

Using the smart city pilot as a quasi-natural experiment in government digital governance, the progressive difference-in-differences method was used to investigate whether the government's digital governance capacity promotes green and sustainable development. The main findings are as follows: the improvement of the government's digital governance capacity significantly contributes to green and sustainable development. After a series of placebo tests and robustness tests, the results of this paper still hold. Government digital governance promotes natural resource management mainly through two mechanisms: green technology innovation and intellectual property protection, and the quality of green technology innovation plays a more critical role than quantity. The impact of improved government digital governance on natural resource management varies significantly across different types of cities, cities with different political levels, and cities with different urban locations and human capital levels.}

Given the climate change paradox and urbanization trends, cities’ success would not only depend on smartness and sustainability, but also resilience to all forthcoming economic, environmental, or behavioral changes. Numerous technologies have surfaced and proved effective in CO2 removal from the local environment. However, the optimal placement of these smart filters is a complex task and require logical and strategic decision-making. Determining the optimal location is one of the key factors for establishing a network of smart air filters. This study used a GIS-based suitability analysis for identifying optimal locations for smart filters based on pollution hotspots (population and spatial proximity to industry, commercial centers, roads, high-traffic areas, and intersections). The spatial analysis involves the determination and preparation of input layers, ranking layers, assigning weights to each criterion, and generation of a suitability map. The sites with a higher suitability score (7 or above) are optimum sites for air filters. The sites are spatially distributed over different regions. The findings revealed that GIS-based suitability analysis can be an effective technique for placing smart filters within an urban environment. These findings can help decision-makers to prioritize the location considering environmental constraints. The proposed solution aims to pave the way for fostering resilient, smart, and sustainable cities through a community sensing platform targeting hotspots within spatial variations.}

The proposed scheme aims to optimize two primary objectives—minimizing operational costs and reducing emissions—simultaneously, fostering a more environmentally conscious and economically efficient transportation network. The Modified Bat Algorithm (MBA) is employed as the optimizer to address the MOO challenges, leveraging its capacity to efficiently explore solution spaces and converge to optimal or near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, the study introduces the integration of a Digital Twin model, providing a virtual representation of the transportation system, for comprehensive simulations and evaluations. The utilization of the MBA as an optimizer showcases its efficacy in achieving a balance between cost-effectiveness and environmental impact reduction. By deploying the Digital Twin model, the paper offers a dynamic and realistic simulation environment, enabling a thorough exploration of various scenarios and ensuring the robustness and adaptability of the proposed route planning scheme. The results demonstrate the superiority of the Multi-Objective Optimization framework, enhanced by MBA, in comparison to conventional optimization algorithms, as it effectively addresses the complexities of smart city public transport systems. The findings underscore the significance of incorporating digital twin technologies for the sustainable and resilient planning of urban transportation networks in the era of smart cities.}

The results of panel data of different indicator samples show unique conclusions. First, smart city pilot policy in megacities has significant impact on urban greenness, primarily due to demographic and economic developments. Second, the impact is different between the megacity and national level, and different factors of urban greenness have different effects on smart city construction. Third, the effects are time-lagged and lasted for years, and regional heterogeneity divided by building climate zones is existed, where the effect is more obvious in city agglomeration.

abstract = {The field of smart cities has seen significant advancements in recent years to improve citizens' quality of life. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing (EC), along with Artificial Intelligence (AI), are being utilized to achieve this goal. This study focuses on a specific branch of IoT known as Visual IoT, which uses digital cameras as sensors and relies on visual data. Advances in AI have enabled researchers to integrate AI models into camera-based edge devices, increasing the use of AI-powered Visual IoT systems in smart cities. However, since the energy consumption in battery-powered systems is naturally a concern, being deployed outdoors for visual data gathering with the integration of AI-based processing raises a significant challenge. This paper examines AI-powered Visual IoT systems in smart cities with a special emphasis on energy efficiency. Our goal is not only to evaluate how AI is used in Visual IoT systems in the context of smart cities but also to evaluate the level of consideration given to the energy efficiency aspect in the reviewed studies. Furthermore, we explore all of the methods used to address it. Through our work, readers will gain insights into the current landscape of Visual IoT in smart cities and an understanding of how much importance is placed on energy consumption in AI-integrated solutions.}

The energy management model within the traffic flow system focuses on dynamic assignment, considering the power consumption associated with the density of moving vehicles. EVs play a key role in economically managing energy in both static and dynamic behaviors within charging stations while aligning with the current traffic flow. To enhance data security within the smart city ecosystem, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based decentralized cyber security approach is recommended. This approach ensures that data transactions involving mobile energy resources are secured against cyber-attacks through the use of public, private, and transaction blocks. Additionally, an uncertainty-based copula function is presented to create a precise management environment within the smart city.

However, despite significant progress in understanding the distinct roles of emerging data-driven governance systems—namely City Brain, Smart Urban Metabolism (SUM), and platform urbanism—enabled by Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), a critical gap persists in systematically exploring the untapped potential stemming from their synergistic and collaborative integration in the context of environmental governance. To fill this gap, this study aims to explore the linchpin potential of AIoT in seamlessly integrating these data-driven governance systems to advance environmental governance in smarter eco-cities. Specifically, it introduces a pioneering framework that effectively leverages the synergies among these AIoT-powered governance systems to enhance environmental sustainability practices in smarter eco-cities. In developing the framework, this study employs configurative and aggregative synthesis approaches through an extensive literature review and in-depth case study analysis of publications spanning from 2018 to 2023. The study identifies key factors driving the co-evolution of AI and IoT into AIoT and specifies technical components constituting the architecture of AIoT in smarter eco-cities. A comparative analysis reveals commonalities and differences among City Brain, SUM, and platform urbanism within the frameworks of AIoT and environmental governance. These data-driven systems collectively contribute to environmental governance in smarter eco-cities by leveraging real-time data analytics, predictive modeling, and stakeholder engagement. The proposed framework underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making, optimization of resource management, reduction of environmental impact, collaboration among stakeholders, engagement of citizens, and formulation of evidence-based policies. The findings unveils that the synergistic and collaborative integration of City Brain, SUM, and platform urbanism through AIoT presents promising opportunities and prospects for advancing environmental governance in smarter eco-cities. The framework not only charts a strategic trajectory for stimulating research endeavors but also holds significant potential for practical application and informed policymaking in the realm of environmental urban governance.

The labor allocation effect of smart cities plays an important role in promoting the transformation to high-quality development in China, but there is still a lack of empirical research testing this effect. Based on panel data of 151 cities at the prefecture level and above for the period 2006–2018, this paper uses a DID model to evaluate the impact of smart city pilot projects on labor misallocation. The results show that, first, smart cities can significantly reduce labor misallocation, and this finding holds under a series of robustness tests. Second, smart cities can reduce labor misallocation through the formation of industrial agglomeration and the upgrading of the industrial structure. Third, the effect of smart cities was more significant in central and eastern cities and large-scale cities than in western cities and small and medium-scale cities. Fourth, smart cities have a significant spatial spillover effect on the reduction of labor misallocation.}

Relying on theoretical guidance provided by Ostrom's (2005) ‘Institutional Analysis and Development’ (IAD) framework and González-Arellano's (2022) and Scott's (2008) formulation of ‘Institutional Construction of Futures of Cities’, we analyse a corpus of empirical data to suggest that SC has historical precedents in the way it is institutionalized. Further, to substantiate our findings, a structured literature review of empirical contributions (34 nos.) within the SCOPUS database is undertaken. In conceptual terms, the anticipatory praxis of Smart City Mission leverages the institutional structure of doing flagship programmes and a cultural-cognitive affirmation of neutrality in data-driven governance. The initiative blurs the political city as the action arenas of structuring SC initiatives at the local levels lack operational rules to construct desired outcomes. The paper argues for a need to make the action-to-outcome linkage legible and endow agency to participants to act and control the outcomes by framing collective choice rules. Strengthening action arenas at the city level emboldens the capacity to envision collaborative futures and bridge the gap between anticipation and experience.}

Moreover, these applications act as the building blocks of IoT-enabled smart cities. The high volume and high velocity of data generated by various smart city applications are sent to flexible and efficient cloud computing resources for processing. However, there is a high computation latency due to the presence of a remote cloud server. Edge computing, which brings the computation close to the data source is introduced to overcome this problem. In an IoT-enabled smart city environment, one of the main concerns is to consume the least amount of energy while executing tasks that satisfy the delay constraint. An efficient resource allocation at the edge is helpful to address this issue. In this paper, an energy and delay minimization problem in a smart city environment is formulated as a bi-objective edge resource allocation problem. First, we presented a three-layer network architecture for IoT-enabled smart cities. Then, we designed a learning automata-based edge resource allocation approach considering the three-layer network architecture to solve the said bi-objective minimization problem. Learning Automata (LA) is a reinforcement-based adaptive decision-maker that helps to find the best task and edge resource mapping. An extensive set of simulations is performed to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the LA-based approach in the IoT-enabled smart city environment.}

To delve deeper into this subject, we employed a mixed methods approach to classify 49 Chinese smart cities and subsequently developed a typology for Chinese smart cities in this study. Our methodology involved three steps. Initially, we devised a classification framework based on the input-throughput-output model and conducted content analysis to identify the characteristics of the 49 cities. Subsequently, we utilized a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering analysis to categorize these cases. Finally, we formulated a typology consisting of five types of Chinese smart cities: knowledge-technocratic smart cities, holistic smart cities, green smart cities, equipment-technocratic smart cities, and emerging smart cities. The findings reveal that different smart city types are characterized by distinct features and priorities in input, throughput, and output. The development of smart cities should comprehensively consider and respect the local urban contexts and the challenges they present.

In the context of smart city wastewater optimization, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that considers both surface water and groundwater dynamics. Existing methods often fall short in addressing groundwater-related concerns, with limitations in accounting for potential contamination and aquifer vulnerability. The proposed method integrates a nuanced understanding of groundwater aspects, providing a more robust and sustainable solution for urban water resource management. This research introduces a new approach that harnesses the power of Divide-And-Conquer (DAC) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) to optimize wastewater collection systems in smart cities. The DAC strategy divides the city into manageable zones, simplifying the optimization problem for parallel processing in large-scale urban environments. VNS fine-tunes wastewater collection networks within each zone by exploring diverse neighborhood solutions. The DAC and VNS offers several benefits, including improved efficiency in wastewater transport, reduced energy consumption, and minimized environmental impact. Zoning the urban landscape is a strategic approach to optimize wastewater collection in smart cities. It involves dividing the city into manageable zones based on specific criteria such as geographical features, population density, and infrastructure layout. Each zone is treated as an independent unit for focused analysis and optimization. The optimization process employs a scoring function that combines weighted criteria, yielding a composite score for each geographical location. Applying a threshold or clustering algorithm group's locations into zones, facilitating tailored wastewater management strategies. By optimizing collection routes and infrastructure design, this approach assists smart cities in achieving sustainability goals while efficiently managing wastewater. The study showcases the potential of DAC and VNS as a robust and adaptable solution for wastewater collection in smart cities, contributing to the development of greener, more resource-efficient urban areas.}

abstract = {In 2015 the beginning of the Indian Smart Cities’ mission was one of the significant steps taken by the Indian government to make the urban environment resilient to climate change impact and extreme weather events like drought, floods, heatwaves, etc. This study computes the urban drought risk for Indian smart cities before the beginning of the Indian smart cities mission. This study considers three decadal variability (1982–2013) in meteorological, hydrological, vegetation, and soil moisture parameters for inducing water scarcity and drought conditions in urban regions. Hazards associated with urban drought-inducing parameters variability, vulnerability, and exposure of Indian smart cities were used to compute the Urban drought risk. The research investigations revealed the maximum urban drought risk for Bangalore, Chennai, and Surat cities. Northwest, West Central, and South Peninsular urban regions have higher risk among all the urban regions of India. Indian smart cities mission can be used to make Indian cities resilient to urban drought risk and increase their sustainability. The present research aligned with several national and international agreements by providing an urban drought risk rank for Indian cities, making them less vulnerable to extreme weather events and improving their resilience to climate change.}

Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning are two enabling technologies for smart cities. IoT sensors are deployed for data collection from city environments and machine learning models are used for data processing, inference, and predictions aimed at controlling IoT actuators and providing information for users. Surveillance applications in smart cities often use cloud and edge servers for the data analytics of video streamed by IoT cameras. This approach might increase the system’s latency due to the communication delay and networking congestion in the links connecting IoT cameras to distant cloud servers. A promising approach to mitigate the latency in video analytics applications is to perform the video analytics locally at the IoT devices and IoT gateways by using lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) models. In this paper, we propose an architecture for implementing at IoT devices the data pipeline required for local video analytics in smart cities. Moreover, we instantiate the proposed framework to conduct an extensive performance evaluation of five CNN models on IoT devices, in a traffic surveillance smart city application. Obtained results show the feasibility of studied CNN models, in terms of frame processing rate and energy efficiency in the considered IoT devices.}

However, research that holistically considers diverse stakeholders in smart cities is scarce. This study utilizes data from four types of collaborators (academia, public sector, industry, and civil society actors) to identify key topics and suggest research areas for developing smart cities. We used latent Dirichlet allocation and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for topic extraction and analysis. The analysis reveals that sustainability and digital platform have received similar levels of interest from academia, industry, and government, whereas governance, resource, and green space are less frequently mentioned than technology-related topics. Hype cycle analysis, which considers public and media expectations, reveals that smart cities experienced rapid growth from 2015 to 2021, but the growth rate has slowed since 2022. This means that a breakthrough improvement in the current situation is required. Accordingly, we propose resolving the unbalanced distribution of topic interests among collaborators, especially in the areas of governance, environment, economy, and healthcare. We expect that our findings will help researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders in understanding which topics are underdeveloped in their fields and taking active measures for the future development of smart cities.}

Benchmarking and assessment of 21 smart cities reveals the existing participatory processes being “tokenistic” and a substantial deficit in democratic stakeholder participation mechanisms. A deeper assessment in Kochi and Nagpur exposes the existing barriers to citizen participation and reveals that the capacities of capable stakeholders and citizen groups can be channelised more effectively. This study promotes advancing the notion of ‘citizenship’ beyond the market to the commons. It suggests transforming urban governance into a more accountable and collaborative governance model with a stronger role and power to local government, residents, and democratic stakeholders.}

Using Chinese city data from 2005 to 2019, this study adopts a causal identification framework based on the multi-temporal difference-in-difference method to explore the impact of smart city construction on green innovation and the mechanism and joint industrial emission reduction effect between them. A positive and significant relationship with a weak inverted U-shaped trend was found between smart city construction and green innovation. Besides the direct channel, labor factor allocation, venture capital attractiveness, and market accessibility are essential indirect channels between the two concepts. Furthermore, the effects of smart city construction on green innovation varied depending on the marketization level, administrative rank, population size, and geographic location of the city. In addition, the interaction of the two constructs negatively affected industrial emissions, which helped optimize the environment. These findings suggest that smart city construction offers a digital dividend for developing green innovation and creating an efficient, sustainable environment.}

Researchers of stakeholder engagement have investigated various aspects of the engagement process from different theoretical perspectives, yet the complexity and dynamism of inclusion, especially at the societal level and in the context of smart city development, continue to inspire more research. Drawing from the intersection of open strategy (OS) and SE, we seek to enhance understanding of the open strategizing process by elucidating stakeholder inclusion practices in a smart city initiative, focusing on food systems in Da Nang, Vietnam. Our participatory action research draws on 114 semi-structured interviews and four stakeholder workshops to analyze the way stakeholder inclusion practices unfold in the strategic decision-making process of a smart city initiative. Our analysis reveals that stakeholder inclusion is complex and involves four interdependent practices at different stages of the strategizing process. These practices are trust formation, common language creation, role transformation, and expectation alignment. Together, they culminate in the creation of an interactive social space for the strategy-making process. The proposed analytical framework highlights the interdependencies among practices and their outcomes at different stages of the open strategizing process and could serve as a guideline in a context in which stakeholder inclusion at the planning phase is necessary to achieve systemic change.}

The results indicate that (1) SCP significantly improves urban GTFEE, a finding that remains valid after the instrumental variables approach and robustness tests. (2) In east-central cities, economically developed cities, medium-sized cities, and non-resource-based cities, SCP significantly affects GTFEE. (3) The SCP considerably raises the local GTFEE but also the GTFEE of the 900-kilometer radius around cities. (4) SCP can improve GTFEE by clean energy development, optimizing industrial structure, promoting green innovation, and resource allocation. In addition, energy saving, emission reduction, and production increase are also important impact channels. Finally, based on its findings, the study offers a reference for decision-making to support SCP development and urban energy efficiency improvement.}

Smart cities serve as temporary spatial fixes until new and better investments opportunities emerge. Drawing from a comprehensive range of publications on capitalism, this article analyzes smart city developments as typifier of 21st century capital accumulation where the financialization of various capitals is the overarching driver and ecological overshoot and socio-economic undershoot are the main negative consequences. It closely examines six spatial manifestations of the smart city – science parks and smart campuses; innovation districts; smart neighborhoods; city-wide and city-regional smart initiatives; urban platforms; and alternative smart city spaces – as receptacles for the conversion of various capitals. It also considers the influence of different national regimes and institutional contexts on smart city developments. This is used, in the final part, to open a discussion about opportunities to temper the excesses of 21st century capitalism.}

abstract = {Nepal is the least urbanized country in South Asia with approximately 28% of Nepalese living in urban areas, while it is also the fastest urbanizing country in with an annual urban population growth of 6%. Urban areas suffer from municipal physical and information infrastructure deficits and are at high risk from earthquakes, floods, fires, and landslides. Development and transformation into Smart Cities would be a new avenue in Nepali development trend. However, this is relatively new and is still in its early stages of development. The objective of this research is to assess the evolution, the emerging trends and future prospects of Smart City in Nepal. A literature review with qualitative method along with structured key informant interviews were conducted to obtain data. This study revealed that the concept of Smart Cities in Nepal is centered around the integration of technology and innovative solutions to address the challenges facing urban areas and improve the quality of life for citizens. The concept is driven by the rapid pace of urbanization, the increasing need for sustainable and resilient cities, and the growing recognition of the role that technology can play in addressing these challenges. Nepal has emphasized on sustainability, the integration of Smart City initiatives, and the use of smart technologies with the country's broader development goals. Smart City indicators have been developed to track the progress, yet they are not flexible. This study recommends that i) the indicators need to be kept flexible with adequate room for revision of resilience-related indicators, ii) appropriate focus should be given to interconnected components of Smart Cities and iii) development of a more transparent and accountable approach to Smart City thereby providing better opportunities to enhance quality of life and unlock economic growth potential.}

However, whether smart city practices lead to environmental, economic, and social sustainability outcomes is still not clear. This is due to a lack of thorough knowledge of how local governments have deployed the smart city notion, as well as a lack of holistic evaluation of sustainability outcomes achieved by smart cities. To fill in this gap, this research evaluates whether local implementation of smart cities is associated with sustainability outcomes at the city level. We studied 103 US cities by integrating a sustainability assessment conducted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and text mining of city official websites. Our analysis shows that more than 80% of the 103 cities have smart city statements on their websites. In addition, smart cities generally score higher on sustainability outcomes than non-smart cities. Furthermore, when controlling for population size and geographic region, smart city mentions are positively associated with economic sustainability outcomes. However, the relationship between smart city mentions and environmental and social sustainability is not statistically significant. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the prevalence of local governments’ deployment of smart cities, which is scarce at present, and gives novel insight into the relationship between the use of technologies and urban sustainability.}

Based on existing research, this study innovatively uses multivariate data to construct an evaluation index system for the construction level of smart cities, and then systematically evaluates the smart city construction efficiency of 37 cities from 2016 to 2021 using the Super-efficiency slack-based model considering undesired output and the Malmquist index. Finally, measures are proposed to promote the orderly and healthy development of smart cities by combining domestic and international experience in smart city construction and policy recommendations. Results show the following: (1) Overall, the imbalance in the efficiency of China’s smart city construction between regions has improved, but a gap remains in the central and western regions in comparison with the east. (2) The improvement in smart city construction efficiency correlates with regional economic development, showing a gradual decrease from east to west.

First, a pioneering data architecture design leveraging CycleGAN is proposed to counteract False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA). By cyclically transforming data distributions, CycleGAN ensures the integrity and reliability of smart city information, fortifying against malicious manipulations. Second, an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) concept is introduced, aiming to enhance real-time monitoring and context-aware threat detection within Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Harnessing the wealth of data generated by IoT devices, this concept provides a comprehensive understanding of network activities, fostering adaptive responses to emerging threats. Lastly, the research delves into the development of a novel IDS hyperparameter adjusting system. This system integrates the strengths of Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to fine-tune IDS configuration parameters. Drawing inspiration from biogeographical principles and collaborative whale behavior, the hybrid optimization system balances exploration and exploitation, adapting the IDS to diverse network environments. Together, these initiatives represent a holistic approach to fortifying smart cities through cutting-edge data architecture, IoT-driven threat detection, and optimized IDS configurations, contributing to the resilience and cybersecurity of modern urban landscapes.}

This study aims to investigate the challenges of rapid urban population growth and explore how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can be utilized to foster the development of smart cities. Specifically, it seeks to understand how the integration of ICT can contribute to enhancing urban resilience, promoting urban sustainability, and improving citizens' quality of life. The study relied on a literature review, appraisals of fifteen (15) different Smart City software applications and their characteristics (spanning various domains, including data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), urban mobility, energy management, and citizen engagement platforms, all related to sustainability and resilience), and thirty (30) case studies cutting across sustainability and resilience. Furthermore, thematic analysis from the case studies was used to evaluate the benefits of smart city applications mapped to the six (6) action areas of Smart City. Based on the findings from case studies and smart city software analysis, rapid urbanisation presents multifaceted challenges like traffic congestion, disaster management, environmental degradation, community engagement, economic disparities, and so on. However, adopting Smart City software applications and aligning with various domains, including data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), urban mobility, energy management, and citizen engagement platforms, play pivotal roles in addressing these challenges. Further findings reveal that the benefits of smart city software align with the action areas of smart cities, including Governance, Mobility, Economy, Environment, Living, and People. The research offers practical application of smart city software for Urban designs and planners. It highlights the influence of contextual factors across countries on Smart City effectiveness.

As a result of a systematic literature review, this study develops a theoretical framework that describes five stages of smart city transformation as a generic developmental and iterative process with feedback. These stages are (1) smart city goal definition, (2) smart city technology innovation, (3) smart city strategy development, (4) smart city plan implementation, and (5) smart city plan evaluation. Different developments and outcomes of these five stages result in four alternative scenarios for smart city development: (a) spiralling up, (b) downward repetition, (c) corrective feedback, and (d) upward feedback. Academics can use the insights in the five developmental processes and four core scenarios as a general framework to interpret, position, and analyse specific smart city projects and processes. Practitioners can use the insights into these developmental processes and core scenarios to inform their management, steering and governance activities in the smart city processes in which they participate.}

However, mobility data usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization, such as mix-zones, have been proposed to address the privacy of users’ identity. Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city development: what are the smart cities applications and services that can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this question, we propose the Utility Analysis Framework of Anonymized Trajectories for Smart Cities-Application Domains (UAFAT). This characterization framework measures the utility through twelve metrics related to privacy, mobility, and social, including mix-zones performance metrics from anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones. This framework aims to identify applications and services where the anonymized data will provide more or less utility in various aspects. The results evaluated with cabs and privacy cars datasets showed that further characterizing it by distortion level, UAFAT ranked the smart cities application domains that best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones. Also, it identified which one of the four case studies of smart city applications had more utility. Additionally, different datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private data markets for smart cities.}

While such applications provide enormous benefits in improving transportation systems operation and environmental sustainability, they also introduce new risks to smart cities. These systems provide wider access to adversaries and increase the attack surface to compromise the operation of smart cities. This study develops a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) based cooperative driving automation platform to understand and analyze the cyber risks in these systems from a V2I perspective in a representative traffic environment. Three cyberattacks (Fake BSMs, replay and denial of service) were emulated as a cooperative game to assess the impact on volatility, energy efficiency and traffic flow stability. The critical nature of cooperative driving automation is revealed by this research and flow stability, and energy efficiency of cooperative driving automation are severely impacted by the three categories of cyberattacks. Further, a 35 %-40 % increase in volatility in acceleration-deceleration regimes along with 20 % increase in emission is observed as opposed to the baseline case with no cyberattacks. The proposed long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM) showed an average detection accuracy of around 98 % for the analyzed cyberattacks. The research findings would foster the development of algorithms to continuously monitor the state of cooperative automated driving environment for anomalous behavior and promote resilient and environmentally sustainable cities in the future.}

The proposed model is represented as a standard Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem. The proposed HEMS provides the optimal scheduling of home appliances and plugging time for charging Electric Vehicles (EV) at home. The main objective of this optimization problem is to minimize the electricity bills while improving the load profile of the distribution system in the context of smart cities. In this study, load management for a typical household has been studied considering several electricity tariffs in Portugal. The simulation results confirm that in the presence of the proposed HEMS, the electricity bill will be effectively reduced while consumer behavior is changed. The cost savings that can be attained through only shifting loads is 5.7 %, while it can reach 67.65 % by installing a hybrid energy system at the studied smart home. The weekly cost reduction percentage due to charging the EV at home is around 16.24 % compared to charging the EV using public charging stations regardless of the traveling time and waiting at the public charging stations.}

abstract = {The integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies as a means to promote sustainability is investigated in this study using a descriptive-analytical literature review. The study identifies key elements associated with the incorporation of green spaces and smart technologies within smart cities. The findings show that green spaces can promote environmental sustainability in smart cities when utilized as renewable energy sources, natural filters, and public spaces. However, effectively managing green spaces requires the implementation of smart technologies such as sensors to monitor and analyze data on factors such as air pollution, temperature, and irrigation levels. The study evaluates the challenges of green space data analysis such as cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise, and reveals that Western and Eastern cities take different approaches to green space data analysis, focusing on environmental/social and urban planning benefits respectively. The importance of technologies and policies aimed at addressing environmental issues in disadvantaged communities, including air pollution, is emphasized. Effective strategies such as the deployment of air quality sensors, green infrastructure, and transit-oriented development can improve air quality and health, though success depends on policy design, resources, and infrastructure. Furthermore, the study explores the potential of advanced technologies and strategies to manage sustainable energy resources in smart cities, including smart grids, renewable energy, and energy-efficient buildings. The study also discusses the potential of smart technologies such as precision irrigation, smart metering, and waste management initiatives to reduce water usage and waste.

abstract = {The transportation environment of smart cities is complex and ever-changing, and traffic flow is influenced by various factors. With the increase of traffic flow in smart cities, optimizing traffic intersection signal control has become an important method to improve traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. To this end, a smart city traffic intersection(SCTI) signal control optimization method based on adaptive artificial fish swarm algorithm was studied. Establish the Equation of state of traffic flow at SCTIs to understand the actual traffic flow at SCTIs. On this basis, design SCTI signal control parameters, with the minimum average delay and average number of stops as objective functions, and construct an optimization model for SCTI signal control. By combining chaotic search theory and adaptively improving the artificial fish swarm algorithm, based on the adaptive artificial fish swarm algorithm, the intelligent city traffic intersection signal control optimization model is solved to achieve intelligent city traffic intersection signal control optimization. The experimental results show that the average delay of this method is 7.8 ms, the average number of stops is 2, and the travel time is 68.4 s s. Thus, it is proved that the method in this paper has a good optimization effect of traffic signal control at smart city intersections, which can improve the optimization efficiency of traffic signal control at smart city intersections and reduce traffic congestion at smart city intersections.}

To deal with the ethical implications of smart cities, the Netherlands face a proliferation of ethical guidelines, principles, and manifests. However: To what extent are Dutch citizens' interests protected by ethical guidelines? This study answers that question using a critical discourse analysis. This exploratory analysis uncovers unnoticed themes in the ethical discourse on smart cities and offers recommendations to strengthen the protection of citizens. Together, the ethical guidelines that are selected represent at least five major cities in the Netherlands. This study finds that the ethical guidelines support the Smart City discourse in which: data is seen as a promise for the future, citizens' interests are not central and public-private governance is pre-supposed in the digital public space. Indeed, the ethical guidelines overlook how Big Data analytics transforms ways of governing, which is described as ‘algorithmic governmentality’. Therefore, if guidelines want to commit to the protection of citizens' interests, this study encourages them to review their guidelines in a Big Data context. However, as ultimately only laws and regulations can ensure the protection of citizens' interests and rights, future research is encouraged to look into the restructuring of the legal system.}

The results show that the efficiency value of green energy fluctuates in Chinese cities. Different test results show that smart city policies can effectively improve urban green energy efficiency, but mainly from the time effect rather than the individual effect. It means the improvement in urban green energy efficiency comes more from the fast-growing of the Chinese economy and urban construction in this period than from the country's smart city pilot policy. In addition, from the spatial spillover effect result, China needs to design a better urban spatial development plan to improve the capacity of smart city energy services and vigorously develop intelligent technology represented by information and communication science.}

As a result of combining the dual algorithms with system model it is possible to establish a secured state for each data with proper response factor. The major significance of proposed method is to introduce node point where all increasing queues in smart cities are controlled due to the information that is achieved from every data points. Moreover the improvement in projected model can be observed with four scenarios where security at every data point plays an important role at an increased level of 84%. In addition to security the amount of stable points is increased with reduction in disparities for about 2% thereby every applications in smart cities are monitored in a precise way.}

These advancements are reshaping data-driven planning strategies, practices, and approaches, thereby facilitating the achievement of environmental sustainability goals. This transformative wave signals a fundamental shift — marked by the synergistic operation of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), and urban digital twin (UDT) technologies. While previous research has largely explored urban AI, urban AIoT, and UDT in isolation, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding their synergistic interplay, collaborative integration, and collective impact on data-driven environmental planning in the dynamic context of sustainable smart cities. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive systematic review to uncover the intricate interactions among these interconnected technologies, models, and domains while elucidating the nuanced dynamics and untapped synergies in the complex ecosystem of sustainable smart cities. Central to this study are four guiding research questions: 1. What theoretical and practical foundations underpin the convergence of AI, AIoT, UDT, data-driven planning, and environmental sustainability in sustainable smart cities, and how can these components be synthesized into a novel comprehensive framework? 2. How does integrating AI and AIoT reshape the landscape of data-driven planning to improve the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities? 3. How can AI and AIoT augment the capabilities of UDT to enhance data-driven environmental planning processes in sustainable smart cities? 4. What challenges and barriers arise in integrating and implementing AI, AIoT, and UDT in data-driven environmental urban planning, and what strategies can be devised to surmount or mitigate them? Methodologically, this study involves a rigorous analysis and synthesis of studies published between January 2019 and December 2023, comprising an extensive body of literature totaling 185 studies. The findings of this study surpass mere interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment, offering valuable insights into the transformative potential of integrating AI, AIoT, and UDT technologies to advance sustainable urban development practices. By enhancing data-driven environmental planning processes, these integrated technologies and models offer innovative solutions to address complex environmental challenges. However, this endeavor is fraught with formidable challenges and complexities that require careful navigation and mitigation to achieve desired outcomes. This study serves as a comprehensive reference guide, spurring groundbreaking research endeavors, stimulating practical implementations, informing strategic initiatives, and shaping policy formulations in sustainable urban development. These insights have profound implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing a roadmap for fostering resiliently designed, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious urban environments.}

Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model.

The current traditional methods for identifying accounting fraud rely on manual review and judgment, lacking objectivity and accuracy. In order to improve the accuracy of accounting fraud identification, improve identification efficiency and objectivity, this article combines smart city information technology to conduct in-depth research on data mining algorithms for accounting fraud identification. This article first provides a brief overview of smart cities and information technology, then introduces the basic theory of accounting fraud identification, and finally implements accounting fraud identification through k-means clustering mining algorithm. The data is divided into k clusters, and abnormal clusters are identified by checking the characteristics and attributes of each cluster. Compared with traditional rule-based and pattern based methods, this approach can more flexibly adapt to different types and forms of fraud, and can discover unknown patterns of fraud. In the experiment, this article used electronic data collection, analysis, and retrieval systems on the websites of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange to collect 641 annual reports and financial characteristics from 62 listed companies that engaged in financial statement fraud and 84 companies that were not reported to have financial statement fraud from 2012 to 2021 as test samples. The results were tested and analyzed from several aspects, including the number of misjudgments, misjudgment rate, and ROC curve. The final test results show that compared to traditional accounting fraud identification methods, the comprehensive misjudgment rate of data mining algorithms based on smart cities has decreased by 3 %. The conclusion indicates that data mining algorithms used in smart city information technology to identify accounting fraud can help improve the accuracy of accounting fraud, improve audit objectivity and effectiveness.}

The prominence of smart cities in power systems has grown recently, offering comprehensive monitoring and accessibility. However, this advancement also brings about increased susceptibility to cyber-attacks. To address this concern, we present an integrated smart city encompassing the smart grid (SG), transportation comprising subway and vehicles, microgrid (MG), and energy hub (EH). Within this proposed model, we employ an enhanced intrusion detection system (IDS) utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) through deep learning to fortify the safety of information transactions inside the smart city. This involves incorporating a security layer into the smart city design, effectively thwarting cyber hackers' attempts to access system information. This paper develops an efficient energy management schedule. To achieve this, we introduce a novel optimization method deploying the honey bee mating optimization technique for the optimum allocation of charging stations. The grid randomness is addressed using the point estimate method (PEM) with a 2 m-scheme. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework are proved, showcasing its ability to enhance the security and efficiency of smart city operations. This research advocates for the application of a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin to explore optimal energy management within a Smart City while ensuring a safe and secure framework. The proposed methodology involves the creation of a comprehensive digital replica incorporating real-time data, cybersecurity measures, optimization algorithms, and machine learning. This digital twin serves as a dynamic simulation environment, enabling stakeholders to analyze, simulate, and refine energy management strategies in a risk-free setting. The study emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement, iterative testing, and adaptability to real-world data for ensuring the relevance and effectiveness of the digital twin in guiding Smart Cities toward efficient, secure, and resilient energy management.}

First, through a semi-systematic review of eighty articles on quantum computing within the social science domain, we identify two relevant classes of urban quantum technologies: quantum communication and quantum computing. Second, we establish a comprehensive taxonomy of conventional smart city solutions based on the automated content analysis of 567 abstracts of articles on the technological aspects of smart cities. Third, we investigate potential associations between two classes of technologies (conventional smart city solutions and urban quantum technologies) by analyzing the semantic relationships between eighty articles on quantum technologies according to the frequency of keywords denoting different types of conventional smart city solutions. Finally, we triangulate our findings through a thematic analysis of potential uses of quantum technologies within identified categories of smart city solutions.}

Citizens populate the smart city and are the ones who are supposed to use the services provided by the government. In this article we explore and analyze digital and analogue services in smart homes developed in a new city district. We have conducted observational studies in 53 apartments during an urban living expo which we analyze by applying a set of socio-technical design principles. The research question that guides the analysis is: “What tensions between values in digital and analogue services for a smart living can be revealed by a socio-technical perspective?”. We identify five tensions between: 1) being in control and being controlled, 2) intended and undesirable use of personal data, 3) digital and analogue smartness, 4) smart home visions and practices, and 5) environmental and social sustainability. By revealing these tensions, we contribute to an understanding of the complexity of smart living. We also contribute by highlighting the importance of applying a perspective that captures both technology and citizen and user issues (i.e., social aspects) when developing services in the smart home context.}

However, the existing evaluation research on smart cities is still limited to a single objective or subjective perspective, and the CSG level that can reflect the sustainability of smart cities is not clear. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive method for evaluating CSG in smart cities. The proposed method combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy weight method (EWM) and ideal solution similarity ranking preference method (TOPSIS) to evaluate the CSG in 19 pilot smart cities in China. The empirical findings explore the CSG level in China’s pilot smart cities, revealing that Shanghai, Beijing, and Nanjing exhibit the highest level of CSG, and a significant correlation is observed between smartness and CSG. The CSG also show variety in different smart cities (i.e. urbanization rate and region) and among heterogeneous citizens (i.e. age, education background, and cognition of smart city). At the same time, this study provides support for each pilot city’s CSG enhancement strategy. In general, this study addresses the existing gap in evaluating CSG in smart cities, and provides valuable implications for policymakers to ensure the sustainability of smart cities in China.}

abstract = {Despite the wealth of research on smart cities, there is a lack of studies examining interlinkages between smart cities and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.}

This study aimed to find starting points for such integration by unraveling the ‘guiding visions’ of corporate technological innovators in the smart mobility and transport sector around Amsterdam. We conducted and analyzed interviews with innovators from 12 smart city start-ups and scale-ups based on three elements of guiding visions: (1) the desired future city, (2) the purposes of technologies they expect to fulfill, and (3) how technologies are thought to relate to their wider societal context. The interviewed innovators appeared to envision a clean, frictionless future city, whereby smart city technologies fulfilled four purposes: catalyzing efficiency, nudging citizens, customizing user experiences, and connecting places and people. Innovators’ ambitions for societal participation were modest and mainly aimed at end-users to optimize design features. Overall, the innovators’ guiding visions highlight the need for participatory futuring approaches that appeal to innovators’ motivation to make a social contribution, but also help them to widen and deepen their understanding of the public values that citizens perceive to be at stake in the smart city.}

This research looked at what influences people's decisions to utilize or embrace smart city services in on Asian country. It extended the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model by adding trust in technology, trust in government, perceived security concern and perceived privacy concern. Using a simple random sampling technique, data were collected from 470 participants across three major cities in one Asian country. The biggest predictor of the desire to use smart city services, according to our research, is the facilitating condition. Other elements include social influence, hedonic drive, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and trust in the government. The inclination to use smart city services was shown to be inversely correlated with privacy and security concerns. Trust in smart city services had nothing to do with its usage intention. Finally, gender and age did not act as moderators of the hypothesized relationships in our model. This outcome established strong theoretical and practical implications as discussed in this article.}

The estimated results explore that China's smart city pilot policies (SCPP) encourage green innovation at the firm level, a finding that still holds after a sequence of robustness tests. Furthermore, the empirical evidence indicates that the influence of green innovations on the SCPP was more important for firms in non-state-owned enterprises, heavily polluting industries and non-resource-based cities relative to state-owned firms, firms in lightly-polluting industries and firms in non-resource-based cities. In addition, this study finds that the smart city pilot policy can provide a new incentive for the green innovation behaviour of enterprises via policy and agglomeration effects. Overall, the estimated findings suggest that the government should continue to play a positive role in constructing smart cities for enterprises' green innovation and implement smart city construction programmes following local conditions to help China's high-quality economic development.}

The studied smart city includes the microgrid, smart transportation system (STS), energy hub (EH) and smart grid. In this regard, a subway synergism hub (SSH) as a new non-energy system is added to the smart city with the aim of serving the subway's water, heat, electrical and cooling demands as well as diminishing the operation cost of the smart city. The EH within the SSH cooperated with a desalination unit is considered to supply the subway's stations water demand by using the sea water. The investigation of the optimal allocation of the SSH unit for reducing the cost of smart city operation is also conducted by introducing a novel intelligent priority selection (IPS) analytical algorithm. In comparison to common meta-heuristic algorithms for allocation problems, the accurate optimal solution can be found in low runtime by the IPS algorithm. To achieve an accurate model of the smart city, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based blockchain approach is provided which can enhance the data and energy exchanges security within the smart city. This research paper introduces a security framework deployed in a smart city setting to establish a secure platform for energy transactions. The findings validate the effectiveness of this model and highlight the value of the IPS method. The effectiveness of the suggested approach has been assessed using the smart city system is comprised of various sections, including EVs, smart grid, microgrid, and SSH, demonstrating the credibility and accuracy of this study.}

In this work, four active smart switchable glazings have been studied (electrochromic, suspended particle device, liquid crystal and gasochromic) based on their operating principle, glazing factors and energetic application. It is evident that EC has more material aspect investigation and overall energetic application for PLDC, SPD and EC needs more study.

A smart grid achieves such aforementioned power supply by ensuring resilient energy delivery, which presents opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of power supply and minimize environmental impacts. A systematic evaluation of the comprehensive benefits brought by smart grid to smart cities can provide necessary theoretical fundamentals for urban planning and construction towards a sustainable energy future. However, most of the present methods of assessing smart cities do not fully take into account the benefits expected from the smart grid. To comprehensively evaluate the development levels of smart cities while revealing the supporting roles of smart grids, this article proposes a model of smart city development needs from the perspective of residents’ needs based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory, which serves the primary purpose of building a smart city. By classifying and reintegrating the needs, an evaluation index system of smart grids supporting smart cities was further constructed. A case analysis concluded that smart grids, as an essential foundation and objective requirement for smart cities, are important in promoting scientific urban management, intelligent infrastructure, refined public services, efficient energy utilization, and industrial development and modernization. Further optimization suggestions were given to the city analyzed in the case include strengthening urban management and infrastructure constructions, such as electric vehicle charging facilities and wireless coverage.}

In this context, the notion of localizing the SDGs is highlighted as essential. Simultaneously, the smart city concept is promoted to address local sustainability challenges, and smart city strategies are used to support urban sustainability transitions. Despite the extensive literature on smart city transitions, no work was found that studies how such strategies may concretely support the localization of the SDGs. In response, we analyze 57 smart city strategies across 29 countries using the SDG framework to pinpoint which SDGs and accompanying Targets are localized through smart city initiatives. The results indicate that strategies strongly support the localization of four Goals (SDGs 7, 8, 9, and 11) along with several individual Targets. While the SDGs treated by the strategies depend on the local context, smart city strategy documents promote sustainable development initiatives across a spectrum of themes. However, for cities that use smart city strategies to encourage a fundamental shift towards a more sustainable urban model, careful attention must be paid to include initiatives on often untreated topics (SDGs 2, 5, and 15).}

Sustainable energy systems in smart cities are systems can be evaluated by using multiple criteria decision making methods or methodologies based on several vague/imprecise evaluation criteria. In this paper, sustainable energy systems in smart cities are evaluated by interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets with an integrated optimization based multi-expert fuzzy Best Worst Method (BWM) and TOPSIS methodology that can better handle uncertainty and vagueness in experts’ linguistic assessments than existing methodologies. The considered criteria are weighted by multi-expert IVPF Best Worst Method, which has become a popular weighting method in recent years. Later, the energy alternatives for a real case study are prioritized by multi-expert IVPF TOPSIS method. In the analysis, the most important criterion is found as Environmental sustainability (C1) with the defuzzified weight of 0.218 while the other weights are as initial investment (C2) with 0.196, operating expenses (C3) with 0.163, technical feasibility (C4) with 0.154, social acceptability (C5) with 0.140, and scalability (C6) with 0.129. The obtained results indicate that “Investing in advanced technologies” in a smart city with relative degree of closeness (RDC) value of 0.798, has been determined as the best alternative among the considered five alternatives. It is closely followed by “Developing a transportation system” with the RDC value of 0.681. Sensitivity analysis shows that the ranking results are quite robust and reliable. The comparative analysis with crisp BWM and TOPSIS methodology is applied to check the validity of the proposed methodology.}
