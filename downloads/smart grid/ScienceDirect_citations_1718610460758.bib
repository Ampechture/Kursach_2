abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative integrated policy secure framework employing blockchain technology to effectively handle optimal structure switching within microgrids. The primary objectives are to enhance electric work for cost reduction and power quality enhancement. The structure utilizes remote switches to adjust the microgrid's power supply route to consumers, minimizing resistive power losses. Additionally, it integrates the mobile storage capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance microgrid operations. The aging costs of battery for EVs are modeled using Wöhler curve. An effective modification technique using Dolphin Echolocation is established to enhance algorithm assortment and prevent premature convergence. The study employs a standard test system to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Simulation results demonstrate that the secure architecture facilitates improved microgrid scheduling through encrypted data packets, optimizing EV charge and discharge. The Energy System Digital Twin (ESDT) plays a crucial role in investigating this stochastic secure energy management architecture for microgrids, incorporating EVs and blockchain. The ESDT dynamically replicates microgrid complexities, integrating stochastic models for renewable energy, EV charging behaviors, and blockchain transactions. This digital twin enables simulations for optimizing EV integration, evaluating blockchain resilience, and strengthening cybersecurity measures. This comprehensive approach within the digital twin framework provides a platform for refinement and innovation, ensuring the development of sustainable, efficient, and secure microgrid ecosystems adaptable to the evolving landscape of renewable energy, EV adoption, and blockchain technology, as well as considering policy in decision making.}

abstract = {Smart Cities contains millions of IoT sensors supporting critical applications such as Smart Transport, Buildings, Intelligent Vehicles, and Logistics. A central administrator appointed by the government manages and maintains the security of each node. Smart City relies upon millions of sensors that are heterogeneous and do not support standard security architecture. Different manufacturers have weak protection protocols for their products and do not update their firmware upon newly identified operating systems’ vulnerabilities. Adversaries using brute force methods exploit the lack of inbuilt security systems on IoT devices to grow their bot network. Smart cities require a standard framework combining soft computing and Deep Learning (DL) for device fleet management and complete control of sensor operating systems for absolute security. This paper presents a real-world application for IoT fleet management security using a lightweight container-based botnet detection (C-BotDet) framework. Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server. The framework quickly updates the standard Linux-based operating system IoT device fleet without relying on different manufacturers to update their system security individually. The simulation and analysis of the C-BotDet framework are presented in a practical working environment to demonstrate its implementation feasibility.}

The security nature of blockchain has more potential to improve the big data applications and services. The advancement of blockchain technology creates more opportunities for the development of smart cities. Blockchain plays the role to acquire, store, analyze, and preserve the privacy of the data. Building a big data platform for smart cities using blockchain and other emerging technologies can implement a point-to-point communication system, smart IoT, and government operations. This can also result in a more trustworthy trust agreement over time. Breaking down information islands and achieving the goals of sharing of data and information security using the blockchain and platform of big data creates a new kind of smart city. Cities which are making their move toward smart cities must take this important secure platform into consideration. To comprehend the issues that arise in the process of developing a smart city on a big data platform, it is imperative that the study and analysis of blockchain technology be strengthened in this connection. This article explores the benefits and related tactics of a blockchain-based big data platforms for smart cities.}

abstract = {Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for monitoring and remote control. Sensor networks are being integrated into all areas of the infrastructures of smart cities. The sensor network data stream contains information that can be utilized to model and control the activity of these infrastructures. However, SCADA systems are constantly exposed to a variety of diverse intrusions, making detection with traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) extremely difficult. Due to their unique specifications, conventional security solutions, like antivirus and firewall software, are unsuitable for properly securing SCADA systems. In addition, anomaly detection in industrial sensor networks (ISNs) should occur in real time. Therefore, effectively identifying cyberattacks in major SCADA systems is unquestionably essential for enhancing their resilience, ensuring safe operations, and avoiding expensive maintenance. We developed a novel hybrid ensemble model approach to address these issues. This paper's primary objective is to detect hostile intrusions that have already circumvented firewalls and typical IDS. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Ensemble Learning Model (ELM) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems with ISNs utilizing a tangible data gathered from a gas pipeline system given by Mississippi State University (MSU), the water system, and the high-dimensional University of New South Wales-NB 2015 (UNSW-NB15) data that reflects a typical attack in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The unity normalization method was adopted for data preprocessing, and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized for feature extraction of the high-dimensional datasets. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) was used for optimizing the bagging, stacking, Adaboost, and an ensemble of classifiers Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with a majority voting technique. Then, we utilized the proposed approach founded on the bijective soft-set approach for efficient ELM selection. The experiment was conducted in two phases: Initially, without PCA + GWO for feature extraction and selection on the ELM, and subsequently, with PCA + GWO for feature extraction and selection on the ELM. PCA + GWO on the ensemble of classifiers NB + SVM provided an accuracy of 99%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and detection rate of 99.90%, outpacing the ensemble of classifiers without PCA feature extraction and GWO optimization approaches.}

The aim of this article is to show the possibilities and directions of application of ICT tools based on abstract spaces and to present the current state of their application. The article shows which elements of GIS technology can be used in tools based on abstract spaces and what differentiates the discussed types of spaces. The approach to the proposed tools was made from three points of view. First - the types of abstract spaces were presented. Second - the areas of their application were indicated along with the application of higher information functions (such as spatial data collection for abstract spaces, their single- and multi-area visualisation, environmental analysis and assessment, planning, inspiration and support of decision-making processes presented in abstract spaces). And thirdly, they were framed from the point of view of modern technologies such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality) or hyperlinks. The reflections were concluded with an analysis of the current state of application of the technology in question in Polish public administration offices. The results of the surveys show that the proposed solutions are not currently used in city halls and are at the conceptual stage. The topic of AI is well known among the respondents. This is probably due to the popularity of the concept in popular science publications. Respondents show much less interest in the area of abstract spaces. Furthermore, they are of the opinion that their GIS solutions do not support this type of space, or if they do, they have no idea how to use it.}

The paper maps, evaluates and analyses the strategic actions of the Greek Municipalities from an internal and external perspective of a public authority. Results show most local authorities try to formulate a coherent framework to efficiently utilize available resources and enhance productivity and quality of the services provided. Even though the majority of cities have embedded in their digital strategies various forms of smart projects, a rather partial implementation of relevant initiatives in their day-to-day operations is noticed. The challenges and prerequisites for an effective implementation of smart strategies have been explored. Furthermore, we assess their design, which may mitigate risks and lead to higher returns, at the earliest possible stage. This allows us to map the crucial factors that may open their “appetite” for a successful strategy towards a smarter future.}

However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems.}

abstract = {Smart cities are rapidly becoming the main form of urban development initiated in response to calls to address certain ills such as unsustainable cities. Often presented as rational responses to such challenges, there are affective dimensions which are political and impact their development in various places. We investigate these affective dimensions by using the concept of atmospheres -collective affects arising from encounters between places, actors, materialities and (hi)stories. Our work builds on the premise that acceptance of smart city initiatives relies on their supporter’s ability to disseminate compelling stories about smart urban futures. Atmospheres matter here because the stories that can be credibly told are not arbitrary – to be believed, urban stories must be embedded in and coupled to the materialities and affects of their environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the deliberate cultivation of atmospheres by actors with urban remits, revealing how such atmospheres can become impactful mechanisms for selectively rendering cities amenable or refractory to different stories about smart urban futures. An in-depth case study of the English new town of Milton Keynes is presented to illustrate how atmospheres have been cultivated to selectively resist or reinforce the stories through which the smart city agenda is advanced. Narratives about rationality and data-driven efficiency were translated into specific versions of the future. The resulting encounters gave rise to atmospheres of reception, anticipation, innovation and progress through which urban spaces were rendered selectively receptive to specific forms of smart development in pursuit of local, contextually defined goals.}

To fully exploit the advantages of photovoltaic power generation and electric vehicles and to release the potential of electric vehicles as distributed energy storage facilities, this paper develops a multi-objective robust optimization framework that accounts for the benefits of multiple parties of smart charging and discharging systems and depicts a bounded uncertainty set based on partial statistical information from real data. The original model is scalarized and linearized using efficient methods such as max-ordering scalarization and the robust augmented weighted Tchebycheff to facilitate the solution. Moreover, a smart charging and discharging scheduling strategy based on a convergent demand response strategy is proposed to achieve better demand-side management. A case study, based on real data from Car2go and the solar radiation intensity in Portland, Oregon, shows that (1) The methodological framework effectively addresses the smart scheduling issue that considers the interests of multiple parties in complex systems with uncertainty, in contrast to conventional methods. (2) The designed convergent demand response strategy promotes photovoltaic power generation and charging demand synergy and achieves regulation effects such as peak shaving and valley filling. (3) The proposed method and strategy yield good results in multiple aspects, such as charging costs, load regulation, and clean energy utilization, while enhancing the economic and environmental benefits.}

Interpretations of Horkheimer and Adorno, Žižek and Lacan serve as background for the research, which are introduced to enrich an existing (mainly Foucauldian) set of smart city critique. Inspired by critical theory, this analysis shows that ideology is reproduced by culture industry and indicates tendencies to implement instrumental reason, to harmonize the existing social and economic contradictions and mainly reproduces economic interests. Since the researched rhetors are as politicians in power to materialize their ideological convictions, the mystification of technology plays a crucial role as disciplining and controlling measure, which aims to stabilize and justify status quo and maintain the existing inequalities.

Specifically, we investigated Taiwanese citizens’ preferences for 35 SC services of seven dimensions classified in two domains, as well as their three perceptions of the usefulness of these SC services in the realization of human needs. The results show that most of our respondents clearly perceived SC services as both important and useful to their existence, relatedness, and growth needs, and that they expressed relatively higher preferences for such services to operate in the “hard” domain – e.g., smart energy, smart transport, or smart safety –than the “soft” one, e.g., smart living. Based on these findings, this study provides policy recommendations that, if implemented, could be expected to advance SC development by increasing citizens’ usage of SC services in both the hard and soft domains, and serve the wider aim of improving their well-being and quality of life.}

Therefore, this study investigates how firms can develop dynamic capabilities to orchestrate ecosystem innovation and, thus, gain from it. Through a multiple case study of smart city initiatives, we offer insights into the specific micro-foundations or sub-routines underlying the ecosystem leader's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities, which are necessary to orchestrate ecosystem innovation. We develop a capability-based framework demonstrating three orchestration mechanisms – namely, configuring ecosystem partnerships, value proposition deployment, and governing ecosystem alignment. Our findings carry implications for the literature on innovation ecosystems and dynamic capabilities, as well as for managers.}

The increasing availability of such LocBigData has created unprecedented opportunities for research on urban systems and human environments in general. In this article, we first review the common types of LocBigData: mobile phone network data, GPS data, Location-based social media data, LBS usage/log data, smart card travel data, beacon log data (WiFi or Bluetooth), and camera imagery data. Secondly, we describe the opportunities fueled by LocBigData for the realization of smart cities, mainly via answering questions ranging from “what happened” and “why did it happen” to “what's likely to happen in the future” and “what to do next”. Thirdly, pitfalls of dealing with LocBigData are summarized, such as high volume/velocity/variety; non-random sampling; messy and not clean data; and correlations rather than causal relationships. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art research trends in this field, and conclude the article with a list of open research challenges and a research agenda for LocBigData research to help achieve the vision of smart and sustainable cities.}

Control systems based on network models of local positioning partially solves the problem of a safety motion. The paper emphasizes three main categories of UV software systems providing correspondingly, collection and processing data, planning, and control, as well as an approach to the architecture of decision making for UV, based on networking and computational multilevel analytics.

The novel framework includes a technical analysis, an economic evaluation, and a public survey. Following the technical analysis, 21 streetlight units in a staggered pole arrangement are recommended to optimize illuminance levels for the minor arterial road as commonly found in cities like Laramie. Two energy source options are considered – a grid-only option and a hybrid option that utilizes solar power for lighting and grid electricity for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The economic and social aspects of this study reveal the need for public-private partnerships to fund smart street lighting projects in small cities. From a benefit-cost analysis standpoint, the grid-only option is currently more economically feasible; however, most residents prefer the hybrid system. Additional capabilities like EV charging, air quality monitoring, and weather sensing provide unique economic and social benefits for both residents and city authorities. This work provides a veritable framework that both private and public stakeholders can adopt for future implementation of smart street lighting projects in contemporary low-population towns and cities.}

The second area concerned the study of this phenomenon in the case of companies from the logistics industry. The diagnosis of the prevalence of remote work among Polish enterprises and the analysis of the survey results showed that during the pandemic, solutions typical of the Smart City concept, working from home or working remotely have become a reality for many organizations. Remote work has become, in the case of many organizations, the basic form of work. However, the necessary legal and organizational solutions in this area do not keep up with the speed and universality of re-mote work implementation.

However, occupants’ demand for “comfort” and “convenience” may contradict the purpose of minimizing the carbon footprint of smart homes. Investigating whether smart home adoption can reduce carbon emissions and promote carbon neutrality from a consumer perspective is therefore essential. In this study, 359 valid responses were collected from Hangzhou, a Chinese megacity, as basic data. We established a smart home adoption evaluation index system that enabled us to empirically examine the trend of household electricity-related CO2 emissions with the change in smart home adoption level. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between the smart home adoption level and household electricity-related CO2 emissions. Smart home adoption causes more CO2 emissions in the initial stage, but reaches a tipping point where higher levels of smart home adoption leads to widespread use of energy-saving smart features and subsequently fewer emissions. Furthermore, this study confirmed the moderating effect of the internet divide on the relationship between smart home adoption and electricity-related CO2 emissions; the results indicate that improving internet accessibility and utilization promotes the commitment to reducing CO2 emissions in smart homes.}

An earthquake has some effect on the environment due to the sudden movement of tectonic plates known as Earthquake Environmental Effects (EEE). These changes can be divided into 2 categories namely primary (e.g. subsidence, surface faulting) and secondary effects (displaced rocks, tsunami, landslides). In this paper, the major contribution revolves around earthquakes and their analysis. Earthquakes occur due to the shifting of tectonic plates on the lithosphere. These movements occur due to the Frictional stress between gliding plate borders builds up and leads to fault line failure. This sudden shaking of the plates releases a certain kind of energy in the Lithosphere which creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are also categorized into different classes ranging from minor to great, depending on their magnitude.}

In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions.

Designing the smart maintenance system is done by considering the findings from an extensive literature review and the feedback from structured interviews with bus service representatives. The system validation is performed as a case study with an industry partner. For conducting the case study, a concept demonstrator is designed according to the defined system and addresses the main problem causing downtime of the buses at the industry partner.

The traditional traffic zone division is limited by data with low update frequency and low accuracy, which can hardly meet the needs. With the progress of ICTs, data-driven traffic zone division is developing gradually. Many scholars have tried to divide traffic zone through GPS and CDR. However, there are still shortcomings in the data-driven traffic zone division. On the one hand, different scholars use different data sources and division methods, and there is no unified framework that can describe different ways. On the other hand, many technical problems such as unsatisfactory zone boundary, single data source and clustering algorithm only considering similarity have not been solved well. Therefore, this paper first proposes a technical framework for data-driven traffic zone division, which describes the different methods uniformly by dividing the data-driven traffic zone division into four parts. Based on this framework, this paper proposes a traffic zone division method based on CSD, which solves the above technical problems successfully, and finally is applied in the traffic zone division of Foshan, China.}

The regression learning model used in this proposed method classifies the time and energy-dependent schedules for data queuing and transmission in a view to maximising throughput. Cost-based data transmission and energy harvesting approaches are the concurrent procedures used to identify the linear descent points through the regression method. This identification helps mitigate unnecessary energy dissemination and early energy drain of the IoT devices for their allocated/transmitted data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations, and it is verified using the metrics energy consumption, remaining energy ratio, energy harvested, cost factor, and throughput. The proposed method helps to minimise the energy consumption rate and maximise the throughput in an effective manner.}

There are still many questions regarding the effective implementation of these systems and their long-term viability. This study aims to offer and inspire sustainable options for the effectiveness and use of CWs by thoroughly evaluating their application and the most recent developments in their sustainable design and operation for wastewater treatment. First, a brief explanation of the definition, classification, and application of current CWs has been given. The relationship between the operational needs and design criteria of CWs, such as substrate types, hydraulic retention time, water depth, plant species, hydraulic load, and feeding mechanism, and the operation's sustainability for treating wastewater has then been examined. Growing knotweed plants, which bind dye particles in the soil and take up heavy metal ions for better growth, as well as reducing the detrimental effects of dyes and heavy metals, are some of the sustainability initiatives for those wetland technologies that are outlined in this paper. If employed, this approach can clean wastewater in smart cities and metropolitan regions that are polluted by industrial waste water very well with a single expenditure.

Social media applications provide an opportunity for dialogic communication, where, for a relatively low cost, a large amount of information reaching a wide audience can be published and exchanged in real time, fueling opportunities for citizens' engagement. This study is based on a social media listening method, through Twitter data mining, which enabled disentangling different components of citizen engagement (popularity, commitment, and virality) for a sample of Italian municipalities. In addition, we executed a deep analysis of the types of communication artifacts exchanged and, through a content analysis of the tweets published by followers of the municipalities' accounts, we identified the main areas of interest in the social media conversations. Our results are based on the analysis of online conversations engaged by followers of Twitter accounts of a sample of 28 Italian municipalities, chosen among the most active and densely populated. We show that municipalities tend to use the Twitter account as a channel of communication to inform the population about a variety of topics, such as transport and public works, among the others. The volume of activity and number of followers (audience) vary from one municipality to the other. There is generally a negative relationship between the density of the population of a municipality and citizens' engagement: smaller municipalities show a higher citizens' engagement; the biggest ones, like Roma, Milan, Turin, Naples, are laggards. We finally conducted a city profiling process, which provides a representation of key citizens' segments in terms of engagement. Policymakers could find in our work useful tools to increase citizens' listening capacity.}

In the last few years, several techniques and models are used for retrieving significant information from urban big data of smart cities. This research work aims at developing a data fusion-based traffic congestion control system in smart cities using a deep learning model.
Methodology
A hybrid model based on the convolution neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) architectures are used for region-based traffic flow predictions in smart cities. CNN is used for the classification of spatial data while LSTM for temporal data.
Conclusion
The experiments used the CityPulse Traffic and CityPulse Pollution datasets, and measured root mean square error (RMSE), time consumption and accuracy. A small RMSE value of 49 and highest accuracy of 92.3% compared to other baseline models depicts the applicability of the proposed model in the region-based traffic flow prediction problems in the smart cities.}

A random selection of 44 articles in these journals was conducted based on the presence of words in titles, abstracts and keywords between 2012 and 2020. Four terms were revealed, namely, competitiveness, distinctiveness, urban forms and everyday lifestyles. The findings compiled 22 principles for creating singularity among smart cities. The three-step framework for creating the singularity of smart cities provides insights into how urban actors and stakeholders in the Global South can change traditional smart cities by aggregating the principles of placemaking (i.e. urban forms and everyday lifestyles) with the principles of the urban economy through urban competitiveness and distinctiveness. The conclusions suggested revisiting factors of ranking smart cities by considering the principles of placemaking, which can enhance the singularity of smart cities.}

The strong interaction between hearing and sight senses is the basis for this selection. The application of this system is in environments with ambient sound variation, including urban transportation, industrial settings, healthcare facilities, and so on. This system increases people's awareness regarding sound events and deals with individuals and the surrounding environment. The proposed method benefits from two types of warm white and cool white LEDs and their input power control to adjust the luminous flux and resulting correlated color temperature of light-emitting diodes. The simulation findings confirm the performance of the introduced method. This technique is recommended as a novel strategy, especially to meet the requirements of inhabitants of smart cities.}

abstract = {With the fast-expanding number of vehicles in smart cities, the management of road intersections and traffic congestion has grown to be major problems. Drivers often express their opinion that putting traffic lights on while taking traffic flows into account will have a significant impact on how traffic moves. This paper presents a smart Road traffic Control management system termed Urban Traffic Control (UTC) keeping real-time dynamic traffic flow in mind which helps in upgrading the level of road traffic network management. To provide an organized traffic arrangement, UTC presents methodologies such as vehicle counting, controlling process, and evaluation of lanes keeping status in mind, this whole procedure is implemented by taking the complete traffic network into an account instead of just considering intersections. The primary goal of our system is to lessen traffic jams by cutting down on the trip and waiting times vehicles spend at crossings and intersections. We need to assign a plan for traffic flow that has the least amount of traffic congestion and vehicle waiting time, for this purpose some indicators and models are introduced in this study. Lane weight, traffic jam indicator, and vehicle priority are among these models. As this work is an improvement on the current Road Network without much changing, we integrate our system on normal traffic lights which allow each lane a chance to move and we also considered the no-interference lane movement. To simulate our idea, we introduced a smart road traffic control system consisting of multi-agents, by using a NetLogo stimulator. To compare the fixed cycle traffic light, several vehicles (150 in total) with random behaviour were generated and scattered over 25 different intersections for the time duration of 9 h. This setting was used to test our smart traffic control solution on both lane flow and no interference movement flow. According to the obtained results, there was a 25.98% reduction in total average waiting time over simulation period for all vehicles and a reduction of 34.16% for no interference movement flow. These observations clearly state that suggested method is better suited for today's complex traffic conditions where change in infrastructure is minimal.}

abstract = {The establishment of smart city database requires Internet of things technology. With the continuous expansion of the scale of the Internet of things data center, the energy consumption of the data center is increasing, which greatly limits the development of the Internet of things data center. Energy consumption of Internet of things network data center in China's smart city has increased year by year, and data center network energy conservation has become a current research hotspot. The traditional network nodes are distributed and centralized innovatively to complete centralized control, and the controller completes the collection of the whole network information, the maintenance of network status, the distribution of flow entry, etc. Firstly, the energy-saving model of digital center network and the model data center network traffic prediction algorithm based on the principle of high accuracy traffic prediction are constructed, and an energy-saving multi-layer virtual traffic scheduling algorithm is proposed. Secondly, the two algorithms are fused, and finally an empirical study is carried out. The results show that in Random mode, the energy consumption ratio of energy-efficient multi-layer virtual-software defined networking (EMV-SDN) is the lowest, and the maximum reduction of energy consumption ratio reaches 7.8% compared with equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) algorithm. In Staggered mode and Stride mode, the energy consumption ratio of EMV-SDN algorithm is the lowest. Compared with the actual data flow, the prediction result of K-means-support vector machine (KM-SVM) algorithm is closer to the actual result, and the maximum error between the predicted value and the actual value of KM-SVM algorithm is 1.2 ​Gbps. However, the maximum error of balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies-support vector machine (B-SVM) algorithm reaches 3.1 ​Gbps; the prediction accuracy of KM-SVM algorithm is always higher than that of B-SVM algorithm in both discontinuous data flow and continuous actual data flow; the accuracy of KM-SVM algorithm in different experiments is high; among the energy consumption ratios of the combined algorithm, the energy consumption ratio of EMV-SDN algorithm is the lowest under the three communication modes, and the performance of the algorithm constructed in this study is higher than that of other algorithms in simulation operation; when the traffic prediction algorithm is combined with the virtual topology energy conservation control algorithm, the network structure change is reduced and the network stability is increased in this study. In the delay comparison of EMV-SDN algorithm, ECMP algorithm, and Dijkstra algorithm in the three communication modes, the EMV-SDN algorithm has the best performance. The results of this study provide an improvement direction for the development of Internet of Things technology and the construction of smart cities.}

Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)-based services are far and wide dependent upon the bandwidth requirement for effective communication in Smart City applications. Modern-day signal processing techniques are widely reliant on adaptive filters for efficient applications like signal prediction, echo cancellation, noise cancellation, etc. In this work, the use of adaptive filters is performed for stationary and non-stationary signals. It is well known that adaptive filters’ performance and effect depend on their regulating parameters and noise variance. Therefore, the parameter step size and filter orders are varied, and the outcome of the variations on respective signals is noted. Simulation of these scenarios is discussed at length to ensure better insight of adaptive filters to researchers and engineers to select the appropriate filter for a specific application.}

The knowledge gain and analysis of the smart city environment improves response time. This paper introduces the dependable information processing (DIP) method for handling multi-attribute environmental information in a smart city application. Information sensed from the environment is categorized in the initial stage regarding how it meets application requirements. It helps to identify the need and response of the application through different interacting spans and previous trials. For attribute categorization and span validation, learning via K-means clustering is exploited to identify similar and dissimilar information attributes. This identification speeds up the process of successive responses with improved interaction sessions. The accuracy of user responses and latency-free assessment improves the reliability of DIP in smart city applications. The efficiency of the system is then evaluated using detection accuracy (97.34%), the response time (4.3 s), and interaction time (12.3 s), which is compared with other methods.}

ULLs aim to provide a space for different parties to research, develop, and test solutions to urban problems whilst engaging with local communities. Their experimental approach to urban innovation and to public-private collaboration makes flexibility, openness, and informality important. However, ULLs are also confronted with existing legal frameworks, responsibilities, and liabilities. Whilst they aim at shared decision-making and horizontality, they must navigate public and private interests, and interact with local government as well. To understand these dynamics, this article examines the legal and organizational structures of ULLs, the factors and trade-offs that influence it, and the role municipal government plays in in these structures. This article analyzes the different forms and trajectories of ULLs in practice, through semi-structured interviews held in four labs in Amsterdam. Through qualitative research, we found that 1) ULLs are partnerships that exist on a spectrum of formalization, from informal to highly formal; 2) the degree of formalization is influenced by financial, legal, and organizational factors that change over time; 3) each degree of formalization is associated to trade-offs, even if these trade-offs are not explicitly formulated by the people involved; 4) tensions arise from the municipality's double role as public authority and as partner. We conclude that ULLs could gain from clearly identifying the legal frameworks that condition their structure, actions, and future.}

The article is intended to be the result of an analysis of the direction of the use of GIS technology in public administration in Poland. For this purpose, a model was developed to examine the state of GIS technology application. Two criteria were used to determine the state: groups of factors influencing the use of GIS technology (organisational, functional, informational and technical) and the level of maturity of GIS tools. Four levels were distinguished (from zero, i.e. no application of GIS technology, to a third level indicating the strategic importance of the tools studied). To this end, an empirical study was developed to determine the level of maturity of the application of the tools in question. After analysing the results, it can be concluded that the systems studied are still evolving. From the perspective of the proposed model, it can be assumed that the development of GIS tools has reached the second level in most of the surveyed offices. However, it will still be difficult to develop the software if not all the currently available GIS software capabilities are used.}

The purpose of this research is to minimize the cost needed to measure the HVAC energy consumption in educational and commercial buildings to save energy for energy efficiency strategies to serve the future smart and sustainable cities. These facilities are among the most energy-consuming loads, and this research proposes a technique to determine real HVAC energy consumption and cooling load using a single-sensor method. Calculating the as-built HVAC energy usage and real cooling load, especially in complex HVAC systems like VRV, which are some of the most challenging gaps, is achieved through a revolutionary and cost-effective approach. The proposed approach computes the actual HVAC energy consumption of each specific zone in the building using data from a single temperature sensor. Furthermore, the real and instantaneous cooling load of each zone was calculated, and the results show a promising agreement between the proposed techniques and the real measured consumption of the HVAC system. This approach can be integrated into the BMS building management system to determine the actual HVAC energy usage and cooling load for each zone individually in real time, enabling significant energy reduction decisions with optimal cost efficiency. Furthermore, it can be used by the BMS system as a real-time On-Board Diagnostic of the HVAC system.}

Although the relevance of new technologies as strategic levers for crisis resolution has been widely debated before the pandemic, especially in the smart cities' context, how individuals have agreed to include the technological changes dictated by the pandemic in their daily interactions remains an open question. This paper aims at detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology before and after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) to analyze a large corpus of tweets. Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies. In this way, the study enhances scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the strategies for enabling the use of technology within smart cities to manage the transformations introduced by the health emergency and guide citizens’ behaviour.}

In simple terms, green smart cities are technologically advanced in solving problems without harming the environment. For implementing green smart cities, developed and developing countries are collaborating and signing a memorandum of understanding with one another. Government representatives, educators, and the general public should cooperate to successfully make a green smart city. Global connectedness, productivity, efficiency, and revolution are possible through green smart cities. Meanwhile, poorly regulated green smart cities will result in environmental difficulties such as socioeconomic inequalities, poor public safety, and conservational destruction. Furthermore, implementing green smart cities is not a simple strategy. This chapter discusses the challenges and issues in green smart cities' implementation.}

A total of 37 articles have been selected and critically reviewed based on the Sustainable Smart Living framework developed for this paper. This review explores the concept of smart equity among citizens, which empowers them as end-users in cities experiencing the rapid growth of smart urbanism. Citizen adoption is an essential issue for critical consideration to ensure the sustainable smart living throughout urban life. The framework for sustainable smart living has been developed by focusing on citizen adoption in light of essential, interrelated variables, including government role, cognitive entity and intelligence. Based on this framework, the selected articles have been evaluated and analysed in terms of their significance for the sustainable smart living variables. The purposes of this review are twofold: first, to develop a framework for sustainable smart living focusing on citizen adoption; second, to examine the current status of smart city research from a human-centric viewpoint by adopting the framework as a guideline for evaluating and analysing the selected articles on smart urbanism. The results of this review may be extended by future studies on sustainable smart living that focus on smart cities that address citizen adoption from a human-centric viewpoint.}

In this paper, Analytical Network Process (ANP) is used to weight smart and sustainable city criteria. According to the results, while 'smart living' is the most important characteristic with a 35,459% priority, 'smart governance' is the last with 5,738%. The study covers 44 cities around the world and comparisons were made by TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). According to the results, Tokyo, London and New York are in the top three in the overall ranking. But none of these cities is among the top five in terms of smart governance, mobility and environmental dimensions. According to the results obtained, the article provides some recommendations for the cities. These results aim to help cities understand their situation relative to other cities and to see areas where policymakers need to strengthen.}

In literature several methods have been proposed to plan a Smart city, but, at the best of the authors’ knowledge, only a few of them have been really applied to the urban context. Most of them are indeed theoretical and qualitative approaches, providing scenarios that have not been applied to real cities/districts. Moreover, a comparison among the results of different quantitative planning models applied to real case studies is still missing. In this framework, the aim of the paper is to propose a new quantitative method based on a previous qualitative model developed by the same authors. The feasibility and validity of the method will be tested through the comparison with an existing AHP model and the application of both approaches on two real case studies, characterized by different territorial levels. Results of the analysis show that both methods are consistent, reliable and do provide similar results despite the differences in the application process.}

Even if only tacitly, the resultant debate increasingly oscillates around how the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) might render cities and urban space better places. This article responds to this imperative by suggesting how to capture users’ views and perceptions of smart city services and applications and in this way enrich the decision- and policy-making processes. It is argued that by developing appropriate scales these otherwise subjective views and perceptions may be objectivized and hence made of great use to managers and policymakers. Accordingly, in this research, a process of scale development is conducted in four phases of both inductive and deductive methods. Following initial rounds of focus groups and assessment by experts, an international survey was conducted with 295 participants from Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Arab Peninsula, and other regions. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 and AMOS 20 tools. The study proposes a 20-item scale in five distinct dimensions: Technology anxiety; Work–life interface; Engagement orientation; Support orientation; and Quality of life. The significant theoretical and managerial implications are discussed to demonstrate how to manage information for the benefit of all stakeholders involved in the making of a smart city.}

Smart cities depend on a robust and flexible mobile network foundation, and yet, Thailand is leading the way in the ASEAN. Using Thailand as a case study, this paper presents a practical mobile network planning and optimization framework (PMNPO) that’s workable for the fourth-generation up to sixth-generation networks in smart cities, especially in an industrial estate. While theoretical frameworks play a vital role in optimizing network performance, such frameworks may not be practical enough. This study applies a mixed quantitative research method on actual applications (case studies) and qualitative research. The PMNPO is a management function of pseudo-codes. A workable cost-sharing model for mobile networks consists of CAPEX, OPEX, feasibility study, and site value management (mobile network operators). The fair factor (0.2), the payback (5 years), the NPV ($0.5 million), and the IRR (20%) reveal a promising financial prospect. The PMNPO is practical for Thailand, with a mean acceptance rate of 4.83. Therefore, the findings support stakeholders, policymakers, and decision-makers, in setting telecommunication policies. The results can apply to other developing countries or catalyze a similar research type.}

We examine the consequences of integrating electric cars and buses into the city energy system (60% of private cars and 100% of public buses), using three different charging strategies in a modelling tool that considers local generation and storage of electricity and heat, electricity import to the city, and investments to achieve net-zero emissions from local electricity and heating in 2050. We find that up to 85% of the demand for the charging of electric cars is flexible and that smart charging strategies can facilitate 62% solar PV in the charging electricity mix, compared to 24% when cars are charged directly when parked. Electric buses are less flexible, but the timing of charging enables up to 32% to be supplied by solar PV. The benefit from smart charging to the city energy system can be exploited when charging is aligned with the local value of electricity in the city. Smart charging for cars reduces the need for investments in stationary batteries and peak units in the city electricity and heating sectors. Thus, our results point to the importance of sectoral coupling to exploit flexibility options in the city electricity, district heating and transport sectors.}

The device can initially up-convert the external vibrations with sub-Hertz into tens of Hertz, and further convert to hundreds of Hertz by the second FUC mechanism, which gives a high conversion ratio of 8400. A comprehensive dynamic model has been proposed and verified both from the theoretical analysis and COMSOL simulation to analyze the frequency conversion process and output voltage. When excited by a frequency of 0.2 Hz, an average output power of 75 μW could be obtained with a compact size. Benefiting from the non-contact design, the device could be applied in some sealed scenarios for smart city construction. Herein, a wireless humid-temperature sensor node in the pipeline was successfully powered by harvesting energy from humans walking with the proposed VEH, showing promising application prospects.}

One barrier to the creation and successful implementation of neighborhood-scale heat resilience plans has been a lack of reliable strategies for resident engagement. In this research, the authors designed a two-week summer STEM module for youth ages 12 to 14 in Roanoke, Virginia in the Southeastern United States. Participants collected and analyzed temperature and thermal comfort data of varying types, including from infrared thermal cameras and point sensors, handheld weather sensors, drones, and satellites, vehicle traverses, and student peer interviews. Based on primary data gathered during the program, we offer insights that may assist planners seeking to engage residents in neighborhood-scale heat resilience planning efforts. These lessons include recognizing: (1) the problem of heat in neighborhoods and the social justice aspects of heat distribution may not be immediately apparent to residents; (2) a need to shift perceived responsibility of heat exposure from the personal and home-based to include the social and landscape-based; (3) the inextricability of solutions for thermal comfort from general issues of safety and comfort in neighborhoods; and (4) that smart city technologies and high resolution data are helpful “hooks” to engagement, but may be insufficient for shifting perception of heat as something that can be mitigated through decisions about the built environment.}

Therefore, the model developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) was adapted and the FITradeoff method was used because it requires only partial information. The applicability of the proposal was illustrated by an application to Brazilian capitals. The results show that there is weakness on the part of the Brazilian capitals in relation to their access to and development of technology, innovation, local attractiveness and economic issues. Moreover, the capitals of the Northeast region of Brazil have lower performance compared to the cities of the South, Southeast and Midwest regions.

The decentralized architecture of blockchain offers greater security for distributed systems. Although, there have been some concerns raised about the robustness of blockchain technology. Numerous cybersecurity flaws have been found in blockchain implementations. Blockchain technology enables transactions to be more transparent than the old centralized systems. Hence, the blockchain technology has been exposed to numerous vulnerable cyberattacks. As a result, cyberattacks lead to system breakdown, data loss, password thefts, and information theft.

Although urban water infrastructure (UWI) performs important functions in a city (e.g., supply of drinking water), information and communication technologies (ICT) and system-wide management of network-based UWI are not yet widely deployed. Therefore, this review summarises first both existing and potential applications related to network-based UWI, characterised by different spatial and temporal resolution of measurement and control data. Second, a comprehensive analysis of ICT is provided, which is extended with exemplary applications in the field. The analysis reveals that a coordination between intended application and usable communication technology is required to realise an efficient monitoring and control network in the field of UWI networks. To overcome this limitation, a detailed framework is developed, which can be used by researcher, network operators, and stakeholder to identify suitable communication technologies for different UWI applications or to determine possible applications for an existing ICT system. Following, the applicability of the framework is demonstrated by selected examples. As the framework also indicates, an integrated approach towards smart water cities requires the combination of different communication technologies to satisfy all specifications.}

These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This new area is a significant gap in and of itself—as it is still in its infancy—that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic.}

The extensibility of the proposed approach is highlighted by further integrating power, water, and telecoms infrastructure as part of the very same system, in order to analyse flood-induced asset failures and their propagation across networks. The World Avatar promotes evidence-based decision making during several disaster management phases, supporting both tactical and strategic risk assessments, which supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 to improve the assessment of vulnerability, exposure, and risk of communities imposed by flooding events.}

abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in future smart cities could help solve many traffic-related challenges, such as reducing traffic congestion and traffic accidents. Various congestion pricing and electric vehicle charging policies have been introduced in recent years. Nonetheless, the majority of these schemes emphasize penalizing the vehicles that opt to take the congested roads or charge in the crowded charging station and do not reward the vehicles that cooperate with the traffic management system. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic traffic congestion pricing and electric vehicle charging management system for the internet of vehicles in an urban smart city environment. The proposed system rewards the drivers that opt to take alternative congested-free ways and congested-free charging stations. We propose a token management system that serves as a virtual currency, where the vehicles earn these tokens if they take alternative non-congested ways and charging stations and use the tokens to pay for the charging fees. The proposed system is designed for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) in the context of a smart city environment without the need to set up any expensive toll collection stations. Through large-scale traffic simulation in different smart city scenarios, it is proved that the system can reduce the traffic congestion and the total charging time at the charging stations.}

Cloud computing (CC), which possesses large capacity in terms of computing and storage resource, may not be suitable for many vehicular applications like safety and emergency services due to high bandwidth requirement and large response time. Edge or fog computing can be a promising technology that can be integrated with vehicular networks to meet the requirements of less bandwidth usage and lower response time. Vehicular cloud network (VCN) extends cloud computing concepts among the vehicles in the vehicular networks to enable vehicles with excess computing, storage or bandwidth capacities to share the resources with other vehicles, who are willing to use that extra resource to fulfill their service requirements. Security poses a great challenge in a vehicular network due to high mobility, dynamic and frequent changes in topology and sudden variation in vehicle density in the roads. Privacy of the vehicular users must be ensured to encourage mass participation for making the system trustworthy. Both security and privacy are pre-requisites of a sustainable smart city. For secured service provisioning, before transmitting a message, connected vehicles must be authenticated. In this paper, we have proposed a system to authenticate vehicles for secured service provisioning in edge-enabled vehicular cloud networks. A novel technique has been developed to avoid redundant authentication to validate a vehicle successively across various RSUs (road side units). Extensive simulation works have been done and the outputs demonstrate efficacy of the proposed algorithm.}

This study responds to this imperative by proposing the use of smart bin technology combined with a vehicle routing problem tool. The integration of these technologies aims to develop an intelligent solution for appropriate waste collection, limiting container pickup only when necessary, and optimizing waste collection routes. Our approach considers several factors, including the fill level of each container, time windows, vehicle capacity, and tour completion constraints. By addressing these key factors, the system seeks to revolutionize waste management practices, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of waste collection.}

The methodological approach of examining citizens' readiness was based on an analysis of crowdsourcing models, such as crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting and crowdsensing, and their application in various fields, such as traffic, environmental conservation, utility services and health. The data was gathered in the city of Belgrade, Republic of Serbia, for two years through a survey that included a sample of 210 citizens. The results indicate that citizens are ready to accept crowdsourcing services related to environmental conservation (crowdfunding services that support solar energy development and environmental protection) and public transportation (crowdvoting and crowd wisdom services that can improve the state of the public transport).

The DMS approach supports iterative development and optimisation of routes and route parameters. If the goals are not achieved in the route plan, the data user can use the previous simulation results as a start point, develop the routes and route parameters in the simulation model, and then evaluate the updated route plan in simulations. The route development and simulation can be continued until the desired targets are met in the route plan.

Activated carbon fiber has a strong adsorption capacity due to its large specific surface area, and can adsorb and remove organic matter in water, including some carcinogenic or toxic macro-aromatic substances. Physical adsorption is caused by electrostatic interaction between the surface molecules of the adsorbent and the adsorbate molecules, which is characterized by adsorption without selectivity. Chemical adsorption is due to the chemical bonding between the two molecules, forming a strong chemical bond and also the surface complex. Chemical adsorption has the certain selectivity, generally monolayer adsorption. With the large increase in vehicle usage and the exhaust emissions from equipment such as oil-fired boilers, the pollution of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide gas has become an important issue in environmental management. Adsorption or catalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide is an important means of treatment. This paper integrates the smart city scenario to construct the novel scenario for the analysis and research. The simulation results prove the effectiveness.}

A smart city is characterized by the interaction between three conceptual components: technology, people and institutions assessed and developed through six distinct characteristics: economy, people, governance, mobility, environment and living. With the growing world population, the amount of clean and fresh water required in cities is increasing. Although water is part of critical urban infrastructure, many smart cities do not include smart water management in their visions. Hydroinformatics is the key link between smart cities and smart water management. It is a science that is not only about modeling and decisions support, but it also considers the social dimension of water cycle management, including social needs, concerns, and consequences. Hydroinformatics takes full advantage of the proliferation of remotely sensed information from space and ground-based sensors with increased capabilities in terms of spatial and temporal resolutions generated by the advancements in smart city technologies. Applications of hydroinformatics in the urban environment have increased in recent years. Smart cities technologies and infrastructures offer the potential of linking together all the aspects of the urban water cycle and can lead to the development of an integrated smart water cycle management.}

Although, many standard and conventional security solutions have been provided for IoT, it suffers from many privacy and security concerns. Standard security protocols are not suitable for majority of IoT devices because of its decentralized topology and resource-constraints. Blockchain (BC) finds its efficient application in IoT to preserve the five basic cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, availability and non-repudiation. Adoption of conventional BC in IoT causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overheads which are not appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. To mitigate these problems, this work proposes a smart access control framework in a public and a private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient and secure as compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security and privacy issues. Moreover, proposed BC has minimal overhead as well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access control issues which handle multiple permissions of various processing nodes of IoT environment and detects relevant inconsistencies. Comparison in terms of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control. The primary goal of this research article is to explore the possibility of BC as an alternative to standard security solutions for low resource IoT applications.}

Sustainable smart cities always looking for smart and more advanced systems. Smart healthcare is one of the prominent area and domain of smart cities where different types of applications are used for people's health and comfort. Smart health systems are further divided into different areas, such as e-health, e-medicine, personal assistant monitoring, and body area networks. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is one of the popular research area due to its impending use in emergencies such as monitoring and diagnosis patient’s health. Sensor nodes are placed on or inside the human body where the implanted sensor performs the operations for a long time without any replacement of the battery. To avoid frequent change/replacement of the battery, energy management is essential and one of major concern. Facts show that most of the sensor networks use multi-hop and utilizes more resources. Energy-efficient routing protocols play a significant role in energy consumption. Due to the number of sensor nodes attached to the patient body, interference among sensors is one of the reasons for energy wastage. The co-channel interference increases the energy consumption because of the higher number of retransmission efforts required for successful transmission in the presence of interference. The main objective of this paper is to develop an Interference Aware Energy Efficient Transmission Protocol (IEETP) by utilizing the most appropriate routing metrics for smart health systems in smart cities. The proposed protocol selects the next forwarder node based on the residual energy of nodes, distance, node’s position, and node density. The proposed protocol is a multi-hop protocol in which each source node forwards the data towards the coordinator node. The proposed protocol has evaluated with state-of-the-art protocols where the IEETP has higher performance in the network.}

Since assessment of these barriers must be handled by considering many different perspectives, assessment of the critical barriers for SEC can be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This study aims to identify possible critical barriers hindering Turkey from becoming an SEC and prioritize these barriers based on an integrated MCDM methodology. This methodology consists of fuzzy Decision Making Trail and Evaluating Laboratory (DEMATEL) and cognitive mapping methods. The integrated methodology has been constructed with hesitant fuzzy Z-numbers, which allows not only to state the impreciseness of the evaluations but also to consider the hesitancy of the decision-makers to evaluate barriers concerning SEC implementation in Turkey. While the relations between the barriers have been determined via the hesitant fuzzy Z-DEMATEL method, their weights have been obtained through the hesitant fuzzy Z-cognitive mapping method. For Turkey, policy, economic, and social barriers are determined as the essential main barriers, respectively. Besides, the following five sub-barriers: the lack of successful past experiences/projects, social/political conflicts, inadequate regulatory framework, lack of regulatory norms, policies/directions, the lack of technical knowledge among planners, and information on new technology are deserved to be more attention since they have high weights. The research should help policymakers and businesses better understand the barriers to smart energy city projects in order to improve effective action and policy interventions that lead to more successful projects.}

Such a multi-tenant deployment model is required to lower the initial investment costs to implement large scale solutions for smart cities, but also imposes some key security obstacles. In fact, smart cities support critical applications demanding to protect the data and functionalities from malicious and unauthorized uses. Equipping the supporting platforms with proper means for access control is demanding, but these means are typically implemented according to a centralized approach, where a single server stores and makes available a set of identity attributes and authorization policies. Having a single root of trust is not suitable in a distributed and cooperating scenario of large scale smart cities due to their multi-tenant deployment. In fact, each of the integrated system has its own set of security policies, and the other systems need to be aware of these policy, in order to allow a seamless use of the same credentials across the overall infrastructure (realizing what is known as the single-sign-on). This imposes the problem of consistent and secure data replicas within a distributed system, which can be properly approached by using the blockchain technology. Therefore, this work proposes a novel solution for distributed management of identity and authorization policies by leveraging on the blockchain technology to hold a global view of the security policies within the system, and integrating it in the FIWARE platform. A detailed assessment is provided to evaluate the goodness of the proposed approach and to compare it with the existing solutions.}

The team of authors, which has a significant background in the field of research on the problems of people with disabilities, for the first time extrapolates it to the concept of a "smart city" and therefore pays considerable attention to the description of the works of foreign authors whose scientific interests are located between urban well-being, the concept of a smart city, transport accessibility and, of course, the social aspects of disability. Based on the results of the article, conclusions are drawn about the level of transport accessibility of the capital, and key features of the public opinion of people with disabilities about whether they feel comfortable living in Moscow are identified.}

abstract = {To develop intelligent and sustainable cities, the government of India launched initiatives like Smart Cities and the Clean Development Mission. Solid waste management (SWM) has become one of the primarily focused areas of such initiatives. The changing dynamics of urban waste characteristics due to unplanned urbanization and rapid growth in urban populations (due to migration) has been a significant concern for local authorities in urban areas to develop an effective SWM plan. The development of a long-term SWM plan along the line of the government initiatives' objectives requires understanding the waste quantities, characteristics, and existing waste management practices. This paper presents an overview of existing waste management activities, financial and institutional demographics in six selected Indian Smart Cities, and the field studies to assess SWM systems as per the waste management rules. The study involved a participatory approach to collect data from local bodies and stakeholders. Indicative strategies for the development of waste management systems were formulated based on the outputs of this analysis. Discussion on pathways includes waste characterization, funding sources, data technologies, and service level benchmarking to plan an integrated solid waste management system for a Smart City. The outcomes of this study shall equip local authorities in designing waste systems to accelerate the transition towards innovative and sustainable waste systems.}

Different aspects of smart city assessment tools including scale of assessment, target groups, type of data, source of data, and geographical focus are studied. It is discussed that major approaches to assessment include benchmarking, baseline assessment, maturity assessment, assessment against peers, assessment against desirable targets, and scenario making. Currently, benchmarking is the most popular approach. However, depending on the specific needs of a development, other approaches may also be used to better inform decision making toward climate resilient cities. It is discussed that smart city should be evaluated at different levels and dimensions. There are six dimensions to cover all aspects of smart city including smart economy, smart people, smart mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart data. Different indicators related to these dimensions are provided that can inform planners and policy makers in their efforts. The chapter argues that smart city assessment tools should be able to facilitate transition toward climate resilience. In this regard, our analysis showed that existing assessment tools are relatively suitable for informing planning and policy making related to environmental and social dimensions. However, better integration of issues and indicators related to other dimensions such as infrastructure is needed. We hope these will be further investigated in the future research.}

Smart city projects may fail if citizens do not actively participate in their design. In smart cities, this participation often occurs through dedicated participation platforms where citizens can vote, discuss, and submit ideas. However, current platforms are not always aligned with the requirements of citizens in a representative way. Furthermore, they are neither always aligned with the reality of the administration and the requirements of public servants. In this paper, we examine what characteristics a participation platform should possess to be aligned with the requirements of citizens and public servants. A quantitative survey of citizens and qualitative interviews of several public servants are performed to elicit those requirements. The most important requirements for citizens are free access, user friendliness, and government usage of the ideas while the most important for public servants are the representation of the city's identity, back-end functionalities, and inclusivity. Afterwards, a guiding framework, following Design Science Research, is composed based on the requirements and applied to the platform LeuvenMaaktHetMee. Furthermore, the framework updates the founding framework of Macintosh and Whyte from 2008, allowing to guide the development and implementation of participation platforms.}

Such an approach includes scientifically processing civic query (including complaints, suggestions, and inquiry) data about a city and planning the city such that its policies reflect its residents' voices to ensure “throughput legitimacy.” This study introduces a novel approach to analyze diverse informal civic query data for a city and plan the city in a way that its residents want.

In her study of ‘Surveillance Capitalism’, Shoshana Zuboff cites Google’s parent firm Alphabet’s legal customer-purchase agreement for the parent firm’s Nest thermostats. These impose ‘oppressive privacy and security consequences’ requiring sensitive information to be shared through ‘Internet-of-Things’ (IoT) networks with other domestic and external devices, unnamed functionaries and various third parties. This is for data harvesting, analytics, processing, manipulation and transformation through digital re-sale to the same and other consumers in the form of unwanted, targeted advertising. The point of this identity ‘rendition’ is to massively augment corporate profits. It is but a short step from trapping the unwitting consumer in a ‘smart home’ to planning a similarly mediated ‘smart city’ aimed at further massively augmenting corporate profits. This is happening, as founders of digital media from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla either commission or become beneficiaries of ‘smart city’ planning. However, there is evidence that such imperiousness is increasingly countered by emerging democratic critique of these new ‘model villages’ or ‘company towns’.}

abstract = {Edge computing can serve latency-sensitive data generated by smart IoT devices in smart cities, which cannot be accommodated by cloud services. However, edge-enabled smart cities applications face many security issues such as massive centralization, vulnerability to tampering, and tracing difficulty. Blockchain, as an emerging ledger technology, can be a useful solution to these problems. However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.}

Using the established session key between the user and an access smart device though mutual authentication and key agreement process, the real time data can be securely accessed. To deal with this issue, we propose a new user authentication scheme in smart city environment using three factors of a legal registered user (mobile device, password and biometrics). The proposed scheme is shown to be robust against a number of potential attacks needed in an IoT-based smart city deployment. The simulation study for formal security verification using the widely-accepted “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” tool demonstrates that the proposed scheme is also secure. Furthermore, experiments on various cryptographic primitives have been carried out using “MIRACL Cryptographic SDK: Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library” under both server and Raspberry PI 3 settings. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis shows the effectiveness and better security of the proposed scheme as compared with other state of art user authentication schemes.}

Therefore, it is urgent to design an universal and robust multi-object tracking(MOT) algorithm. MOT is a challenging problem with numerous significant applications, including robot navigation, autonomous driving and pedestrian behavior analysis. Among the existing MOT approaches, MOT models which joint learning detection and Re-ID are attracting increasing attention. Subsequently, there is competition between these two tasks jointly in a network inevitably leading to performance degradation. To address these difficulties, we propose an adaptive joint learning approach, called UnionTrack, for MOT in this paper. It handles with the problem of uniform learning between tasks in online MOT system. Firstly, UnionTrack introduces a scale-aware attention network that aggregates features from different scales for object localization and learning of the corresponding discriminative embeddings. Secondly, a cross-correlation module is designed to construct task-relevant feature maps and interact adaptively during training detection and Re-ID. Then, we perform inter-frame correlation at different stages by using high and low confidence detection to avoid occlusions and backgrounds. UnionTrack is trained in an end-to-end manner to better accommodate the training between detection and Re-ID tasks. Finally, our proposed UnionTrack is compared with state-of-the-art methods in extensively experiments and detailed performance analysis is performed in MOT15, MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 which are all urban scene to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Looking forward to playing a role in the Smart City systems.}

This research investigates attack attempts on smart home environments, focusing on firmware, brute force, and DoS attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) network which were successful in bringing down the device in less than a minute. Weak passwords were cracked using Brute Force techniques related to HTTP, SSH, Telnet, and FTP protocols, and an unknown service port to reveal backdoor access. Cross-site scripting vulnerability was detected on IoT devices that could allow running malicious scripts on the devices. The authors also exploited the unknown services to reveal backdoors and access sensitive device details and potentially exploited them to add new ports or rules to turn the IoT devices into a router to attack other devices. To detect and mitigate such attacks, the authors present an IoT-based intrusion detection and prevention system to secure smart home network devices. The authors compared the proposed framework with other similar research based on Precision, Accuracy, F-measure, and Recall. The proposed model outperforms all the other known models reporting a high of 95% for identifying malicious attack packets, while others reported 58% and 71% detection percentage.}

abstract = {In developing production sectors, the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) is a significant interchange between the internet of things (IoT) and vehicle automation systems in smart cities. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) uses the roadside unit (RSU) and nearby techniques to conduct different vehicle requirements. Since the number of vehicles and traffic delivery is growing asymmetrically, the service provider should implement innovative download strategies to increase efficiency and provide customers with high-quality service. Nevertheless, the lack of national knowledge and time-various IOVs make it extremely difficult for the roadside unit long-term energy restrictions to take successful offloading or discharging. Hence in this paper, the Optimized energy-efficient sensible edge processing (OEE-SEP) model for IoV in smart cities has been proposed for vehicle activity discharging with the estimated amount of time with less energy consumption. The sensible edge processing model comprises undirected activity discharging and similar activity discharging protocol, concerning the number of duties per unit time and the estimated time of completion for the same amount of information imported. An optimized energy-efficient model is formulated to reduce the total transmission delay and reduce the energy consumed during discharge. OEE-SEP leads to less energy consumption during activity discharging when the IoV processes and information loading activities are considered. The experimental results show that the suggested model enhances the performance rate of 97.45% with less transmission delay, less energy consumption for vehicle automation systems in smart cities.}

abstract = {In recent years, the world has witnessed significant progress in implementing numerous eco-district and eco-city projects, which are under the banner of experimentation or seen as sites of innovation. Indeed, the rise of such initiatives serves as a sign of renewed attempts to experiment or innovate in designing urban futures in an increasingly urbanized and datafied society. In light of this, a number of alternative models of eco-urbanism have been proposed by scholars and promoted by policy makers. The prominent among these models are sustainable urban districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. At the core of these models is a range of compact and ecological design strategies and static and dynamic conceptions of spatial scaling. These are intended to produce and boost the benefits of sustainability on the basis of a set of integrated approaches—increasingly supported by big data technologies—as a way to overcome new challenges and introduce new solutions. Based on two case studies conducted on three of the ecologically and technologically leading cities in Europe—Stockholm, Malmö, and Barcelona, this paper analyses and discusses the role and relevance of integrating density, mixed land use, greening, and low-energy buildings to the sustainability of emerging eco-districts; the new conceptions of cities and their spatial scales in the context of data-driven smart eco-cities; and the opportunities and challenges of smart urban metabolism with respect to the evaluation of eco-districts. This study shows that combining compact and ecological design strategies improves the performance of eco-districts with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as paves the way for their balanced integration for producing synergistic effects. Also, this study highlights the innovative potential and enabling role of urban computing and intelligence in transforming the spatial scaling of data-driven smart eco-cities through generating the kind of designs that increase the effects of sustainability as outcomes of processes. Moreover, this study reveals the advantages of the data-driven approach to the analysis of the flows of resources in urban environments in relation to the evaluation of sustainable urban district development. This paper concludes that data-driven smart planning and evaluation holds great potential for facilitating progress towards achieving the goals of sustainability thanks to the proven role and untapped potential of big data technologies in monitoring, understanding, and analyzing urban processes and systems in real-time.}

The selected city scale tools for analysis are International Urban Sustainability Indicators List, LEED for cities and communities, Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency, and Chilean Center for Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS). Also, the selected tools at the neighborhood scale are LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED ND), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method and Green Star Communities. The results of our analysis showed that, on average, more than half of the smart city indicators are covered by selected sustainability assessment tools. However, the extent of coverage was not the same across all dimensions. Dimensions such as smart environment and smart living have been better included in the sustainability assessment tools than the smart economy and smart people dimensions. CEDEUS includes the highest percentage of smartness indicators among the selected sustainability assessment tools, while LEED cities includes the lowest percentage. There is also no considerable difference between neighborhood and city scales of sustainability assessment tools in terms of smartness inclusion. Overall, the results of this research show that more efforts are needed for better integration of smart city and climate resilience indicators into sustainability assessment tools. It is hoped that the developers of assessment tools will consider this issue when revising their assessment tools.}

abstract = {Forecasting short-term residential energy consumption is critical in modern decentralized power systems. Deep learning-based prediction methods that can handle the high variability of residential electrical loads have made models more accurate. On the other hand, these methods need a lot of sensitive information about how much people use something gathered centrally to train a forecasting model. This is not good for privacy and scalability. Moreover, models may become less accurate over time due to changing conditions. In this work, we propose a framework for energy consumption forecasting that exploits adaptive learning, federated learning, and edge computing concepts. A central server aggregates numerous long short-term memory (LSTM) models that users at various locations train with their energy consumption data to create a generalized model that uses adaptive learning to detect data drifts and enhance forecasting at the edge layer. Our findings show that adaptive federated learning performs better than centralized learning while preserving privacy, reducing communication overhead, lowering the forecast error rate by 8%, and decreasing the training time by approximately 80%.}

abstract = {With the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the construction of the smart city came into being. Compared with the traditional city, a smart city can reduce resource consumption, improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental pollution, reduce traffic congestion, reduce potential safety hazards, improve the quality of life of citizens, etc. In order to collect a large amount of data to provide accurate decision-making recommendations for the management of smart cities, a large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) system needs to be built as the basis. For most applications in smart cities, it is very important to obtain the physical location information of the data during the data collection. However, it is a challenging issue for most sensor devices in the IoT system, because sensor devices are hard to equip positioning equipment as limited by cost. To tackle this, a Low-Cost Physical Locations Discovery (LCPLD) Scheme is proposed in this paper. In LCPLD scheme, mobile vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used for physical location discovery on the wireless sensor networks which are the important component of the IoT system in a smart city. In order to further reduce cost, we propose a task application mechanism to reduce the cost of vehicle broadcasting and the Adaptive UAV Flight Path Planning (AUPPP) algorithm to reduce UAV flight cost. In order to reduce localization error, the Large Error Rejection (LER) algorithm and the UAV Same Position Broadcast Repeat (USPBR) algorithm are proposed in this paper. After simulation experiments based on real vehicle driving data, the experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme: Compared with the comparison scheme, the LCPLD scheme proposed has a cost reduction of 16.58% ∼19.88%, an average reduction of 78.80% in positioning error, and an average reduction of 99.88% in the variance of positioning error.}

By extending MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation Software), we design and test appropriate mitigation strategies when traffic accidents occur within an existing urban area augmented with V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) capabilities and Advanced Driving Assisted cars (ADAS). Further, we propose traffic congestion models and related mechanisms for improving the necessary time for emergency vehicles to respond to accidents.}

abstract = {Wireless communications for IoT in smart cities may be affected by Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation conditions due to obstacles such as buildings, trees, and others. LoRaWAN technology transmits information through several kilometers in one hop, from a source node to a gateway. However, packet reception decreases when the link has NLOS conditions and there are no alternative routes for packet delivery. This paper presents a LoRa implementation of MACGSP6, a Gossip-based routing algorithm, to improve communications in a LoRaWAN network where all nodes have NLOS conditions. The paper compares the packet delivery ratio of LoRaWAN and MACGSP6. Results show that packet delivery to the gateway increased from 0% with LoRaWAN to a minimum of 53% with the routing algorithm. Additionally, most packets were delivered using the shortest path available, even when the algorithm does not explicitly compute the routes, decreasing the delay associated with this process. Thus, the proposed solution is useful for IoT applications in smart cities, such as smart metering and structural health monitoring, where one relay node can forward the information of many other nodes.}
