abstract = {The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation within the European Union intensifies regulatory requirements in terms of data protection for Smart City services. In particular, the mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process constitutes a complex managerial challenge. To reduce the complexity, this study develops a typology of Flemish Smart City services based on DPIA costs. Our explorative case study, based on face-to-face interviews and a workshop, shows that DPIA costs vary along the complexities of i) the urban environment in which a Smart City service is provided, and ii) the Smart City service itself. The research further demonstrates that these complexities represent multilayered concepts. The complexity of the urban environment consists of three layers: i) city size, ii) diversity of urban stakeholders, and iii) total of Smart City services in the urban region. Similarly, the complexity of the Smart City service is composed of five layers: i) number of different data streams, ii) clarity of data ownership, iii) amount of use-cases, iv) privacy invasiveness, and v) visibility of the Smart City service. While most layers of the respective complexities unequivocally matter in the eyes of the experts, others are more contested, such as the size of the city and the visibility of the Smart City service. This cost-based framework is of value to city administrations and Smart City service providers as it allows them to make the DPIA process more efficient by shortening the learning curve and improving decision making by clustering services based on data protection needs. In particular, stakeholders that have little expertise in-house, and that are looking for an easy-to-understand, rational framework can benefit from these results. Furthermore, based on both the literature review and the obtained results, our systematic data protection impact-cost-approach is generalizable beyond the EU-borders.}

abstract = {Substantial population growth, increasing urbanization, overloaded infrastructure, more energy consumption, environmental impacts, and investment in technological developments are major challenges in city management and development. Municipalities seek to improve their citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but the need to find a balance between these complex factors makes decision-making processes more difficult. Experts must analyze the determinants of smart cities, which are urban centers intended to be socially involved, habitable, and economically and environmentally sustainable, and that rely strongly on technology and innovation. Based on multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) principles, this study combines cognitive mapping techniques and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to develop a multicriteria model that can help managers analyze smart city determinants in a collaborative manner. The research included identifying these determinants and their respective cause-and-effect relationships using an expert panel’s experience and knowledge related to the subject under analysis. The results were validated by both the panel and the city councilor responsible for mobility and municipal projects within Évora City Council, Portugal, which has implemented smart city strategies. The latter specialist verified that the proposed evaluation system can be used as a tool to facilitate smart city collaborative decision-making processes. The study’s main advantages and limitations are also analyzed and discussed.}

abstract = {Many city governments have implemented promising smart initiatives to make cities more efficient, livable, and ecological. To harness the full potential of smart city initiatives, it is vital for policymakers to align citizens with the project objectives. This study comprehensively characterizes and classifies top-down announcements formulated by city developers into six alignment categories (i.e., smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living) using natural language processing. The proposed framework consists of five main processes: (1) web scraping-based extraction of announcements of four smart cities – Boston, Helsinki, Seoul, and Taipei, (2) text data preprocessing, (3) latent Dirichlet allocation-based modeling of strategic topics, (4) quantification of inter-topic similarities using Hellinger distance, and (5) comparison of top-down communication trends with real-world levels of urban performance. Through the comparative analysis of top-down communication trends and actual urban performances, the top-down discourses of smart cities were deconstructed as a reflection of wider political programs developed to enhance citizen alignment and urban performances. Furthermore, inter-topic similarities were also quantified to reflect whether communication strategies are multidisciplinary and city-tailored. In conclusion, the findings of this study can enhance our understanding and provide workable guidance for future smart city development.}

abstract = {This research studied the effect of different combinations of government capabilities (innovation capability mix) on public value in smart city-framed innovation projects. The study drew on the public value theory, the collaborative public innovation approach and the dynamic capabilities theory to devise a conceptual framework that links government capabilities and public value. Insights from smart cities and literature on public innovation were also used to identify a range of intra-organizational and external collaboration capabilities of governments that should lead to valuable public sector innovation. These capabilities were combined inductively through factor analysis, which was applied to a sample of 143 innovation projects in Spanish municipalities, leading to four forms of innovation capability mix. A factor analysis regression was then estimated. Overall, the study found that ‘citizen-oriented management’ (i.e., outstanding innovation-oriented internal management coupled with strong collaboration with citizens) and ‘provider focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with providers) seem to have a positive influence on three dimensions of public value (i.e., efficiency, effectiveness and societal challenges). By contrast, ‘citizen and expert focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with experts and citizens) and ‘peer focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with other governments) do not contribute to any of the three dimensions of public value. While project type was studied, it was found that its isolated effect was limited, although analyzing it provided some interesting findings.}

This paper identifies nine anticipated benefits/value proposition components of smart city activities, based on a literature review. It then uses a comparative multiple case study analysis to investigate how value proposition components are present in the SC activities of six cities with demonstrated excellence: Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, Helsinki, New York, Vienna; and three with emerging excellence: Berlin, Budapest, Moscow. The study reveals the distribution of the components in each city for different years, then these annual activity portfolios are clustered. Four different types of smart cities emerge from the analysis: (1) The Green City – in which years of activities, cities are focusing on environmentally related objectives; (2) The App City – in which years of activities, cities are focusing on developing and rolling out platforms and ICT applications to provide Quality of Life improvements directly for citizens; (3) The Socially Sensitive City - in which years of activities socially sensitive activities are prominent; (4) The Participatory City – in which years of activities citizen engagement is in focus. The findings provide a more comprehensive explanation to the mono-dimensional and holistic strategic approach of smart cities.}

abstract = {The real time Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading have ameliorated the smart city environment. Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart cities have made it possible to balance the energy demand and supply without burdening the power grids. They also help in minimizing both the heap amounts of pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions. EVs not only charge their batteries from Charging Stations (CSs), but when the smart city faces energy deficiency, they supply their surplus energy to the power grids to fulfill energy demand as well. In addition, EVs also balance the energy demand and supply through energy trading at the local level during peak hours, which strengthens V2V energy trading. However, some issues, such as security threats and privacy leakage prevent EVs from participating in the energy trading process. In addition, the lack of incentives and knowledge about the cost of reaching the energy trading place within minimum time are also big challenges. Therefore, to solve the aforementioned challenges, a secure and efficient scheme for V2V and V2G energy trading is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme also helps in promoting environmental friendliness and making the smart cities sustainable and reliable. In the proposed scheme, energy trading transactions are secured using consortium blockchain, wherein the Local Aggregators (LAGs) are selected as authorized nodes. LAGs perform their role as energy brokers and are responsible for validating the energy trading requests using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a solution to find accurate distance with required expenses and time to reach the charging destination is also proposed, which effectively guides EVs to reach the relevant CSs and encourages energy trading. Besides, we propose a fair payment mechanism using a smart contract to avoid financial irregularities. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also given in the proposed work to prevent EVs from acting selfishly. The efficient power flow having minimized losses in the vehicular network is of much importance. Therefore, the energy losses incurred in both V2G and V2V are discussed in this work. Furthermore, Oyente is used for smart contract’s security analysis and for testing Ethereum’s resilience against different security flaws. Two attacker models are proposed and the security analyses of the models are also provided. The analyses show that the proposed system is robust against the double spending and Sybil attacks. Finally, the efficient performance of our proposed scheme is validated and analyzed. The simulation results proved that our proposed work outperforms existing work in terms of providing a secure and efficient energy trading platform for both V2G and V2V environments.}

The public value of having a higher municipal credit rating reduces borrowing costs and consequently lowers the cost to manage government programs. In this article, the relationship between credit ratings and local governments' decisions to utilize one of the first sets of information and communications technology (ICT) innovations is investigated—the 311 system (non-emergency versions of 911 that use phone, web, and mobile application interfaces)—the analysis pairs longitudinal financial data with information on the implementation of 311 systems. The results of our analysis demonstrate that access to 311 systems, particularly web/mobile-based 311, can positively influence a city's credit rating. Additionally, we find that the length of time since 311 was adopted is positively related to credit ratings. The effect is visible with phone-based and web/mobile-based 311. These results suggest that cities with 311 systems and those with 311 in place longer have higher credit ratings. These results could indicate that cities with 311 are better managed or simply more transparent to investors, thus posing lower risks.}

To address this question, a qualitative multiple case study was carried out across three city authorities in Ireland characterised by diversity in their ITG structural arrangements to govern portfolios of smart city initiatives. From this analysis three types of ITG structural implementation are proposed named: Detached, Integrated, and Traditional. These are compared and discussed in relation to: (1) orientation of each approach; (2) decision-making authority; (3) alignment with the IT function and the overall municipal organization; and (4) the challenge perceived by the SCFs under each ITG arrangement. This research contributes to the academic conversation on adaptive governance, smart cities as well as to the broader ongoing debate on ITG in the public sector.}

At the same time, the adaptation of scientific methods to the civil protection mechanism and the diffusion of their results to the authorities and citizens, remains a challenge and in some cases, is not achievable. The main objective of this study is to provide an overview of the potentialities of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing, to incorporate relative methods and disseminate their results in an efficient and comprehensive way. Through characteristic examples, the use of GIS and remote sensing techniques, to produce relative webtools and interactive maps, which can be subsequently integrated in smart cities’ geoportals easily accessible from smartphones and personal computers, is highlighted. Moreover, it is analyzed how that kind of geoportals, can be combined to provide an effective and completed management of the natural disasters and simultaneously to defuse the generated knowledge along with other relative viable information to the public.}

abstract = {The pressing demand for an escalation in renewable energy production arises from the surge in power consumption, escalating environmental concerns, and the exhaustion of fossil fuels. Microgrids, featuring dispersed power sources, exhibit superior resilience, efficiency, and stability in contrast to conventional power grids. Noteworthy investments in eco-friendly initiatives have been made by various major corporations, particularly in institutional structures. The current research advocates for the integration of photovoltaics, energy storage, and electric vehicles (EVs) as pivotal elements in a smart grid. This study introduces an optimal energy management system (EMS) designed to efficiently allocate power from existing sources. To address the challenges within an uncertain and reliable environment, a stochastic framework leveraging the whale optimization algorithm and unscented transform has been formulated. All simulations have been executed using the digital twin of the smart grid components. Results suggest that the proposed EMS ensures uninterrupted power supply, contributing to a substantial 45% reduction in energy costs. Furthermore, the potential of EVs as storage devices is explored. When employed as energy sources, EVs led to a noteworthy 45.58% reduction in power prices, while their use as loads still yielded a significant 19.33% decrease. The study also delves into the analysis of outage effects on the continuous power supply cost.}

Due to such issues, the cities are more susceptible to natural disasters. Although many preparations are made against natural disasters in urban life, it is evident that adequate measures are not taken against secondary disasters. One of the most destructive and frequent secondary disasters is fires after earthquakes. In this study, an early fire detection system is proposed in order to minimize the losses caused by fires in the potentially chaotic environment that may occur after earthquakes in cities. This system consists of a structure that detects fire with convolutional neural network (CNN) based You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, determines the geolocation of the fire with stereo vision/epipolar geometry and provides information to the disaster management center via wireless sensor network (WSN). Experimental test findings conducted in İstanbul verify that the proposed system would be useful for post-earthquake fire detection with low cost, high reliability and high accuracy.}

Given the scarcity of a historically informed understanding of a smart city in the existing literatures on smart urbanism, this paper argues that a genealogical method helps us to counter the sweeping binarism that obscures the complexity and diversity of actually existing smart cities today. Through genealogy, this study underscores the multifaceted nature of the smart city, which consists of a combination of multiple urban diagrams that grows out of distinct problems and objectives of urban management – mobility, security, environment, and futurity. This paper illustrates how a smart city emerged out of multiple strings of history and problematizations that are contingently interweaved at a given time and space in multiple and diffused forms.}

Most real-time applications prefer it for its benefits, including lower operating prices and reduced network delay, and enhanced security. Resource allocation (RA) and planning are difficult tasks because of the heterogeneity of fog devices. A MA (MA) algorithm named the crow search algorithm (CSA) is used in the current study to meet RA and planning in fog computing environments. The suggested model focuses on 2 purposes: the achievement rate and the security hit rate. It is essential to maximize both purposes. A local search layout has been used for enhancing the efficiency of the CSA. RA and planning in fog environments are solved using the metaheuristic method. Based on the digital twin model simulations, the efficiency of the developed algorithm is compared to the current methods and demonstrates that the developed algorithms achieve the outlined purposes more efficiently.}

abstract = {Population growth and industrialization lead to a proportionate increase in cities' daily waste generation rates. Communities in developing cities often turn to waste disposal methods that have proven destructive to human health and the environment. Further, the disposal of waste is not treated and utilized for waste-to-energy (WtE)-based energy generation. To overcome this situation, many researchers proposed various solutions. However, the optimal utilization of this waste for power generation still needs to be solved. The proposed work discusses a self-powered garbage management system using a Convolution Neural Network and IOT for households in smart cities. The proposed system collects household wastes and segregates them into organic and inorganic wastes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The inorganic waste is sent to the recycling bin, and the organic waste is used for power generation. The residue of the organic waste after power generation is utilized as fertilizer for plants. The proposed system comprises five modules: a garbage collector, a segregation unit, a power generator unit, an inorganic waste collection bin with IoT-enabled sensors, and an electronic control unit. The garbage collector unit collects household waste. The CNN-based waste classifier in the segregator unit separates the waste into organic and inorganic, and the organic waste is sent to the power generation unit. The waste is grinded using a combustion unit in the power generator, producing biogas for electric power generation. The system is fully automatic, and a Raspberry Pi controller controls the complete process with the help of sensors and various motors. The system monitors the inorganic waste collection bin level using sensors. It sends a notification to the municipality's Garbage Collection Van operator using the IoT module once the bin is full and can be sent for recycling. The accuracy of the proposed CNN for waste segregation is 98%. While comparing with other pre-trained CNN models, such as InceptionV3 and Inception ResNet, the proposed method produces satisfactory results with 14% and 12% accuracy gains, respectively. The segregated and decomposed 50 kg of organic waste can produce 6 m3 of biogas which in turn can produce 114 MJ of electric energy, which can be utilized for street lights and also for the proposed smart self-power generating garbage management system to function. The proposed system is highly adaptable in smart cities for household municipal waste management with minimum routine monitoring and operational time requirements. Further, the system generates only a fraction of the required energy.}

abstract = {To address various urban issues such as fine dust, traffic congestion, and water shortage caused by rapid urbanization, a national pilot Smart City is planned in two Korean cities, Sejong and Busan. As weather data is crucial for improving the environment and operating future transportation while constructing a smart city, preparing for future weather disasters by analyzing the characteristics of various meteorological phenomena in the planned development area is necessary. This study analyzed the fog generation characteristics for the period of 2016–2020 at the automatic weather system sites of the Korea Meteorological Administration in Sejong and Busan, and the characteristics of the meteorological elements during fog were investigated. Additionally, three machine learning based models, including Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Network DNN-1 and DNN-2, were constructed for estimating visibility using meteorological input variables. In Sejong, approximately 50 fog days were observed annually for the analysis period, with the highest frequency of these days being during autumn. The fog hours were distributed from nighttime to before sunrise and 94.3% of the fog occurred when the wind speed was less than 1.5 m/s, showing the characteristics of radiative fog. Most of the fog occurred during summer in Busan, and the maximum number of fog days was observed in July. The average wind speed during fog was approximately 2.5 m/s, which was relatively large, suggesting that advection fog was likely to occur. As a result of estimating visibility from the ML-based models, the RF model had the highest R2 (0.66 and 0.53) in both regions, but the visibility estimated from the RF model had an over- and under-estimation for short and long visibility ranges, respectively. DNN-1 and DNN-2 models have lower biases. In the detection of fog-possible weather based on the estimated visibility from the models, the best precisions (0.85 and 0.84) and F1-scores (0.76 and 0.74) were from the RF model, but model recall was better in the DNN-1 model. The model recalls for the detection of the thick and dense fog were also better in the DNN models. ML-based models presented reasonable performance but revealed their weaknesses and strengths depending on performance indicators.}

The study produced five key results. (1) SCP can significantly promote urban GTFP in China, and a series of robustness checks verified the validity of this finding. (2) There was a positive spatial spillover effect of SCP on GTFP in neighboring non-pilot cities, while the spillover effect on the neighboring pilot cities was poor. (3) There was heterogeneity among Chinese cities, with the promotional effect of SCP on GTFP being more significant in eastern cities, super cities, non-resource-based cities, and cities with high levels of human capital, financial development, and information and communication infrastructure construction. (4) The regression results of a mediating effect model showed that SCP can promote GTFP through technological innovation, upgrading the industrial structure, and resource allocation optimization. (5) Smart city policy improved urban GTFP mainly by improving technical efficiency rather than technological progress. These conclusions are of great theoretical and practical significance for the Chinese government, and can be used to transform the extensive urban development mode and achieve high-quality development.}

Management of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure for such dynamic environment at scale brings about new challenges. Existing fog layer resource management involves context-sharing and migration for real-time vertical and cross-vertical services. However, improper context migration might affect performance negatively. In this paper, the authors have envisioned improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of smart transportation while employing context-aware computing and Artificial Intelligence, which helps alleviate massive data transfers among Fog nodes and intelligent vehicles in real-time. The proposed Context-Aware Intelligent Transportation System (CAITS) manages the services of intelligent vehicles and manages the road traffic of traditional vehicles in an effective manner, with a three-layered learning model that accounts for on-vehicle, on-co-vehicle, and on-fog-and-vehicle learning by means of a platoon control algorithm as well as federated learning at the Fog level. Simulations are carried out on CloudSim simulator under different scenarios and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves prediction efficacy of contexts at the Fog layer by approximately 8%–24% than existing models which in turn reflects in reduced service time and energy consumption of EVs and reduces the CO2 of environment.}

abstract = {To address the aftermath of ever more frequent natural disasters striking highly-populated urban areas, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations increasingly involve the coordinated efforts of multiple agencies and in particular Civil–Military Cooperation (CIMIC). In such scenarios, rescuers operate in a disrupted environment, must maintain a high operational tempo, and need to quickly make high-impact decisions. Effectively supporting emergency responders through IT services that implement accurate situation awareness presents a formidable set of challenges, including the discovery and integration of surviving IT assets with purposely deployed ones; effective information prioritization; resilient communications; and secure information sharing. We believe that in the highly digital modern urban environment, often referred to as smart cities, these challenges can be effectively addressed only by integrating by design HADR support into the smart city middleware. This paper presents Aceso — a proof-of-concept smart city middleware that provides location- and context-sensitive services with full support for HADR operations. Aceso provides a set of functions, ranging from resource discovery to secure information sharing, that can be quickly activated in case of unpredictable and adverse events to facilitate HADR operations. Furthermore, Aceso leverages the Value-of-Information (VoI) methodology to handle the processing and dissemination of mission-critical information. To validate the capabilities of Aceso, we devised a fictional HADR scenario, set in the city of Helsinki, Finland, that involves the collaboration of multiple responder teams with different roles. The validation results confirm Aceso’s usefulness in prioritizing the processing and dispatching of critical information and in realizing federation-wide sharing of this information among HADR teams.}

These applications include healthcare monitoring, resource utilization, city resource management, and various public services. Internet of Things (IoT) enables smart city applications to collect data from various sensors and process it for providing numerous smart services to the end-users with improved performance. The diverse nature of IoT network requires the use of multiple types of sensors which produce a huge amount of data. This data is highly vulnerable to multiple service-oriented attacks; therefore, it must be protected during the communication of IoT nodes. This research work has focused on the identification and detection of malicious nodes causing service-oriented attacks in smart city applications and networks. The direct experience of communicating nodes and recommendations from neighboring nodes are collected to formulate a total trust score. The adaptive weights assigned to direct observations and indirect recommendations ensure the effectiveness of the Context-Based Trust Evaluation System Model (CTES) in detecting On–Off attacks. Moreover, context similarity measure calculations filter out those bad nodes which are posing a Sybil Attack. The proposed CTES has also been simulated on Contiki Cooja. The results also validate the effectiveness of CTES in detecting the bad behavior of malicious nodes.}

Hence, the need to plan and develop smart cities based solutions for enhanced urban governance is becoming more evident. These solutions are motivated by innovations in Information and Communication Technology to support smart planning for the city and to facilitate enhanced services to its citizens. Important areas where smart city services can be offered include urban planning, transport planning, energy conservation, water management, waste management, environmental monitoring, public safety, healthcare, education, entertainment, and many other services. Hence, the enormous data collected from different networks and applications to facilitate the offering of smart city services requires efficient data scheduling, aggregation, and processing to ensure service quality (QoS). However, existing data scheduling approaches consider scheduling and processing data only in the cloud, while processing also in the data collecting devices is significantly essential. This paper first introduces the multi-layer network architecture comprising sensor/device networks and cloud. The paper then introduces a Multi-layer, Priority-based, Dynamic, and Time-sensitive data processing and Scheduling approach (MPDTS) in the proposed multi-layer networks. Simulation results show that the proposed MPDTS approach achieves lower latency and data processing time than existing traditional data scheduling approaches that work only in the cloud layer.}

One of the areas targeted by the smart cities concept is mobility. Reducing CO2 emissions in urban agglomerations is among the basic goals that cities set as part of improving the quality of life. This is where transport has a significant impact on the environment. This article emphasizes the importance of integrating railway stations into the smart city concept. Railway stations, their location, and the availability of other modes of transport are among the key elements in the use of rail transport. It follows from this fact that the smart city concept should also include rail transport if this mode of transport is available in the given city.}

In this context, smart city infrastructure plays an important role in enabling new ways of measuring, experiencing and engaging with local and temporal dynamics of urban systems.

Smart City is a heterogeneous system consisting of a large IoT-based network, offering various applications for citizens by collecting and analyzing real-time information. As intelligent, efficient digital systems, smart cities manage data by digitalizing all information. Despite the potential benefits of smart cities for citizen convenience, this digital information service can give rise to security and privacy issues. In particular, the challenge of relying on the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is that it is difficult for individuals to manage large amounts of data in smart city environments. In this paper, we study blockchain and Secret Sharing to address personal information protection issues in external cloud services and improve data integrity and security by designing a distributed system. CSPs are connected in a blockchain to validate user data integrity and provide easy data access through Transaction. CSP uses the blockchain to store distributed users' information safely through the Secret Sharing algorithm as a distributed system with improved security of existing centralized systems. The proposed approach demonstrates improved security and privacy through security analysis and has faster transaction speed and data storage efficiency than existing research.}

On the one hand, although the low-entropy fossil energies are constantly transformed into high-entropy energies and consumed through various batteries, the large-scale combustion inevitably brings a huge carbon footprint and severe climate changes. On the other hand, mechanical energies are widely distributed in the urban environment in types of vibrations and rotations, and natural areas in types of water waves, rainfalls, and winds. With the development of mechanical energy harvesting technologies like triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc., various mechanical energy harvesters with optimized structures and selected materials, including triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), electromagnetic generator (EMG), etc., have been demonstrated for efficiently extracting electric power from ubiquitous existed mechanical energy sources like wind, water waves/flows, raindrops, vibrations, human motions, organs, and so on. With a comprehensive review of energy harvesting-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications among smart environmental monitoring (wind, ocean, and agriculture), smart transportations (drivers, vehicles, ships, roads, and bridges), smart homes (windows, floors, accessories, and human-machine interfaces), smart healthcare (wearable/portable devices, and implantable devices), the concept of smart cities are being promoted to conform with requirements of carbon neutrality and environment-friendly. Moreover, by combining developed self-powered sensor nodes, self-sustainable wireless sensor nodes, and self-charging energy storage units, the concept of IoT will be reinforced by increasing 5G endpoints and accelerates digitalization in smart cities.}

This attack allows adversaries to bypass detection methods, manipulate outcomes, and jeopardize secure grid operation. This study explores FDIA identification in smart grids, focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for detection. The objective is to assess the proposed detection methodology through simulation experiments on the IEEE standard test scheme, validating practicality under diverse sustainable energy conditions. This study undertakes a focused exploration into the realm of identifying FDIAs within smart grids, centering on the utilization of Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) as a machine learning approach for detection. The objective is to assess the efficacy of the proposed detection methodology through rigorous imitation experiments conducted on the IEEE standard test scheme. Various contrasting scenarios are meticulously designed to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the detection model under diverse conditions. In the intricate landscape of Fault Detection, Isolation, and Diagnosis in smart grids, the imperative is to recognize and comprehend abnormal conditions or faults within the grid's operational framework. A robust strategy poised to detect FDIAs in Smart Grids involves the strategic implementation of an advanced digital twin known as the “Cyber-Physical Digital Twin for Smart Grid Security.” This digital twin is meticulously engineered to emulate the intricate dynamics of the Smart Grid, seamlessly integrating both its physical and cyber elements.}

Concerning the landfill scenario, it is a challenge for a human to monitor the air quality continuously due to the emission of stinky smells and gases from the landfill sites. In this study, we implement a UAV network based on IoT (Internet of Things) and a cloud server for the smart city for tracking the air quality of the landfill sites in real-time and alerting the UAV for capturing the visuals from the camera for detecting the exact cause of the pollutant in the landfill sites. The gas that causes the most air pollution is Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ozone, dioxins and furans, etc. In this paper, continuous monitoring of these harmful gases is done to alert the people to protect them from harm. The study is also carrying the discussion about the industry 5.0 perspectives using UAV long-range communication. The objective of this study is to record the sensory data and visuals of the various gases (NO2, VOC, CO2, SO2) of landfill sites using IoT & UAV and then visualized in a graphical user interface form. The concentration of each gas that is stored in the cloud server is presented in the graphical representation. Different parameters such as Eigenvalues, Correlation Coefficients, and Regression Parameter have also been analysed graphically for the recorded data. The visuals captured from the UAV camera are employed for estimating the cause of the rise in pollutants in landfill sites.}

A complex event is inferred from patterns of different individual primitive events according to their spatio-temporal information. Complex event processing (CEP) systems facilitate applications to define their reasoning rules based on event processing languages (EPL), similar to SQL. However, current languages and CEP engines do not efficiently support spatial data characteristics. Geospatial CEP is challenging since applications have diverse definitions for complex events (e.g., air quality index), IoT devices have heterogeneous specifications/capabilities, and complex events may happen concurrently. This paper proposes the Geo-Tesla language that enables smart city applications to define spatial attributes in complex event definitions and reasoning rules. Then, we devise the GeoT-Rex CEP engine that implements geospatial operations that compiles Geo-Tesla language and processes the spatial data. The integration of Geo-Tesla and GeoT-Rex enables applications to process complex events with spatial characteristics in their reasoning rules and identify boundaries of the detected complex event (event footprint). The evaluation results from the proof of concept implementation show that our proposed solution outperforms in identifying the footprint of complex events up to 44% in the largest network size. They also show that the detection percentage in the concurrent appearance of complex events is 40% more on average than a close state-of-the-art baseline.}

abstract = {Crowd counting targets for determining the number of pedestrians in an image, which is of crucial importance for smart city construction. The problem of scale variation is an ingrained and drastic challenge in crowd counting, and it severely degrades the performance of counting. To address this problem, many powerful models with complex network structures and tricks are built, but the constrained resources of embedded systems prevent the direct deployment of these models into an edge device. Thus, it is on high demand to design favourable lightweight models that require fewer parameters and a fast inference speed, while maintaining competitive counting performance. To this aim, we devise a lightweight network, termed as Ghost Attention Pyramid Network (GAPNet). Specifically, a lightweight GhostNet is adopted as the backbone to encode low-level features. Subsequently, a zero-parameter channel attention module is designed to select the discriminative crowd region efficiently. In addition, an efficient pyramid fusion module is built with a four-branch architecture to obtain multiscale hierarchy representations while reducing the parameters. Finally, a decoder generates the prediction by exploiting a series of transposed convolution blocks. Extensive experiments on crowd counting benchmarks have proved the superiority of the GAPNet in both accuracy and efficiency.}

First, topic modeling and network analysis are conducted using patent text data and international patent classification code, respectively. Patents are classified and defined based on the technology theme and the type of technology provider. Second, hardware-oriented and service application-oriented technologies are classified and predicted using machine learning. Third, the similarities in growth patterns of different technology groups are explored using dynamic time warping (DTW). Moreover, lagging or preceding relationships are examined using multivariate time series analysis. Network infrastructure and Internet-of-things (IoT) application technologies have short-term lagging and preceding relationships along with long-term equilibrium relationships. In terms of player groups, long-term relationships between device vendors, chipset makers, network operator and IoT service provider, and network equipment vendors are confirmed. Technologies for realizing a sustainable city must be prioritized, and the strategic direction of technology must be established to realize truly smart sustainable cities. The supplier of technologies along with possible collaboration opportunities must also be selected. This study proposes the role and direction of technology for SSC and presents a comprehensive methodology for analyzing technology using patents.}

As recent research has argued, the spatial, material, and political contexts of cities have major influence over what smart urbanism looks like in practice. This paper adds analytical depth to, and broadens the geographical scope of, research on the variegated modes of making smart cities. Based on empirical research in multiple Australian cities we use three case studies to explore three different modes of smart urbanism, each one centred on the interests of a different key actor: corporate-centric, citizen-centric, and planner-centric. These different modes can, and do, co-exist in the same city. At times, they are competing logics that fight to pull the city in different directions. Yet, they can also work together to shape smart city initiatives. In describing these different modes, we pay particular attention to the ways that these projects and strategies must contend with the already existing spatial, cultural, and political contexts of each place.}

Since information technologies are considered a key competitive element of a city's destination, tourism companies invest extensively in smart system initiatives. Moreover, the smart city concept and related approaches are increasingly recognized by cities worldwide to optimize sustainable environments. Furthermore, a smart tourist city faces the challenge of creating urban areas that residents and tourists can experience together, particularly in cities that pose new tourism challenges. This paper proposes the Data-Driven Sustainable Smart City Framework (DDSSCF) for sustainable green tourism strategies and policies. This paper explores the aspects of technologies essential for creating a smart city and a fashionable tourism destination. The preservation of the climate, protected cultural heritage, and natural resources would contribute to an environment, the economic, social sustainable field of tourism by reducing hazardous pollutants and energy usage. Therefore, based on the preservation limit, it has been classified into three components includes-green architecture, green waste, and green energy as a part of the green management framework at the same time. Hence, green tourism, including marketing efforts, such as green marketing, are necessary for the vision of successful adequate green management activities. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances efficiency ratio when compared to other existing methods.}

Providing reliable interaction between the smart devices and maintaining the battery sustainability of smart devices are the major demand since most of the IoT devices are run by a battery source. Device sustainability is the prime concern in most the IoT applications such as smart cities, e-health, smart grid, etc. Thus, we have come up with a cross layer design that improves the device sustainability and lifetime of the IoT networks in smart cities. In the proposed design, physical layer and data link layer information is utilized by the network layer to explore the energy efficient communication among the IoT devices, since 70% - 80% of device energy is utilized for its communication. Cross-layer design can be an optimal solution to enhance the modalities of the wireless network. The Weighted sum approach is used in the proposed model which is an effective computation method to analyze and identify the routing metrics that are associated with energy efficiency. Based on the routing metric analysis (Table 2) it is found that a particular combination of routing metrics performs effective power utilization (by attaining optimal transmission power) and achieves sustained device lifetime. From the obtained results, it is noticed that the MTPM + ETP + ND routing metric combination outperforms all the other combinations, and designing the cross-layer mechanism with the weighted sum approach computation gives better network performance without compromising the device lifetime. In smart cities applications, the device scalability is huge, since frequent battery replacement is a very difficult task. Therefore, we come up with an efficient network model that is more suitable to maintain device sustainability in smart cities.}

This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category. Finally, some of the best practices for attaining sustainable smart cities are provided.}

Smart City is one of its applications which aims to manage cities automatically. Because of the large number of devices, three critical challenges come up: heterogeneity, privacy-preserving of generated data, and providing high-level services. The existing solutions cannot even solve two of the mentioned challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a three-module framework, named “Ontology-Based Privacy-Preserving” (OBPP) to address these issues. The first module includes an ontology, a data storage model, to address the heterogeneity issue while keeping the privacy information of IoT devices. The second one contains semantic reasoning rules to find abnormal patterns while addressing the quality of provided services. The third module provides a privacy rules manager to address the privacy-preserving challenges of IoT devices achieved by dynamically changing privacy behaviors of the devices. Extensive simulations on a synthetic smart city dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the existing solutions while providing affordability and robustness against information leakages. Thus, it can be widely applied to smart cities.}

The solution uses a collaborative technique between distributed edge servers and privacy mediator nodes with the support of an intrusion detection system to enhance the availability, reliability and security of smart city applications. Simulation results show a reduction in the delay per service request by 39.2% for highly dense environments, and up to 62.6% for lightly dense environments.

This study establishes a mathematical model for determining the relationship between the CCT of LED light sources and the time of day.

This system can be used in indoor locations such as commercial settings, educational environments, health care facilities, and so on, especially places where due to the long-term presence of people, the effects of artificial lighting on the performance and efficiency of inhabitants are significant.

When electricity prices decline, customers tend to consume more electrical energy. Conversely, with the increase in prices, there is a tendency to use less electricity. Also, lighting levels are another important factor in determining the energy consumption and associated costs of light-emitting diodes. By using the proposed system, lighting levels are adjusted as a percentage of the nominal light output of LEDs. The advantage of this method is controlling the energy cost based upon the simultaneous effects of electricity prices and the desired lighting levels. Therefore, unlike conventional lighting control systems that focus only on controlling the lighting levels, the introduced method provides a more effective control solution. The accuracy of this technique is supported by the results of system simulation and implementation.

HypeAIR is a novel open-source framework for the management of sensor calibration in real-time. It incorporates two calibration methodologies: a combination of machine learning models (Voting Regressor and Support Vector Regression) and the Long Short-Term Memory deep learning model. To evaluate the framework, three extensive experiments were conducted over a 2-year period in the city of Modena, Italy, to monitor NO, NO2, and O3 gases. Both calibration methodologies outperform the manufacturer calibration and our baseline (i.e., a variation of the Random Forest algorithm) and maintain efficiency over time.

How to deploy VNF instances and route data packets for IoT services in the MEC has been considered as a nontrivial problem. The problem becomes more complicated when taking Quality of Service (QoS) into consideration. In this paper, we study the VNF placement and service chaining problems while considering multi-attribute-based QoS in smart cities. We first formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and utilize randomized rounding technique to calculate a solution to the problem. Considering IoT services have different QoS requirements, we design an unsplittable flow based heuristic algorithm to deploy computing resource for each type of IoT service.

abstract = {With the immense increase of population density, many challenges facing organizations and governments. Thus, it has become mandatory to turn up our cities to be intelligent by introducing IoT and smart grids to build smart buildings, smart communication technologies, smart healthcare systems, smart transportation, etc. Smart cities guarantee the healthy living of indoor inhabitants by sensing, processing and controlling all possible indoor–outdoor measures. In this paper, we develop a framework that systematically builds a reliable and secure Smart City Model (SCM) to be integrated then exploited by the building information model (BIM). SCM encloses both physical and digital models which highlight smart buildings in particular. First, the proposed solution identifies and models SCM components including their appropriate architectures that are responsible for communication, extension, information flow, and protection. To ensure SCM functional and security requirements, we develop a sound hybrid approach that relies on formal methods and network analysis. Uppaal model checker is used to verify the satisfiability of the smart city requirements whereas Cooja is deployed to simulate the connectivity and the communication coverage of the developed SCM. The obtained results, in Uppaal, showed that the different implemented scenarios are satisfying the functional correctness and security policies. Moreover, the simulation through Cooja showed that how different obstacles and positions of nodes affect the communication coverage and the energy consumption regarding the deployed nodes. Experimentally, the effectiveness of the developed framework has been shown through practical scenarios that are difficult to model and analyze.}

Big data have a direct influence on transportation capacity in future cities. There has been a significant increase in urbanization over the last decade in which one in three people will live in an urban area by 2050. An updated transportation infrastructure is essential to keep up with the present flow of goods, while also limiting its impact on the environment and human health and this is likely to be achieved using big data analytics technique. To overcome this problem, smart cities are becoming more popular. With the use of information and communication technology (ICT), a smart city aims to address public concerns in an inclusive, municipally-based partnership. A big data transportations system may be built using the superstructure of a smart city. A good way to define it is the modeling and analysis of urban transportation and distribution networks using enormous data sets created by GPS, mobile phones, and transactional data from company activities. Big Data analytics may be used in public transportation to better understand how people go about the city. A better understanding of passengers’ travel patterns might help transportation providers make better judgments regarding service quality. People who travel by automobile on a regular basis may now be predicted based on the triangulation of mobile phone data from millions of anonymous users. Local and national polls may demonstrate the paradigm’s applicability. To compute the time it takes for passengers to board and exit trains, Metro and iBus vehicle position data may be combined with information from smart cards. Big Data analytics for traffic management may benefit from these findings.}

Wireless power transfer technology is well-known for its dependability, security, and adaptability, and has reached billions of market share in China alone in the cell phone and electric vehicle sectors over the past decade, with the electric vehicle wireless charging market expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 30% by 2023. Combining WPT with renewable energy, electric vehicles, and recharge infrastructure is a promising new application for smart city development. This paper examines the history, characteristics, and six classifications of WPT technology through the lens of urban development, in addition to its successful implementations in seven contexts, such as portable devices and transportation, based on a survey of 161,425 papers. We propose a dependable and efficient research-to-application life cycle for high-power WPT operations, which is capable of achieving efficiencies of approximately 90 percent at approximately 50 percent of the original cost. In addition, the significance of incorporating WPT technology, renewable energy sources, and urban infrastructure into the design of sustainable cities is highlighted. This study determined that WPT is advantageous for promoting the construction of space and ground photovoltaic plants, as well as photovoltaic rooftops, and also serves to accelerate the promotion of electric vehicles, smart devices, and charging roads. The findings of this study cast light on three problem areas and six future prospects of WPT, as well as its multifaceted benefits in terms of energy, the environment, and the social economy of sustainable cities.}

The programmable network SDN centrally manages different smart devices connected in the networks. These smart devices are facilitated by Internet of Things (IoT) and collect real time data for network devices. One of the emerging applications of IoT network is Smart City which purpose is to manage the city without human interventions. The rapid growths of IoT devices like actuators and sensors in smart city are generating large amount of data and increasing the traffic in network. To maintain the quality of services (QoS) of smart city IoT networks, the SDN characteristic is one way to provide better services to network users. Traditional IoT network having the challenges like, access delays, security and reliability issues. The SDN enabled IoT networks are capable to overcome these challenges and improves the network performance. One single controller is not sufficient to manage all IoT devices in smart city networks. So, multiple controllers are required to handle Software Defined-IoT Networks (SDN-IoT). Different metaheuristic algorithms are implemented to overcome controller placements problems (CPP) but as the number of controllers increases the performance of approaches degrades due to premature conversions. To better balance the exploration and exploitation features an intelligent Hybrid Differential Evolution and Whale Optimization (DEWO) Algorithm is proposed that optimizes the controller placements in SDN-IoT enabled smart city networks. The algorithm searches the optimal locations of controllers and balance the switch loads in respect of minimum latency. The algorithm also minimizes the link failure and evaluate the minimum end to end delay. The proposed hybrid algorithm is evaluated up to 40 controllers with other state of art method and able to achieve better results in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms.}

First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME.}

However, for cities to be truly “smart”, they should be evaluated, and, to that end, determinants that facilitate their creation need to be identified. This study thus sought to combine cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach to find which factors foster smart city success, as well as the cause-and-effect relationships among these determinants. In two groupwork sessions, a panel of experts identified a wide range of smart city determinants and analyzed the dynamics of their relationships.

The pitfalls of Smart Cities concerning its propensity towards techno-centric and efficiency-focused governance are identified, with diminutive emphasis on social equity and human-centric urban growth. Thus, the paper elaborates upon an alternative mode of person-environment-interaction based approach towards placemaking: Empathic Cities. This approach implies embracing a shift from efficiency to sufficiency and wellbeing embedded regenerative perspective for conceiving the built environment. First, the variable dimensions of urban growth and governance, which gave rise to the smart city, are contextualized. The embedded neoliberal operational agenda of smart cities are established. On this basis, the underpinnings of an empathic city are established by acknowledging the shift from techno-centric to human-centric and from product-based to context-based smart city and wellbeing perspectives. Strategies toward urban development are proposed, such as embracing a regenerative perspective wherein the city and its constituents need to be understood as interdependent systemic elements while embracing a human-centric and ethical approach. Additionally, a transition from efficiency to sufficiency-oriented practices and a shift towards inclusive modes of participatory governance are proposed as fundamental principles for an empathic future of the built environment.}

Consequently, today's cities require integrated policies and new innovative ways to manage and improve the complexity of urban living conditions. The growing volume and variety of data produced in the urban ecosystem are crucial for obtaining the city's insights and building knowledge-based solutions for a smarter and more sustainable urban development. In this paper, we look at the open data impacts on these complex ecosystems and its crucial enabler role for the generation and analysis of contextual and actionable data aimed at understanding, managing, and planning the city. Despite the importance of open data, the literature is scarce in systematic and structured research that evaluates its impacts on the smart city context.

Smart cities collect data from various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and manage the resources and provide service to the public. Emergency Vehicle Priority/Pre-emption (EVP) is one of the major IoT components in smart cities which saves many lives by giving right of way green signal to the Emergency Vehicles (EVs) such as ambulances and fire engines. The existing EVP system gives green signal to the EVs immediate by stopping the conflicting movements. The sudden stoppage of normal traffic as well as the sequence change generates confusion to the road users and drivers. This needs an optimal control strategy which gives green signal to EVs as well as it should not affect the normal traffic flow. This paper proposes an optimal control strategy for EVP using edge computing and IoT sensor for smart cities. The experiment was conducted using a GPS based IoT sensor which keeps on sending the Location Information (LI) to the edge server. The edge server computes the optimum timings based on the proposed control strategy algorithm and clears the emergency vehicles. Waiting time of other road vehicles before and after implementing the system have been studied at a traffic junction at Thiruvananthapuram, India. The comparison result shows that the average waiting time of vehicles on the other road is reduced by 73.23% in the proposed system when compared with the existing system. Since, edge computing has been deployed the latency in communication has been reduced less than 100 ms. So, the proposed solution reduces the waiting time of other road vehicles and reduces the latency in communication simultaneously.}

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has enabled transforming urban areas into smart cities. Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.}

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates an inherent link between the previously independent transport and power sectors. This is especially relevant in the smart cities paradigm, which focuses on optimizing resource management using modern software tools and communication infrastructures. The optimal management of energy resources is of key importance, and with mobile EVs playing a pivotal role in smart city power flows, the coordination of energy management systems (EMSs) at their parking locations can bear global benefits. In this study the coordination between home energy management systems (HEMSs) and EV parking lot management systems (PLEMS) is proposed, modeled, and simulated, as a new contribution to earlier studies. The EMSs coordinate through partially sharing individual EV schedules and without sharing private information. Missing information is completed through public cloud repositories and services. The HEMS and PLEMS are implemented using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The proposed coordination framework is computationally implemented and simulated based on a real-life case study. The results show that the proposed EMS coordination framework is both technically beneficial for power grids and economically beneficial for EV owners.}

abstract = {Serious challenges such as rapid growth in population, environmental pollution, and possibility of energy shortage have motivated researchers for designing optimal energy operation strategies through the concept of smart city. Buildings and electric transport systems, especially subway systems and Plug in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), are among the major energy consumption systems in a smart city. In this paper, a linear model is proposed for the co-optimization planning and operation of distributed energy resources and transportation systems in an interconnected system that analyzes the interactions of such an interconnected system. The idea of Regenerative Breaking Energy (RBE) is deployed to improve the operation of the subway system through the interconnected subway system in the smart city. For the optimal operation of the smart city, an optimization formulation is devised to minimize the total cost of the city in the presence of subway RBE. In this paper, the traffic and length of the routes are modeled considering Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Subway (V2S) located in the parking lots. Furthermore, the degradation model is developed to increase the PEVs’ battery life. An unscented transformation (UT) approach is utilized to construct a stochastic framework based on the uncertainty method, to handle the uncertain behaviors of PEVs and distributed energy resource and loads in the smart city. Finally, the proposed model is implemented and its performance is analyzed in both the stochastic and deterministic frameworks.}

After 2 weeks of its impact, this study conducted a household survey in the central part of Bhubaneswar city (comprising of different wards), where smart-city projects were implemented and ongoing. Survey questions categorized into Social & Human, Financial, Physical, and Smart-city factors and their corresponding indicators were chosen through literature review and some modified based on local conditions. A total of 22 vulnerability and 40 capacity indicators were used to calculate the vulnerability and capacity index. The result indicates that overall capacity overweighs the overall vulnerability in the central part of the city during the Fani cyclone. Specifically, the city was more vulnerable based on Financial factors, whereas more capable and smartly prepared for the cyclone in the context of Social & Human factors, Physical factors, and Smart-city factors. The study indicates the mitigating impact of the smart-city project in the central Bhubaneswar city area and applauds the step taken by the government for preparation during such an extreme event.

This study proposes an energy management platform based on an intelligent probabilistic wavelet petri neuro-fuzzy inference algorithm (IPWPNFIA) to control the V/F index in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs) and battery energy storage system (BESS) facing with various uncertainties. The suggested approach is programmed at two central and local controller stages based on the communication system and time-of-use demand response programs execution. The suggested approach is modeled by considering asymmetric membership functions based on the BESS optimal participation to control uncertainties caused by RESs, plug-and-play operations, and load fluctuations. The proposed platform's performance is verified and compared in different scenarios with different methods. The experimental setup and results are based on the rapid control prototyping of the micro-grid platform, MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB software, and hardware infrastructure such as the OPAL-RT (OP5600/OP8660) System. The most important highlights of this research are: fast dynamic response, real-time control based on real data, reducing the calculation time and burden based on learning algorithms, and the suitable coordination to adjust the protection equipment pick-up time.}

Although, the majority of proposed solutions provide the optimal way to direct network traffic toward cloud storage. However, most of them are still needed to manage resources efficiently while handling huge amounts of data. Moreover, distributed IoT services must be intelligent and also be secure against malicious data access. This study introduces an autonomous approach using trusted sensing technologies to provide reliable remote sensing and aggregation for future-generation systems. In the first phase, the proposed model looks at an artificial intelligence-based method for negotiation between IoT devices and mobile stations for transferring the data. The second phase involves the creation of a robust security method that supports digital certificates for peer-to-peer mutual authentication. Additionally, to maintain the integrity of certificates, they are sent securely in the form of a chain. Finally, a combination of trust and privacy is used while storing data on cloud servers. Simulation-based experiments have shown that the proposed model significantly outperforms I-AREOR and MCNA in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, malicious threats, and overhead.}

This study identifies the priority areas of large Polish cities with regard to SC and the extent to which social infrastructure and human capital inform development objectives. Work involved content analysis of official documents and websites profiling SC strategies of six Polish cities (Warsaw, Cracow, Łódź, Wrocław, Poznań and Gdańsk) and their metropolitan areas. This was complemented by targeted interviews and seminars. Moreover, an exploratory study of Gdańsk and Gdynia was also carried out. Our evidence suggests that Polish experience with SC represents gradual processes of adaptation and emergent forms of urban politics that reflect tensions between new and more traditional forms of governance and economic, environmental and social goals.

Firstly, we consider the influence of item attributes on user scoring. Naive Bayesian classifier is used to score unrated items, which can effectively fill in the missing values in the score matrix and solve the problem of data sparsity. Secondly, to ensure sustainable recommendations for uncertain goals, the three-way decisions is introduced into the collaborative filtering recommendation system, three-way recommendation rules are formulated, and 3NBCFR is constructed. Finally, the model is applied to the movie recommendation system. The experiment on Movielens shows that compared with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, 3NBCFR algorithm reduces the recommendation cost and improves the recommendation quality. At the same time, it lays a foundation for promoting the construction of smart city.}

The smart services of cities like smart buildings, smart hospitals, smart traffic, smart factories, and smart transportation are vital to energizing resilient, reliable, seamless energy and electrical flow. One of these smart services' critical challenges is anticipated to run without disruptions using smart energy and smart electrical grids. Hence, in this research, the Internet of Things (IoT) role in green energy resources incorporation into smart electrical grids has been introduced using the Multi-Objective Distributed Dispatching algorithm (MODDA). Efficient energy management includes a tradeoff between the cost linked with utility function and energy consumption. The utility function can be the living comfort of the consumers or the utility firm's gross income. The interchanges between utility and energy consumption must, therefore, be recognized. The algorithm is intended to transmit the renewable green energy available to the battery, thermal, and load storing while preserving a thermal and battery storage limit. The experimental results at the lab-scale show the proposed dispatching algorithm minimizing the system cost and energy consumption. It is shown that substantial energy waste can be reduced by equipping a smart building with the proposed IoT system for effective green energy management.}
