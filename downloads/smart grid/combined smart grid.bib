 abstract = {National and local governments have made climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies a priority. New technologies have allowed cities to decrease their ecological footprint while maintaining economic operations. This chapter aims to conduct a typology analysis of smart city initiatives and identify implemented solutions to improve good governance and sustainable management of the transportation, water, and energy sectors. We developed a global database of 50 smart city projects and used descriptive analysis to describe them. We gathered information about the projects’ size, ownership, geographic focus, smart city solution type, dimension, and the relationship with climate change. The four key directions of smart transportation projects are promoting sustainable travel behavior, smart parking management, public transit development, and active and low-carbon transportation development. The four key directions of smart governance projects are promoting participation, public services, and openness. Some smart city initiatives use smart lighting, low-carbon building materials, and electric vehicles (EVs) to save energy. Finally, smart cities have prioritized water resource management, intelligently establishing initiatives to manage water supply systems, consumption, and wastewater disposal.},

 abstract = {Future smart cities will undoubtedly generate and process an immense volume of data. Developing a smart network infrastructure is thus becoming a key component for the better development and efficient governance of smart cities. The main objective of this article is to examine the feasibility of utilizing moving vehicles to develop an efficient Vehicular-based Virtual Network Infrastructure (VVNI) for smart cities. The basic idea here is to divide the whole city into distinct cells, then predict and evaluate the vehicle eligibility to act efficiently as a centralized communication and information hub for each cell. Specifically, we present the basic framework of the proposed VVNI, and identify the corresponding efficiency requirements in terms of service availability, cost, and quality; then we introduce novel metrics to characterize the vehicle's ability to cope with these requirements. Several simulation scenarios were conducted to assess the efficiency of the proposed VVNI. The simulation results demonstrate how the proposed model outperforms existing models and improves system performance in three benchmark areas: throughput, packet delivery ratio, and latency, especially in medium- and high-density network scenarios with slower vehicle velocities. The simulation results are promising to further enhance the development of the proposed network infrastructure.},

 abstract = {Global ecological requirements are pushing city actors to opt for ecological solutions at all levels, including urban mobility. More sustainable Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have become an indispensable part of the transport offer by world's major metropolis. Like any computerized service system, they generate voluminous and complex data that the use of which is essentially limited to the management and operation of the system. The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station. For this, we propose an approach that integrates in these systems both the new IoT for smart city technologies and machine learning in order to facilitate the task of management, availability and profitability. In addition, we propose an automatic management system capable of predicting the number of bikes shared per hour, day or month by taking several dynamic parameters. Simulation results carried out on real data from London's bike sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

 abstract = {Forecasting short-term residential energy consumption is critical in modern decentralized power systems. Deep learning-based prediction methods that can handle the high variability of residential electrical loads have made models more accurate. On the other hand, these methods need a lot of sensitive information about how much people use something gathered centrally to train a forecasting model. This is not good for privacy and scalability. Moreover, models may become less accurate over time due to changing conditions. In this work, we propose a framework for energy consumption forecasting that exploits adaptive learning, federated learning, and edge computing concepts. A central server aggregates numerous long short-term memory (LSTM) models that users at various locations train with their energy consumption data to create a generalized model that uses adaptive learning to detect data drifts and enhance forecasting at the edge layer. Our findings show that adaptive federated learning performs better than centralized learning while preserving privacy, reducing communication overhead, lowering the forecast error rate by 8%, and decreasing the training time by approximately 80%.},

The search and study for the alternative methods of UV localization is demand to the implementation of smart city concepts, because in real-world conditions the GPS signal may either be absent, or its accuracy may be insufficient to trajectory following and perform maneuvers. Control systems based on network models of local positioning partially solves the problem of a safety motion. The paper emphasizes three main categories of UV software systems providing correspondingly, collection and processing data, planning, and control, as well as an approach to the architecture of decision making for UV, based on networking and computational multilevel analytics.

Security is considered as one of the most important challenges facing IoT. Key distribution techniques are at the core of security provision and are critical components of any system in order to establish a secure connection between any two objects. In this paper a new Hierarchical Key Distribution (HKD) architecture and a set of Hierarchical Hybrid Key Distribution (H2KD) protocols are presented for IoT environment to support the provision of smart cities applications. The applicability of this protocols has been studied over HKD architecture and simulated using AVISPA tool and using Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic. The targeted features of designing the architecture and the protocols are supporting mobility, scalability, heterogeneity and supporting constrained nodes’ limited capabilities. The performance of H2KD set of protocols has been evaluated based on a quantitative measure of several performance metrics including the memory storage, the computation cost for the constraint nodes, the number of messages exchanged and needed to establish a new session key for a mobile node. Scalability and resilience of the proposed protocols have been also measured. Simulation results show that H2KD protocols are safe against various attacks. Moreover, the analysis results show that the H2KD reduces communication, computation, and the storage costs for constraint nodes by 51.5% compared with related protocols. Additionally, H2KD has been found to provide more scalability and resilience than rival protocols.},

The annual World Health Organization reports indicate that many people die from preventable diseases as a result of improper waste disposal and management. The provision of garbage bins is inadequate in the management of solid waste in smart cities. The major problem is that garbage bins fill up quickly, and it takes time for the municipal workers to empty the bins. This paper focuses on a real-time smart garbage bin mechanism for solid waste management in smart cities. Conventional garbage collection and management systems have many shortcomings, including inaccessibility to actual data required, lack of throughput, and late unloading. The mechanism proposed accesses real-time information of any smart garbage bin deployed across the city and helps to resolve the problem of waste overflow from garbage bins and keep the smart cities clean. Fuzzy logic is applied in the strategic deployment of smart garbage bins across the smart cities. The system is implemented on Net-logo which is widely used in multi-agent modelling environments. The significant advantage of the system is its novelty in real-time decision-making and real-time monitoring using the fuzzy logic process.},

 abstract = {As the world population grows rapidly, the global energy demand increases exponentially and the technological advancements require more resilient infrastructure than ever, there is a strong need to develop innovative energy systems in smart cities. This paper introduces a novel model to assess cities for their smartness. A smart city is characterized by assessing 8 main domains including economy, environment, society, governance, energy, infrastructure, transportation, and pandemic resiliency. Each domain is evaluated by assessing several key parameters that reflect the condition of that domain in any given city. All indicators are measurable and can be assessed, which gives this approach more credibility and accuracy. This model has been applied on 20 cities worldwide. Enhancing the smart energy index by 25 % results in doubling the smart economy index for all cities. Furthermore, enhancing the GDP per capita by 50 % results in modest increase in the smart economy index. Smart governance has a positive and linear relationship with smart economy with a p value of 0.004. Montreal has the highest Smart City Index of 0.8 while Abuja has the lowest of 0.3. Socioeconomic and energy domains are critical domains that must be improved to achieve higher Smart City Index scores and therefore resilient and smart cities.},

 abstract = {This study presents an innovative integrated approach for smart cities, aimed at promoting environmentally sustainable economies through novel technological and socio-economic transitions. The proposed model determines the smart city index (SCI) by aggregating 32 distinct performance indicators that significantly transform the environment, economy, energy, social, governance, and transportation sectors. This model is inherently multidisciplinary and is methodologically processed using multi-criteria decision analysis, which is aggregated using four distinct weighting schemes. The model results reveal that based on the equal weighting scheme, Sydney emerges as the city with the highest SCI score of 0.72, whereas Lima is identified as the city with the lowest SCI score of 0.26. On the other hand, based on the sustainability triad scheme, Toronto tops the list with an SCI score of 0.77, whereas Abuja scores the lowest with an SCI score of 0.31. Interestingly, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal continue to maintain their position among the top 5 cities across all three schemes: equal weighting, sustainability triad, and energy-focused schemes. Furthermore, the energy-focused scheme identifies Montreal as the top-performing city, scoring 0.7, followed by Oshawa at 0.67, and four Canadian cities top the SCI scores in this scheme. In contrast, Lima still remains at the bottom of the list with an SCI score of 0.27. Finally, based on a smart health-focused scheme, Sydney, Osaka, and Hämeenlinna rank highest in SCI scores. Overall, the proposed approach and model provide valuable insights and guidelines for policy-makers and urban planners to design and implement smart city initiatives that can significantly enhance sustainable development and improve quality of life in urban settings.},

This systematic review seeks to answer this question by offering a framework that elucidates the principles of placemaking in smart cities and the relationship between people and places. The results of reviewing the SciVal and SCImago databases yielded 13 journals related to ‘urban economy’—as a goal of smart cities—and ‘placemaking’—as a target of city singularity. A random selection of 44 articles in these journals was conducted based on the presence of words in titles, abstracts and keywords between 2012 and 2020. Four terms were revealed, namely, competitiveness, distinctiveness, urban forms and everyday lifestyles. The findings compiled 22 principles for creating singularity among smart cities. The three-step framework for creating the singularity of smart cities provides insights into how urban actors and stakeholders in the Global South can change traditional smart cities by aggregating the principles of placemaking (i.e. urban forms and everyday lifestyles) with the principles of the urban economy through urban competitiveness and distinctiveness. The conclusions suggested revisiting factors of ranking smart cities by considering the principles of placemaking, which can enhance the singularity of smart cities.},

As a component of the framework, a mobile application has been developed that enables users to check the availability of nearby parking spots and subsequently reserve a parking place. This paper also describes different use-cases of a person for finding a parking space and parking it in right place. The proposed system has been implemented using Raspberry Pi, NodeMCU, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Infrared (IR) sensors.

This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category.

In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions. We believe such rigorous analysis will provide a baseline for future research in the domain.},

 abstract = {Interest in smart green cities is growing, and IoT is an underlying driver of this trend. The integration of IoT in smart cities has altered the manner of working and living of society. IoT technologies do, however, come with a number of drawbacks, including vulnerability of highly secure devices, energy consumption, governance, etc. in smart cities. Governance in smart city is more citizen-center and the decisions of government are focused on citizens’ demands. Government can identify influential spreaders from this huge voluminous population and take requisite preventive steps such as delaying the spread of rumor, identifying the information source, or blocking the source node. Hence, security of highly vulnerable IoT device and governance are the two main issues of the IoT environment of smart green city. This paper proposes a framework for identifying influential spreaders who play a key role in the governance of smart city as well as determining vulnerable IoT devices that needs to be protected from malware attacks. A framework named as Modified Dynamic Weighted Sum Method, is proposed for determining influential devices and spreaders in smart green cities. The connectivity between devices is considered as a network, then, distinct centrality measures are considered as the multi-attribute of the network, so as to take advantage of each centrality measure. Experiments are conducted on Santender testbed and it was found that static devices play an important role in IoT environment. Hence, they need to be protected from malware attacks. From future perspective, opportunities and challenges in smart city applications are discussed.},

 abstract = {Achieving sustainability in cities relies on effective mobility management (MM) that serves current and future generations. It involves establishing an inclusive transportation system to address many issues, like traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond environmental concerns, robust mobility management has social and economic advantages, fostering improved access to vital services like healthcare, education, and employment. Software-defined networking (SDN) presents a viable solution for enhancing MM within networks. Unlike traditional setups, SDN merges MM through a programmable control plane, streamlining network configurations and enabling features like handover, load balancing, and quality of service (QoS). The utilization of SDN technology extends to various facets of sustainable city networks, encompassing areas like network security, performance optimization, big data processing, energy efficiency, emergency management, carbon emissions reduction, intelligent services, and MM in vehicular networks. Despite the advantages of SDN-based mobility management, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges and limitations posed by traditional MM methods that SDN aims to overcome. The paper explores SDN's potential in sustainable cities, focusing on how it can transform mobile device management, support various networking technologies, and evaluate the impact of SDN methods on existing MM systems, considering factors like scalability and compatibility. The paper asserts that SDN-based MM has substantial potential for promoting sustainable urban development. By centralizing control, adapting to changing conditions, and optimizing resource allocation, SDN can contribute to reduced energy consumption, lower carbon emissions, and more efficient urban mobility. It emphasizes the importance of addressing potential drawbacks to ensure successful implementation in sustainable cities.},

 abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) revolution has emerged as a promising network that enhanced information dissemination about the city's resources. This city's resources are wirelessly connected to different constrained devices (such as sensors, robotics, and actuators). However, the communication of this wireless information is threatened by several malicious attacks, cyber-attacks, and hackers. This is due to unsecured IIoT networks that were exposed as a potential back door entry point for the attacks. Consequently, this study aims to develop a security framework for the smart cities’ sustainability edge computing vulnerabilities using Petri Net and Genetic Algorithm-Based Reinforcement Learning (GARL). First, a common trust model for addressing information outflows in the network using a distributed authorization algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is implemented on a secure framework modeling in Petri Net called secure trust-aware philosopher privacy and authentication (STAPPA) for mitigation of the privacy breach in the networks. Genetic Algorithm-based Reinforcement Learning (GARL) is used to optimize the search, detect anomalies, and shortest route during the agent learning in the environment. The detection and accuracy rate results obtained over a secure framework using reinforcement learning are 98.75, 99, 99.50, 99.75, and 100% during simulation in the network environment. The average sensitivity of the detection rate is 1.000, while the average specificity outcome is 0.868. The result of the GARL simulation model obtained shows the best distance of 238.84 * 10−3 fitness when the search space is optimized by reducing the number of chromosomes to 10 in the model. These approaches help to detect anomalies and prevent unauthorized users from accessing edge computing components in the city architecture.},

The novel framework includes a technical analysis, an economic evaluation, and a public survey. Following the technical analysis, 21 streetlight units in a staggered pole arrangement are recommended to optimize illuminance levels for the minor arterial road as commonly found in cities like Laramie. Two energy source options are considered – a grid-only option and a hybrid option that utilizes solar power for lighting and grid electricity for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The economic and social aspects of this study reveal the need for public-private partnerships to fund smart street lighting projects in small cities. From a benefit-cost analysis standpoint, the grid-only option is currently more economically feasible; however, most residents prefer the hybrid system. Additional capabilities like EV charging, air quality monitoring, and weather sensing provide unique economic and social benefits for both residents and city authorities. This work provides a veritable framework that both private and public stakeholders can adopt for future implementation of smart street lighting projects in contemporary low-population towns and cities.},

The regression learning model used in this proposed method classifies the time and energy-dependent schedules for data queuing and transmission in a view to maximising throughput. Cost-based data transmission and energy harvesting approaches are the concurrent procedures used to identify the linear descent points through the regression method. This identification helps mitigate unnecessary energy dissemination and early energy drain of the IoT devices for their allocated/transmitted data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations, and it is verified using the metrics energy consumption, remaining energy ratio, energy harvested, cost factor, and throughput. The proposed method helps to minimise the energy consumption rate and maximise the throughput in an effective manner.},

 abstract = {The goal of smart cities is to improve efficiencies, enhance sustainability, advance quality of life and reduce energy consumption. One of the key factors to accomplish a smart city involves the use of IoT and information technology infrastructure which can be described as the foundation of a smart city. Its effective implementation will allow the city to meet its wide range of requirements while being able to respond to innovations, such as advanced sensors, analytic tools, measurement, and artificial intelligent based solutions. This paper investigates and compares between the use of low and high resolution infrared sensors as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate crowds in cities to enhance and optimise the efficiency of the transportation process and other public services for low density scenarios. A case study was conducted in Nottingham city at one of the tram stops. An experimental methodology is used where different number of people are captured and the results are compared using different image processing techniques. The findings show that both technologies are useful in the estimation of crowd density, however, the high resolution camera has been found to be more accurate in estimating the number of people albeit it is more expensive for the integration into infrastructures. The practical implication is that low-cost and low resolution infrared cameras could provide reasonable results. However, for higher accuracy, high resolution infrared cameras will be needed; and they are potentially more expensive. So a compromise might be needed between cost and performance to encourage the installation of more IoT systems using infrared technologies.},

Here, the Wireless-enabled sites can communicate data to the control unit via the access point (AP). The sites function by utilizing an energy-saving mechanism, which leads to a notable improvement in spectral efficiency. The Markov chain considers the number of active sites in the network dynamically. Moreover, energy harvesting-assisted AP helps overcome the rising demands of the city by providing an enhanced data rate, low latency, shorter coverage, widespread connectivity of the massive number of sites, and energy efficiency. The channel between sites to the AP is Nakagami-m distributed, whereas the AP is connected with the control unit through the free space optical (FSO) link. The FSO link is modelled with Gamma–Gamma distribution with pointing error impairments. The mathematical equations for average bit error probability (ABEP) are obtained for smart cities by considering mixed channels and utilizing the multi-user selection combination. The Monte Carlo simulation technique verifies the accuracy of the numerical results.

For this purpose, they are increasingly relying on smart city indicatives. At the same time, many tools have been developed for assessing the sustainability, resilience, and smartness of cities and neighborhoods. In this chapter, our main aim is to examine the extent of inclusion of smart city indicators in sustainability assessment tools. We examine the extent of inclusion of smart city incubators in existing tools for assessing sustainability at the neighborhood and city scales. The selected city scale tools for analysis are International Urban Sustainability Indicators List, LEED for cities and communities, Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency, and Chilean Center for Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS). Also, the selected tools at the neighborhood scale are LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED ND), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method and Green Star Communities. The results of our analysis showed that, on average, more than half of the smart city indicators are covered by selected sustainability assessment tools. However, the extent of coverage was not the same across all dimensions. Dimensions such as smart environment and smart living have been better included in the sustainability assessment tools than the smart economy and smart people dimensions. CEDEUS includes the highest percentage of smartness indicators among the selected sustainability assessment tools, while LEED cities includes the lowest percentage. There is also no considerable difference between neighborhood and city scales of sustainability assessment tools in terms of smartness inclusion. Overall, the results of this research show that more efforts are needed for better integration of smart city and climate resilience indicators into sustainability assessment tools. It is hoped that the developers of assessment tools will consider this issue when revising their assessment tools.},

Six major dimensions of a societal smart city are: social sustainability, citizen-centeredness, e-democracy, social justice, participatory governance, and cultural resilience. We encourage urban planners and policymakers to pay attention to these dimensions and caution against physical and technological determinism.},

 abstract = {Smart cities have gained prominence in theory and practice over the past two decades. While many aspects of smart cities have been explored, there has been a disproportionate focus on physical and technological elements at the expense of social justice and democratic values. Although there have been attempts to advance the ideas of human-centric or people-centric approaches, a comprehensive perspective encompassing social rights, democratic values, and social justice is still missing. To fill this gap, this study introduces the concept of 'societal smart city', discusses its dimensions, and clarifies aspects of social justice as one of the main dimensions of a societal smart city. In addition to theoretical elaborations, we offer a case study of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, which has recently invested significantly in its technological infrastructure. For this purpose, we conducted a questionnaire survey. Results of the Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) indicate that four key factors, namely citizen-centric governance (α: 0.92, loading 15 variables), inclusive services (α: 0.91, loading 11 variables), resilient infrastructure (α: 0.9, loading 8 variables), and information literacy (α: 0.91, loading 6 variables) are the main underlying factors of social justice in Tehran. The study highlights the importance of social justice as a major dimension of the societal smart city and provides new insights for urban planners and policymakers on how to realize a societal smart city that offers benefits beyond physical and technological advances.},

 abstract = {With the fast-expanding number of vehicles in smart cities, the management of road intersections and traffic congestion has grown to be major problems. Drivers often express their opinion that putting traffic lights on while taking traffic flows into account will have a significant impact on how traffic moves. This paper presents a smart Road traffic Control management system termed Urban Traffic Control (UTC) keeping real-time dynamic traffic flow in mind which helps in upgrading the level of road traffic network management. To provide an organized traffic arrangement, UTC presents methodologies such as vehicle counting, controlling process, and evaluation of lanes keeping status in mind, this whole procedure is implemented by taking the complete traffic network into an account instead of just considering intersections. The primary goal of our system is to lessen traffic jams by cutting down on the trip and waiting times vehicles spend at crossings and intersections. We need to assign a plan for traffic flow that has the least amount of traffic congestion and vehicle waiting time, for this purpose some indicators and models are introduced in this study. Lane weight, traffic jam indicator, and vehicle priority are among these models. As this work is an improvement on the current Road Network without much changing, we integrate our system on normal traffic lights which allow each lane a chance to move and we also considered the no-interference lane movement. To simulate our idea, we introduced a smart road traffic control system consisting of multi-agents, by using a NetLogo stimulator. To compare the fixed cycle traffic light, several vehicles (150 in total) with random behaviour were generated and scattered over 25 different intersections for the time duration of 9 h. This setting was used to test our smart traffic control solution on both lane flow and no interference movement flow. According to the obtained results, there was a 25.98% reduction in total average waiting time over simulation period for all vehicles and a reduction of 34.16% for no interference movement flow. These observations clearly state that suggested method is better suited for today's complex traffic conditions where change in infrastructure is minimal.},

This paper introduces the dependable information processing (DIP) method for handling multi-attribute environmental information in a smart city application. Information sensed from the environment is categorized in the initial stage regarding how it meets application requirements. It helps to identify the need and response of the application through different interacting spans and previous trials. For attribute categorization and span validation, learning via K-means clustering is exploited to identify similar and dissimilar information attributes. This identification speeds up the process of successive responses with improved interaction sessions. The accuracy of user responses and latency-free assessment improves the reliability of DIP in smart city applications. The efficiency of the system is then evaluated using detection accuracy (97.34%), the response time (4.3 s), and interaction time (12.3 s), which is compared with other methods.},

The diverse nature of IoT network requires the use of multiple types of sensors which produce a huge amount of data. This data is highly vulnerable to multiple service-oriented attacks; therefore, it must be protected during the communication of IoT nodes. This research work has focused on the identification and detection of malicious nodes causing service-oriented attacks in smart city applications and networks. The direct experience of communicating nodes and recommendations from neighboring nodes are collected to formulate a total trust score. The adaptive weights assigned to direct observations and indirect recommendations ensure the effectiveness of the Context-Based Trust Evaluation System Model (CTES) in detecting On–Off attacks. Moreover, context similarity measure calculations filter out those bad nodes which are posing a Sybil Attack. The proposed CTES has also been simulated on Contiki Cooja. The results also validate the effectiveness of CTES in detecting the bad behavior of malicious nodes.},

To date, there has been little empirical investigation into how it is deployed, implemented and experienced by end-users in urban Global South contexts. This study uses a socio-technical lens to address this evidence gap with a mixed-method empirical case study from urban Ghana. Results show smart meters as a utility-centric socio-technical infrastructure, with the water utility having designed the customer out of its current rollout approach. The utility's approach is an incremental one that is responsive to the existing context yet provides limited upgrades and impacts to existing systems and actors. We demonstrate how smart meters are much more than neutral, often shaped through everyday realities but have also become new junctions of friction, mistrust and scepticism between the utility and users. In exploring these issues, we raise questions about the smart metering agenda and related digital transformation policies of utilities, highlighting directions towards more customer-centric design and implementation in the design and deployment of digital water infrastructure.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, smart city paradigm plays a primary role in the fulfillment of sustainable solutions in the field of urban mobility, both public and private. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) is allowing the development of increasingly advanced solutions for real-time management of collected information related to the management and coexistence of vehicles (i.e., buses, cars, trains, bicycles, etc.) immersed in urban and sub-urban traffic. The Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm adds a relational connotation between objects typical of human relationships. Objects operate as equals and request/provide information among them in the perspective of providing IoT services to users while maintaining their individuality. Social object relationship enables the design of solutions aiming to improve the exchange of information among network nodes in terms of security from malicious attacks external to the so-called social network of objects. In this context, a new SIoT smart city solution is presented in this article: private and public vehicles together with pedestrians are involved in a real-time collection of data to improve the viability of the city in order to suggest new directions and information to citizens to better organize how to live the city. The developed architecture presented in this article is equipped with an artificial intelligence that process collected traffic data and, thanks to machine learning techniques, evaluate the directions and flows undertaken by vehicles and pedestrians on a daily basis. The authors are also presenting an application that allow both citizens to live the city in a better way and municipal authorities to promptly manage traffic flows. The proposed system was installed in a specific area of Cagliari (Italy) and the traffic flows have been compared with daily traffic data monitored before the installation, observing an average gain of up to 35 percent in daily traffic reduction.},

In this work, we explore how the domains of smart cities, smart transport, and smart energy will evolve until 2030 from a scientific and technological perspective, as a means to inform future policies for urban development in Europe. We started our work with an extensive review of recent and relevant research, covering policy and market reports, scientific journal articles, and other scientific publications. Then, a two-round Delphi survey with 120 field experts was conducted to assess the plausibility of the literature review findings to materialize until 2030. According to our empirical findings, there will be several speedy and structural changes in the three domains: we were able to identify a set of 18 statements that are highly probable to become reality in the next decade, whereas 17 statements were classified as plausible but not highly probable, and three statements raised controversiality. This work provides significant added value in supporting territorial policymakers' and stakeholders' decision making under uncertainty, as well as in designing highly relevant research agendas, attuned to contemporary and emerging trends.},

The first area concerned the spread of remote work in Polish enterprises during the pandemic. The second area concerned the study of this phenomenon in the case of companies from the logistics industry. The diagnosis of the prevalence of remote work among Polish enterprises and the analysis of the survey results showed that during the pandemic, solutions typical of the Smart City concept, working from home or working remotely have become a reality for many organizations. Remote work has become, in the case of many organizations, the basic form of work. However, the necessary legal and organizational solutions in this area do not keep up with the speed and universality of re-mote work implementation. The results of the diagnosis in the field of implementing remote work solutions and the results of research conducted by companies from the logistics industry can be used as reference material in further research on remote work as one of the Smart City concepts in other industries and types of organizations, e.g. public.},

 abstract = {Increase in urbanization drives the need for municipalities to make mobility more efficient, both to address climate goals as well as creating a smart living environment for citizens, with less noise congestion, and pollution. As vehicles are being electrified, further advances will be needed to meet social, environmental, and economic sustainability targets, and a more efficient use of vehicles and public transport is central in this endeavor. Accordingly, Electric Mobility as a Service (eMaaS) has developed as a concept with the potential to increase sustainability mobility in cities and been designated as a phenomenon with potential to radically change how people move in the future. But presently there is the lack of a common business model that supports complex integration of all actors, digital technologies, and infrastructures involved in the eMaaS business ecosystem. This study aims to support the further development of eMaaS by providing a state of the art of eMaaS and further proposes a digital ecosystem as a business model for eMaaS sharing in smart cities. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was adopted grounded on secondary data from the literature to offers a new approach to urban mobility and demonstrate the suitability of the eMaaS concept in smart communities. The digital ecosystem is designed based on system design approach. Findings from this study provides a sustainable policy perspective, discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development of eMaaS and its impact on electrification of vehicles. Overall, findings from this study considers the role of electric vehicles as part of the mobility sharing economy. Recommendations from this study provides designs and strategies for eMaaS, the interrelations between eMobility and other everyday practices, strategically highlighting the positive benefits of eMaaS and broader policies to limit private car usage in cities.},

 abstract = {The race towards smart city status, influenced by the perceived benefits of innovation and sustainability in smart city concepts, has engendered the need to measure the smartness/smart development levels of developing countries' cities to improve upon urban infrastructures. However, various strategies for determining cities' smartness/smart development levels are mostly inconclusive by not considering all the dimensions in urban space in their assessments. This study adopted a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) technique to model the smartness/smart development levels of a developing country city using a six-dimensional framework which provides a comprehensive perspective on the characterization of urban frameworks of cities. A positivism research philosophy using deductive approach and purposive sampling technique was adopted. Quantitative data were collected from experts using a close-ended questionnaire in which 76 responses were retrieved. The study modeled eight indicators for each of the six dimensions using FSE to determine the smartness/smart development level index of each dimension towards the determination of the overall smartness/smart development level index of the developing country city. After analysis, the developing country city and each of the six dimensions used to characterize the city were determined as fairly developed. The implications of such level of ranking meant that the city is below the acceptable smart city status, and hence, improvement should be made in policy applications along the 48 identified indicators such as empowering human resources, sustainable resource consumption, etc., to propel the six dimensions towards smart city. This study could also serve as a theoretical model for determining the smartness/smart development levels of developing countries’ cities. The study also reveals aspects in the urban framework where policy makers and urban developers could target to improve the smartness/smart development levels of cities towards the smart city status.},

While these initiatives continue to be increasingly sought out and publicly promoted by governments across the globe, little is known about the influence of smart city branding campaigns on public perceptions of such projects. To explore this dynamic, we conducted a sentiment analysis of tweets regarding four smart city projects in Africa using the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The analysis revealed strong and consistent positive associations with words annotated with the emotions of Anticipation, Trust, and Joy. Based on these cross-case trends, we speculate that given their underwhelming outputs, the larger smart city agenda and its accompanying strategic positive framing have contrived a potentially pervasive and illusionary sentiment of “smart city mirages” among the public consciousness.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely utilized as the major significant element of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for feasible smart cities due to the capability of IoT for supporting sustainability in numerous domains. There is a need for fault avoidance via the continuous and dynamic utilization of network behavior for achieving the necessary quality of the IoT communication system that allows us to get sustainable enhancement in smart cities regarding IoT communication systems. While considering the IoT-assisted network, the basic part of the IoT model is considered a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), especially for data management that consists of various sensor nodes in the smart city area. Moreover, every node in a WSN is considerably utilized for a specific reason and thus, every node is handled by a battery that increases the consumption of energy in the entire smart city scheme for processing the data regarding communication. On the other hand, there exist various limitations like scalability, communication latency, centralization, privacy, security, etc. Thus, this paper plans to develop the IoT and WSN-based smart city application using novel intelligent techniques, aiming for the optimal performance classification of the network. The infrastructure of IoT will consist of WSN, Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET), Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Here, the efficiency of the whole IoT system is acquired from the efficiency of the whole IoT module. Hence, the IoT network efficiency rates of the individual must be predicted in an earlier stage to predict the effectiveness of the complete IoT system. The efficiency of each network is forecasted with the help of the constraints such as energy consumption, gathered data size, transmitted data size, mobility, false positive, throughput, packet loss, and delay. The output from each network is considered as input to the Optimized Recurrent Neural Network (ORNN) for predicting the ending superiority of the whole IoT network. Here, the parameter tuning in the RNN is done by the Self Adaptive Honey Badger Algorithm (SA-HBA). The empirical outcomes confirmed that the designed method has forecasted and enhanced the superiority of a whole simulated IoT system in an accurate manner. Throughout the result analysis, the given designed method attains minimum energy consumption rate and also better prediction accuracy.},

 abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has enabled transforming urban areas into smart cities. Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.},

 abstract = {The rapid growth of urban populations worldwide imposes new challenges on citizens’ daily lives, including environmental pollution, public security, road congestion, etc. New technologies have been developed to manage this rapid growth by developing smarter cities. Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) in citizens’ lives enables the innovation of new intelligent services and applications that serve sectors around the city, including healthcare, surveillance, agriculture, etc. IoT devices and sensors generate large amounts of data that can be analyzed to gain valuable information and insights that help to enhance citizens’ quality of life. Deep Learning (DL), a new area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has recently demonstrated the potential for increasing the efficiency and performance of IoT big data analytics. In this survey, we provide a review of the literature regarding the use of IoT and DL to develop smart cities. We begin by defining the IoT and listing the characteristics of IoT-generated big data. Then, we present the different computing infrastructures used for IoT big data analytics, which include cloud, fog, and edge computing. After that, we survey popular DL models and review the recent research that employs both IoT and DL to develop smart applications and services for smart cities. Finally, we outline the current challenges and issues faced during the development of smart city services.},

 abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in future smart cities could help solve many traffic-related challenges, such as reducing traffic congestion and traffic accidents. Various congestion pricing and electric vehicle charging policies have been introduced in recent years. Nonetheless, the majority of these schemes emphasize penalizing the vehicles that opt to take the congested roads or charge in the crowded charging station and do not reward the vehicles that cooperate with the traffic management system. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic traffic congestion pricing and electric vehicle charging management system for the internet of vehicles in an urban smart city environment. The proposed system rewards the drivers that opt to take alternative congested-free ways and congested-free charging stations. We propose a token management system that serves as a virtual currency, where the vehicles earn these tokens if they take alternative non-congested ways and charging stations and use the tokens to pay for the charging fees. The proposed system is designed for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) in the context of a smart city environment without the need to set up any expensive toll collection stations. Through large-scale traffic simulation in different smart city scenarios, it is proved that the system can reduce the traffic congestion and the total charging time at the charging stations.},

 abstract = {Benchmarking cities has an essential place to have an idea about their current situation globally. In recent years, the concept of a “smart city” has attracted attention, and therefore the competition between cities has increased even more. Although various indices published regularly have been developed, no approach makes use of a systematic methodology. The gap in the literature constitutes the main motivation of this study. From this point of view, the study aims to measure the smartness level of cities by performing integrated grey-based methods. In this manner, a grey extension of an integrated Level Based Weight Assessment (LBWA) & Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method has been proposed. Six criteria are weighted with the LBWA-G method, and the performances of 17 European cities are measured by the EDAS-G method. The criteria and cities’ related data are derived from the Global Power City Index (GPCI). Furthermore, sensitivity and comparative analysis are conducted to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methodology. The findings of our study offer many managerial implications. We think that this study will guide administrative and local administrators to carry out corrective action for moving forward and developing their cities.},

A calibration process in the same environment as the sensor is crucial to enhance their accuracy. Furthermore, low-cost sensors deteriorate over time, necessitating repeated calibration for sustained performance. HypeAIR is a novel open-source framework for the management of sensor calibration in real-time. It incorporates two calibration methodologies: a combination of machine learning models (Voting Regressor and Support Vector Regression) and the Long Short-Term Memory deep learning model. To evaluate the framework, three extensive experiments were conducted over a 2-year period in the city of Modena, Italy, to monitor NO, NO2, and O3 gases. Both calibration methodologies outperform the manufacturer calibration and our baseline (i.e., a variation of the Random Forest algorithm) and maintain efficiency over time. The availability of the source code facilitates customization for monitoring additional pollutants, while shared air quality datasets ensure reproducibility.},

The security features like integrity, authentication, and confidentiality are indispensable requirements of the smart grid environment. On the other hand, different objects like smart meters in the smart grid environment are resource-constrained, posing in designing lightweight security protocols.

 abstract = {The main technical issues regarding smart city solutions are related to data gathering, aggregation, reasoning, data analytics, access, and service delivering via Smart City APIs (Application Program Interfaces). Different kinds of Smart City APIs enable smart city services and applications, while their effectiveness depends on the architectural solutions to pass from data to services for city users and operators, exploiting data analytics, and presenting services via APIs. Therefore, there is a strong activity on defining smart city architectures to cope with this complexity, putting in place a significant range of different kinds of services and processes. In this paper, the work performed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city project on defining a smart city architecture addressing a wide range of processes and data is presented. To this end, comparisons of the state of the art solutions of smart city architectures for data aggregation and for Smart City API are presented by putting in evidence the usage semantic ontologies and knowledge base in the data aggregation in the production of smart services. The solution proposed aggregate and re-conciliate data (open and private, static and real time) by using reasoning/smart algorithms for enabling sophisticated service delivering via Smart City API. The work presented has been developed in the context of the Sii-Mobility national smart city project on mobility and transport integrated with smart city services with the aim of reaching a more sustainable mobility and transport systems. Sii-Mobility is grounded on Km4City ontology and tools for smart city data aggregation, analytics support and service production exploiting smart city API. To this end, Sii-Mobility/Km4City APIs have been compared to the state of the art solutions. Moreover, the proposed architecture has been assessed in terms of performance, computational and network costs in terms of measures that can be easily performed on private cloud on premise. The computational costs and workloads of the data ingestion and data analytics processes have been assessed to identify suitable measures to estimate needed resources. Finally, the API consumption related data in the recent period are presented.},

Specifically, we design a novel eNsemble federATed leArning for mobiLity InfErence (NATALIE) framework. The ensemble method combines the outputs from different DNN models learned via FL and shows an accuracy that surpasses comparable models reported in the literature. Extensive benchmarking experiments on open-access MTL Trajét and GeoLife GPS datasets demonstrate that the proposed inference model can achieve comparable accuracy in the identification of mode of travel without compromising privacy. The evaluation of the proposed model against non-i.i.d. data at varying sample sizes and different worker numbers shows improved performance.

Taking advantage of vehicular communications, in this paper we propose novel mechanisms for the acceleration of the rescue operation resulting in a reduction in fatalities in accidents. We propose a Software-Defined Traffic Light Preemption (SD-TLP) mechanism that enables Emergency Medical Vehicles (EMVs) to travel along the rescue route with minimal interruptions. The SD-TLP makes preemption decisions based on global knowledge of the traffic conditions in the city. We also propose mechanisms for the selection of the nearest emergency center and fast discharge of the route of EMVs. Furthermore, depending on the dynamic traffic conditions on the streets at the time of the accident, an appropriate rescue route is selected for the EMV before its departure. The proposed approach is evaluated using the OMNET++ and SUMO tools over part of the Megacity of Tabriz, Iran. The simulation results demonstrate that the method can reduce the average rescue time significantly. The proposed approach keeps the resulting disruption in city traffic acceptably low while trying to shorten the rescue time as much as possible.},

We implement both synchronous and asynchronous communication modes for agents interacting with the knowledge graph. When occurring in conjunction, directed acyclic graphs of derivations can arise, with changing data propagating through the knowledge graph by means of agents’ actions. While the framework itself is domain-agnostic, we apply it in the context of smart cities as part of the World Avatar project and demonstrate that it is capable of handling sequential events across different timescales.

 abstract = {Air pollution stands out as one of the most critical challenges impacting public health, the overall quality of life, and the pursuit of sustainable development in urban environments. Each existing air quality monitoring method carries inherent limitations alongside its advantages. This study addresses the drawbacks of both satellite-based and fixed monitoring stations by proposing a drone-based air quality monitoring solution. The entire urban area was surveyed using a multi-rotor drone equipped with sensors capable of measuring atmospheric components, resulting in the creation of high-resolution air pollution maps. The expansive urban area, exceeding the coverage capacity of a single flight, was systematically subdivided into subregions. Distinct measurements were conducted in each subregion, and a consolidated mapping was generated by combining the individual results obtained. The drone, operating autonomously, conducted precise measurements on a citywide scale, enhancing the consistency of pollutant mapping by eliminating potential errors associated with manual control. Pollution sources were identified throughout the city, and real-time data revealed how transportation-induced air pollution affected different regions. Environmental factors like wind and pressure differences were identified as influential in the varied spread of air pollutants across different parts of the city. The study underscores the pivotal role of transportation in urban air pollution, laying the groundwork for the development of targeted pollution control strategies in urban environments. Furthermore, the research validates the potential of UAVs in advancing the efficient management of smart cities, particularly through the monitoring and analysis of air pollution stemming from transportation.},

Along with this trend, the problem with standardization of this concept appeared, which in this context means defining specific criteria for assessing the degree of introducing smart solutions to cities. Regarding the issue of measurable methods of assessing cities in terms of implementing the smart idea, it can be said that the existing works in this area usually present only values/levels that particular cities have achieved in specific criteria, on the basis of which rankings are then created. The indicators defined for the purpose of such estimates, however, give neither a picture of their initial conditions, with which particular cities started their development, nor their perspectives for the development. The solution to the described problem may be an assessment methodology in which, in addition to static indicators, dynamic or derivative indicators are being computed and assessed. The proposed dynamic indicators tell about the rate of progress or the regression in particular assessment categories. This approach, to a certain extent, shows the innovation and efforts made by particular cities towards introducing the smart idea.},

Interpretations of Horkheimer and Adorno, Žižek and Lacan serve as background for the research, which are introduced to enrich an existing (mainly Foucauldian) set of smart city critique. Inspired by critical theory, this analysis shows that ideology is reproduced by culture industry and indicates tendencies to implement instrumental reason, to harmonize the existing social and economic contradictions and mainly reproduces economic interests. Since the researched rhetors are as politicians in power to materialize their ideological convictions, the mystification of technology plays a crucial role as disciplining and controlling measure, which aims to stabilize and justify status quo and maintain the existing inequalities. Derived rhetoric elements, which indicate categorization of citizenship and reductionism of environmental issues demonstrate the high societal relevance of the study and emphasize the urgent need for critique on progressing urban digitalization.},

 abstract = {In the context of economic crisis, it is necessary to drive changes in the productive model towards a smart society. Particularly in urban areas, the Smart City movement has become an agent for change to help fight the loss of competitiveness and unemployment. Literature review shows that there is little regarding the generation of knowledge and entrepreneurial activity in the context of a smart city and in Spain in particular. This study contributes to filling this gap. We start by identifying the potential sources of entrepreneurial opportunities that a medium-sized smart city may offer based on the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship. We then provide empirical evidence that the Smart City label has positively influenced the effective creation of new businesses. To this end, we examine 44 Spanish Smart City initiatives included and classified in the Smart City Index according to their smartness level. Our results confirm the relation between the Smart City label and the entrepreneurship rate. Moreover, they allow us to present some relevant considerations and implications concerning the maturing process of Smart City initiatives. These considerations are of particular interest for those agents involved in the smart city entrepreneurial ecosystem.},

 abstract = {Sensors are considered as a great invention that radically contributed to saving time and effort for humans while moving or transporting things. That's the reason why, researchers are constantly working on a smart vision sensor that can provide important data such as directions, temperature, speed, risks… to drivers. Nowadays, there is a new tendance of smart cities that recommend the equipment of vehicles with sensors that can facilitate communication between all categories of vehicles. In this paper, we proposed an in-depth study for developing an assistance system that assists controls the vehicle position, managed a vision sensor (camera) that provides a perception of the road environment in real-time. Then to calculate the Steering Angle (SA), we use the Smart Soft-Sensors that take into consideration the road edges in the images. Each road image is identified by the SA, these images will be trained in a GPU processor using Nvidia's End to End architecture. Then an adaptive control by applications of the proposed system, gives SA estimated to assist in controlling the actuator (Steering Wheel). The results obtained by this approach encourage integrating it into automotive embedded systems to make the right behavior on the road.},

 abstract = {The smart cities agenda has garnered considerable interest recently as the spread of mobile technologies and notions of ‘big data’ have opened possibilities for promoting greater efficiencies in urban metabolisms. This has been particularly prominent in the realm of environmental sustainability, where smart technologies have been viewed as a way of reducing traffic congestion and delivering energy efficiencies. Key to these aspirations is the way in which technologies are seen to interact with human behaviour and how digital technologies can promote behavioural change through the provision of ‘better’ information. However, smart city programmes adopt a particular intellectual and pragmatic framing of behavioural change that we argue is fundamentally narrow and unambitious, raising concerns about how behavioural science is mobilised, by whom and its potential to promote sustainable urban futures. First, we propose that the focus in smart city narratives on quantitative data and insights from ‘big data’ is methodologically narrow and is representative of a highly individualised, libertarian paternalist perspective that privileges rationalistic and atomised understandings of behaviour. Second, we argue that the logic of smart cities leads city governments towards a focus on superficial change and the language of ‘encouraging’ shifts in individual behaviour that presents a distraction from the urgent need to reconfigure city infrastructures for low carbon forms of living. Third, we explore how such behavioural change approaches are fundamentally didactic and often lapse into assuming that publics are the passive receivers of ‘smarter’ information rather than active citizens who can question, campaign and present alternative visions to those of corporate-government interests. In this way, we argue that the suffusing of the smart cities and behavioural change agendas act as a neo-liberal distraction to the ways in which cities can develop to support the priorities of human and ecological wellbeing.},

 abstract = {This research studied the effect of different combinations of government capabilities (innovation capability mix) on public value in smart city-framed innovation projects. The study drew on the public value theory, the collaborative public innovation approach and the dynamic capabilities theory to devise a conceptual framework that links government capabilities and public value. Insights from smart cities and literature on public innovation were also used to identify a range of intra-organizational and external collaboration capabilities of governments that should lead to valuable public sector innovation. These capabilities were combined inductively through factor analysis, which was applied to a sample of 143 innovation projects in Spanish municipalities, leading to four forms of innovation capability mix. A factor analysis regression was then estimated. Overall, the study found that ‘citizen-oriented management’ (i.e., outstanding innovation-oriented internal management coupled with strong collaboration with citizens) and ‘provider focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with providers) seem to have a positive influence on three dimensions of public value (i.e., efficiency, effectiveness and societal challenges). By contrast, ‘citizen and expert focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with experts and citizens) and ‘peer focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with other governments) do not contribute to any of the three dimensions of public value. While project type was studied, it was found that its isolated effect was limited, although analyzing it provided some interesting findings.},

 abstract = {As a locus of technological innovation, a smart city (SC) is a prototypical city of the future. Moreover, according to scholars, a smart city is also sustainable city. Nonetheless, the environmental aspects of urban sustainability are often de-emphasized in favor of discourses around the technical characteristics of SC technologies. In order to integrate the two, the article introduces the notion of a smart green city (SGC) in which technological means and environmental outcomes are in sustainable balance. SGC is presented here as a unifying concept integrating smart city and green city concepts through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework. To illustrate the positive synergy between a city's greenness and smartness, we derive operational definitions of both based on the online media's attention to the related technology and sustainability initiatives. After calculating the two indices for all the cities worldwide with over one million inhabitants (498 cities), regression analysis is performed to determine the strength and direction of the relationships between a city's greenness and smartness. We find that a city's greenness is positively related to its smartness. Principal component analysis reveals a potential relationship between a city's population and the two indices. In particular, a large city's population negatively affects its greenness but positively affects its smartness. A joint index of smartness and greenness is negatively related to a city's population. Hence, the containment of uncontrolled urban growth is critical for successfully implementing SGC initiatives. The analysis results are of use to policy-makers, city managers, and planners intending to integrate the ESG framework into their future urban development strategies. Moreover, to our knowledge, a joint evaluation of a city's greenness and smartness has never been performed before on the inter-regional level of analysis. Accordingly, such a holistic assessment can be of methodological interest to scholars of smart and sustainable cities.},

Thus, this study explores how SVC contributes to achieving the SDGs at the city level. We performed the Cross-Network Information Analysis protocol, which is properly designed for investigating dyadic phenomena. The main findings revealed that SVC contributes to most SDGs in cities, mainly 11, 17, 9, and 8. Consensus building, smart sustainable cities, and innovation ecosystems are central aspects of the SVC contribution to the SDGs in general. Other relevant aspects are: shared meaning, networking strategy, socio-spatial & cultural patterns, technology, circular economy, sharing economy, corporate social responsibility, entrepreneurship, social bricolage, knowledge sharing, open innovation, ethics, and creativity. However, there has been no empirical evidence of SVC contribution to reaching the SDGs 5, 14, and 15.

 abstract = {The notion of smart city is based on using both bidirectional power and data flows. For that, designing a persuasive control model for power flow becomes a big and crucial part in a smart city to optimize the power balance between production and consumption. So, a seven-layer smart city energy management strategy (SLSCEMS) for multiple home energy cooperation is presented in this paper. The optimised aims of this strategy are smoothing the smart homes power demand profiles, reducing the electricity bills (E.B), and gaining a total free charging of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). This approach has been designed as hierarchic local and global layers. The first one is divided into three layers that aim to transfer the energy between each smart home and its own Renewable Energy sources (RES) and PEVs. The second one is split into four layers that aim to transfer the energy between each smart home and its PEVs, the neighboring homes and their RES, and the smart grid. All optimised layers are based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed strategy is evaluated in a city that contains one hundred homes classified into five categories, each category is designated by its power profile and its flexible number of RESs and PEVs. Simulation results show a decrease in the daily E.B of 26.24%, 2.42%, 60.33%, 29.51%, and 2.38% respectively of the five categories. So, these numerical results prove that the proposed SLSCEMS has considerable efficiency.},

Applying a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis to 130 smart city initiatives in Switzerland, we develop a three-dimensional framework of business models for digital sustainability. The framework comprises 12 theoretically possible business model types, representing distinct business model configurations.

 abstract = {This article contextualizes the smart cities paradigm in the panorama of contemporary city challenges, which increasingly encompasses the pursuit of sustainable development goals and the need to incorporate urban resilient behaviors, mainly in response to the impacts of climate change. Such a scenario also comprises the interpretation of smart cities as tools to assist policymakers and city administrators in directing solutions based on emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) to the materialization of urban strategic plans addressing these confrontations. There are, however, no established indicator systems that attest to the substantiation of such plans by smart city solutions, nor to their alignment with the goals of urban sustainable development. Therefore, an analytical framework is proposed here to address this knowledge gap. It enables guiding the leverage of smart cities’ ICTs, not only for the achievement of economic goals, a feature intrinsic to smart city innovations, but also to reach other sustainability dimensions, as the environmental, social, institutional and cultural. To this end, generic sustainability indicator frameworks and also a set of smart city indicators are explored. They are examined as potential sources of specific taxonomies in smart city services for urban sustainable development. From this compilation of options, the Dashboard of Sustainability, once one of the indicator systems most recommended by experts, is revisited. It is adapted as a framework for analyzing and helping to maintain the strategic targeting of smart city solutions, during their entire lifecycle, at sustainability. To complete the qualitative-analytical-taxonomic frame, the services offered by a real smart city solution, the Rio de Janeiro Center of Operations, are employed as a model. This allows investigating its 9-year transition from a wider, larger capacity, strategic and innovative configuration in orientation towards sustainability perspectives, to a more narrow, operational composition, that is predominantly devoted to the economic dimension.},

 abstract = {Among the security services, like authentication, access control, key management and intrusion detection, user authentication is very much needed for a smart city environment because an external authorized user may require the real time data to be accessed directly from the deployed Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart devices. Using the established session key between the user and an access smart device though mutual authentication and key agreement process, the real time data can be securely accessed. To deal with this issue, we propose a new user authentication scheme in smart city environment using three factors of a legal registered user (mobile device, password and biometrics). The proposed scheme is shown to be robust against a number of potential attacks needed in an IoT-based smart city deployment. The simulation study for formal security verification using the widely-accepted “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” tool demonstrates that the proposed scheme is also secure. Furthermore, experiments on various cryptographic primitives have been carried out using “MIRACL Cryptographic SDK: Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library” under both server and Raspberry PI 3 settings. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis shows the effectiveness and better security of the proposed scheme as compared with other state of art user authentication schemes.},

 abstract = {Smart cities (SC) have emerged as a hope for urbans that face challenges and sustainability issues due to rapid urbanization. SC services can make the daily routines more efficient, create more public value, and improve the urban sustainability and life quality (QoL). However, before any technology enters the market, the factors making adoption easier for the end-users should be examined. Here, we aim to examine the acceptance of IoT-based and sustainability-oriented SC services. This study proposes a SC services acceptance model (SCSAM), built over the human, technology and institution dimensions of SC. We tested SCSAM by using structural equation modeling via 640 survey-respondents. The quantitative findings were supported by qualitative analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that personal innovativeness, social influence, quality of service (QoS) and perceived trust are the significant determinants of use intention. Interestingly cost has no significant effect and demographics do not contribute much on the acceptance of smart services. This is the only study in the literature adopting both quantitative and qualitative analysis to examine SC services adoption via an acceptance model based on the SC's multidimensional structure. Our findings would help city administrators and service providers to improve urban sustainability and QoL.},

 abstract = {The prevalence of IoT based technology in contemporary society allows for the planning of smart city infrastructure with individually owned devices as participating nodes in a social smart network. Edge computing application into such an IoT network facilitates the distributed computing framework by bringing the computational application closer to the end-users in form of Fog sub-networks, comprising the local participating end-user IoT nodes as service requesters and specialized servers catering to the requests, modelled for the infrastructure category they are delivering (Smart healthcare, ITS, Smart architecture, etc.). Opportunistic-based last-mile connectivity between the Fog servers and participating nodes aides the dynamicity of the topology for efficient information. Aiding the same, the proposed edge computing enabled, sustainable, opportunistic IoT-based intuitive data exchange, collection and operation scheme that employs a dynamic routing procedure that considers human interactions, their movement patterns and their decision-making process. The proposed scheme employs probabilistic history-based parameters that keep track of node interactions. The interactions are modelled on the Firefly PSO, allowing exploitation of the social mobility. The Fuzzy logic is used for hop decision making based on the social and attribute-based parameters which mimic intuitive and pragmatic decision making of humans in terms of social interactions and mobility.},

 abstract = {Smart home devices have brought in a disruptive, revolutionary Internet-based ecosystem that enhanced our daily lives but has pushed private data from inside our homes to external public sources. Threats and attacks mounted against IoT deployments have only increased in recent times. There have been several proposals to secure home automation environments, but there is no full protection against Cybersecurity threats for our home IoT platforms. This research investigates attack attempts on smart home environments, focusing on firmware, brute force, and DoS attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) network which were successful in bringing down the device in less than a minute. Weak passwords were cracked using Brute Force techniques related to HTTP, SSH, Telnet, and FTP protocols, and an unknown service port to reveal backdoor access. Cross-site scripting vulnerability was detected on IoT devices that could allow running malicious scripts on the devices. The authors also exploited the unknown services to reveal backdoors and access sensitive device details and potentially exploited them to add new ports or rules to turn the IoT devices into a router to attack other devices. To detect and mitigate such attacks, the authors present an IoT-based intrusion detection and prevention system to secure smart home network devices. The authors compared the proposed framework with other similar research based on Precision, Accuracy, F-measure, and Recall. The proposed model outperforms all the other known models reporting a high of 95% for identifying malicious attack packets, while others reported 58% and 71% detection percentage.},

 abstract = {Public administrations frequently tend to make communities as much sustainable as possible pursuing smart city goals. Solar energy investments represent a valid opportunity to support smart cities and consequently the sustainable economic development. The valuation of these projects is not a simple task considering their sequential nature and riskiness. This article proposes a compound Real Options Approach (ROA) as a tool for potential investors to make a conscious R&D renewable investment decision on smart cities. In this sense, we fit the compound ROA with the framework of a typical smart city project in solar energy field. We also provide a case study to make a comparison between classical Expected Net Present Value (ENPV) approach and compound ROA. The results show that ENPV underestimates the project value, whereas compound ROA allows to obtain a more attractive valuation of the project by embedding in the analysis the managerial flexibility value.},

 abstract = {Sustainable cities are currently undergoing unprecedented transformative changes in light of the recent paradigm shift in science and technology brought on by big data science and analytics. These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This new area is a significant gap in and of itself—as it is still in its infancy—that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the world has witnessed significant progress in implementing numerous eco-district and eco-city projects, which are under the banner of experimentation or seen as sites of innovation. Indeed, the rise of such initiatives serves as a sign of renewed attempts to experiment or innovate in designing urban futures in an increasingly urbanized and datafied society. In light of this, a number of alternative models of eco-urbanism have been proposed by scholars and promoted by policy makers. The prominent among these models are sustainable urban districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. At the core of these models is a range of compact and ecological design strategies and static and dynamic conceptions of spatial scaling. These are intended to produce and boost the benefits of sustainability on the basis of a set of integrated approaches—increasingly supported by big data technologies—as a way to overcome new challenges and introduce new solutions. Based on two case studies conducted on three of the ecologically and technologically leading cities in Europe—Stockholm, Malmö, and Barcelona, this paper analyses and discusses the role and relevance of integrating density, mixed land use, greening, and low-energy buildings to the sustainability of emerging eco-districts; the new conceptions of cities and their spatial scales in the context of data-driven smart eco-cities; and the opportunities and challenges of smart urban metabolism with respect to the evaluation of eco-districts. This study shows that combining compact and ecological design strategies improves the performance of eco-districts with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as paves the way for their balanced integration for producing synergistic effects. Also, this study highlights the innovative potential and enabling role of urban computing and intelligence in transforming the spatial scaling of data-driven smart eco-cities through generating the kind of designs that increase the effects of sustainability as outcomes of processes. Moreover, this study reveals the advantages of the data-driven approach to the analysis of the flows of resources in urban environments in relation to the evaluation of sustainable urban district development. This paper concludes that data-driven smart planning and evaluation holds great potential for facilitating progress towards achieving the goals of sustainability thanks to the proven role and untapped potential of big data technologies in monitoring, understanding, and analyzing urban processes and systems in real-time.},

 abstract = {This paper acknowledges the contemporary neoliberal mode of operation of Smart Cities. The pitfalls of Smart Cities concerning its propensity towards techno-centric and efficiency-focused governance are identified, with diminutive emphasis on social equity and human-centric urban growth. Thus, the paper elaborates upon an alternative mode of person-environment-interaction based approach towards placemaking: Empathic Cities. This approach implies embracing a shift from efficiency to sufficiency and wellbeing embedded regenerative perspective for conceiving the built environment. First, the variable dimensions of urban growth and governance, which gave rise to the smart city, are contextualized. The embedded neoliberal operational agenda of smart cities are established. On this basis, the underpinnings of an empathic city are established by acknowledging the shift from techno-centric to human-centric and from product-based to context-based smart city and wellbeing perspectives. Strategies toward urban development are proposed, such as embracing a regenerative perspective wherein the city and its constituents need to be understood as interdependent systemic elements while embracing a human-centric and ethical approach. Additionally, a transition from efficiency to sufficiency-oriented practices and a shift towards inclusive modes of participatory governance are proposed as fundamental principles for an empathic future of the built environment.},

 abstract = {The background for this study is a two-year smart city cluster project, called Ready for Smart Growth, which included various smart city projects in 22 municipalities. This study's novelty lies in the context of its analysis and theoretical contribution, which outline an identification of the complexity, advantages and barriers that smart city project managers perceived in an ongoing smart city cluster project. Further, a definition for a smart city project is suggested. This research is within a case study methodology, and was based on a mixed method approach that employed nine key informant interviews and two questionnaires. The results revealed that the project managers perceived different needs and goals within the context of smart city innovation and realization. The project managers perception of smart city was mainly within a smart economy and smart governance perspective. However, the project managers also criticized the relatively less focus on public participations and dialogue-oriented smart city solutions. The perceived major barriers to real smart city implementations were regulations; silos; and the choice of stakeholders, including companies promising too much. The major advantages include the different perspectives and types of knowledge of various stakeholders.},

The multiple regression analysis method was adopted, considering the main formal sources of innovation incubation financing, in addition to the indicators of Open and Close Innovation practices among young companies. The research was concentrated in 66 cities on the European continent based on longitudinal data for the period from 2008 to 2014. The results reveal that there is a significant effect of the innovation incubation financing system on the evolution of the SUD level, with this system being identified as private sponsorship, as venture capital sponsorship, and as sponsorship by higher education entities. Public financing and PPP financing did not have a significant influence on the evolution of the SUD level, although some studies highlight the importance of these sources for smartization projects.},

In this blueprint, cities are seen as a hotspot for achieving those goals by 2030. In this context, cities, through smart technologies, are engaging in generating a sustainable ecosystem that is inclusive of social and environmental concerns. The main objective of this paper is to assess the effect of SDGs institutionalization on the concept of smart sustainable cities. To this end, we review the literature on smart cities and SDGs to analyze the degree of alignment and potential areas of development. The results reveal the existence of brokerage keywords, which rank high in both fields of the literature, but are missing from the portfolio of overlapping keywords. This is the case for water management, energy, governance, and collaboration.

 abstract = {Smart cities are increasingly keen to establish a fruitful conversation with their citizens, to better capture their needs, and create virtual platforms for stimulating co-creation processes between government and users, with the final objective of increasing the quality of life and well-being. Social media applications provide an opportunity for dialogic communication, where, for a relatively low cost, a large amount of information reaching a wide audience can be published and exchanged in real time, fueling opportunities for citizens' engagement. This study is based on a social media listening method, through Twitter data mining, which enabled disentangling different components of citizen engagement (popularity, commitment, and virality) for a sample of Italian municipalities. In addition, we executed a deep analysis of the types of communication artifacts exchanged and, through a content analysis of the tweets published by followers of the municipalities' accounts, we identified the main areas of interest in the social media conversations. Our results are based on the analysis of online conversations engaged by followers of Twitter accounts of a sample of 28 Italian municipalities, chosen among the most active and densely populated. We show that municipalities tend to use the Twitter account as a channel of communication to inform the population about a variety of topics, such as transport and public works, among the others. The volume of activity and number of followers (audience) vary from one municipality to the other. There is generally a negative relationship between the density of the population of a municipality and citizens' engagement: smaller municipalities show a higher citizens' engagement; the biggest ones, like Roma, Milan, Turin, Naples, are laggards. We finally conducted a city profiling process, which provides a representation of key citizens' segments in terms of engagement. Policymakers could find in our work useful tools to increase citizens' listening capacity.},

 abstract = {Wireless communication technologies and Internet of Things (IoT) applications are the main drivers of upcoming sustainable smart networks which require an effective resource management. The reduction of the transmission energy consumption and the efficient utilization of the available spectrum for wireless communication, for instance, have to be enabled by energy-efficient and cognitive IoT networks. These are implemented through optimized communication protocol stacks and algorithms that rely on actual physical layer and channel state information. The modeling and the prototype evaluation of protocol optimization approaches are mainly driven by pure simulation studies with abstracted physical layer and channel models. With the Radio-in-the-Loop (RIL) simulation (S. Böhm and H. König, 2023) and modeling (S. Böhm and H. König, 2021), we have created an evaluation approach that integrates real wireless hardware and radio environments into the simulation of protocol sequences and algorithms. In this paper, we summarize the fundamentals of our basic methodology and demonstrate a cross-layer optimization case study for energy efficient modeling using software-defined radios. We exemplary show the scenario of a receiver-sensitivity control to increase the energy efficiency of receiver-dominated IoT nodes in Smart City networks.},

The methods of qualitative comparative analysis and logical generalization made it possible to identify the features of the content of Russian and international smart transport standards, to systematize management tools for achieving standardized indicators of smart transport in a smart city by the transport infrastructure. “Gaps” in the instrumental base in the Russian track of managing the development of smart transport are associated with the underuse of digital platforms and citizen initiatives that are widely represented in European practice. The scientific novelty of the results is achieved by a comparative approach to the tools for managing the development of smart transport in a smart city, consists of assessing the differences between Russian and European management tracks, of justified directions for using European experience in the Russian Federation. The paper provides practical recommendations for the inclusion of digital platforms with proven efficiency at the corporate level in management tools; for increasing the role of innovative initiatives of citizens in the formation of smart transport. Practical recommendations can be used in the development of transport strategies, transport sections of the strategies for the socio-economic development of the constituent entities and municipalities of the Russian Federation using not only program-project, but also platform-initiative goal-setting tools.},

Discourses on “smart urbanism” are being discussed and lead to the proposal of changes to urban models and reference systems through local anchoring, a rethinking of governance, the participation of citizens, and the strengthening of their capacities (“smart citizens”). In this contribution, we observed the path of learning cities promoted by UNESCO, which, as the French examples (Clermont-Ferrand) have shown us, is decisive for the “good life”. We can see the emergence of a coexistence between “smart city” and “learning city”, which contributes to the management of urban transitions and can lead to functional complementarities and increase the capacity for adaptation and resilience. Hybridization creates tensions and controversies but also helps with regulations and coordination. It encourages citizen participation, collective dynamics, and lifelong learning but also new forms of local anchoring, relationships with the environment and social interactions favorable to the quality of life.},

Municipalities seek to improve their citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but the need to find a balance between these complex factors makes decision-making processes more difficult. Experts must analyze the determinants of smart cities, which are urban centers intended to be socially involved, habitable, and economically and environmentally sustainable, and that rely strongly on technology and innovation. Based on multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) principles, this study combines cognitive mapping techniques and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to develop a multicriteria model that can help managers analyze smart city determinants in a collaborative manner. The research included identifying these determinants and their respective cause-and-effect relationships using an expert panel’s experience and knowledge related to the subject under analysis. The results were validated by both the panel and the city councilor responsible for mobility and municipal projects within Évora City Council, Portugal, which has implemented smart city strategies. The latter specialist verified that the proposed evaluation system can be used as a tool to facilitate smart city collaborative decision-making processes.

A more holistic systems framing can ensure that ‘smart’ solutions better address sustainability broadly and extend to issues of equity, power, agency, nature-based solutions and ecological resilience. In this context, smart city infrastructure plays an important role in enabling new ways of measuring, experiencing and engaging with local and temporal dynamics of urban systems.

@article{BUNDERS2019145,
 abstract = {Recently, the concept of the smart city has gained growing popularity. As cities worldwide have set the aim to harness digital technologies to their development, increasing focus came to lie on the potential challenges and concerns related to data-driven urban practices. In the existing literature, these challenges and concerns have been dominantly approached from a pragmatic approach based on the a priori assumed ‘goodness’ of the smart city; for a small group of critics, the very notion of the smart city is questionable. This paper takes the middle-way by interrogating how municipal and civil society stakeholders problematize the challenges and concerns related to data-driven practices in five Dutch cities, and how they act on these concerns in practice. The lens of problematization posits that the ways of problematizing data-driven practices contribute to their actual enactment, and that this is an inherently political process. The case study shows that stakeholders do not only perceive practical challenges but are widely aware of and are (partly) pro-actively engaging with perceived normative-ethical and societal concerns, leading to different (sometimes inter-related) technological, legal/political, organizational, informative and participative strategies. Nonetheless, the explicit contestation of smart city policies through these strategies remains limited in scope. The paper argues that more research is needed to uncover the structural-institutional dynamics that facilitate and/or prevent the repoliticization of smart city projects.},

This is highly relevant for delivering city-wide urban solutions to grand challenges. The combinations of conditions (factors) for scale-up remain understudied. This paper contextualizes its research within the theoretical literature of smart cities, innovation, knowledge management, and governance and compares 17 smart city pilot projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. The cases were selected according to the research objective and analyzed using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The findings show two paths of city-wide scale-up, which we term “bureaucratic tailoring” and “low-uncertainty partnering.” This article makes three important theoretical contributions. First, it is possible for smart city pilot projects to scale-up to an entire city through different paths. Second, differentiating the role and capabilities of the municipality in terms of these different paths and in relation to the other governance conditions is essential. Third, the social perception of technological uncertainty is not static but fluid, and is highly related to other governance conditions. Future-oriented policy makers might find the paths explained here useful for anticipating how projects might scale-up.},

 abstract = {The development of smart city and smart mobility has put forward requirements for the traffic zone division. The traditional traffic zone division is limited by data with low update frequency and low accuracy, which can hardly meet the needs. With the progress of ICTs, data-driven traffic zone division is developing gradually. Many scholars have tried to divide traffic zone through GPS and CDR. However, there are still shortcomings in the data-driven traffic zone division. On the one hand, different scholars use different data sources and division methods, and there is no unified framework that can describe different ways. On the other hand, many technical problems such as unsatisfactory zone boundary, single data source and clustering algorithm only considering similarity have not been solved well. Therefore, this paper first proposes a technical framework for data-driven traffic zone division, which describes the different methods uniformly by dividing the data-driven traffic zone division into four parts. Based on this framework, this paper proposes a traffic zone division method based on CSD, which solves the above technical problems successfully, and finally is applied in the traffic zone division of Foshan, China.},

Previous studies have concentrated on analyzing the spatial distribution of urban services, with less attention on their contribution as local urban amenities. In this study, we propose a spatial dynamic modeling approach based on urban amenities using social media data from Google Place API to provide locational information on potential resident interactions. We use a representative region in Europe (Stockholm County, SE) to simulate and project urban development in the region until 2050. Our circular conceptual framework of spatial information and feedback supports decision-makers in testing possible urban planning scenarios that align with the vision of a smart city. Simulation results reveal the interplay between human-land interactions on a specific spatial-temporal scale, and we analyze scenario outcomes in relation to commercial and residential land uses. Overall, our study provides a new perspective on human-social behavior-driven urban development, through a smart, spatial dynamic model as a planning support system that can enhance realism, and ultimately help realize planned development objectives in the region.},

 abstract = {To address the aftermath of ever more frequent natural disasters striking highly-populated urban areas, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations increasingly involve the coordinated efforts of multiple agencies and in particular Civil–Military Cooperation (CIMIC). In such scenarios, rescuers operate in a disrupted environment, must maintain a high operational tempo, and need to quickly make high-impact decisions. Effectively supporting emergency responders through IT services that implement accurate situation awareness presents a formidable set of challenges, including the discovery and integration of surviving IT assets with purposely deployed ones; effective information prioritization; resilient communications; and secure information sharing. We believe that in the highly digital modern urban environment, often referred to as smart cities, these challenges can be effectively addressed only by integrating by design HADR support into the smart city middleware. This paper presents Aceso — a proof-of-concept smart city middleware that provides location- and context-sensitive services with full support for HADR operations. Aceso provides a set of functions, ranging from resource discovery to secure information sharing, that can be quickly activated in case of unpredictable and adverse events to facilitate HADR operations. Furthermore, Aceso leverages the Value-of-Information (VoI) methodology to handle the processing and dissemination of mission-critical information. To validate the capabilities of Aceso, we devised a fictional HADR scenario, set in the city of Helsinki, Finland, that involves the collaboration of multiple responder teams with different roles. The validation results confirm Aceso’s usefulness in prioritizing the processing and dispatching of critical information and in realizing federation-wide sharing of this information among HADR teams.},

Using China's SCC pilots as a quasi-natural experiment, this study examines the impact of SCC on corporate hiring decisions and finds that SCC adversely impacts corporate employment. The mechanism analysis suggests that SCC affects corporate employment through factor substitution rather than job creation by promoting digital capitalization and capital and technological factor substitution. Further analyses indicate that SCC primarily reduces the number of low-skilled and non-production employees and has a stronger impact on local private, old, and industrial firms. We also find evidence of labor reallocation effects of SCC. Overall, the results highlight the trade-off between promoting SCC and mitigating employment challenges and the role of data as a new production factor in the digital economy era, providing important policy implications for stakeholders.},

First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME.},

 abstract = {In the field of Smart City applications, the analysis of urban data to detect city hotspots, i.e., regions where urban events (such as pollution peaks, virus infections, traffic spikes, and crimes) occur at a higher density than in the rest of the dataset, is becoming a common task. The detection of such hotspots can serve as a valuable organizational technique for framing detailed information about a metropolitan area, providing high-level spatial knowledge for planners, scientists, and policymakers. From the algorithmic viewpoint, classic density-based clustering algorithms are very effective in discovering hotspots characterized by homogeneous density; however, their application on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. For such a reason, since metropolitan cities are characterized by areas with significantly variable densities, multi-density clustering approaches are more effective in discovering city hotspots. Moreover, the growing volumes of data collected in urban environments require the development of parallel approaches, in order to take advantage of scalable executions offered by Edge and Cloud environments. This paper describes the design and implementation of a parallel multi-density clustering algorithm aimed at analyzing high volumes of urban data in an efficient way. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed parallel clustering approach takes out encouraging advantages in terms of execution time, speedup, and efficiency.},

As intelligent, efficient digital systems, smart cities manage data by digitalizing all information. Despite the potential benefits of smart cities for citizen convenience, this digital information service can give rise to security and privacy issues. In particular, the challenge of relying on the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is that it is difficult for individuals to manage large amounts of data in smart city environments. In this paper, we study blockchain and Secret Sharing to address personal information protection issues in external cloud services and improve data integrity and security by designing a distributed system. CSPs are connected in a blockchain to validate user data integrity and provide easy data access through Transaction. CSP uses the blockchain to store distributed users' information safely through the Secret Sharing algorithm as a distributed system with improved security of existing centralized systems. The proposed approach demonstrates improved security and privacy through security analysis and has faster transaction speed and data storage efficiency than existing research.},

 abstract = {District 2-2 (or Saerom-dong), located in Sejong smart city, is designated as a ‘Specially Designed Zone for Women’. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the gendered dimensions of this smart city district through gender analysis. This paper analyzes the planning, implementation, and post-occupancy stages of the district through a review of guidelines of gender-mainstreaming policies of Korean cities, interviews of experts involved, and a survey of 100 residents to gain an insight into how users perceive the spatial aspects of the women-friendly walking environment. Results show that, at the planning stage, little interprofessional communication occurs between smart city experts and ‘women-friendly city’ experts. At the implementation stage, this leads to incomplete gender-mainstreaming of the district. Post-occupancy survey results reveal, however, that despite these shortcomings, both women and men perceive the ‘Specially Designed Zone for Women’ to be safe. Even so, there is a gender difference in the perception regarding smart installations. CCTVs are more important to men than women, while on-site emergency bells are more significant to women than men. This indicates that women need more active safety systems than passive surveillance systems. This paper argues that a gendered perspective is needed for the more inclusive planning of smart cities.},

 abstract = {Sustainable cities are considered paradigmatic to achieve COP27 targets, but scant literature has analyzed the association with CO2 emission (CE) mitigation policies, especially for the G7 economies. This study traces the impacts of urbanization, innovation, income, and energy consumption on CE for the G7 countries from 1995 to 2019. The time period is important due to the rapid increase in urbanization, globalization, and, at the same time, technology diffusion. The study is focused on novel and relevant panel data econometric methods that tackle cross-section dependence, non-normality of data, and heterogeneity in slope coefficients. The empirical outcome first confirms the long-run cointegrating relationship among the variables in the presence of structural breaks by employing the advanced panel cointegration test. Technologies related to environmental management and energy consumption are positively linked with CE. However, the role of income per capita is found to be inverse with CE. In contrast, the effect of urbanization in different models is mixed for CE. Innovation and its interaction with urbanization are crucial for limiting CE and promoting sustainable cities in G7 economies. This indicates that urbanization with environment-friendly innovation can help G7 countries foster sustainable cities and achieve COP27 targets in general, specifically the Sustainable Development Goal of sustainable cities. The results were tested for the multiplicative effect of different variables with urbanization and innovation. Regarding policy insights, the study recommends focusing on smart and sustainable cities with environment-related innovations and transitioning towards cleaner energy from conventional energy consumption.},

 abstract = {To develop intelligent and sustainable cities, the government of India launched initiatives like Smart Cities and the Clean Development Mission. Solid waste management (SWM) has become one of the primarily focused areas of such initiatives. The changing dynamics of urban waste characteristics due to unplanned urbanization and rapid growth in urban populations (due to migration) has been a significant concern for local authorities in urban areas to develop an effective SWM plan. The development of a long-term SWM plan along the line of the government initiatives' objectives requires understanding the waste quantities, characteristics, and existing waste management practices. This paper presents an overview of existing waste management activities, financial and institutional demographics in six selected Indian Smart Cities, and the field studies to assess SWM systems as per the waste management rules. The study involved a participatory approach to collect data from local bodies and stakeholders. Indicative strategies for the development of waste management systems were formulated based on the outputs of this analysis. Discussion on pathways includes waste characterization, funding sources, data technologies, and service level benchmarking to plan an integrated solid waste management system for a Smart City. The outcomes of this study shall equip local authorities in designing waste systems to accelerate the transition towards innovative and sustainable waste systems.},

The current cyber security development cannot keep up with the eager adoption of global smart city technologies so correct design based on deep learning methods is essential to protect smart city cyber. This paper summarizes the knowledge and interpretation of Smart Cities (SC), Cyber Security (CS), and Deep Learning (DL) concepts as well as discussed existing related work on IoT security in smart cities. Specifically, we briefly reviewed several deep learning models, including Boltzmann machines, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. Then we introduced cyber security applications and use cases based on deep learning technology in smart cities. Finally, we describe the future development trend of smart city cyber security.},

 abstract = {Owing to some special characteristics and features, blockchain is a very useful technique that can securely organize diverse devices in a smart city. It finds wide applications, especially in distributed environments, where entities such as wireless sensors need to be certain of the authenticity of the server. As contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have not been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the post-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from quantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction capacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded. Thus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm for security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used to not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to existing classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining. Meanwhile, an identity-based post-quantum signature is embedded into a transaction process to construct lightweight transactions. Subsequently, we provide a detailed description on the execution of the post-quantum lightweight transaction in a blockchain. Overall, this work can help enrich the research on future post-quantum blockchain and support the construction or architecture of emerging blockchain-based smart cities.},

Hence In this paper, to resolve such issues, Holistic Big Data Integrated Artificial Intelligent Modeling (HBDIAIM) has been proposed to improve the privacy and security aspects of data management interface in various smart city applications. In HBDIAIM, a differential evolutionary algorithm has been incorporated to build adequate security for the confidential data management interface in smart city applications.

A traffic flow prediction model is constructed based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) algorithm. The target road section and its historical traffic flow data in Tianjin are collected and pre-processed. Then, several Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are stacked together to form a DBN, which is trained as a generative model. Finally, its performance is analyzed by the simulation experiment. The algorithm model proposed is compared with Neuro Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) model, Deep Learning Architecture (DLA), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the algorithm model proposed are 4.42%, 6.21%, and 8.03%, respectively. Its prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that of the other three algorithms. In addition, the algorithm can effectively suppress the spread of congestion in the smart city, achieving timely evacuation of traffic congestion. In short, the constructed Deep Learning-based traffic flow prediction model has a high-precision prediction effect and traffic congestion evacuation performance, which can provide experimental references for the later construction of smart cities.},

 abstract = {The information and communication technology (ICT) makes the smart city exchange information with the general public and deliver higher-quality services to citizens. The collection of waste is important in smart city service and smart technology has great potential for increasing garbage collection efficiency and quality all around the world. This is a waste of resources since garbage is emptied even half-full, city resources are misused, and vehicle gas is wasted. High costs and poor effectiveness are the two main problems with smart city garbage collection. This problem can be solved by recycling since it reduces the garbage that has to be disposed of and protects valuable storage space. Although the recycling rates are rising, estimates predict that people can generate more waste than ever before. A key focus of machine learning is developing algorithms that can acquire and utilize information in the learning process to make future predictions. Therefore, this paper’s automatic machine learning-based waste recycling framework (AMLWRF) has been proposed to classify and separate materials in a mixed recycling application for improved separation of complicated waste. The major goal of this research is to examine machine learning algorithms utilized in recycling systems. This paper suggests the ML and Internet of Things (IoT) for smart waste management to overcome this problem in the smart city. The IoT-powered devices may be installed in waste containers including recycling bins and it gives real-time data on garbage generating behavior. Image processing may be used to calculate a dump’s garbage index. They offer a clear picture of trash and recycling trends and suggestions on improving productivity. This research compiles the most recent advances in recycling-related machine learning.},

Happiness reflecting citizens’ quality of life could be the gateway to sustainability, but few studies incorporated it into smart city planning. This paper clarifies the correlations between smart cities and urban happiness. The analyses show that the smart environment associated with green spaces, air pollution control, and recycling services significantly influences happiness. Moreover, improving urban infrastructure thoroughly is more critical for increasing well-being and livability than providing technical products for end users. Finally, different geographically gathered cities would face different challenges in maintaining happiness, including local (e.g., housing and population density) and global (e.g., the North-South divide) issues. Urban planners and governments must understand local and cultural contexts while cultivating global visions to identify cities’ actual needs and achieve sustainable development goals.},

Using Chinese city-level panel data, we investigate the impact of national smart city pilots on satellite-derived ground level NO2 concentrations by Difference-in-Differences method. The results show that the smart city policy is conductive to mitigating the NO2 concentrations in pilot cities, especially for the cities with large population, high administrative hierarchies and located in eastern China. In particular, the mitigation effect of first round smart city pilots is greater than the second and third rounds. The mechanisms of smart city policy mitigating NO2 concentrations is to optimize energy structure and advance treatment technology, rather than directly reduce fossil energy consumption. Therefore, smart city policy may be a win-win choice for developing countries to break the trade-off between air pollution and economic development.},

The main findings are as follows: the improvement of the government's digital governance capacity significantly contributes to green and sustainable development. After a series of placebo tests and robustness tests, the results of this paper still hold. Government digital governance promotes natural resource management mainly through two mechanisms: green technology innovation and intellectual property protection, and the quality of green technology innovation plays a more critical role than quantity. The impact of improved government digital governance on natural resource management varies significantly across different types of cities, cities with different political levels, and cities with different urban locations and human capital levels.},

Results display the SCP contributions to promoting urban green and low-carbon development. When we run the various robustness tests, the conclusions remain valid. The heterogeneity test shows that, in large cities and resource-based cities, the promotion effect is more obvious. We further test its transmission mechanism and find that SCP enhances urban green and low-carbon development by raising urban technical innovation levels, upgrading the construction of smart infrastructure and optimizing the quality of smart management and services.},

 abstract = {The establishment of smart city database requires Internet of things technology. With the continuous expansion of the scale of the Internet of things data center, the energy consumption of the data center is increasing, which greatly limits the development of the Internet of things data center. Energy consumption of Internet of things network data center in China's smart city has increased year by year, and data center network energy conservation has become a current research hotspot. The traditional network nodes are distributed and centralized innovatively to complete centralized control, and the controller completes the collection of the whole network information, the maintenance of network status, the distribution of flow entry, etc. Firstly, the energy-saving model of digital center network and the model data center network traffic prediction algorithm based on the principle of high accuracy traffic prediction are constructed, and an energy-saving multi-layer virtual traffic scheduling algorithm is proposed. Secondly, the two algorithms are fused, and finally an empirical study is carried out. The results show that in Random mode, the energy consumption ratio of energy-efficient multi-layer virtual-software defined networking (EMV-SDN) is the lowest, and the maximum reduction of energy consumption ratio reaches 7.8% compared with equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) algorithm. In Staggered mode and Stride mode, the energy consumption ratio of EMV-SDN algorithm is the lowest. Compared with the actual data flow, the prediction result of K-means-support vector machine (KM-SVM) algorithm is closer to the actual result, and the maximum error between the predicted value and the actual value of KM-SVM algorithm is 1.2 ​Gbps. However, the maximum error of balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies-support vector machine (B-SVM) algorithm reaches 3.1 ​Gbps; the prediction accuracy of KM-SVM algorithm is always higher than that of B-SVM algorithm in both discontinuous data flow and continuous actual data flow; the accuracy of KM-SVM algorithm in different experiments is high; among the energy consumption ratios of the combined algorithm, the energy consumption ratio of EMV-SDN algorithm is the lowest under the three communication modes, and the performance of the algorithm constructed in this study is higher than that of other algorithms in simulation operation; when the traffic prediction algorithm is combined with the virtual topology energy conservation control algorithm, the network structure change is reduced and the network stability is increased in this study. In the delay comparison of EMV-SDN algorithm, ECMP algorithm, and Dijkstra algorithm in the three communication modes, the EMV-SDN algorithm has the best performance. The results of this study provide an improvement direction for the development of Internet of Things technology and the construction of smart cities.},

 abstract = {Globalization has facilitated productivity gains and economic growth and for decades. It has helped integrate emerging economies, spread technology, knowledge, culture, and created an interconnected global community. Smart cities depend on a robust and flexible mobile network foundation, and yet, Thailand is leading the way in the ASEAN. Using Thailand as a case study, this paper presents a practical mobile network planning and optimization framework (PMNPO) that’s workable for the fourth-generation up to sixth-generation networks in smart cities, especially in an industrial estate. While theoretical frameworks play a vital role in optimizing network performance, such frameworks may not be practical enough. This study applies a mixed quantitative research method on actual applications (case studies) and qualitative research. The PMNPO is a management function of pseudo-codes. A workable cost-sharing model for mobile networks consists of CAPEX, OPEX, feasibility study, and site value management (mobile network operators). The fair factor (0.2), the payback (5 years), the NPV ($0.5 million), and the IRR (20%) reveal a promising financial prospect. The PMNPO is practical for Thailand, with a mean acceptance rate of 4.83. Therefore, the findings support stakeholders, policymakers, and decision-makers, in setting telecommunication policies. The results can apply to other developing countries or catalyze a similar research type.},

Smart public lighting systems are designed using LED light sources in combination with a controller based on light intensity and motion sensors to control the brightness in working areas as per standard requirements. The control of smart public lighting systems is designed to operate in three modes: manual, scheduled, and auto modes, which are tested and compared in terms of lighting and power quality. Other functions of IoT, such as air pollution detection, security system-based video surveillance, and warning systems for flood disasters, are integrated into smart public lighting systems. A prototype of the designed smart public lighting system is presented in this paper. The parameters of average illuminance, overall uniformity, and threshold increment were implemented using DIALux software to optimise the luminaire spacing. The results showed that the goal of energy saving could be achieved using the auto mode. Although the automatic mode caused current harmonic distortion to the electrical grid, the harmonic value was less than the specified standard. Furthermore, the precision of IoT system operation was dependent on environmental variations and the reliability of wireless network technology.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a pervasive computing technology that provides solutions to critical sustainable smart city applications. Each sustainable application has its own set of requirements, including energy efficiency, Quality of Service (QoS), hardware, and software resources. Even though green IoT devices operate in a resource-constrained environment. Monitoring, recognizing, and responding to activities that entail continuous access to timely information in a partially or fully distributed ecosystem is a difficult task. To overcome the challenges of resource management in the IoT, we proposed an energy-efficient Dynamic Clustering Routing (DCR) protocol using a neuro-fuzzy technique for restricting the resources of IoT devices. The proposed protocol uses a dynamic self-organizing neural network to create dynamic clusters in a network. The test-bed analysis is for computing the real-time event detection and clustering sensor nodes using TinyOS. The simulation result shows that the proposed protocol achieved a significant gain over peer-competing well-known green communication routing protocols like Low-energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Low-energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy-Centralized (LEACH-C). The proposed model results show that using neuro-fuzzy logic is effective for sustainable IoT devices and green smart city applications in terms of resource management and dynamic clustering. The result analysis shows that the proposed protocol shows an average 35% significant gain on the First Node Dies (FND), Last Node Dies (LND), the number of packets sent to CH & BS, network convergence time, network overhead, and average packet delay to compare with the LEACH and LEACH-C.},

To address these problems, various studies have been conducted to determine an improvement method for the energy performance of aged buildings by adopting the smart city concept. However, because they have primarily focused on the software aspects of monitoring and control using IT technologies, studies on the hardware aspects (that is, the characteristics of buildings and renovation techniques for energy saving) that affect energy performance have been underrepresented in the context of smart cities. Therefore, by using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, this study aims to analyze the causal relationship by examining how the characteristics of buildings and energy-saving techniques affect the energy performance of EU smart city projects. To implement SEM for depicting causal relationships, a case study based on 55 building cases on 11 EU smart city projects was conducted, and the significant direct/indirect effects of hardware aspects on energy-saving performance were successfully suggested.},

These cities will act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. The results from the expressions of interest suggest that the Mission's objectives are shared by a significant number of cities: 314 EU cities (representing 18% of EU population) plus 48 non-EU cities declared their ambition and preparedness to become climate neutral. Transport is a key sector to address, with the overwhelming majority of applicant cities setting specific targets and policy measures. Electrification of urban transport appears as the main approach towards decarbonization. Nevertheless, the required investments and the repercussion on the citizens’ costs for mobility are major concerns.},

 abstract = {This study aims to examine the impact of smart city construction on the ecological environment quality (EEQ) of China. Due to the problems arising from urbanisation, local governments construct smart cities as inherent innovative advantages that can improve their level of science and technology, and efficiency in resource allocation, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Through this innovation-driven channel, shocks to the degree of city smartness can have a significant impact on the regional environment. In order to compute the sensitivity of urban pollution to the degree of city smartness in China both conceptually and empirically, we modify a theoretical model of classic land allocation decisions to demonstrate how local officials’ responsibilities to protect the ecological environment and promote economic growth can lead to the long-run spatial expansion of smart cities, resulting in the improvement of EEQ. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, we find that from 2005 to 2017 period, smart city initiatives in China reduced industrial exhaust gas and industrial wastewater by approximately 20.7% and 12.2%, respectively, such that most of the reduction may be attributed to the technology effect and allocation effect of urban innovation.},

The public value of having a higher municipal credit rating reduces borrowing costs and consequently lowers the cost to manage government programs. In this article, the relationship between credit ratings and local governments' decisions to utilize one of the first sets of information and communications technology (ICT) innovations is investigated—the 311 system (non-emergency versions of 911 that use phone, web, and mobile application interfaces)—the analysis pairs longitudinal financial data with information on the implementation of 311 systems. The results of our analysis demonstrate that access to 311 systems, particularly web/mobile-based 311, can positively influence a city's credit rating. Additionally, we find that the length of time since 311 was adopted is positively related to credit ratings. The effect is visible with phone-based and web/mobile-based 311. These results suggest that cities with 311 systems and those with 311 in place longer have higher credit ratings. These results could indicate that cities with 311 are better managed or simply more transparent to investors, thus posing lower risks.},

Yet, it is not clear how policymakers narrow down the topics to focus on with respect to their smart city agenda. As a result, the aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical contribution that explains how local governments define their smart city policy agenda. It is suggested that the agenda is influenced by policy priorities at the local level from other urban domains. To support this notion, policy studies literature is used to show that three streams of problems, policy, and politics, when aligned, set the policy agenda. The smart city agenda will be formed from key ideas existing at the local political level, such as policy priorities, that have now been matched with solutions framed in the smart city context, all underpinned by a favourable political environment. In addition, from smart city policy related documents, a topic modelling analysis illustrates a set of topics that are associated to the smart city policy agenda in two cities, London and Melbourne. This shows how some topics on the smart city agenda can be likened to issues that are the primary topic of another policy domain.},

However, little is known about the factors that may increase collaboration amongst smart city stakeholders. Through a digital government lens, we first elaborate the nature of multi-stakeholder collaboration in the smart city. Then, we adopt a contingency approach to unpack the factors that affect the intensity of collaboration between the stakeholders in the smart city ecosystem. To characterize the ecosystem, we use the quadruple-helix framework. Through the perspective of the local government, we derive hypotheses on whether certain factors lead to more intensive collaboration, which are tested on a sample of Belgian municipalities. Our findings reveal the importance of smart city strategies for intensifying collaboration between the local government and stakeholders in the ecosystem. Moreover, we also find that for large ecosystems, a smart city manager or department may facilitate collaboration amongst stakeholders. Taken together, our findings indicate that there are certain configurational approaches to increasing collaboration in smart cities, which will depend on the context of a city.},

The development of smart cities presents opportunities for the development of new, digitally supported health and social infrastructure in urban and rural areas. These innovations will enable a more efficient combination of existing societal resources in neighbourhoods for the provision of health care and social needs to the ageing residents who are dependent on others due to illness or functional decline. On the supply side, new scientific and technological innovations offer new utilities and create new businesses for the supply of goods and services to older people, and provide new job opportunities for younger workers entering the job market.

 abstract = {Smart cities are rapidly becoming the main form of urban development initiated in response to calls to address certain ills such as unsustainable cities. Often presented as rational responses to such challenges, there are affective dimensions which are political and impact their development in various places. We investigate these affective dimensions by using the concept of atmospheres -collective affects arising from encounters between places, actors, materialities and (hi)stories. Our work builds on the premise that acceptance of smart city initiatives relies on their supporter’s ability to disseminate compelling stories about smart urban futures. Atmospheres matter here because the stories that can be credibly told are not arbitrary – to be believed, urban stories must be embedded in and coupled to the materialities and affects of their environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the deliberate cultivation of atmospheres by actors with urban remits, revealing how such atmospheres can become impactful mechanisms for selectively rendering cities amenable or refractory to different stories about smart urban futures. An in-depth case study of the English new town of Milton Keynes is presented to illustrate how atmospheres have been cultivated to selectively resist or reinforce the stories through which the smart city agenda is advanced. Narratives about rationality and data-driven efficiency were translated into specific versions of the future. The resulting encounters gave rise to atmospheres of reception, anticipation, innovation and progress through which urban spaces were rendered selectively receptive to specific forms of smart development in pursuit of local, contextually defined goals.},

In her study of ‘Surveillance Capitalism’, Shoshana Zuboff cites Google’s parent firm Alphabet’s legal customer-purchase agreement for the parent firm’s Nest thermostats.

This is for data harvesting, analytics, processing, manipulation and transformation through digital re-sale to the same and other consumers in the form of unwanted, targeted advertising. The point of this identity ‘rendition’ is to massively augment corporate profits. It is but a short step from trapping the unwitting consumer in a ‘smart home’ to planning a similarly mediated ‘smart city’ aimed at further massively augmenting corporate profits. This is happening, as founders of digital media from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla either commission or become beneficiaries of ‘smart city’ planning. However, there is evidence that such imperiousness is increasingly countered by emerging democratic critique of these new ‘model villages’ or ‘company towns’.},

 abstract = {This book chapter describes the evolutionary journey of cities with relevance to hydroinformatics: all the significant steps and advancement in technology from the primitive form of urbanization to the conceptualization and creation of modern smart cities. A smart city is characterized by the interaction between three conceptual components: technology, people and institutions assessed and developed through six distinct characteristics: economy, people, governance, mobility, environment and living. With the growing world population, the amount of clean and fresh water required in cities is increasing. Although water is part of critical urban infrastructure, many smart cities do not include smart water management in their visions. Hydroinformatics is the key link between smart cities and smart water management. It is a science that is not only about modeling and decisions support, but it also considers the social dimension of water cycle management, including social needs, concerns, and consequences. Hydroinformatics takes full advantage of the proliferation of remotely sensed information from space and ground-based sensors with increased capabilities in terms of spatial and temporal resolutions generated by the advancements in smart city technologies. Applications of hydroinformatics in the urban environment have increased in recent years. Smart cities technologies and infrastructures offer the potential of linking together all the aspects of the urban water cycle and can lead to the development of an integrated smart water cycle management.},

 abstract = {A Comprehensive theory of Smart Cities continues to elude scholars. This seems to result from ontological uncertainty surrounding the Smart City and who it serves. Such uncertainty has led to the techno-centric versus human-centric debate currently dominating the Smart City discussion. This paper adopts a systems approach to stratify society into three strata: the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and system (macro). I implement a systematic review of the Smart City literature to examine how Smart Cities are conceptualized. From an analysis of 41 papers, this research identifies a dualistic phenomenon occurring at all points in the stratified city system: sources of innovation (SOI) and Loci of change (LOC). Here, SOI refers to the perceptions of deficiencies which initiate the learning curve of innovation, while LOC refers to the structures which allow the learning curve to disseminate through the system. This analysis highlights an overemphasis on the organizational stratum and insufficient attention to the individual and system strata. To address this shortfall, I introduce the Social Innovation Cycle. This multi-level social innovation framework incorporates the interdependencies of SOI and LOC to link all strata, mitigate power asymmetries, and reduce marginalization. In so doing, I delineate where policy implementation can be directed for holistically developing the Smart City. I recommend that Smart City policy should target the intersection of SOI and LOC in pursuit of human-centricity.},

 abstract = {With the immense increase of population density, many challenges facing organizations and governments. Thus, it has become mandatory to turn up our cities to be intelligent by introducing IoT and smart grids to build smart buildings, smart communication technologies, smart healthcare systems, smart transportation, etc. Smart cities guarantee the healthy living of indoor inhabitants by sensing, processing and controlling all possible indoor–outdoor measures. In this paper, we develop a framework that systematically builds a reliable and secure Smart City Model (SCM) to be integrated then exploited by the building information model (BIM). SCM encloses both physical and digital models which highlight smart buildings in particular. First, the proposed solution identifies and models SCM components including their appropriate architectures that are responsible for communication, extension, information flow, and protection. To ensure SCM functional and security requirements, we develop a sound hybrid approach that relies on formal methods and network analysis. Uppaal model checker is used to verify the satisfiability of the smart city requirements whereas Cooja is deployed to simulate the connectivity and the communication coverage of the developed SCM. The obtained results, in Uppaal, showed that the different implemented scenarios are satisfying the functional correctness and security policies. Moreover, the simulation through Cooja showed that how different obstacles and positions of nodes affect the communication coverage and the energy consumption regarding the deployed nodes. Experimentally, the effectiveness of the developed framework has been shown through practical scenarios that are difficult to model and analyze.},

 abstract = {Face emotion recognition (FER) has found several applications across numerous industries. One such application area lies in the field of human–computer interaction, where it can improve user experiences by allowing systems to adjust based on users’ emotional states by leveraging the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate more responsive interactions. The increasing demand for precise and immediate emotion analysis across various applications drives the need for FER utilizing deep transfer learning (DTL). In this study, a novel Mist-Fog framework for real-time FER is introduced, which employs a DTL algorithm called Mobile-Net for quick and easy image classification on mobile and embedded devices. It addresses the challenges of operating deep neural networks (DNN) under limits on power and processing resources. By utilizing depth-wise separable convolutions, the MobileNet algorithm reduces computational complexity while maintaining reasonable accuracy on the FER-2013 dataset. A Fog-based architecture, in which a mist layer comprising edge devices like Raspberry-Pi (RPi), an ARM-based single-board computer, was considered for a smart city scenario. Further, the M/M/1/K queuing system was considered, which follows the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling criteria and a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) arrival rate to evaluate the system’s performance. The effectiveness of this novel approach towards industrial computer vision paradigms is assessed pertaining to different performance criteria.},

We reflect on approaches that leverage smart city maturity models to capture the evolution and trajectory of a city in its quest for smartness. By adopting the cross-methodology borrowed from the macroeconomics domain, we illustrate how a maturity model can be actionable in the sense that it can reveal the equilibria of supply and demand of a given smart city dimension or parameter. To evaluate this methodology, we study a well-known use case in cybersecurity, specifically incident response, against crowdsourcing, a key enabler of a data-driven circular economy. Our findings confirm that when crowdsourcing is injected into smart city infrastructure, the city's maturity is expected to increase as the additional capabilities can contribute to addressing cybersecurity incidents.},

 abstract = {As cities worldwide adopt various high-tech solutions to solve emerging urban problems, transition toward greater smartness becomes a global trend. The question, however, remains how the cities’ progress towards greater smartness can be monitored and measured. Although different smart city (SC) classifications exist, these classifications are not always balanced, with some of them placing an emphasis on ICTs and infrastructure, while others prioritize social performance of cities and their physical environment. In this study, we suggest a relatively simple SC ranking system, based on two basic principles – direct relevance to human welfare and equal representation of key dimensions of sustainability. The proposed assessment system, composed of nine quantitative metrics, is applied to 100+ major cities worldwide, helping us to identify the best and the worst SC performers. As the study also reveals, there are clear regional differences in the interpretation components and underlying dimensions of SCs with an emphasis on “economy and technology” in North America, “the environment” in Europe, and “society” in Asia.},

Question, however, remains whether the accumulation of these attributes results in tangible benefits for local residents. To answer this question, we compare different metrices of city smartness with several indicators of intra–urban income disparity and environmental performance, using data available for 100+ major cities worldwide. As the analysis indicates, the proliferation of internet technologies and the number of universities the city hosts, i.e., popular ways of advancing “smartness”, are not related to either intra–urban income disparity or environmental performance of cities per se. We thus suggest that the transition of cities towards greater smartness should be focused on people's needs and ICT-using skills, not on ICT proliferation per se. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that links the level of city smartness with intra–urban income inequality and environmental performance of cities and substantiates these links empirically. By accumulating this knowledge, the study helps to understand better the smart city phenomenon and its impact on urban development.},

Smart cities are reconceptualized as smart social substances forming the basis of social interactions in which citizens themselves are involved in negotiating human–computer interactions in the processes of social learning, negotiating and adapting to ICT devices, and prompting behavior change to achieve the desired condition in the cities. In this study, responses from 548 citizens living in China in an online questionnaire are examined using a structural equation modeling technique for data analysis, and a theoretical model is proposed based on social learning theory. The results reveal that high-quality responsiveness and information content of a digital learning service have a significant positive effect on commitment to community and ICT self-efficacy. Additionally, we find that commitment to community and ICT self-efficacy have a significant positive effect on online civic engagement. Moreover, commitment to community mediates the effect of information content, responsiveness, and environment quality on online civic engagement. Our research findings suggest that, in their efforts to improve online civic engagement, smart city implementation practitioners can enhance citizens’ individual commitment to community and foster ICT self-efficacy via high-quality ICT devices and digital learning services.},

The main objective of this research is to propose a multidimensional assessment of cities from the aspects of a smart and sustainable city, through a sorting multicriteria analysis. Therefore, the model developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) was adapted and the FITradeoff method was used because it requires only partial information. The applicability of the proposal was illustrated by an application to Brazilian capitals. The results show that there is weakness on the part of the Brazilian capitals in relation to their access to and development of technology, innovation, local attractiveness and economic issues. Moreover, the capitals of the Northeast region of Brazil have lower performance compared to the cities of the South, Southeast and Midwest regions. Finally, this study can serve as a support tool in the decision process for managers, city planners and private sector entities seeking development strategies in relation to the theme, as well as helping to mitigate the gap found in the literature.},

 abstract = {The Smart City is a fuzzy concept, which integrates numerous characteristics, components and dimensions. These characteristics are challenged in the academic literature, especially the technocentric approach and the central position of private companies. Moreover, the lack of proper conceptualisation pushes cities to claim themselves ‘smart’. Finally, there are few rigorous analytical or statistical analyses of the concept and its application to territories. Therefore, this paper studies how Belgian municipalities understand the concept of Smart Cities in 2016. Based on the groundwork of literature on Smart Cities and the results of a survey of 113 Belgian municipalities, a typology of four understandings of the Smart City (technological, societal, comprehensive and non-existent) is elaborated. The results also show that municipalities with no understanding of the Smart City concept or with a technical understanding are mostly located in small and rural municipalities. This could be a sign of rejection of the phenomenon in this context. Conversely, medium and large-sized municipalities mostly develop a societal or comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this study highlights a dichotomy of understanding and acceptance of the concept of the Smart City between peripheral (rural and small size municipalities) and central municipalities (urban, medium and large size municipalities).},

The reality is that the maintenance approaches and systems that are currently in use at inner city public bus services are based on previous technological and industrialization methods. Smart maintenance and Industry 4.0 technologies can be used to optimize maintenance at inner city public bus services to support informed decision-making. This paper presents the development of a smart maintenance system for these organizations to minimize the downtime caused by unexpected breakdowns and ensure inner city buses operate reliably. Designing the smart maintenance system is done by considering the findings from an extensive literature review and the feedback from structured interviews with bus service representatives. The system validation is performed as a case study with an industry partner. For conducting the case study, a concept demonstrator is designed according to the defined system and addresses the main problem causing downtime of the buses at the industry partner.

An earthquake has some effect on the environment due to the sudden movement of tectonic plates known as Earthquake Environmental Effects (EEE). These changes can be divided into 2 categories namely primary (e.g. subsidence, surface faulting) and secondary effects (displaced rocks, tsunami, landslides). In this paper, the major contribution revolves around earthquakes and their analysis. Earthquakes occur due to the shifting of tectonic plates on the lithosphere. These movements occur due to the Frictional stress between gliding plate borders builds up and leads to fault line failure. This sudden shaking of the plates releases a certain kind of energy in the Lithosphere which creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are also categorized into different classes ranging from minor to great, depending on their magnitude.},

However, data privacy becomes a real issue. This problem can be addressed by using federated learning trusted authority principle. In this paper, we investigate a novel federated deep learning approach to urban traffic flow forecasting that graph learning, and trusted authority mechanism. The road network is first pre-processed to eliminate the noise from the traffic data. Next, detecting anomalous features is performed to prune irrelevant edges and patterns. The generated graph is then utilized to learn a graph convolutional neural network for calculating the future city’s traffic flow. We extensive evaluate our federated learning-based framework, where a case study on predicting the future traffic flows has been carried out using multiple datasets. We examine it with different baseline techniques as well. The findings show that the suggested framework greatly outperforms the baseline methods, particularly when the graph has a lot of nodes. Importantly, our approach is the first one that integrates trusted authority principle in federated learning and, by doing so, it is able to efficiently secure model data. Moreover, the average precision of the developed model reached 84%, while the baseline solutions did not exceed 77%.},

Taking 153 cities from China as the research sample, we evaluated the impact of smart city policy (SCP) on urban ecological total factor energy efficiency (ETFEE) using the generalized synthetic control method. The main results are as follows. (1) SCP significantly improves urban ETFEE after controlling the endogeneity and unobserved time-varying confounders, and this conclusion is strongly supported by multiple robustness tests. (2) There is a two-stage mediating mechanism through which SCP functions. Specifically, SCP promotes innovation by enhancing intelligence (including informatization, human capital, and technology), thereby improving urban ETFEE. (3) Public participation and market conditions play moderating effects, and they improve the contribution of SCP on urban ETFEE. (4) For heterogeneity, SCP plays a significant role in eastern cities, large-size cities, non-resource-based cities, and non-old industrial base cities, whereas it has little impact on other cities’ ETFEE.

 abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the main component in the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities to sense our environment, gather essential and meaningful data, and forward it to the base station (BS). Nowadays, IoT utilizes WSN as a necessary platform for sensing and communication of the data. One of the main strategies to minimize consumption of energy in a WSN with highly dense sensors is to maximize sleeping sensors at each time. This way implies to schedule the activity of sensors, i.e. determining when a sensor node is kept idle (sleep mode) and when a sensor node is activated to sense environment (active mode). Due to heterogeneity of the sensor nodes in WSNs-based IoT for smart cities, one approach for scheduling the sensing activity is clustering the sensors into K mutually different subsets, so that every subset of sensors alone can cover all targets of the network. In this case, we can solve finding the maximum number of sensor subsets, or equivalently sensor covers problem, by conversion it to SET K-COVER problem. In this paper, an energy aware Grouping Memetic Algorithm (GMA) is proposed for solving the SET K-COVER problem. The proposed GMA varies in four general ways from any of the other evolutionary algorithms for solving the SET K-COVER problem. First, to transform solution structures linked to the SET K-COVER problem into chromosome genes, a new encoding scheme was being used. Second, specific genetic operators appropriate for the chromosomes are used, based on the encoding used. Third, to direct the search process in the solution space of the SET K-COVER problem, a novel proper fitness function is proposed. Fourth, a local improvement algorithm which uses a sensor dominance rule is proposed. This study, carried out detailed experiments of different numbers of targets and different numbers of sensors in WSNs to assess the proposed algorithm. In several instances of the problem, the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm works considerably better in terms of solution quality than many other heuristics and evolutionary algorithms and significantly outperformed the evolutionary algorithms in terms of runtime, suggesting the usefulness of the proposed algorithm to increase the lifetime of WSN in IoT and smart cities.},

 abstract = {This paper envisions alternative scenarios for future cities that are resilient environmentally, socially, economically, and embedded in smart infrastructure and governance. It reinforces the position that although complementary, the backcasting approach is more appropriate for future city planning. There is limited research that envisions how future cities can be backcasted with frugal innovation (FI) underpinning the sustainability pillars. This research aims to narrow the gap. The methodology is based on a systematic literature review and secondary exploratory case studies. The results of the TOWS (threats, opportunities, weaknesses, strengths) analysis on the suitability of FI on smart sustainable cities (SSC) developmental policies show that FI is an affordable and inclusive way to sustainably develop cities without injury to the environment. The findings reveal that the five pillars of a smart sustainable future city can integrate frugal innovation and lean engineering concepts to ensure sustainable development at lower costs. Through frugal innovation embedded in city infrastructure, cleaner methods of production can be realized, and inclusiveness can be fostered.},

 abstract = {Studies from the field of smart city development show that smart cities attract more people from the nearby countryside along with an increasing number of tourists. While many smart tourism concepts focus solely on the development of technology, people, and institutional logic, the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EES) approach helps to strengthen smart destinations on their way to fostering the development of urban sustainability. As part of an evaluation of the EES, qualitative interviews (n = 14) with key informants demonstrate the importance of entrepreneurship for the development of smart destinations. To identify the relevant factors for this kind of smart city positioning, the following study aims to explore, test, and analyze smart city aspects among experts in terms of EES, residents, and tourists visiting Innsbruck. The present study uses both face-to-face interviews and surveys to explore initiatives and targets within the city's EES development as perceived by core stakeholders. It applies a questionnaire measuring local residents' and tourists' perceptions of important smart city attributes (n = 336). The data shows that residents believe Innsbruck has the potential to become a smart city. Furthermore, the data confirms that the EES approach benefits from the tourism industry in the region, with tourism found to improve the respective EES elements, consequently leading to enhanced entrepreneurial activity.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based Ambient Assisted Living systems play an important role in smart cities by improving the quality of life of the elderly population. Many Ambient Assisted Living systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes. Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for Android Apps. The proposed algorithms can improve the privacy protection of Ambient Assisted Living App users in smart cities and relieve them through cognitive offloading.},

 abstract = {Vehicular networks are getting huge attention among the research community due to its tremendous potential to offer diversified applications and services to the drivers and passengers towards the realization of intelligent transportation system (ITS) for connected living and sustainable smart cities. Cloud computing (CC), which possesses large capacity in terms of computing and storage resource, may not be suitable for many vehicular applications like safety and emergency services due to high bandwidth requirement and large response time. Edge or fog computing can be a promising technology that can be integrated with vehicular networks to meet the requirements of less bandwidth usage and lower response time. Vehicular cloud network (VCN) extends cloud computing concepts among the vehicles in the vehicular networks to enable vehicles with excess computing, storage or bandwidth capacities to share the resources with other vehicles, who are willing to use that extra resource to fulfill their service requirements. Security poses a great challenge in a vehicular network due to high mobility, dynamic and frequent changes in topology and sudden variation in vehicle density in the roads. Privacy of the vehicular users must be ensured to encourage mass participation for making the system trustworthy. Both security and privacy are pre-requisites of a sustainable smart city. For secured service provisioning, before transmitting a message, connected vehicles must be authenticated. In this paper, we have proposed a system to authenticate vehicles for secured service provisioning in edge-enabled vehicular cloud networks. A novel technique has been developed to avoid redundant authentication to validate a vehicle successively across various RSUs (road side units). Extensive simulation works have been done and the outputs demonstrate efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

Simultaneously, people are no longer relying on traditional news channels to enlighten themselves about the epidemic situation. Alternately, smart cities citizens are relying more on Social Network Service (SNS) to follow the latest news and information regarding the outbreak, share their opinions, and express their feelings and symptoms. In this paper, we propose an SNS Big Data Analysis Framework for COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction in Smart Sustainable Healthy City, where Twitter platform is adopted. Over 10000 Tweets were collected during two months, 38% of users aged between 18 and 29, while 26% are between 30 and 49 years old. 56% of them are males and 44% are females. The geospatial location is USA, and the used language is English. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is deployed to filter the tweets. Results demonstrated an outbreak cluster predicted seven days earlier than the confirmed cases with an indicator of 0.989. Analyzing data from SNS platforms enabled predicting future outbreaks several days earlier, and scientifically reduce the infection rate in a smart sustainable healthy city environment.},

 abstract = {The principal goals of smart cities are to improve citizens' quality of life and foster economic growth while ensuring efficient service delivery and sustainable development. Accordingly, understanding and adequately meeting citizens' needs and desires is a fundamental step toward improving citizens' happiness. While prior studies have investigated the direct relationship between technology readiness and continuous intention to use the services, extant results are still fragmented. Hence, this study examines the relationship between citizens' readiness and intention to continue usage by introducing satisfaction and discomfort as mediators in a smart city services (SCS) context. We rely on a mixed-method approach to propose and validate a new readiness model for assessing smart city citizens' readiness for continuous usage and long-term adoption of SCS. In the first phase, qualitative research was used by conducting in-depth interviews with SCS experts to investigate and theorize the main factors perceived as enablers and inhibitors to the continuous usage of SCS. While in the second quantitative phase, data were collected from 350 citizens and structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings suggest three main enablers (empowerment, optimism, and innovativeness) and three main inhibitors (insecurity, mistrust, and legal considerations) that affect the intention to continuously use SCS. In the quantitative phase, satisfaction and discomfort emerged as mediators to intention of continuous usage. Moreover, we found that empowerment, innovativeness, and optimism enhance the continuous usage of SCS when mediated by satisfaction but have no significant effect when mediated by discomfort. Discomfort was found to be an effective mediator between inhibitors and continued usage intention. Our study highlights the role of technology readiness as a personality trait in shaping user satisfaction, discomfort, and intention to continue using SCS. Furthermore, it proposes a new scale and model for measuring users’ readiness to adopt and continuously use SCS. The proposed model has practical implications for SCS providers, and can inform the design of future SCS and ensure their sustainable and successful adoption by citizens, not only initially, but also in the long-term.},

 abstract = {The platforms supporting the smart city applications are rarely implemented from scratch by a municipality and/or totally owned by a single company, but are more typically realized by integrating some existing ICT infrastructures thanks to a supporting platform, such as the well known FIWARE platform. Such a multi-tenant deployment model is required to lower the initial investment costs to implement large scale solutions for smart cities, but also imposes some key security obstacles. In fact, smart cities support critical applications demanding to protect the data and functionalities from malicious and unauthorized uses. Equipping the supporting platforms with proper means for access control is demanding, but these means are typically implemented according to a centralized approach, where a single server stores and makes available a set of identity attributes and authorization policies. Having a single root of trust is not suitable in a distributed and cooperating scenario of large scale smart cities due to their multi-tenant deployment. In fact, each of the integrated system has its own set of security policies, and the other systems need to be aware of these policy, in order to allow a seamless use of the same credentials across the overall infrastructure (realizing what is known as the single-sign-on). This imposes the problem of consistent and secure data replicas within a distributed system, which can be properly approached by using the blockchain technology. Therefore, this work proposes a novel solution for distributed management of identity and authorization policies by leveraging on the blockchain technology to hold a global view of the security policies within the system, and integrating it in the FIWARE platform. A detailed assessment is provided to evaluate the goodness of the proposed approach and to compare it with the existing solutions.},

 abstract = {With the decreasing cost of green technologies and the increasing ambitions to reach the net-zero carbon emissions target, more communities are engaged in renewable deployment and energy-intensive technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles will be intensively adopted in the near future. The integration of these appliances in lower grid levels will likely require grid reinforcements. However, some of these appliances are flexible and there is an opportunity to explore their flexibility potential to optimise the investment costs further. This paper proposes an optimal design strategy for a grid-connected site that returns the renewable generation and storage’s optimal sizing capacities and the required network reinforcement capacity. The novelty of the work is integrating network upgrade costs and considering flexibility from distributed flexible resources across planning and operation. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer piecewise linear problem, with the capacities of generation, storage and network upgrade as decision variables. The piecewise linear cost function related to the upgrade costs figuring in the objective function is then recast as a mixed-integer problem, and the flexible resources are modelled through an approximation method as a single virtual flexible asset. The application of the strategy on the Perth West smart city project as a case study demonstrates the importance of considering flexibility in the planning phase. The costs related to the storage system can decrease by up to 76%, and the overall costs by up to 35%, with the highest levels of savings, reached for the highest rates of electric vehicle adoption.},

 abstract = {Renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial technologies for achieving sustainable cities. However, intermittent power generation from renewable energy sources and increased peak load due to EV charging can pose technical challenges for the power systems. Improved load matching through energy system optimization can minimize these challenges. This paper assesses the optimal urban-scale energy matching potentials in a net-zero energy city powered by wind and solar energy, considering three EV charging scenarios: opportunistic charging, smart charging, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G). A city on the west coast of Sweden is used as a case study. The smart charging and V2G schemes aim to minimize the mismatch between generation and load, and are formulated as quadratic programming problems. The simulation results show that the optimal load matching performance is achieved in a net-zero energy city with the V2G scheme and a wind-PV electricity production share of 70:30. The load matching performance in the optimal net-zero energy city is increased from 68% with opportunistic charging to 73% with smart charging and further to 84% with V2G. It is also shown that a 2.4 GWh EV battery participating in the V2G scheme equals 1.4 GWh stationary energy storage in improving urban-scale load matching performance. The findings indicate that EVs have a high potential to provide flexibility to urban energy systems.},

The employment of passive-based techniques to minimize energy consumption is one of the requirements of smart cities. In this study, the thermal behavior of three buildings in the presence of PCM is discussed. The first building has no PCM and has a wall thickness of 29 cm, but the second and third buildings have PCM and a wall thickness of 34 cm. In general, the installation of PCM in the northern, southern, eastern, and western walls is beneficial, as it reduced heat exchange by 63.5% in PCM-filled buildings compared to the reference one. The thickness of PCM is increased from 5 to 10 and 20 cm, and it is found that energy exchange in the second building is less than that in the first building by 4500, 7546 and 11,681 kWhyear at 5, 10, and 20 cm respectively. Although the increase in thickness is less effective for the third building, the amount of energy-saving is equal to 17120, 19835, and 21,215 kWhyear at 5, 10, and 20 cm.},

 abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer technology have been promising for empowering and enabling seamless operation of wireless sensors and developing sustainable systems such as wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). Relying on this technology and focusing on WRSNs, this paper proposes an adaptive charging scheduling algorithm called the three-stage fuzzy metaheuristic algorithm (TSFM) by using the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and a multiobjective function designed to meet the application requirements of WRSNs in smart cities. The TSFM algorithm benefits from the WOA for the automated configuration and optimization of the fuzzy rule-base table in a three-stage fuzzy inference system for clustering, routing, and scheduling mobile charging simultaneously. Unlike the other methods, the TSFM algorithm determines the ratio of effect of fuzzy input parameters of every stage based on application and environment in addition to considering effective parameters for every stage, especially for charging scheduling (e.g., the energy of a charge-request node, the distance between a charge-request node and a mobile charging (MC), the density of a charge-request node, the average energy consumption rate of a charge-request node, and the time elapsed after a charge request). Furthermore, for the proper distribution of energy in a network, better responsiveness, and optimal use of a charging robot, two energy thresholds are defined in the TSFM algorithm, namely as the charging request issue threshold and the charging operation completion threshold. The TSFM algorithm is adaptable to applications, environments, and requirements of WRSNs not only by using the features of nodes (as the fuzzy input parameters) but also by considering the application-specific features, environments, and infrastructure (e.g., network size, number of nodes, base station (BS) positions, and designer’s goals) within the process of optimizing tunable parameters. The TSFM algorithm was evaluated and compared with some common methods such as FCFS, NJNP, and ESS in terms of functional metrics such as energy utility, charging latency, survival rate, death rate of nodes, system stability, number of packets received by BS, number of request nodes, number of alive nodes, average residual energy, adaptability analysis, and statistical validation in two scenarios and six applications. According to the simulation results, the proposed TSFM algorithm improved the performance criteria and outperformed the other methods by far in terms of application. For instance, the TSFM algorithm improved the minimum system stability rate by 167%, 0.73%, and 123% compared with FCFS, NJNP, and ESS methods, respectively.},

 abstract = {Achieving a sustainable state in smart cities would require ongoing monitoring and evaluation of all activities in different dimensions. Hence, it is essential to use smart systems and adaptable, reliable, and controllable schemes in all dimensions of smart cities. This paper focuses on the on-demand wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) to allow for ongoing and sustainable monitoring and provide application-based services matching goals, conditions, and the environment within in smart cities. Overcoming the challenge of energy limitation, WRSNs are more reliable than wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Hence, the paper proposes a calibration fuzzy-metaheuristic clustering routing scheme (CFMCRS) for on-demand WRSNs. The proposed CFMCRS benefits from resource-saving and energy supplementary techniques in addition to using metaheuristic and fuzzy logic methods to manage roles and energy distribution in nodes and across the network. It also uses a multiobjective function to match and calibrate the network with the nearest-job-next with preemption (NJNP) charging scheduler to meet WRSN requirements in smart cities. The extensive simulation results of the proposed CFMCRS were compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of energy efficiency, latency, minimum sustainability rate, dead rate, survival rate, mean energy of network, number of packets received by base station (BS), request rates, and sensitive analysis. Accordingly, the proposed scheme outperformed the other methods by far for application requirements and improved evaluation factors for application. Ultimately, it can prolong the WRSN lifetime. The simulation results were also validated through ANOVA and its subsequent post-hoc analysis.},

 abstract = {Introduction
The concept of a smart city is fast becoming a key instrument in transforming living environments in a better way to enhance the operational efficiency of a transportation system. This paper presents a framework to assess transportation performance measures and smart-growth of cities around the U.S. by including physical activity as one of the main criteria.
Methods
This study employs Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. The proposed assessment framework is comprised of the evaluation of an individual criterion and the assessment of comprehensive results. The criteria are categorized into four groups including network performance, traffic safety, environmental impact, and physical activity. As a case example, the proposed performance measures were examined for forty-six cities in the U.S., and the required data was gathered from multiple sources.
Results
The output of the framework contains sustainability and smart-growth rankings of the selected cities as well as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis was utilized to determine the quantity that each performance measure or weighting factor requires to alter the smart-growth score. It has been illustrated that the dominancy between reversible pairs in the ranking is critically sensitive for almost 15% of cases.
Conclusion
The results of the proposed framework can be an effective decision supporting tool in analyzing traffic management strategies. Results from the score sensitivity calculation indicate that the proposed framework can be adopted in multifaceted transportation system performance in sustainability and smart-growth of cities.},

 abstract = {Recently, the intent to use microgrid (MG) technology for urban, residential, and industrial applications has significantly increased. Thanks to the integration of shared storage technologies, these power systems allow for higher penetration of distributed renewable generation (DGs) and better mitigation of imbalances between demand and generation. This responds to social and environmental requirements in terms of decarbonizing energy and also contributes to strengthening smart cities. DC (Direct Current) microgrids offer several advantages compared to AC (Alternating Current) type microgrids, like superior efficiency, better control, stability, compatibility with the DC nature of renewables and storage sources, and the absence of reactive and synchronization problems. However, before fully exploiting the potential of microgrids in renewable-powered smart grids, it is necessary to conduct further research and discussion on critical technical and socio-economic challenges. This paper presents a review of the existing state-of-the-art research in DC microgrid development, relevant challenges related to security, communication, power quality, and operation, as well as the appropriate control and energy management strategies to handle them. As control and energy management strategies considerably impact other performance indicators such as operating cost, emissions, and power system safety, this paper offers a perspective on the potential improvement of such management solutions.},

Using longitudinal data for the period 2006–2018, we examine the changes in green patents granted: (i) due to the implementation of various levels of stringency of environmental policies across all cities; and (ii) after the introduction of smart city policies in 2012 in China. The prior literature stresses the importance of environmental policies, yet less attention has been paid to digital policies required to drive eco-innovation and their spatial dimension in the context of a developing economy. Our results show that, when digital policies (artificial intelligence and internet of things) are implemented in cities that have adopted strict environmental policies, the production of green patents increases. We contribute to debates in the literature of policy mix for sustainability transitions in the context of a developing economy by illustrating the importance of both types of policy for eco-innovation, as they correct two market failures and, more importantly, address the systemic coordination problems that occur during the production of green patents.},

This study aims to examine the impacts and potential mechanisms of SCI on air pollution governance from the objective satellite monitoring data within a quasi-natural experiment framework. We find that SCI directly reduces the air pollutants concentration such as PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and smog in urban China and improves the air quality very well, which also has significant and positive spillovers on air pollution governance in adjacent cities. This encouraging phenomenon can also be achieved through contributing to green technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, and decentralizing urban spatial structure, such that most of can be attributed to the technological effect. Heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that the governance effect of air pollution is more obvious in large smart cities, and increases with the expansion of city size. Additionally, the effect performs better in resource-based smart cities and smart cities with stronger financing capacity and air pollution pressure.},

 abstract = {Smart city projects stand out for including a wide array of communication systems and heterogeneous technologies operated by multiple entities that collect data from citizens in very different ways. Basically, these projects involve three main actors that may have conflicting interests regarding the ownership and exploitation of the generated data: public administrations, service providers and citizens. Nevertheless, this is not a new problem. Actually, the most popular communication systems on the Internet, such as social networks, often have issues of this kind that can become highly visible in the press, especially when service providers, who commonly store data generated by their users via centralized models, have a security issue leading to a massive data leak, or when providers take advantage of their dominant position to exploit data improperly or sell it to third parties. This paper proposes an architecture to create user-centric data management applications for communications in smart cities where data is stored and managed in a decentralized way to reduce dependency on service providers and return control of the data to the different actors involved in the communications. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed architecture is implemented, using Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the main tools, to demonstrate its feasibility, show concrete protocols, and discuss the proposal on an empirical basis.},

The output of the model is the assessment of the risk of the municipality subsystems, taking into account the threshold for the functioning of the municipality subsystems, the linguistic interpretation of the level of risk and the acceptability of the tolerable risk resource. The model algorithm was used to create a web application to support the Municipal management for the above-mentioned agenda, from safe time to pandemics.},

 abstract = {Over the course of the 21st century, a century in which the urbanization process of the previous one is ever on the rise, the novel smart city concept has rapidly evolved and now encompasses the broader aspect of sustainability. Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project’s impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.},

 abstract = {In recent years, smart city programmes have focused on innovation and technology to transform cities into resource-efficient, liveable, and inclusive places. Children's and young people's positions in smart cities are unstable and, depending on a project's agenda, ever-shifting – at the centre of a bottom-up movement, on the fringes of top-down planned programmes. This article revolves around the everyday experiences of children and young people and explores how they encounter life in a smart city district. It draws on observations from a qualitative case study with children and young people in a Viennese neighbourhood where an EU smart city lighthouse project was implemented from 2016 to 2019. Drawing on ethnographic research with children and young people in a school, an afterschool centre, and an open child and youth care programme in a city park, I develop three dimensions of encounters: how children and young people move through, interact with, and take care of the city. My findings show that many children and young people perceive crises with the same urgency as smart city programmes and are equally interested in technological innovation, environmental protection, and social inclusion. They demonstrate responsibility and care about socio-ecological challenges and approaches to solutions. However, young people's discourses and practices also show that urban life cannot be limited to certain issues, nor do young people's urban lives end at structural or administrative boundaries. Participants also emphasise that focusing on human beings alone does not lead to sustainable urban development, and they express frustration with measures that bypass the reality of their lives and divert much-needed attention away from pressing issues.},

 abstract = {IoT devices generate data over time, which is going to be shared with other parties to provide high-level services. Smart City is one of its applications which aims to manage cities automatically. Because of the large number of devices, three critical challenges come up: heterogeneity, privacy-preserving of generated data, and providing high-level services. The existing solutions cannot even solve two of the mentioned challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a three-module framework, named “Ontology-Based Privacy-Preserving” (OBPP) to address these issues. The first module includes an ontology, a data storage model, to address the heterogeneity issue while keeping the privacy information of IoT devices. The second one contains semantic reasoning rules to find abnormal patterns while addressing the quality of provided services. The third module provides a privacy rules manager to address the privacy-preserving challenges of IoT devices achieved by dynamically changing privacy behaviors of the devices. Extensive simulations on a synthetic smart city dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the existing solutions while providing affordability and robustness against information leakages. Thus, it can be widely applied to smart cities.},

However, by integrating these enabling technologies with behavioral intelligence, scientific research and trans-disciplinary knowledge can enable smart cities to drive inhabitants more efficiently, and these urban hubs will be able to meet their sustainable development goals (SDGs). Sustainable growth depends on the successful management of transparent and inclusive urban development, particularly in low income and lower-middle income countries where rapid urbanization is expected to reach 50% and 59% on average by 2050. Further, this study sheds light on current issues as well as challenges and future research where the above technologies can promote socio-economic and techno-environmental development, and become a catalyst for the implementation of the concept of smart cities leading to a sustainable future. Keeping in mind the need for sustainability globally, this study presents a participative bottom-up and cognitive top-down paradigm that focuses on developing self-sustainable smart cities where sustainability is at the centre of governance, inhabitants, business, and all other related entities.},

 abstract = {There has been a surge in telecommunication network deployments across the globe to facilitate advanced communication infrastructure which is necessary for smart cities. This has in turn increased the power consumption of telecommunication networks, thus motivating the need to adopt green energy solutions like solar energy to power them. Base stations (BSs) are the primary entities contributing to the power consumption in the telecommunication network. To efficiently deploy solar powered base stations, it is imperative to optimally provision them with appropriate Photo Voltaic (PV) panel and battery resources. The ultimate goal of such dimensioning is to provide best possible quality of service (QoS) to the consumers while maintaining an optimal cost of deployment and operation. Both PV panels and the batteries are major contributors while calculating the overall cost of deployment and operation for a solar powered BSs. Therefore an accurate calculation of battery lifetime with respect to different PV panel dimension and battery sizes is an important step in cost optimal resource provisioning for the solar powered BSs. This issue is addressed in this paper by presenting an analytical scheme to estimate the battery lifetime for a particular resource provisioning of PV panels and batteries. This is then used for evaluating the cost-optimal photo-voltaic panel dimensions and battery size for the base station with acceptable limit of outage probability. The proposed methodology would find great relevance in developing energy efficient sustainable telecommunication networks for upcoming smart cities.},

We identified five dynamic capabilities that effectively contribute to smart city transformation: seizing, sensing, innovation, integrative, and empowering capability. Our analysis also reveals that a city administration's organizational readiness plays a critical role in these transformative processes and relies on four factors: innovation readiness, resource readiness, a participatory and collective mindset, and strategic readiness. Based on our findings, we suggest a theoretical framework composed of 10 propositions that describe the mutual influences of these dynamic managerial capabilities and organizational readiness factors, together with their contributions to smart city transformation.

The results provide deep insights into how smart city managers express their roles and responsibilities in smart city transformation. We discuss implications for theory and practice and conclude with avenues for future research.},

 abstract = {Developing countries constantly face the predicament of how to achieve the common progress of economic growth and environmental protection, and smart city construction may be the key. This study takes a smart city pilot policy in China as the starting point, and systematically evaluates the effects of smart city construction on energy saving and CO2 emission reduction using a progressive difference-in-differences method. The research conclusions show that: 1. Smart city construction has significantly reduced per capita CO2 emissions, with a reduction effect of approximately 18.42 logarithmic percentage points. This conclusion remains valid in the placebo test, instrumental variable method, and a series of robustness verifications. 2. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between energy efficiency and per capita CO2 emissions, and most cities in China have crossed the inflection point; smart city construction achieves energy savings and reduces per capita CO2 emissions by improving energy efficiency. 3. The effect of smart city construction on CO2 emission reduction is more obvious in cities with higher administrative levels, higher levels of neutral technological progress and green innovation, and higher levels of advanced industrial structure. This research provides an empirical basis for how developing countries or regions can move toward sustainable development through digital and intelligent transformation and demonstrates the importance of providing new infrastructure construction such as smart cities from the perspective of a low-carbon economy.},

Exploring the influence of smart city pilot policies on urban innovation performance is critical for achieving high-quality economic development and creating an innovation-driven country. This study views the experimental smart city policy in China as a quasi-natural experiment and assesses the improved influence of smart city development on urban innovation performance by constructing a multiple period difference-in-differences (DID) model, then confirms it using a variety of robustness test methodologies. The results show that urban innovation performance benefits from the construction of smart cities, and the promotion effect is sustainable. The level of economic development and information infrastructure, as well as the financial innovation expenditure, have a beneficial effect in encouraging smart city construction innovation performance, while the degree of opening-up hinders the improvement of smart city urban innovation performance. In addition, it is also found that there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of smart city building on urban innovation performance. The research of this paper provides useful enlightenment for better exerting the promotion effect of smart city building on urban innovation performance.},

This research leverages panel data from 260 prefecture-level cities in China between 2009 and 2020, applies the non-radial directional distance function (NDDF) for the quantification of energy and environmental performance (EEP), and harnesses the multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model to empirically investigate the influence of the smart city pilot policy (SCPP) on EEP. The findings reveal the following. (1) SCPP significantly enhances EEP in cities of China. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that SCPP primarily improves EEP by promoting economic agglomeration and driving innovation development. (3) The enhancement effect of SCPP on EEP exhibits a time lag and tends to decay in later stages, without exerting a notable spillover effect on EEP of neighboring cities. (4) The EEP of cities with lower administrative levels and insufficient resource endowments has experienced more substantial improvements under SCPP. This study offers valuable insights for developing countries with backgrounds similar to China for improving urban ecological environments and achieving sustainable development.},

 abstract = {Crowd counting targets for determining the number of pedestrians in an image, which is of crucial importance for smart city construction. The problem of scale variation is an ingrained and drastic challenge in crowd counting, and it severely degrades the performance of counting. To address this problem, many powerful models with complex network structures and tricks are built, but the constrained resources of embedded systems prevent the direct deployment of these models into an edge device. Thus, it is on high demand to design favourable lightweight models that require fewer parameters and a fast inference speed, while maintaining competitive counting performance. To this aim, we devise a lightweight network, termed as Ghost Attention Pyramid Network (GAPNet). Specifically, a lightweight GhostNet is adopted as the backbone to encode low-level features. Subsequently, a zero-parameter channel attention module is designed to select the discriminative crowd region efficiently. In addition, an efficient pyramid fusion module is built with a four-branch architecture to obtain multiscale hierarchy representations while reducing the parameters. Finally, a decoder generates the prediction by exploiting a series of transposed convolution blocks. Extensive experiments on crowd counting benchmarks have proved the superiority of the GAPNet in both accuracy and efficiency.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the links between smart cities and urban energy sustainability. Because achieving a “smart city” is a wide agenda rather than a specific set of interventions, smartness itself cannot easily be measured or quantifiably assessed. Instead, we understand smart cities to be a broad framework of strategies pursued by urban actors, and ask whether and how smart city projects catalyze urban energy sustainability. We use case studies of three cities (Nottingham, Stavanger, and Stockholm) funded by the Horizon 2020 Smart Cities and Communities program and examine how urban energy sustainability was advanced and realized through the smart city initiatives. We find first that while sustainability is not always a major objective of local implementation of smart city projects, the smartness agenda nevertheless increases the ambition to achieve energy sustainability targets. Second, the sustainability measures in smart cities are rarely driven by advanced technology, even though the smart city agenda is framed around such innovations. Third, there is significant sustainability potential in cross-sectoral integration, but there are unresolved challenges of accountability for and measurability of these gains.},

A bibliometric analysis is used to reveal the most influential articles and their associations. Furthermore, a content analysis is performed to explore recent developments in the field of smart city assessment in terms of research hotspots and research themes. The analysis reveals the existence of 11 research themes and their timelines. The most influential research addresses (1) multiple-criteria decision-based performance measurement frameworks, (2) data connectivity challenges, (3) composite indexes for smart sustainable cities, (4) holistic performance evaluations of smart cities, and (5) the characteristics of indicator sets. Based on these results, current advances in smart city assessment are discussed, and future research directions in this field are suggested.},

However, occupants’ demand for “comfort” and “convenience” may contradict the purpose of minimizing the carbon footprint of smart homes. Investigating whether smart home adoption can reduce carbon emissions and promote carbon neutrality from a consumer perspective is therefore essential. In this study, 359 valid responses were collected from Hangzhou, a Chinese megacity, as basic data. We established a smart home adoption evaluation index system that enabled us to empirically examine the trend of household electricity-related CO2 emissions with the change in smart home adoption level. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between the smart home adoption level and household electricity-related CO2 emissions. Smart home adoption causes more CO2 emissions in the initial stage, but reaches a tipping point where higher levels of smart home adoption leads to widespread use of energy-saving smart features and subsequently fewer emissions. Furthermore, this study confirmed the moderating effect of the internet divide on the relationship between smart home adoption and electricity-related CO2 emissions; the results indicate that improving internet accessibility and utilization promotes the commitment to reducing CO2 emissions in smart homes.},

The second phase involves the creation of a robust security method that supports digital certificates for peer-to-peer mutual authentication. Additionally, to maintain the integrity of certificates, they are sent securely in the form of a chain. Finally, a combination of trust and privacy is used while storing data on cloud servers. Simulation-based experiments have shown that the proposed model significantly outperforms I-AREOR and MCNA in terms of energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, malicious threats, and overhead.},

 abstract = {A considerable amount of non-dispatchable photovoltaic and wind power have always been planned in smart cities, however, the problem of massive energy storage has not yet been solved which limits the use of green energy on larger scale. At present the only battery energy storage is available, and it is effective only for storing modest quantities of energy for short periods of time. The other storage technology options are not often commercially available items; rather, they are just good concepts that need to be tested for viability. Currently, the only alternative options for turning an urban development into one that exclusively uses green energy is to use that energy to generate hydrogen through electrolyzers, then use this fuel to generate the required electricity in order to stabilize the grid. Even more appealing is the idea of using wind and photovoltaic energy to transform smart communities into a centre for producing hydrogen in addition to a city that solely uses renewable energy. The most likely solution, absent an urgent debate inside the science establishment, will be to import electricity from the burning of hydrocarbons while continuing to pay carbon offsets, which is incompatible with the goal of using only renewables. The smart city has not officially accepted this issue, just like the science establishment.},

This page presents the geographical locations where most publications in this discipline have been released. It provides a wide-ranging, accurate, and novel review of literature on optimizing the energy performance of smart city components. Utilizing computational optimization algorithms in this domain also opens up new perspectives in terms of energy efficiency. The results showed that these algorithms have successfully optimized energy consumption and reduced pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases.},

 abstract = {The goal of managing smart cities and societies is to maximize the efficient use of finite resources while enhancing the quality of life. To establish a sustainable urban existence, smart cities use some new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Drones (IoD), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The created data by these technologies are submitted to analytics to obtain new information for increasing the smart societies and cities' efficiency and effectiveness. Also, smart traffic management, smart power, and energy management, city surveillance, smart buildings, and patient healthcare monitoring are the most common applications in smart cities. However, the Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approach all hold a lot of promise for managing automated activities in smart cities. Therefore, we discuss different research issues and possible research paths in which the aforementioned techniques might help materialize the smart city notion. The goal of this research is to offer a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of smart city and society management, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that require further investigation and consideration. IoT, cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, IoD, IoV, and hybrid models are the seven key emerging developments in information technology that, in this paper, are considered to categorize the state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the Conventional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are the most commonly used ML method in the publications. According to research, the majority of papers are about smart cities' power and energy management. Furthermore, most papers have concentrated on improving only one parameter, where the accuracy parameter obtains the most attention. In addition, Python is the most frequently used language, which was used in 69.8% of the papers.},

 abstract = {The decarbonization of city energy systems plays an important role to meet climate targets. We examine the consequences of integrating electric cars and buses into the city energy system (60% of private cars and 100% of public buses), using three different charging strategies in a modelling tool that considers local generation and storage of electricity and heat, electricity import to the city, and investments to achieve net-zero emissions from local electricity and heating in 2050. We find that up to 85% of the demand for the charging of electric cars is flexible and that smart charging strategies can facilitate 62% solar PV in the charging electricity mix, compared to 24% when cars are charged directly when parked. Electric buses are less flexible, but the timing of charging enables up to 32% to be supplied by solar PV. The benefit from smart charging to the city energy system can be exploited when charging is aligned with the local value of electricity in the city. Smart charging for cars reduces the need for investments in stationary batteries and peak units in the city electricity and heating sectors. Thus, our results point to the importance of sectoral coupling to exploit flexibility options in the city electricity, district heating and transport sectors.},

The smart city framework uses information and communication technology to develop, implement, and maintain sustainable development in smart cities. The participants are interconnected with the smart city environment through connected buildings, vehicles, and smart phones. Smart cities are facing a number of issues, including poor security, difficulty maintaining and upgrading equipment, high operating costs associated with building large data centers, and privacy leakage. The blockchain technology plays an important role in achieving efficient smart cities. Blockchain technology performs transactions across a wide network between untrusted parties in chronological order and digital ledgers in a decentralized database. The decentralized architecture of blockchain offers greater security for distributed systems. Although, there have been some concerns raised about the robustness of blockchain technology. Numerous cybersecurity flaws have been found in blockchain implementations. Blockchain technology enables transactions to be more transparent than the old centralized systems. Hence, the blockchain technology has been exposed to numerous vulnerable cyberattacks. As a result, cyberattacks lead to system breakdown, data loss, password thefts, and information theft. This chapter analyses the various types of cyberattacks in blockchain-enabled smart cities.},

These could also be addressed by means of context-aware fog computing at the edge of the network and also by incorporating intelligence at the network edge. Since workload at fog nodes can anytime see sudden changes in demand, hence load migration among fog nodes becomes viable. However, improper migration can lead to further migrations, eventually decreasing performance. In this paper, we present a multi-channel queuing model based smart distributed service management approach and an intelligent resource-aware forecasting technique to predict the required context and resource management. The scheme accomplishes live migration by a resource-aware ensemble forecast method that used current and predicted resource utilization and their context availabilities to address the delay requirement for cross-domain IoT applications. The proposed management algorithms are simulated using CloudSim simulator and the efficacy of the obtained results confirm the superiority of the proposed methods.},

However, the query stays as to how towns can become “clever.” The software of the records era is normally taken into consideration as a key motive force withinside the “smartization” of towns. Detailed frameworks and techniques are consequently having to manual, operationalize, and degree the implementation manner in addition to the effect of the respective technology. This chapter discusses about blockchain era, a unique motive force of technological transformation that contains a mess of underlying technology and protocols, and its capability effect on clever towns. The chapter deals with the query of ways the blockchain era may also advantage the improvement of city regions. Based on a complete literature review, we gift a framework and study propositions. Nine software fields of a blockchain era withinside the smartization of towns: (1) healthcare, (2) logistics and deliver chains, (3) mobility, (4) energy, (5) management and services, (6) e-voting, (7) factory, (8) domestic, and (9) education are discussed. Contemporary-day tendencies in those fields illustrate how they're laid low with the blockchain era and derive propositions to manual destiny studies’ endeavors. Further sections of the chapter are well organized as follows. Section 1 is the introductory part of the eco-friendly blockchain technology for smart cities. Section 2 reflects types of blockchain executions and some common consent algorithms. Section 3 illustrates the benefits of blockchain combination with smart cities and reconnoiters ways it plays an essential role in creating and benefitting smart cities. Fifteen benefits of smart cities with blockchain are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 defends how blockchain is eco-friendly, and finally, Section 6 summarizes and concludes all sections.},

According to the United Nations Population Fund, cities accommodated 3.3 billion people (54%) of the global population in 2014. By 2050, around 5 billion people (68%) will be residing in cities. In order to make lifestyles in cities more comfortable and cost-effective, the city must be smart and intelligent. It is mainly accomplished through an intelligent decision-making process using computational intelligence-based technologies. This paper explored how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the smart city concept. From 2014 to 2021, we examined 133 articles (97% of Scopus and 73% of WoS) in healthcare, education, environment and waste management, agriculture, mobility and smart transportation, risk management, and security. Moreover, we observed that the healthcare (23% impact), mobility (19% impact), privacy and security (11% impact), and energy sectors (10% impact) have a more significant influence on AI adoption in smart cities. Since the epidemic hit cities in 2019, the healthcare industry has intensified its AI-based advances by 60%. According to the analysis, AI algorithms such as ANN, RNN/LSTM, CNN/R-CNN, DNN, and SVM/LS-SVM have a higher impact on the various smart city domains.},

 abstract = {Smart cities attempt to reach net-zero emissions goals by reducing wasted energy while improving grid stability and meeting service demand. This is possible by adopting next-generation energy systems, which leverage artificial intelligence, the Internet of things (IoT), and communication technologies to collect and analyze big data in real-time and effectively run city services. However, training machine learning algorithms to perform various energy-related tasks in sustainable smart cities is a challenging data science task. These algorithms might not perform as expected, take much time in training, or do not have enough input data to generalize well. To that end, transfer learning (TL) has been proposed as a promising solution to alleviate these issues. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper presents the first review of the applicability of TL for energy systems by adopting a well-defined taxonomy of existing TL frameworks. Next, an in-depth analysis is carried out to identify the pros and cons of current techniques and discuss unsolved issues. Moving on, two case studies illustrating the use of TL for (i) energy prediction with mobility data and (ii) load forecasting in sports facilities are presented. Lastly, the paper ends with a discussion of the future directions.},

Therefore, designing the energy systems based on clean and renewable criteria is considered a sustainable solution for smart cities. Indeed, the deep and rapid penetration of renewable energy-based technologies have been believed to very well fit into a smart city under various scales, this could supply a secure basis for a modern society with a low-carbon economy. In this review paper, the main components and roles of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, and biofuels) for the smart city were fully introduced. Besides, integrating the renewable sources form into the energy systems of smart cities was thoroughly analyzed on the basis of technical and economic criteria. Finally, existing challenges and future scenarios were also discussed in detail to clarify the progress and perspective of smart renewable energy systems for the smart city. In general, the integration of renewables into energy systems of the smart city is a sagacious perspective and solution aiming to achieve cleaner process and more sustainable development. However, the optimization issues of the energy system for integrating of renewable components, ensuring good stability, maximizing the operating range, and minimizing the investment costs should be critically evaluated in the future works.},

 abstract = {Social media data analysis in a smart city context can represent an efficacious instrument to inform decision making. The manuscript strives to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to Twitter messages using supervised learning to achieve real-time automated event detection in smart cities. A semantic-based taxonomy of risks is devised to discover and analyse associated events from data streams, with a view to: (i) read and process, in real-time, published texts (ii) classify each text into one representative real-world category (iii) assign a citizen satisfaction value to each event. To select the language processing models striking the best balance between accuracy and processing speed, we conducted a pre-emptive evaluation, comparing several baseline language models formerly employed by researchers for event classification. A heuristic analysis of several smart cities and community initiatives was conducted, with a view to define real-world scenarios as basis for determining correlations between two or more co-occurring event types and their associated levels of citizen satisfaction, while further considering environmental factors. Based on Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA), we established the relationships between scenario variables, obtaining a variance of 60%–90% between the dependent and independent variables. The selected combination of supervised NLP techniques leverages an accuracy of 88.5%. We found that all regression models had at least one variable below the 0.05 threshold of the f−test, therefore at least one statistically significant independent variable. These findings ultimately illustrate how citizens, taking the role of active social sensors, can yield vital data that authorities can use to make educated decisions and sustainably construct smarter cities.},

Multiple publicly available yet isolated data sources, including geospatial building information and property sales data as well as real-time river levels, weather observations, and flood warnings, are connected to instantiate a semantically rich ecosystem of knowledge, data, and computational capabilities to provide cross-domain insights in projected flooding events and their potential impact on population and built infrastructure. The extensibility of the proposed approach is highlighted by further integrating power, water, and telecoms infrastructure as part of the very same system, in order to analyse flood-induced asset failures and their propagation across networks. The World Avatar promotes evidence-based decision making during several disaster management phases, supporting both tactical and strategic risk assessments, which supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 to improve the assessment of vulnerability, exposure, and risk of communities imposed by flooding events.},

Particularly for small villages and isolated areas, CWs provide an energy- and land-efficient alternative to traditional treatment systems. There are still many questions regarding the effective implementation of these systems and their long-term viability. This study aims to offer and inspire sustainable options for the effectiveness and use of CWs by thoroughly evaluating their application and the most recent developments in their sustainable design and operation for wastewater treatment. First, a brief explanation of the definition, classification, and application of current CWs has been given. The relationship between the operational needs and design criteria of CWs, such as substrate types, hydraulic retention time, water depth, plant species, hydraulic load, and feeding mechanism, and the operation's sustainability for treating wastewater has then been examined. Growing knotweed plants, which bind dye particles in the soil and take up heavy metal ions for better growth, as well as reducing the detrimental effects of dyes and heavy metals, are some of the sustainability initiatives for those wetland technologies that are outlined in this paper. If employed, this approach can clean wastewater in smart cities and metropolitan regions that are polluted by industrial waste water very well with a single expenditure. Future research on improving the sustainability and stability of CWs is also emphasised as being crucial.},

 abstract = {A smart city is an evolving Internet of Things (IoT) technique that links different digital gadgets via a network, offering several new services to the manufacturing and medical field to commerce. A smart city is an omnipresent and fundamental change that has altered the whole environment using Information Communication Technology (ICT) and sensor-enabled IoT gadgets. Renewable energy storage, the solar, wind, and distributed resources can be better integrated into the grid. The leading theory in the digital domain for improved and broad use of all the situations with high digital media accessibility (i.e., video, sound, words, and pictures), nevertheless it is challenging to talk freely about such small appliances because of resource constraints (starving power and battery capacity), and large quantities of the information. The green communication approach for the smart city (GCA-SC) is proposed in this article. Thus, using saved video streams to solve these difficulties is recommended by Hybrid Adaptation and Power Algorithms and Delay-tolerant Streamed Algorithms. A new architecture is similarly proposed for the smart city network. Empirical findings such as power drainage, battery capacity, latency, and bandwidth are acquired and evaluated. It was reached that, with less effort than Baseline, GCA-SC optimises energy drainage, the battery capacity, variance, power delivery ratio of the IoT compatible gadgets in the smart city environment. The simulation analysis of the proposed GCA-SC method enhances the packet delivery ratio of 39% and throughput of 99 kbps. It reduces the delay by 2.5 s and the standard deviation by −0.9 s.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, with continuous integration of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies, there are increasing demands and specific requirements for data sharing in sustainable smart cities: (1) practical data sharing should be implemented in the non-interactive fashion without a trusted third party to be involved; (2) dynamic thresholds are preferred since the participants may join or leave at any time; (3) multi-secret sharing is desirable to increase the packing capacity. To fulfil these requirements, we propose a general construction of ideal threshold changeable multi-secret sharing scheme (TCMSS) with information-theoretic security, in which polynomials are employed to achieve dealer-free and non-interactive in the secret reconstruction phase. The TCMSS scheme can be built on any existing linear secret sharing scheme, and it is simpler and more efficient than the existing TCSS schemes in the literature. The main difference between TCMSS and Shamir’s SS is that univariate polynomial is used in Shamir’s SS to generate the shares for all shareholders; while in TCMSS, each shareholder can recover her own univariate polynomial using her share. This article demonstrates that with this novel modification, the classic polynomial-based SS can be transformed into an ideal TCMSS. Moreover, the TCMSS scheme is lightweight and it can resist both internal and external attacks. It does not require pairwise key distribution and its secret reconstruction phase is improved with enhanced properties. Therefore, the designed proposal is fairly suitable and attractive to be deployed in sustainable cities.},

 abstract = {With smart city (SMC) initiatives proliferating worldwide since the 2000s, the theoretical debates around SMC development have evolved from a technology-centric approach to a more human-centric approach. Investing in human capital and improving quality of life have become the major elements of SMC rhetoric. However, few studies have examined the approaches adopted in real-world SMC policymaking or why different cities follow different approaches. We statistically examine the factors behind the human-centricity of SMC policies through a text analysis of policy documents from 341 Chinese prefectural cities published between 2009 and 2020. We find divergent approaches to SMC development across these Chinese prefectural cities. Unexpectedly, the more economically developed and dense cities tend to be more technology-centric in SMC policymaking. Cities at the initial and advanced stages of SMC development also prefer a technology-centric approach, albeit with very different underlying mechanisms. These findings suggest the need for a greater prioritization of human capital in SMC creation in developed cities and for context-specific interpretations of technology-centricity for cities at different SMC development stages.},

The increasing availability of such LocBigData has created unprecedented opportunities for research on urban systems and human environments in general. In this article, we first review the common types of LocBigData: mobile phone network data, GPS data, Location-based social media data, LBS usage/log data, smart card travel data, beacon log data (WiFi or Bluetooth), and camera imagery data. Secondly, we describe the opportunities fueled by LocBigData for the realization of smart cities, mainly via answering questions ranging from “what happened” and “why did it happen” to “what's likely to happen in the future” and “what to do next”. Thirdly, pitfalls of dealing with LocBigData are summarized, such as high volume/velocity/variety; non-random sampling; messy and not clean data; and correlations rather than causal relationships. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art research trends in this field, and conclude the article with a list of open research challenges and a research agenda for LocBigData research to help achieve the vision of smart and sustainable cities.},

 abstract = {Edge computing can serve latency-sensitive data generated by smart IoT devices in smart cities, which cannot be accommodated by cloud services. However, edge-enabled smart cities applications face many security issues such as massive centralization, vulnerability to tampering, and tracing difficulty. Blockchain, as an emerging ledger technology, can be a useful solution to these problems. However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.},

 abstract = {Visually-impaired people encounter a series of challenging tasks in their daily life that are easy to the majority of society. For example, crossing a street, which is a critical task for a pedestrian traveling in a city, actually involves a set of orientation and navigation sub-tasks. The typical form of assistive technology as a solution today for street crossing relies upon an accessible pedestrian signal (APS) usually in the mode of audio signals broadcasted at a cross street. As popular as such APS is, there are various pain points to visually-impaired users who are trying to rely on conventional APS when crossing a street. Given the prevalence of smartphones among the visually-impaired around the world, there is still a vacuum in the literature as to the possibility of providing them, through a smartphone, a safer solution to address those pain points so that users can more confidently walk across a street. In this paper we look at how mobile technology relevantly helps the visually-impaired to cross streets more comfortably and confidently by presenting an action-research-based case of developing and deploying a smart accessible pedestrian signal system (SAPSS) in Taiwan. Originated from an ability-based design principle so as to ensure accessibility, the system integrates hardware, software, and a user-side mobile app into an enhanced solution for the visually-impaired to comfortably cross a street. Two field tests by 19 visually-impaired end users help modify the system and confirm its usability. From the positive feedbacks of these test participants, SAPSS has been formally deployed in three cities in Taiwan. This case study reports the development, the tests, and the deployment of the system in detail and also discusses implications of such a new generation assistive technology in the development of smart cities.},

The Chinese government proposed enhancing citizens' sense of gain to achieve the citizen-centric development goal. To develop a more realistic improving path for the sustainability of smart city services (SCS), it is necessary to clarify the factors that affect citizens' sense of gain of smart city services (CSGSCS). To achieve this objective, 9 hypotheses were developed based on the modified expectation confirmation theory. Hypothesis testing, mediating effect testing, and heterogeneity analysis was conducted based on data collected from Nanjing citizens. The results indicate that: 1) Expectation-Perception Performance, including Content of SCS, Channel of SCS, and Support of SCS, all have positive direct effects on CSGSCS; 2) Expectation Confirmation directly affects CSGSCS and mediates the positive effect of the Expectation-Perception Performance on CSGSCS; 3) Heterogeneity of age and usage frequency have significant effects on CSGSCS. Finally, three policy implications were proposed, including encouraging citizens to participate in SCS supply, bridging the digital divide created by SCS, and improving the policy and legal system on SCS. This research enriches the academic framework and provides guidance for sustainable supply of SCS in similar cities around the world.},

 abstract = {Effective waste management arises as a crucial challenge for smart city development in the current era of rapid urbanization, shifting towards sustainability and public health. Harnessing modern technologies, especially the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with intelligent waste bins, can revolutionize urban waste collection, optimizing efficiency and reducing costs. This paper delves into a multiagent simulation-based framework for understanding and assessing the dynamics of an IoT-enabled smart waste management system. Initiating with the intricate process of garbage generation, we shift our focus to the real-time monitoring capabilities of IoT-connected waste bins. The study further explores protocols to regulate bin status, along with timing mechanisms to trigger garbage collection rounds. Subsequently, a predictive routing system is introduced to determine the most efficient garbage collection routes. For the bins’ filled level tracking, the ultrasonic sensors are commonly used that send out sound waves and track their echo return time, whereas weight sensors measure the garbage load in the bin, providing insights into waste production trends. For data transmission from bins to the central system, various communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and long-distance networks are considered. Through a simulation, we contrast the innovative IoT-enabled sensor-based collection mechanism against the conventional periodic review strategy. Field experiments at the Al Rayyan locale, proximate to Doha, Qatar, facilitate the model demonstration. By leveraging region-specific data, we simulated various aspects including economic factors, environmental impact, public satisfaction, and operational efficiencies. The findings indicate that with an average daily garbage generation of 1.3 kg per individual, the sensor-driven mechanism remarkably outperforms the periodic review approach by covering fewer distances with fewer trucks, while concurrently achieving the key objectives of cost-efficiency, environmental preservation, public satisfaction, and reduced employee workload. This research contributes to the developing field of smart city technology by providing critical insights for urban planners, policymakers, and technologists attempting to build more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives lifestyle changes in smart city infrastructure due to rapid growth of services and activities that develop well-being. One of the main challenges that resulted from the exponential spread of IoT is the dense number of nodes with the huge amount of data over different networks that influence the collision probability, and network congestion. Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results.

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology drives lifestyle changes in smart city infrastructure due to rapid growth of services and activities that develop well-being. One of the main challenges that resulted from the exponential spread of IoT is the dense number of nodes with the huge amount of data over different networks that influence the collision probability, and network congestion. Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques.},

 abstract = {The simulation tools geared towards promoting sustainability in Mobility as a Service (MaaS) evaluation is inherently a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) challenge due to three primary concerns: the criteria significance, data variability, and the expert opinions' uncertainty. Despite efforts in recent years, no current developed MaaS has fully addressed all evaluation criteria. Moreover, no research has evaluated the sustainability of MaaS in the context of determining its optimality. As such, this research's pivotal contribution is to present an evaluation of simulation tools for sustainable MaaS in autonomous vehicles operating in smart cities. This evaluation leans on the advanced extension of a newly proposed an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set (IVFFRS) incorporated within integrated MCDM methodologies. The IVFFRS is designed to capture intricate and uncertain evaluative data. The initial phase of the evaluation methodology involves formulating the evaluation criteria using an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set, fuzzily weighted for zero inconsistency. The subsequent phase adopts the interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough decision via the opinion score method to prioritize alternatives in light of data variations. This study evaluates ten distinct simulation tools for MaaS in autonomous vehicles based on seven criteria. The methodology's robustness is further ascertained through sensitivity and comparative analyses.},

However, the waste collection and transportation process remain highly inefficient and costly, contributing to a substantial environmental footprint for waste collection operations. The inefficiencies in the current waste management system highlight the need for innovative solutions to optimize collection processes and minimize environmental impact. This study responds to this imperative by proposing the use of smart bin technology combined with a vehicle routing problem tool. The integration of these technologies aims to develop an intelligent solution for appropriate waste collection, limiting container pickup only when necessary, and optimizing waste collection routes. Our approach considers several factors, including the fill level of each container, time windows, vehicle capacity, and tour completion constraints. By addressing these key factors, the system seeks to revolutionize waste management practices, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of waste collection.},

 abstract = {Big sensor-based data systems and the emergence of large-scale wireless sensor networks (LS-WSNs), which are spatially distributed across various geographical areas in smart cities (SCs) have thrown new challenges for energy-efficient data collection. The traditional approach utilizing IoT-based techniques for data collection and transmission for waste management applications is not energy-efficient and currently infeasible for such LS-WSNs, thus necessitating the need for a transformation to an IoV-based technique, where vehicular networks can be opportunistically exploited for efficient data collection for waste management strategies in SCs. This paper gives two contributions to research in waste management for SCs. First, a comprehensive study of the various IoT-based techniques for waste management in SCs is presented. Survey studies present energy consumption of the sensor-nodes due to high routing/transmission/control overheads as a major challenge. Several IoT-based techniques have been used to optimize the energy efficiency of the sensor-nodes. However, none has effectively addressed the challenges of energy consumption and optimization. The second contribution proposes an IoV-based technique for data collection for waste management in SCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of such a proposed scheme for SC waste management strategies. Thus, this paper is the first attempt to propose a novel IoV-based model for SC waste management strategies. This technique involves the use of vehicles as opportunistic MDCs to optimize energy efficiency. The paper also proposes using swarm-intelligence-based methods to increase energy efficiency and data collection for SC waste management application. An energy-efficient routing model is very critical to IoT-based applications. Hence, the paper presents an energy-efficient opportunistic model utilizing the ant-based routing algorithms for LS-WSN SC waste management applications. The paper also provides some analytical approaches to determine the energy consumption of the network model. The final part presents experiments in different application scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results present the proposed approach in good performance in terms of the performance metrics compared to the conventional techniques for waste management strategies.},

The environmental features of urban cities mean that signal transmission can be affected across communication networks, with packet delays, packet loss and higher error rates occurring during data exchange. There is a need for sustainable and robust low-energy signals for smart EV communication. The present paper proposes a novel method for continuous, robust video data transmission at low energy via multi-sensory-enabled 5G technology. The transceivers (transmitters and receivers) are designed with multiple low-energy sensors for detecting data availability at the receiver device. By applying a threshold level detection technique, data availability is identified dependent upon energy level and successive data exchange occurs between transceivers. The application of low-energy signal transmission reduces power usage during video data transmission and leads to a sustainable solution for intelligent EV applications. The performance of the proposed multi-sensory technique is tested and verified using various calibrated parameters considering key metrics including collision error, propagation error, sensing error and accuracy. The proposed model significantly improves accuracy, with higher sensing capabilities and lower delays and propagation errors compared to the existing buffer model.},

This research introduces a novel IoT-driven SPMS that leverages Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology, termed as IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN, to surmount typical restrictions related to communication range, energy usage, and implementation cost seen in traditional systems. IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN features intelligent sensing nodes that incorporate an Arduino UNO microcontroller and two sensors—a triaxial magnetic sensor and a waterproof ultrasonic sensor. These components collaboratively detect vehicle occupancy and transmit this data to the server via a LoRaWAN gateway. Notably, the integration of LoRa technology enables extensive network coverage and energy efficiency. Users are provided with real-time updates on parking availability via the accessible AllThingsTalk Maker graphical user interface. Additionally, the system operates independently, sustained by a solar-powered rechargeable battery. Practical testing of IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN under various scenarios validates its merits in terms of functionality, ease of use, reliable data transmission, and precision. Its urban implementation is expected to alleviate traffic congestion, optimize parking utilization, and elevate awareness about available parking spaces among users.

Buildings and electric transport systems, especially subway systems and Plug in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), are among the major energy consumption systems in a smart city. In this paper, a linear model is proposed for the co-optimization planning and operation of distributed energy resources and transportation systems in an interconnected system that analyzes the interactions of such an interconnected system. The idea of Regenerative Breaking Energy (RBE) is deployed to improve the operation of the subway system through the interconnected subway system in the smart city. For the optimal operation of the smart city, an optimization formulation is devised to minimize the total cost of the city in the presence of subway RBE. In this paper, the traffic and length of the routes are modeled considering Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Subway (V2S) located in the parking lots. Furthermore, the degradation model is developed to increase the PEVs’ battery life. An unscented transformation (UT) approach is utilized to construct a stochastic framework based on the uncertainty method, to handle the uncertain behaviors of PEVs and distributed energy resource and loads in the smart city. Finally, the proposed model is implemented and its performance is analyzed in both the stochastic and deterministic frameworks.},

In particular, smart cities have the potential to limit participation opportunities for information-disadvantaged groups in decision-making by their optimized use of ICT in infrastructure and service delivery. Until now, studies on citizen participation in smart cities have mainly focused on the participation characteristics of general citizens. Thus, this study categorizes the key considerations for encouraging the participation of information-disadvantaged groups in smart cities and analyzes the difference in the relative importance between types using a series of Delphi surveys to collect the opinions of smart city experts in South Korea. The findings show that service accessibility is significantly important in encouraging participation, while the calculation of appropriate service cost and developing a support plan for service delivery are paramount in improving service accessibility. Furthermore, financial support for reducing the digital divide and citizens’ understanding of the purpose of participation for increasing participative receptivity are found to be statistically significant.},

 abstract = {Recently, Internet of the things (IoTs) devices have been used highly in surveillance applications in smart environments, cities, and buildings. Most of the surveillance data recorded by the IoT devices is in the form of video and needs to be transmitted to the admin or server by video streaming technology. Fractal video compression uses a self-similarity concept for video compression, meaning the fractal image contains self-similarity of itself that is explained and denoted by change. Computational cost is more in fractal video coding; different methods have been developed to reduce this computational cost. The proposed work's main objective is to implement a video streaming approach by combining the Diamond-search-pattern- block-matching motion estimation algorithm and hash-based fractal video compression algorithm to reduce the encoding time. It improves both the delay and security of the block matching system and the developed approach measures based on evaluation parameters: Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), encoding time, decoding time, Mean squared error (MSE), and Compression ratio for Smart City Applications. Compared to other algorithms, the IoTs video data is streamed efficiently in a smart city to analyse the abnormalities.},

This study fills that need by presenting evidence-based research on such preferences and perceptions from the perspective of need theories, taking Taiwan as a case study. Specifically, we investigated Taiwanese citizens’ preferences for 35 SC services of seven dimensions classified in two domains, as well as their three perceptions of the usefulness of these SC services in the realization of human needs. The results show that most of our respondents clearly perceived SC services as both important and useful to their existence, relatedness, and growth needs, and that they expressed relatively higher preferences for such services to operate in the “hard” domain – e.g., smart energy, smart transport, or smart safety –than the “soft” one, e.g., smart living. Based on these findings, this study provides policy recommendations that, if implemented, could be expected to advance SC development by increasing citizens’ usage of SC services in both the hard and soft domains, and serve the wider aim of improving their well-being and quality of life.},

 abstract = {The amalgamation of Internet of Things (IoT) and communication systems within Smart Grid Control Systems (SGCS) has amplified their susceptibility to cyber-attacks, posing a significant threat. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs), originally designed for securing IT systems, exhibit limitations in SGCS due to reliance on predefined structures and training on specific cyber-attack patterns. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework to establish balanced representations for the inherently asymmetric SGCS datasets. These representations are seamlessly integrated into a dedicated DL-based model for attack detection within the SGCS environment. Utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), the model identifies novel cyber-attack representations. Performance evaluation through 10-fold cross-validation on two real SGCS datasets reveals the proposed approach's superiority over traditional methods like Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Additionally, the generalized method can be effortlessly implemented in existing SGCS infrastructures with minimal complexity. This study introduces a novel cybersecurity enhancement method for Smart Grid Control Systems by integrating a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin with a deep learning-based IDS. This approach intricately models both physical and cyber components, facilitating real-time training and fine-tuning of the intrusion detection model using synthetic cyber threats. The digital twin undergoes rigorous testing to assess the model's effectiveness, employing scenario analyses to identify vulnerabilities and formulate response strategies. The adaptive digital twin fosters a proactive cybersecurity stance by implementing security measures such as access controls and cyber range simulation. Real-time monitoring, analytics, and stakeholder collaboration enhance incident response readiness. The lifecycle simulation, spanning from model development to deployment, ensures alignment with regulations. This integrated approach not only detects but proactively responds to cyber threats, fortifying Smart Grid Control Systems against evolving risks.},

However, cyber security has always been a serious problem, and it is becoming more and more severe in smart cities. The existing attack defense methods are not suitable for detecting multi-step attacks since the detection rules are limited and the efficiency is limited by a large number of false security alarms. Hence, an advanced solution is urgently needed to improve cyber security defense capability. In this paper, we propose a novel attack detection framework called ACAM. To better represent the cyber security knowledge, the framework is based on the MDATA model, which can represent dynamic and temporal–spatial knowledge better than the knowledge graph. The framework consists of the knowledge extraction module, the subgraph generation module, the alarm correlation module, and the attack detection module. These modules can remove false alarms and improve the detection capabilities of multi-step attacks. We implement the framework and conduct experiments on the cyber range platform, the experimental results validate the good performance of attack detection accuracy and efficiency. The framework can greatly improve the cyber security defense capabilities for smart cities.},

This paper examines the influence of smart city construction on urban green total factor productivity (GTFP), explores the influence mechanism and further investigates the heterogeneous influence among the factors of urban scale, human capital and financial development, by conducting a quasi-natural experiment based on the first batch of pilot smart city in China and using panel data of 174 prefecture level cities over the period of 2005−2016. Our findings show that: (1) Smart city construction pilot significantly improves GTFP and green technological progress (GTP) in China, but its influence on GTE is not significant, which means smart city construction promotes GTFP mainly through promoting GTP. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. (2) The estimation result of mediating effect models is that smart city construction promoted GTFP and GTP mainly through boosting urban technological innovation. The influence path of “smart city construction→technological innovation→GTFP” is verified. (3) Regarding city heterogeneity, cities with larger scale, richer human capital and higher level financial development have stronger positive effects on GTFP and GTP. These conclusions are of vital significance to improve the urban ecological environment and promote the high-quality development of urban economy.},

The development of new technologies has accelerated the process of urban development, and smart cities have emerged under these conditions. One of the problems to be solved by smart cities is environmental pollution. The development of industrialized cities has caused a series of environmental problems such as smog and sewage. Therefore, pollution problems must be actively managed. The prediction of environmental pollution is also an important subject in pollution control. This paper is based on neural network technology to study the prediction method of environmental pollution in smart cities. This paper introduces some neural networks commonly used in the field of environmental pollution prediction, and also introduces the processing method of environmental pollution data. This paper also designs experiments. The first experiment is to compare the model in this paper with other three neural network models, and it is found that the model in this paper is smaller than other models in terms of ARE and MAE; the second experiment is to design an environmental pollution prediction system based on the model in this paper, and take sulfur dioxide as an example, use the system to predict the value of sulfur dioxide in two provinces. The results are as follows: the average error value of the system's prediction for Jiangxi Province is 0.31%, and the average error value for Hubei Province is 0.34%. In combination, the neural network designed in this paper compares the pre-accuracy of environmental pollution than other neural networks, and the system predictive accuracy is high.},

 abstract = {In smart city practice, urban policymakers show to focus foremost on the technologies sec. This often leads to quite uniform, technocratic and corporate-led ways of handling urban issues. In contrast, more attention should be paid to the question of appropriateness of smart city technologies. This entails that quite uniform urban issues in different contexts ask for distinctive approaches and as a consequence, for specific smart city technologies. In other words, the context plays a decisive role in the choice for the urban issues themselves and in the ways to ‘solve’ or govern these, and in the choice for specific smart city technologies. This study examines the role of context in the handling of urban issues with the help of smart city technologies in three smart city projects: Hangzhou City Brain (China), Singapore Smart Nation, and Amsterdam Smart City (the Netherlands). The results reveal that the specific contextual factors influence urban city developments and the application therein of smart city technologies. This includes: a technology-driven management approach to fixing Hangzhou's traffic congestion; a mixed technocratic and platform-oriented approach to effecting transformation in Singapore's government services, businesses and urban living; and a platform-oriented, open-minded mechanism to improve Amsterdam's livability and economic prosperity. This paper concludes that rather than treating the technology itself as smart, the real smartness in smart cities is to develop and implement appropriate technologies according to its local context to solve targeted urban issues.},

Microgrids, featuring dispersed power sources, exhibit superior resilience, efficiency, and stability in contrast to conventional power grids.

The current research advocates for the integration of photovoltaics, energy storage, and electric vehicles (EVs) as pivotal elements in a smart grid. This study introduces an optimal energy management system (EMS) designed to efficiently allocate power from existing sources. To address the challenges within an uncertain and reliable environment, a stochastic framework leveraging the whale optimization algorithm and unscented transform has been formulated. All simulations have been executed using the digital twin of the smart grid components. Results suggest that the proposed EMS ensures uninterrupted power supply, contributing to a substantial 45% reduction in energy costs. Furthermore, the potential of EVs as storage devices is explored. When employed as energy sources, EVs led to a noteworthy 45.58% reduction in power prices, while their use as loads still yielded a significant 19.33% decrease.

The urban energy execution appraisal and impacting variable model could diminish the issues brought about by two-organized execution, evaluation, and factor examination, measure the impacts of appraisal pointers and affecting elements of urban energy execution, and mirror the real execution of various urban communities in smart city transportation. Exact results show that urban energy execution of common capital in China has been expanding. The potential for energy-saving in Chinese common capital is also very high. When evaluating urban energy execution, it was critical to include the energy contribution as an appraisal pointer. Although there was a negative relationship between population thickness and urban energy execution, the temperature record, urbanization rate, and family vehicle possession were all extremely associated with urban energy execution. Chinese common capitals gradually lost their ability to execute urban energy from east to west. As a result of these findings, a few approach recommendations for improving urban energy execution are proposed for smart transportation.},

 abstract = {Enhancing urban resilience is increasingly crucial for cities to achieve sustainable development. However, existing studies have a limited understanding of the resilience of shrinking cities and their response policies. Taking Yichun, a typical shrinking city in China, as an example, this study constructs a system dynamics model to assess urban resilience from a subsystem perspective and explores the relationship between the dynamic development of resilience and urban shrinkage from 2008 to 2028. Then, a smart decline response policy of Yichun is put forward. The findings indicate that the evolution curve of urban resilience shows a fluctuating growth trend as a whole and that the dominant subsystems of resilience are changing. The occurrence of urban shrinkage inhibits the dynamic development of urban resilience and has various effects on the subsystems of resilience. Compared with the regrowth strategy, the smart decline strategy can effectively improve the resilience and mitigate the adverse impact of urban shrinkage on the resilience under the condition of limited resources. Resilience can be proven to be a viable perspective to help formulate a response strategy of shrinking cities. These findings will enhance comprehension of the resilience of shrinking cities and provide a reference to address urban shrinkage and formulate corresponding governance strategies.},

 abstract = {The development of smart cities in practice requires significant investments and financial expenses, therefore, the authors of the article decided to identify and evaluate the economic conditions of this process, which is rarely analysed in the literature on the subject. For this purpose, they conducted representative surveys in 287 Polish cities, taking into account 5 groups of parameters related to the subsequent stages of the evolution of smart cities. According to the obtained results, the key barrier to the development of smart cities in Poland is the unsatisfactory level of prosperity of the residents and the difficult financial situation of cities, which means that the vast majority of the surveyed areas are not able to attempt to get closer to the Smart City 1.0 generation. In contacts with stakeholders, Polish cities prefer the triple helix model, focused on business cooperation and creating favourable conditions for commercial entrepreneurship. Relationships of higher order helices (with communities or ecological organisations) are not a priority for them, which may contribute to the aggravation of urban pathologies in the form of unsustainability and socio-economic exclusion. Conclusions and recommendations resulting from the research contribute to the economics of smart cities and can be used in the practical improvement of the process of their creation and development.},

Language-conditioned robot behavior plays a vital role in executing complex tasks by associating human commands or instructions with perception and actions. However, most language-conditioned policy-related research is limited to specific datasets and cannot generalize across different environments. In this study, we propose a novel imitation learning framework tailored for language-conditioned robotic tasks. Our framework includes specialized encoders designed for various benchmarks and utilizes two distinct models: the Transformer and Diffusion models. We rigorously evaluate this framework in three different robotic environments. Our findings indicate that the framework consistently delivers superior performance across multiple domains. Notably, we observe that the Transformer model is particularly effective in managing tasks with long trajectories, whereas the Diffusion model demonstrates enhanced proficiency in generating trajectories from limited training datasets. Our approach showcases remarkable generalization capabilities across a range of tasks and achieves significantly higher success rates in task completion.},

This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold. As for now, however, there seems to be insufficient social trust to exploit this on a wider scale without creating even more scepticism and distrust.},

Recent WHO global air pollution guidelines highlight air pollution as a critical environmental threat along with climate change. To address these threats, smart cities and clean air programs are on a rise. In smart cities, data and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are major drivers of city transformations. The 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing have the potential to accelerate these transformations toward urban resilience. However, the success of smart cities and clean air programs depends on cohesive multi-sector stakeholder contributions. This study conducted interdisciplinary participative stakeholder analysis to understand the data, and sectorial challenges, to outline the technological opportunities to facilitate clean air programs in Indian smart cities. The research highlights gaps due to siloed stakeholder operations, lack of data calibration, non-alignment of smart city and air quality management services, non-availability of health exposure data, and difficulty in translating scientific data into implementable actions. Stakeholders expressed potential ‘fit for the purpose’ use of IoT devices, satellites, smartphones, and mobility data augmented by AI methods in bridging these gaps. The analysis points toward a need to develop an easily accessible and ubiquitous urban data governance ecosystem enabling seamless cross-sector data exchanges to build trusting relationships among the stakeholders across the air quality management value chain},

Regarding real-time electricity prices, the presented method allows for selecting grid electricity or photovoltaics per peak, off-peak, and between these two. In addition to reducing costs, this strategy lessens photovoltaic installation capacity and increases the justification of BIPVs. Considering demand-side management, proper control in terms of economic aspects is conducted based on the system's defined model and the price of electricity. The suggested technique outperforms other applied methods when both energy supply and demand are considered, as well as real-time electricity prices.

 abstract = {Nature inspired artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are gaining traction in air quality modeling. A mathematical simulation of how air pollutants distribute and react in the atmosphere to impact ambient air quality is known as air quality modeling. Modeling aids in estimating the correlation between pollution levels and their impacts on air quality. Outdoor ambient air quality is important because it affects indoor air quality. Unprecedented growth of urban agglomeration, population blast, and unrestricted use of natural resources as well as nonrenewable fuels eventually results in higher pollution and driving the world away from the sustainable development goals. Rising air pollution levels around the globe is an alarming situation for all lifeforms. It also affects the nonliving things such as structures, metals, and water bodies. In this chapter, to predict air quality in seven Indian smart cities, a data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) is merged with particle swarm optimization (PSO), a nature-inspired optimization technique. The PSO technique presented in this chapter functions as an ANN optimization technique. The data were obtained from the online web repository called Kaggle. The data-sets for 12 pollutants were selected for 7 Indian smart cities. The datasets were recorded during the last 5 years from 2016 to 2020 and were included for computation. Models can be used by air quality managers to forecast the effects of prospective new emissions. Policy makers often use models to predict ambient air pollution concentrations under various scenarios as a decision-making tool. Because of the robustness and effectiveness of AI models, the public will be able to get early warning for a high concentration level of pollutants in big cities, potentially lowering cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. The findings proved PSO's outstanding performance while evaluating high-dimensional data.},

 abstract = {Smart cities emphasize the use of advanced technology to deliver better services to and improve the well-being of their residents. Since the administrative authorities that manage cities often lack the knowledge and skills needed to transform their operations in this way, smart city initiatives usually involve a complex set of actors, from local urban authorities and their technical departments to small and large IT firms, academics, and civic organizations, as well as individual citizens. Mediating organizations are often set up to coordinate and manage such interactions. However, little is known about the roles and activities of such bodies. Using data from the Dublin smart city projects, this study draws on the concept of boundary spanning to develop a taxonomy of the work of such intermediaries. Divided into technical, political, social, and cultural domains, the study demonstrates the critical role of the work done by such bodies in enhancing collaboration among and the participation of a diverse group of citizens, IT and digital strategy departments of local authorities, universities and local/international IT companies (e.g., Google, Facebook or Airbnb), leading to a bottom-up governance style of leading smart city initiatives and projects.},

 abstract = {This study aims to assess the vulnerability and capacity of Bhubaneswar, India's first smart-city, to the most recent extremely severe cyclonic (ESC) storm ‘Fani’ which ravaged the city on May 3, 2019. After 2 weeks of its impact, this study conducted a household survey in the central part of Bhubaneswar city (comprising of different wards), where smart-city projects were implemented and ongoing. Survey questions categorized into Social & Human, Financial, Physical, and Smart-city factors and their corresponding indicators were chosen through literature review and some modified based on local conditions. A total of 22 vulnerability and 40 capacity indicators were used to calculate the vulnerability and capacity index. The result indicates that overall capacity overweighs the overall vulnerability in the central part of the city during the Fani cyclone. Specifically, the city was more vulnerable based on Financial factors, whereas more capable and smartly prepared for the cyclone in the context of Social & Human factors, Physical factors, and Smart-city factors. The study indicates the mitigating impact of the smart-city project in the central Bhubaneswar city area and applauds the step taken by the government for preparation during such an extreme event. The realizations of these results will help the government to further improve its disaster management plan with important infrastructural modification highlighted in this study.},

 abstract = {Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for monitoring and remote control. Sensor networks are being integrated into all areas of the infrastructures of smart cities. The sensor network data stream contains information that can be utilized to model and control the activity of these infrastructures. However, SCADA systems are constantly exposed to a variety of diverse intrusions, making detection with traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) extremely difficult. Due to their unique specifications, conventional security solutions, like antivirus and firewall software, are unsuitable for properly securing SCADA systems. In addition, anomaly detection in industrial sensor networks (ISNs) should occur in real time. Therefore, effectively identifying cyberattacks in major SCADA systems is unquestionably essential for enhancing their resilience, ensuring safe operations, and avoiding expensive maintenance. We developed a novel hybrid ensemble model approach to address these issues. This paper's primary objective is to detect hostile intrusions that have already circumvented firewalls and typical IDS. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Ensemble Learning Model (ELM) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems with ISNs utilizing a tangible data gathered from a gas pipeline system given by Mississippi State University (MSU), the water system, and the high-dimensional University of New South Wales-NB 2015 (UNSW-NB15) data that reflects a typical attack in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The unity normalization method was adopted for data preprocessing, and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized for feature extraction of the high-dimensional datasets. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) was used for optimizing the bagging, stacking, Adaboost, and an ensemble of classifiers Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with a majority voting technique. Then, we utilized the proposed approach founded on the bijective soft-set approach for efficient ELM selection. The experiment was conducted in two phases: Initially, without PCA + GWO for feature extraction and selection on the ELM, and subsequently, with PCA + GWO for feature extraction and selection on the ELM. PCA + GWO on the ensemble of classifiers NB + SVM provided an accuracy of 99%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and detection rate of 99.90%, outpacing the ensemble of classifiers without PCA feature extraction and GWO optimization approaches.},

Considering that, due to multiple environmental and societal pressures, land use, has become more political than ever, whereby pleas for open and transparent methods of coordination, deliberation, and participation proliferate, it is imperative that citizens are involved in the land use policymaking at the level of the city and the neighborhoods. Even if substantial literature addressing each of these issues exists, approaches that would fit these multiple pieces of the puzzle together in one equation are still missing. By elaborating on the findings of an online survey (N = 5752) involving the citizens of a smart city (Lublin, Poland), this paper responds to this imperative. The findings suggest that utilizing insights from e-participation tools and surveys, in combination with more traditional instruments, such as meetings, debates, and workshops, may significantly improve land use policies in (smart) cities.},

 abstract = {Software Defined Networks (SDNs) is modern network paradigm that separately manages the control logic-plane and hardware data-plane. The programmable network SDN centrally manages different smart devices connected in the networks. These smart devices are facilitated by Internet of Things (IoT) and collect real time data for network devices. One of the emerging applications of IoT network is Smart City which purpose is to manage the city without human interventions. The rapid growths of IoT devices like actuators and sensors in smart city are generating large amount of data and increasing the traffic in network. To maintain the quality of services (QoS) of smart city IoT networks, the SDN characteristic is one way to provide better services to network users. Traditional IoT network having the challenges like, access delays, security and reliability issues. The SDN enabled IoT networks are capable to overcome these challenges and improves the network performance. One single controller is not sufficient to manage all IoT devices in smart city networks. So, multiple controllers are required to handle Software Defined-IoT Networks (SDN-IoT). Different metaheuristic algorithms are implemented to overcome controller placements problems (CPP) but as the number of controllers increases the performance of approaches degrades due to premature conversions. To better balance the exploration and exploitation features an intelligent Hybrid Differential Evolution and Whale Optimization (DEWO) Algorithm is proposed that optimizes the controller placements in SDN-IoT enabled smart city networks. The algorithm searches the optimal locations of controllers and balance the switch loads in respect of minimum latency. The algorithm also minimizes the link failure and evaluate the minimum end to end delay. The proposed hybrid algorithm is evaluated up to 40 controllers with other state of art method and able to achieve better results in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms.},

 abstract = {The real time Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading have ameliorated the smart city environment. Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart cities have made it possible to balance the energy demand and supply without burdening the power grids. They also help in minimizing both the heap amounts of pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions. EVs not only charge their batteries from Charging Stations (CSs), but when the smart city faces energy deficiency, they supply their surplus energy to the power grids to fulfill energy demand as well. In addition, EVs also balance the energy demand and supply through energy trading at the local level during peak hours, which strengthens V2V energy trading. However, some issues, such as security threats and privacy leakage prevent EVs from participating in the energy trading process. In addition, the lack of incentives and knowledge about the cost of reaching the energy trading place within minimum time are also big challenges. Therefore, to solve the aforementioned challenges, a secure and efficient scheme for V2V and V2G energy trading is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme also helps in promoting environmental friendliness and making the smart cities sustainable and reliable. In the proposed scheme, energy trading transactions are secured using consortium blockchain, wherein the Local Aggregators (LAGs) are selected as authorized nodes. LAGs perform their role as energy brokers and are responsible for validating the energy trading requests using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a solution to find accurate distance with required expenses and time to reach the charging destination is also proposed, which effectively guides EVs to reach the relevant CSs and encourages energy trading. Besides, we propose a fair payment mechanism using a smart contract to avoid financial irregularities. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also given in the proposed work to prevent EVs from acting selfishly. The efficient power flow having minimized losses in the vehicular network is of much importance. Therefore, the energy losses incurred in both V2G and V2V are discussed in this work. Furthermore, Oyente is used for smart contract’s security analysis and for testing Ethereum’s resilience against different security flaws. Two attacker models are proposed and the security analyses of the models are also provided. The analyses show that the proposed system is robust against the double spending and Sybil attacks. Finally, the efficient performance of our proposed scheme is validated and analyzed. The simulation results proved that our proposed work outperforms existing work in terms of providing a secure and efficient energy trading platform for both V2G and V2V environments.},

In the last few years, several techniques and models are used for retrieving significant information from urban big data of smart cities. This research work aims at developing a data fusion-based traffic congestion control system in smart cities using a deep learning model.
Methodology
A hybrid model based on the convolution neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) architectures are used for region-based traffic flow predictions in smart cities. CNN is used for the classification of spatial data while LSTM for temporal data.
Conclusion
The experiments used the CityPulse Traffic and CityPulse Pollution datasets, and measured root mean square error (RMSE), time consumption and accuracy. A small RMSE value of 49 and highest accuracy of 92.3% compared to other baseline models depicts the applicability of the proposed model in the region-based traffic flow prediction problems in the smart cities.},

 abstract = {A smart city model views the city as a complex adaptive system consisting of services, resources, and citizens that learn through interaction and change in both the spatial and temporal domains. The characteristics of dynamic evolution and complexity are key issues for megacity planners and require a new systematic and modeling approach. Multiscale models involved in smart cities and megacities have recently become a popular topic because they can understand complex adaptive systems and efficiently solve complex problems at multiple scales (i.e., micro, meso, and macro) to improve system efficiency and reduce computational complexity and cost. However, there are numerous opportunities to improve this interdisciplinary field considering the lack of applicability of the multiscale modeling approach in megacities and smart cities, and the potential of multiscale modeling in various complex systems within smart cities. Therefore, a review that summarizes the state-of-art researches and opens opportunities around the theme of multiscale modeling participating in megacities and smart cities is warranted. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive review covering the introduction of megacities, their current challenges, and their emergence in smart cities. Then, the introduction of the smart city along with its characteristics and different generations is disclosed. Moreover, we shed light on multiscale modeling, its categories (i.e., sequential multiscale modeling and concurrent multiscale modeling), and the need for multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities along with its emerging applications.

 abstract = {Increasing levels of communication and automation has led to the development of cyber physical systems applications known as cooperative driving automation. While such applications provide enormous benefits in improving transportation systems operation and environmental sustainability, they also introduce new risks to smart cities. These systems provide wider access to adversaries and increase the attack surface to compromise the operation of smart cities. This study develops a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) based cooperative driving automation platform to understand and analyze the cyber risks in these systems from a V2I perspective in a representative traffic environment. Three cyberattacks (Fake BSMs, replay and denial of service) were emulated as a cooperative game to assess the impact on volatility, energy efficiency and traffic flow stability. The critical nature of cooperative driving automation is revealed by this research and flow stability, and energy efficiency of cooperative driving automation are severely impacted by the three categories of cyberattacks. Further, a 35 %-40 % increase in volatility in acceleration-deceleration regimes along with 20 % increase in emission is observed as opposed to the baseline case with no cyberattacks. The proposed long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM) showed an average detection accuracy of around 98 % for the analyzed cyberattacks. The research findings would foster the development of algorithms to continuously monitor the state of cooperative automated driving environment for anomalous behavior and promote resilient and environmentally sustainable cities in the future.},

 abstract = {Increasing levels of communication and automation has led to the development of cyber physical systems applications known as cooperative driving automation. While such applications provide enormous benefits in improving transportation systems operation and environmental sustainability, they also introduce new risks to smart cities. These systems provide wider access to adversaries and increase the attack surface to compromise the operation of smart cities. This study develops a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) based cooperative driving automation platform to understand and analyze the cyber risks in these systems from a V2I perspective in a representative traffic environment. Three cyberattacks (Fake BSMs, replay and denial of service) were emulated as a cooperative game to assess the impact on volatility, energy efficiency and traffic flow stability. The critical nature of cooperative driving automation is revealed by this research and flow stability, and energy efficiency of cooperative driving automation are severely impacted by the three categories of cyberattacks. Further, a 35 %-40 % increase in volatility in acceleration-deceleration regimes along with 20 % increase in emission is observed as opposed to the baseline case with no cyberattacks. The proposed long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM) showed an average detection accuracy of around 98 % for the analyzed cyberattacks. The research findings would foster the development of algorithms to continuously monitor the state of cooperative automated driving environment for anomalous behavior and promote resilient and environmentally sustainable cities in the future.},

 abstract = {The extensive deployment of the Internet of things (IoT) devices in urban areas enables smart city systems (e.g., urban traffic detection and air pollution monitoring) to use these devices to discover the affected regions by various events, particularly complex ones. A complex event is inferred from patterns of different individual primitive events according to their spatio-temporal information. Complex event processing (CEP) systems facilitate applications to define their reasoning rules based on event processing languages (EPL), similar to SQL. However, current languages and CEP engines do not efficiently support spatial data characteristics. Geospatial CEP is challenging since applications have diverse definitions for complex events (e.g., air quality index), IoT devices have heterogeneous specifications/capabilities, and complex events may happen concurrently. This paper proposes the Geo-Tesla language that enables smart city applications to define spatial attributes in complex event definitions and reasoning rules. Then, we devise the GeoT-Rex CEP engine that implements geospatial operations that compiles Geo-Tesla language and processes the spatial data. The integration of Geo-Tesla and GeoT-Rex enables applications to process complex events with spatial characteristics in their reasoning rules and identify boundaries of the detected complex event (event footprint). The evaluation results from the proof of concept implementation show that our proposed solution outperforms in identifying the footprint of complex events up to 44% in the largest network size. They also show that the detection percentage in the concurrent appearance of complex events is 40% more on average than a close state-of-the-art baseline.},

 abstract = {Since urban problems are increasingly becoming complex and multifaceted due to the rapid urbanization, interest in the development of smart cities as an efficient solution to such problems is growing. The significance of smart cities lies in not having technology itself but using technology with a novel approach to solve urban problems, enhance the quality of life for urban residents, and optimize government performance. Such an approach includes scientifically processing civic query (including complaints, suggestions, and inquiry) data about a city and planning the city such that its policies reflect its residents' voices to ensure “throughput legitimacy.” This study introduces a novel approach to analyze diverse informal civic query data for a city and plan the city in a way that its residents want. By analyzing 160,000 civic queries accumulated over 10 years from 2006 to 2017 from the “Oasis of 10 Million Imagination,” which is a civic participation platform of Seoul, this study aims to contribute to the sustainable development of Seoul so that it can plan a citizen-centric and smart city that satisfies the demands of its residents. By applying Dynamic Topic Model, the authors intend to specify civic demands and forecast the demands of citizens.},

 abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have emerged with energy conservation systems for managing energy in cities as well as buildings. Although many studies on energy conservation systems of smart homes have already been conducted, energy management at the city level is still a challenge due to the various building types and complex infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigated the research themes on smart homes and cities through a quantitative review and identified barriers to the progression of smart homes to sustainable smart cities through a qualitative review. Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the “bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)” are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level. This paper is expected to play a leading role as a knowledge-based systematic guide for future research on the implementation of energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT
The research questions of the current study include: “Is it beneficial for countries, local governments, and autonomous districts with a high level of e-government to become smarter cities with the electronic, digital, and smart introduction of information and communications technology (ICT) technologies?” “Do cities with well-developed e-governments have a similar process from e-government to smarter cities?”, and “Do cities with similar levels of e-government or smarter cities go through different development processes in terms of their socio-cultural attributes?” This study focuses on the fact that e-government and smart cities, whose academic roots arose differently over time, are evolving to address governance, including next-generation e-government, urban e-government, and civic engagement, which has expanded to digital government and platform government concepts. Therefore, the scope of this study is set to e-government and smart/smarter cities as platforms. By comparing the key success factors of e-government with the smart city through a prior study, some intersections were found, but the success factors of the e-government and smart city were different. In order to explain the change of system from e-government to smart city as a platform in the socio-cultural attributes in which each case is involved, two cases—the Royal Borough of Greenwich and Seongdong-gu—were selected under similar conditions by comparing the e-government development level, economic indicators, and smart city development level. As a result of the case analysis, it was confirmed that the development level of e-government affected the smarter city process. The changes in the system from e-government to smart city was capable of being explained in different ways depending on the social and cultural attributes. In the process from e-government to smarter city, the case of Seongdong-gu, which has followed the informatization project and e-government development formula, was analyzed from the viewpoint of institutional overwrap, and the case of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, which was an active innovation agent for solving urban problems through public-private cooperation, was analyzed from the viewpoint of institutional transformation. In the Korean context with a collective hierarchical culture, citizens and stakeholders have participated in the public sector to the extent that they raise issues and express their preferences in policy-making decisions. The governments, including the autonomous district, have still treated citizens and stakeholders as guidance targets or customers rather than cooperative partners. On the other hand, the UK, which has an individualistic rational culture, citizens and stakeholders have become accustomed to maintaining cooperative relationships and operating cities based on partnerships as innovators. Since the socio-cultural contexts of each country have affected the actual system operations and changes, implementation plans and solutions under feasibilities need to take into account critical success factors and the socio-cultural properties of each autonomous district for the introduction, expansion, and establishment of smarter cities. This result of this study is that transferability considering sociocultural properties should be considered when introducing best practices, etc.},

Thus, many countries are introducing smart city services, and some companies are entirely focused on developing the technology for the services. However, the classification of smart cities based on how they are developed is currently underexplored. This study analyzes smart cities built and operated by major countries and companies within the smart city framework. Firstly, the direction of smart city development in each city is changing. In the past, the goal of a smart city was to build urban infrastructure. However, the current focus is on providing smart city services. Thus, the operation and maintenance of smart city services are becoming more important than building them. Secondly, the manner in which companies secure smart city services has become diverse. As such, companies may be classified into those that secure the entire value chain of smart cities and those that own only some smart city services. Thirdly, companies are actively establishing a cooperative system to secure smart city technology. Rather than developing all the required technology, they demonstrate flexibility in responding to various smart city needs by collaborating with companies that provide individual services.},

First, topic modeling and network analysis are conducted using patent text data and international patent classification code, respectively. Patents are classified and defined based on the technology theme and the type of technology provider. Second, hardware-oriented and service application-oriented technologies are classified and predicted using machine learning. Third, the similarities in growth patterns of different technology groups are explored using dynamic time warping (DTW). Moreover, lagging or preceding relationships are examined using multivariate time series analysis. Network infrastructure and Internet-of-things (IoT) application technologies have short-term lagging and preceding relationships along with long-term equilibrium relationships. In terms of player groups, long-term relationships between device vendors, chipset makers, network operator and IoT service provider, and network equipment vendors are confirmed. Technologies for realizing a sustainable city must be prioritized, and the strategic direction of technology must be established to realize truly smart sustainable cities. The supplier of technologies along with possible collaboration opportunities must also be selected.

 abstract = {To address various urban issues such as fine dust, traffic congestion, and water shortage caused by rapid urbanization, a national pilot Smart City is planned in two Korean cities, Sejong and Busan. As weather data is crucial for improving the environment and operating future transportation while constructing a smart city, preparing for future weather disasters by analyzing the characteristics of various meteorological phenomena in the planned development area is necessary. This study analyzed the fog generation characteristics for the period of 2016–2020 at the automatic weather system sites of the Korea Meteorological Administration in Sejong and Busan, and the characteristics of the meteorological elements during fog were investigated. Additionally, three machine learning based models, including Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Network DNN-1 and DNN-2, were constructed for estimating visibility using meteorological input variables. In Sejong, approximately 50 fog days were observed annually for the analysis period, with the highest frequency of these days being during autumn. The fog hours were distributed from nighttime to before sunrise and 94.3% of the fog occurred when the wind speed was less than 1.5 m/s, showing the characteristics of radiative fog. Most of the fog occurred during summer in Busan, and the maximum number of fog days was observed in July. The average wind speed during fog was approximately 2.5 m/s, which was relatively large, suggesting that advection fog was likely to occur. As a result of estimating visibility from the ML-based models, the RF model had the highest R2 (0.66 and 0.53) in both regions, but the visibility estimated from the RF model had an over- and under-estimation for short and long visibility ranges, respectively. DNN-1 and DNN-2 models have lower biases. In the detection of fog-possible weather based on the estimated visibility from the models, the best precisions (0.85 and 0.84) and F1-scores (0.76 and 0.74) were from the RF model, but model recall was better in the DNN-1 model. The model recalls for the detection of the thick and dense fog were also better in the DNN models. ML-based models presented reasonable performance but revealed their weaknesses and strengths depending on performance indicators.},

In the context of resilience, a smart tourism city could be a solution for enhancing community resilience. Thus, it is important to identify available community resources to help people cope with adversity, which can contribute to the overriding goal of a smart tourism city. To do this, we aim to provide empirical evidence on the spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters as community resources on community resilience to advance the building of a resilient smart tourism city. Using spatial econometric modeling with spatial data, we measure the spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters on community resilience in the United States. The findings reveal the significant spatial spillover effects of sport industry clusters on community resilience within a specific region and across surrounding regions. The findings of this study provide policymakers and practitioners with spatial information on regional sport industry clusters as community resources that are locally bound and specialize in smart tourism and planning to enhance community resilience.},

 abstract = {Before the terms “smart city” and “floating city” were introduced, the world's population had increased and land shortage across the world was already widely recognized. As a first challenge, the previous studies have developed the concept of a smart city as a creative answer, following that, several scientists proposed the floating city concept in the literature as a solution to the increased sea levels. Moreover, engineers, architects, and designers deal with city planning, for smart and floating settlements as a difficult design challenge, and evolutionary algorithms could be employed to address this complex problem by optimizing residents' needs. As a continuation of our previous studies on this topic, this time, we develop a multi-objective continuous genetic algorithm with differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy (MO_CGADE) and a multi-objective ensemble differential evolution algorithm (MO_EDE) to solve the problem on hand. Then, we compare the performance of the MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) to maximize two conflicted objective functions, namely, scenery, and walkability in the proposed smart floating city model created in the Grasshopper Algorithmic Modeling Environment. The parametric model that we create in the Grasshopper software includes 64 decision variables, area constraints and objective functions to be optimized by MO_CGADE, MO_EDE, and NSGAII algorithms. Computational results show that MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms generate better Pareto ranking results than the traditional NSGAII algorithm in terms of cardinality, distribution spacing, and coverage metrics.},

In this paper, the smart city concept is addressed by developing a hybrid methodology consisting of two phases. In the first phase, a qualitative analysis is established to determine the smart city concept. In the second phase, the DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique is used to examine smart city focusing on the dimensions derived from the literature in the form of six main and 33 sub-dimensions. Data is collected by contacting ten academia experts through a questionnaire specifically designed; open-ended questions and DEMATEL technique assessments. Results indicated that both phases had different outputs. While technology was highlighted and possible managerial issues emerged in the qualitative section, on the contrary, in the quantitative section, ‘smart people’ has emerged as the most important predictor of the smart city while ‘smart governance’ was the least. By the DEMATEL, not only the most and the least important dimensions within each group revealed but also the causer and receiver effects of each dimension. Further, the results and implications of the study are discussed.},

 abstract = {A smart city is a system that uses technology means to create, implement, and promote environmentally friendly solutions to the problems caused by growing urbanisation. The smart city is a key answer that will allow us to continue with our regular lives during and after the epidemic. To better serve its citizens, a smart city takes advantage of modern technology and innovative solutions in areas including healthcare, educational, energy provision, transport, and communications. Applications of the Internet of Things have led to the development of "Smart Cities" all around the globe. In order to further the development of smart cities toward effective sharing and interconnection, this study will examine the smart city data technology based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing (CC). Initially, we gather IoT data based on the smart cities. The gathered data is normalised. Machine learning sets the way for the IoT, which allows machines to communicate with one another without any human intervention. So we utilize machine learning algorithm called Advanced Random Forest (ARF). For multi-criteria optimization, we suggest Adaptive cloud computing virtual machine resource allocation technique (ACC-VMRA). We analyse and simulate the use of IoT and CC technologies in a smart city to verify its efficacy. The experimental finding demonstrates the recommended optimization algorithm's superior efficiency to other currently used techniques.},

In general, cities are required to effectively manage a wide range of incidents-from routine activities such as repairs and road accidents to life-threatening crises such as terrorist acts and natural disasters. If the city wants to effectively manage these incidents, it needs the ability to understand what is happening, to share information quickly, to direct responses based on standardized procedures, and then to constantly improve these procedures according to the best experience so far. The object of the research is the method, which is the introduction of a new information system in the field of building smart cities in practice. We solved the assignment through: Analysis of faults and their consequences (FMEA), using the process type of analysis. When solving the security of the new information system in the area of smart city through the FMEA method was identified barriers / failures of individual steps that threaten the process. By designing and applying appropriate measures, we managed to reduce the residual risk of the information system so that all values were below the limit of risk acceptability.},

Cities on a global scale continuously launch new digital services and smart solutions in order to become places that are more resilient, efficient, and attractive. While digitally-driven urban development has become a new paradigm for cities, the digital divide is emerging as a serious concern when it comes to the goal of making cities accessible and inclusive for everyone, especially the most vulnerable. Issues such as digital inclusion and access to key urban services, information, and experiences by people with disabilities (PwD) are critical areas in which cities face important challenges related to ethical and responsible governance. The aim of this paper is to provide conceptual and empirical insights into the culture of digital accessibility of PwD on an urban scale. It argues that leadership in digital accessibility can inspire transformative change, allowing cities to be envisioned from the standpoint of digital inclusion and equity, thereby fostering a barrier-free, digital urban logic.},

In the case of the ASCN, technocratic regionalism is used to spur urban development through the rollout of smart city plans, policies and projects across Southeast Asia. As such, it is a regional strategy designed to scale smartness, and thus deprovincialise the city by embedding it within transnational flows of capital, ideas and expertise. At the same time, however, already existing urban issues have the potential to re-provincialise the city. The vagaries of local contexts, structures of governance and urban cultures complicate processes of scalar ascendency and thus foreground the paradox of (de)provincialisation. We identify three challenges – divergent infrastructural developments, vertical and horizontal (non-)integration, and the need to reconcile (in)formal spaces of the “smart” city – that underpin the translational politics of technocratic regionalism, and which are likely to compromise the efficacy and success of the ASCN.},

The present paper systematically examines how such data-based value creation generates challenges for decision-makers in the smart city and how they can deal with these challenges. It formulates a coherent data governance framework that comprehensively covers ethical and legitimacy challenges which can arise over the various stages of data-based value creation. The framework translates abstract ethical requirements into a set of systematically derived governance mechanisms which are at the same time anchored in the concept of democratic accountability. This guiding principle does not demand that citizens necessarily become active themselves to realize citizen-centric data governance for socially sustainable smart city development. Rather, it demands that data governance comprises a suitable set of accountability measures that put the purposes of any data use center-stage.},

However, the issue of bias in these data and the fairness of outcomes in smart cities has received relatively limited attention. This is a troubling and significant omission, as social equity should be a critical aspect of smart cities and needs to be addressed and accounted for in the use of new technologies and data tools. This paper examines bias in resident-reported data by analyzing socio-spatial disparities in ‘311’ complaint behavior in Kansas City, Missouri. We utilize data from detailed 311 reports and a comprehensive resident satisfaction survey, and spatially join these data with code enforcement violations, neighborhood characteristics, and street condition assessments. We introduce a model to identify disparities in resident-government interactions and classify under- and over-reporting neighborhoods based on complaint behavior. Despite greater objective and subjective need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems. Our findings form the basis for acknowledging and accounting for data bias in self-reported data, and contribute to the more equitable delivery of city services through bias-aware data-driven processes.},

However, the approach faces challenges when multiple goals shall be simultaneously achieved. For illustration, we study a multi-agent system, where agents have a plurality of different, and mutually inconsistent goals. We then allow agents in the system to vote on which traffic signal controllers, which were trained on different goals using deep reinforcement learning, would control the intersection. Taking decisions based on suitable voting procedures turns out to lead to favorable solutions, which perform highly for several goals rather than optimally for one goal and poorly for others. This opens up new opportunities for the management or even self-governance of complex systems that require the consideration and achievement of multiple goals, such as many systems involving humans. Here, we present results for traffic flows in urban street networks, which suggest that “democratizing traffic” would be a promising alternative to centralized control of traffic flows.},

Rooftop photovoltaics is a promising solution for sustainable energy production in urban environments. Understanding their potential and their obstacles is critical for their better performance and establishment, both in financial and environmental terms. The main factors that influence solar photovoltaic efficiency are the percentage of sunlight and the power capacity, that's why many studies have proposed various installed power capacity assessment models and they have tried to analyze the so-called shadow effect. Ιn a more inclusive context, smart energy or renewable cities, an advanced term of smart city scenario, are a concept that implies that not only individual owners will benefit of the advantages from renewable sources, but whole places will integrate physical, digital, and human systems in traditional networks and services to better use energy resources and reduce emissions to the benefit of citizens and businesses. Already many countries around the world, with several policies and proposals, are promoting more sustainable urban areas with the use of latest smart technologies and renewable energy sources. Examples given from many different countries are analyzing the installation process, the financial benefits, the local policies, and other factors that affect rooftop PVs in various study cases. The concept of Smart Renewable Cities refers to cities that are willing or have already made a commitment for a green transition focusing on the production of electricity by the use of renewable energy sources, mainly solar and wind energy.

Analytically, the author's concept is represented by an irreversible Markov process, for which a system of equilibrium equations and stationary probabilities are defined. Based on the latter, a qualitative metric was formulated, which included such indicators as the average number of requests accepted for service in the 5 G cluster, the probability of losing an incoming request, and the average volume of network resource units used in the 5 G cluster. For the single input data that characterizes a real NS 5 G cluster, a comparison of the author's and known competing access control schemes in terms of formulated qualitative metrics is implemented. The obtained results showed that the author's concept prevails over the competitor in the range of low loads. Note that in this range, the advantage of the author's scheme over the competitor significantly increases with the increase in the number of network segments into which the information environment of the 5 G cluster is divided.},

However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, increasing urbanization has necessitated the social, environmental, and economic development of cities to enhance the Quality of Life (QoL) significantly and introduces the “Smart City” concept. It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others. The 6G communication network takes care of latency and reliability issues in the smart city with their unique characteristics such as latency (10–100 μs) and reliability (99.99999%). Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review for blockchain technology and IoT together functional to smart cities. First, state-of-art-the works and contextual information are introduced. Then, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized architecture for IoT-integrated smart cities covering different application perspectives, such as smart grid, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and healthcare 5.0 underlying 6G communication networks. Next, we describe the challenges of the proposed architecture respective to each application, as mentioned above. Finally, we collated the open research issues and future direction to efficiently integrate blockchain into IoT-envisioned smart cities.},

 abstract = {With the widespread adoption of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), context awareness, and decentralized computing at the edge of the network, service delivery in smart city parlance has been rapidly evolved. Management of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure for such dynamic environment at scale brings about new challenges. Existing fog layer resource management involves context-sharing and migration for real-time vertical and cross-vertical services. However, improper context migration might affect performance negatively. In this paper, the authors have envisioned improving the Quality of Service (QoS) of smart transportation while employing context-aware computing and Artificial Intelligence, which helps alleviate massive data transfers among Fog nodes and intelligent vehicles in real-time. The proposed Context-Aware Intelligent Transportation System (CAITS) manages the services of intelligent vehicles and manages the road traffic of traditional vehicles in an effective manner, with a three-layered learning model that accounts for on-vehicle, on-co-vehicle, and on-fog-and-vehicle learning by means of a platoon control algorithm as well as federated learning at the Fog level. Simulations are carried out on CloudSim simulator under different scenarios and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves prediction efficacy of contexts at the Fog layer by approximately 8%–24% than existing models which in turn reflects in reduced service time and energy consumption of EVs and reduces the CO2 of environment.},

 abstract = {Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum in the recent past. While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real’ smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings’.},

 abstract = {The idea of a smart city is one that utilises Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies and data analytics to optimise the efficiency of city operations and services, so as to provide a high quality of life for its citizens. Due to reduced public funding, many public transport systems are already facing challenges to maintain their services. For a smart city, the goal of public transport is not simply the movement of people, but the provision and enhancement of mobility for living. This will be particularly challenging due to changes in habitation trends and work patterns. For example, the growth of mega-cities has led to extreme traffic congestion in city centres and urban sprawl on their outskirts. In order to provide sufficient coverage and frequency of service, an integrated co-ordinated multi-modal public transport system is needed, leading to substantial increase in operational complexity. Environmental concerns and the recent pandemic may also change work and commuting patterns in the future, with more people working from home and companies adopting flexible work shifts. For smart cities, public transport must offer ubiquitous access, real-time response to demand, convenience and quality service, and energy-efficient operations. This paper will discuss the challenges in network design, operations planning, scheduling and management of smart public transport systems. A brief survey of recent research and innovations will also be presented.},

Further, this paper looks beyond the smart city vision to making Kochi a creative city as well. Kochi has a unique mixture of ethnicity, culture, architecture and cuisine owing to the influence of traders from around the world as well as various parts of India.

Due to such issues, the cities are more susceptible to natural disasters. Although many preparations are made against natural disasters in urban life, it is evident that adequate measures are not taken against secondary disasters. One of the most destructive and frequent secondary disasters is fires after earthquakes. In this study, an early fire detection system is proposed in order to minimize the losses caused by fires in the potentially chaotic environment that may occur after earthquakes in cities. This system consists of a structure that detects fire with convolutional neural network (CNN) based You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, determines the geolocation of the fire with stereo vision/epipolar geometry and provides information to the disaster management center via wireless sensor network (WSN). Experimental test findings conducted in İstanbul verify that the proposed system would be useful for post-earthquake fire detection with low cost, high reliability and high accuracy.},

One dimension of a smart city, i.e., smart people/society, suggests that a smart city requires high-quality social interactions and social relationships that help cities connect with their residents and the outside world. For this purpose, smart cities in Indonesia have developed digital platforms (internet websites and mobile applications) to disseminate the cities' programs and information and facilitate sharing of information among its residents. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platforms. We used a quantitative approach by conducting surveys in 8 smart cities in Indonesia, with 1161 respondents. The survey data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that social factors (sense of belonging and seeking reputations) have dominant roles in determining residents' intention to seek information on smart city platforms. In turn, the intention to seek information is the key factor that affects the residents' intention to share information on the smart city platforms and on their online social network. This paper provides insights on the factors that need more attention from smart city administrators to improve resident engagement and enhance the dimension of smart people.},

 abstract = {Successful implementation of smart energy cities in Turkey is essential to optimize urban energy systems. Turkey faces several barriers on its way to establishing smart energy cities. Since assessment of these barriers must be handled by considering many different perspectives, assessment of the critical barriers for SEC can be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This study aims to identify possible critical barriers hindering Turkey from becoming an SEC and prioritize these barriers based on an integrated MCDM methodology. This methodology consists of fuzzy Decision Making Trail and Evaluating Laboratory (DEMATEL) and cognitive mapping methods. The integrated methodology has been constructed with hesitant fuzzy Z-numbers, which allows not only to state the impreciseness of the evaluations but also to consider the hesitancy of the decision-makers to evaluate barriers concerning SEC implementation in Turkey. While the relations between the barriers have been determined via the hesitant fuzzy Z-DEMATEL method, their weights have been obtained through the hesitant fuzzy Z-cognitive mapping method. For Turkey, policy, economic, and social barriers are determined as the essential main barriers, respectively. Besides, the following five sub-barriers: the lack of successful past experiences/projects, social/political conflicts, inadequate regulatory framework, lack of regulatory norms, policies/directions, the lack of technical knowledge among planners, and information on new technology are deserved to be more attention since they have high weights. The research should help policymakers and businesses better understand the barriers to smart energy city projects in order to improve effective action and policy interventions that lead to more successful projects.},

Imbibed with utopian technological planning, understanding the convergence between smart development and sustainable practices for city development is necessary. Smart cities have succeeded in bringing high standards of living to its residents. This article evaluates the long-term sustainability performance of 35 leading European smart cities over time from 2015 till 2020 to understand on how these cities address sustainability to make the concept of smart sustainable cities more actionable. A novel Double-Frontier Slack Based Measure Data Envelopment Analysis (DFSBM-DEA) model considering undesirable factors in the technology set is proposed for the assessment. An integrated relative sustainability performance assessment model considering both the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoint simultaneously, in terms of interval efficiency is used to determine the most efficient smart city under 6 various dimensions of sustainable development. These key dimensions include; Energy and Environmental Resource, Governance and Institution, Economic dynamism, Social cohesion and solidarity, Climate Change and, Safety and Security. A productivity progress assessment from a double frontier perspective using a modified Malmquist-DEA model is then used to capture the response of each smart city in terms of their productivity growth towards achieving sustainable development. Results show Dublin (ranked 1st) as the most smart and sustainable European city under all the proposed dimensions of sustainable development from the double-frontier perspective. Along with Dublin lies Oslo, Zurich and Amsterdam as the cities with high aggregate sustainability performance. The results also revealed significant difference in the productivity progress values from the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoint, thus exemplifying the significance for the proposed aggregate productivity progress measurement model. The findings of the present study contribute to knowledge and practice for smart city modellers, decision makers and urban planners, by aiding methodological clarity in assessing sustainable capacity of cities from a double frontier perspective and, in particular, by drawing attention to underlying assumptions about the role of sustainability in smart city development. This research stands as a breakthrough in the field of relative sustainability assessment using non-parametric approaches and a benchmark for global smart cities to shape their development in light of sustainability.},

Understanding the shades of urban resilience and livability in smart city models is of paramount importance. This study presents a novel two-stage data-driven framework combining a multivariate metric-distance analysis with machine learning (ML) techniques for resilience and livability assessment of smart cities. A longitudinal dataset for 35 top-ranked European smart cities from 2015 till 2020 applied as the case study under the proposed framework. Initially, a metric distance-based weighting approach is used to weight the indicators and quantify the scores across each aspect under city resilience and urban livability. The key aspects under city resilience include social, economic, infrastructure and built environment and, institutional resilience, while under urban livability, the aspects include accessibility, community well-being, and economic vibrancy. Fuzzy c-means clustering as an unsupervised machine learning technique is used to sort smart cities based on the degree of performance. In addition, an intelligent approach is presented for the prediction of the degree of livability, resilience, and aggregate performance of smart cities based on various supervised ML techniques. Classification models such as Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and, ensemble models including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting machine (GBM) were used. Three coefficients (accuracy, Cohen's Kappa (κ) and average area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR)) along with confusion matrix were used to appraise the performance of the classifier ML models. The results revealed GBM as the best classification and predictive model for the resilience, livability, and aggregate performance assessment. The study also revealed Copenhagen, Geneva, Stockholm, Munich, Helsinki, Vienna, London, Oslo, Zurich, and Amsterdam as the smart cities that co-create resilience and livability in their development model with superior performance.},

 abstract = {Cities of the 21st century are buffeted with challenges, leaving potentially serious consequences on the future of urban living. Smartening development in cities has reinvented hopes of melting down predicaments in the early 2000s'. However, perplexed by the intensifying complexities of smart cities, urban living in smart cities needs to be evaluated with multiple conflicting criteria. Multi-criteria-based evaluations have been an answer to this case when attempting to gauge the composite performance of multiple decision-making entities. Several multi-criteria assessment techniques exist when dealing with selection problems. Nonetheless, the vagueness associated with the methodologies accompanied by uncertainties and complexities is inevitable in multi-attribute assessments. Fuzzy-based multi-criteria models are often an answer to such uncertainties when modelling real-world problems. The study thus presents a novel fuzzy expert-based multi-criteria decision support model, where the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is combined with the Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) approach under a spherical fuzzy environment to create a composite index for comprehensive performance monitoring. The case of 35 high-tech European cities was used to empirically validate the proposed novel approach and thus construct a composite index. The composite index considers the intricate facet of integrating the concept of smart cities with sustainability, urban resilience, and livability under a unified framework. The fuzzy c-means partitioning technique was then used to segment smart cities into high, medium, and low-performing classes. A comparative analysis considering several distance-based approaches under a fuzzy environment with the SF-AHP and EDAS methodology is conducted to validate the robustness and stability of the proposed novel decision support model. The results revealed London as the top-ranked smart city that promotes sustainability, resilience, and livability in its current urban development model. Dusseldorf, Zurich, Munich, Oslo, Dublin, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rome, Moscow, and Stockholm were no exemption from addressing the tritactic goals of sustainability, urban resilience, and livability well into their urban development plan and were placed in the high-performance cluster. The proposed model is efficient to express decision makers' preferences in a larger space and modelling functional parameters including hesitancy independently in the 3-dimensional domain. The model supports decision-makers and relocation analysts to assess the performance of smart cities and set targets to improve performance to remodel urban development to a more sustainable, resilient, and livable pattern.},

The appearance of numerous smart city indices, which claim to successfully evaluate and compare smart city performances, is the manifestation of the concept's growing popularity. The central objective of this paper is to address the integrity and quality of the existing smart city indices, and identify those ones which are fit for international comparison. We propose a method for evaluating the integrity and quality of the existing smart city indices in terms of five criteria – Credibility, Reliability, Methodology, Versatility, Precision. The article critically evaluates six smart city indices and concludes that the Cities in Motion Index from the IESE Business School has the best overall performance. To improve the versatility of the existing smart city indices, this paper proposes a new approach based on respecting three main criteria: refining the types of indicator, defining the smart city domains and adopting context-sensitive measurements. These elements are deemed to be essential for any smart city index.},

This study contributes to this stream of research by exploring the determinants of citizen participation in smart city projects. We develop and quantitatively test a model that identifies three key antecedents on a set of survey data collected from French citizens (N = 604). Our results confirm the importance of political efficacy, the conative dimension of sense of belonging, and the central role public administration satisfaction when it comes to evaluating the intention of citizens to participate in smart city projects. Those three dimensions cover essential elements of the human bond between citizens and their smart city. This study not only informs practically the way we can involve individuals into the design and the construction of smart cities that fulfil their need, but also the bottom-up organizing of broader and larger project.},

The extensive experience with the benefits that these advanced urban roads provide informs decision-makers toward efficient investments in advanced systems for urban roads. However, there is no tool designed to evaluate the developmental status of urban roads in a smart city. Therefore, this study has developed a hierarchy table of indicators and measures specific to assessing the current status of urban road innovation for smart cities. A keyword network analysis was used to develop the hierarchy table. The procedures take three phases: data preparation, data analysis, and hierarchy table development. As a result, the hierarchy table includes 53 measures in 14 indicators connected to the five smart city components (e.g., environment, mobility, governance, economy, and living). The hierarchy table can be used for city officials to assess the current status of urban roads in the transition of a smart city, which leads to an explicit investment decision on urban road innovation. The procedures presented in this study can be adapted to develop indicators and measures for other service areas necessary for a smart city.},

This study demonstrates that the innovation network is driven by the activities of searching, acting, and convincing actors of an opportunity to develop smart city solutions. The findings also show that innovation networks emerge not solely from a business goal, but also from a social goal and can still generate business opportunities for companies. Therefore, innovation for smart cities specifically requires a new form of configuration (public–private and citizens’ participation), drivers (economic and social), and resources (technological and non-technological) in both its development and implementation. The analysis of the different configurations suggests more/less effective innovation.},

Making cities smarter implies not only technological innovation and deployment, but also having smart people and effective policies. Cities can acquire knowledge and incorporate governance lessons from other jurisdictions to develop smart city initiatives that are unique to the local contexts. We conducted two rounds of surveys involving 23 experts on an e-Delphi platform to consolidate their opinion on factors that facilitate policy transfer among smart cities. Findings show a consensus on the importance of six factors: having a policy entrepreneur; financial instruments; cities’ enthusiasm for policy learning; capacity building; explicit regulatory mechanisms; and policy adaptation to local contexts. Correspondingly, three policy recommendations were drawn. Formalizing collaborative mechanisms and joint partnerships between cities, setting up regional or international networks of smart cities, and establishing smart city repositories to collect useful case studies for urban planning and governance lessons will accelerate policy transfer for smart city development. This study sheds light on effective ways policymakers can foster policy learning and transfer, especially when a jurisdiction's capacity is insufficient to deal with the uncertainties and challenges ahead.},

When a data breach occurs, it is difficult for the data owner to trace the identity of the data leaker. To address this challenge, we propose an Efficient and Traceable IoT Data Sharing method (ETDS), which strives to solve the accountability problem of IoT data in multiparty sharing scenarios. The ETDS consists of a blockchain-based decentralized access control system and a commutative encryption and fingerprint system. ETDS not only implements data access authorization in a decentralized environment but also implements an efficient accountability mechanism for data leakages. Unlike other accountability solutions, the data accountability mechanism of ETDS is implemented in scenarios where the data and the applications are decoupled. This paper demonstrates the security and availability of ETDS through security analysis and an efficiency evaluation.},

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.},

 abstract = {Innovative cities that use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) while guaranteeing that they meet current generations’ needs for life quality, operating efficiency, and competitive nature are known as Smart Sustainable Cities (SSCs). Green spaces and eco-friendly practices are integrated into the urban area to reduce pollution levels and CO2 emissions and protect the natural resources within the city. Apps for smart cities are designed to control traffic and respond to emergencies in real-time. Therefore, smart cities may be better equipped to react to challenges than those with a straightforward transaction processing relationship with their residents. Existing high-speed internet and underground wiring in major metro areas are both in need of replacement due to deterioration from decades of use. Although the availability of wireless broadband service is expanding, some parts of the country’s largest cities are still without it. In order to maintain cities in a sustainable fashion, there are several obstacles that must be faced. Congestion, a lack of funding for essential services, a lack of suitable accommodation, deteriorating infrastructure, and increasing air pollution are all common problems in cities. The major challenges such as the best use of urban buildings’ energy generation, storage, consumption, fossil fuel use, disregard for the environment, and limited internet technology (IT) architecture are all contributing factors in the city’s decline addressed in this research. Therefore, this paper proposes the social collaboration of renewable energy resources (SC-RER) technique to overcome the basic challenges described above. With the help of the proposed technique, local renewable energy sources can be used to their full potential. Smart block innovation (SBI) is used to make smart community planning mode. Energy-Efficiency (EE) model is framed to reduce the energy consumed significantly. As a result, it helps increase the method’s efficiency to gain a 95.4% maximum level, suitable for making sustainable smart cities.},

 abstract = {Over the past decade, Smart Cities initiatives have attracted a great deal of global attention from governments and scholars. However, less attention has been given to the impact of Smart Cities construction on local entrepreneurial activity. This paper assesses the impact of Smart Cities construction on urban entrepreneurial activity using the difference-in-difference (DID) model based on panel data from 265 prefecture-level cities in China from 2002 to 2019. The empirical results show that Smart Cities policies significantly enhance urban entrepreneurial activity. After the parallel trend and placebo test, the estimation results based on the PSM-DID (Propensity Score Matching-Difference in Difference) method are robust and consistent with the baseline regression results. The mechanism analyses indicate that the possible channels for Smart Cities policies to exert a positive impact on urban entrepreneurial activity are improving the city's ability to attract investment and enhancing technological innovation. Furthermore, Smart Cities policies have a more significant incentive effect on entrepreneurial activity in eastern regions, larger-scale cities, and cities with higher levels of service informatization and a larger scale of government financial expenditure. This paper contributes to the policy effects of Smart Cities pilots and the factors influencing entrepreneurial activity. This paper has important implications for enhancing entrepreneurial market dynamics and promoting urban transformation programs in developing countries to empower a sustained wave of urban entrepreneurship.},

 abstract = {Aiming to safeguard a decentralized setup such as smart cities, collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) has become a mainstream security mechanism to protect different types of computer networks, especially decentralized computing platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). The main benefit of CIDS relies on the information sharing process among devices, nodes, software and hardware entities. However, traditional CIDS often requires a trusted third partner, e.g., a centralized computing server, to help build up a trusted communication channel among various entities. Such requirement is not practical in real-world implementation, making the integrity of shared information compromised easily. With the wide adoption, blockchain technology has given a solution to protect the distributed/collaborative detection system. In the current market, blockchain technology has been extensively researched across many detection scenarios, but there is a need to explore how such technology can overall contribute to CIDS and a general distributed detection system. In this work, we introduce a blockchain-assisted security management framework for CIDS, which summarizes and provides an integrated protection given by blockchain. In the case study, we evaluate our proposed framework in both a simulated and a real CIDS setup with challenge-based mechanism.

The fluctuating nature of renewable energy is considered, and microgrid energy management is investigated using probabilistic and deterministic assumptions. To enhance energy management, digital twin simulations are employed, providing a virtual representation of the power grid. This enables accurate analysis and prediction of system behavior in different scenarios. Digital twins help simulate the effects of load profiles on microgrids, facilitating better energy planning and decision-making. The proposed framework considers objective functions related to cost reduction, voltage profile improvement, and voltage stability enhancement. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is applied to solve the complex and nonlinear energy management problem, aiming to minimize costs and enhance voltage stability. Simulation results show that an optimally installed PV system and wind turbines reduce energy costs and improve overall system efficiency in smart cities. Furthermore, the objective function of WOA outperforms particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution algorithm (DEA) in achieving the desired outcomes.},

 abstract = {With the development of virtual reality technology, wearable visual devices and digital technology can provide users with intuitive virtual experiences, which can effectively improve the user experience of landscape planning. This article analyzes the VR landscape planning and user virtual entertainment experience of smart cities based on artificial intelligence. The application of this technology can also provide richer data support for urban landscape planning and design, allowing designers and planners to better utilize advanced technological means to optimize the planning and layout of urban landscapes. In the field of urban planning and design, artificial intelligence can be used to simulate street space architecture and urban pedestrian and vehicle behavior paths, evaluate the impact of planning and design schemes on the environment, transportation, and citizens, and effectively demonstrate the feasibility of implementing smart city planning schemes. Virtual landscape models utilize computer-generated 3D image technology to present real-world landscapes in a realistic manner. With the help of artificial intelligence technology, entertainment robots are able to interact with users in natural language and understand their needs and preferences. Through technologies such as deep learning and pattern recognition, entertainment robots can autonomously learn and recommend entertainment content suitable for users, further enhancing users’ virtual entertainment experience. Through virtual reality technology, immersive browsing and experience of landscapes can provide a more intuitive perceptual experience, and also enable decision-makers and the public to better understand the design and planning intentions of the landscape.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces an advanced framework for energy and data transactions, aiming to optimize the sustainable management in smart cities. The prominence of smart cities in power systems has grown recently, offering comprehensive monitoring and accessibility. However, this advancement also brings about increased susceptibility to cyber-attacks. To address this concern, we present an integrated smart city encompassing the smart grid (SG), transportation comprising subway and vehicles, microgrid (MG), and energy hub (EH). Within this proposed model, we employ an enhanced intrusion detection system (IDS) utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) through deep learning to fortify the safety of information transactions inside the smart city. This involves incorporating a security layer into the smart city design, effectively thwarting cyber hackers' attempts to access system information. This paper develops an efficient energy management schedule. To achieve this, we introduce a novel optimization method deploying the honey bee mating optimization technique for the optimum allocation of charging stations. The grid randomness is addressed using the point estimate method (PEM) with a 2 m-scheme. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework are proved, showcasing its ability to enhance the security and efficiency of smart city operations. This research advocates for the application of a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin to explore optimal energy management within a Smart City while ensuring a safe and secure framework.

However, it is difficult to understand and describe smart cities from different perspectives, given the widespread application of the concept of smart city in diverse disciplines, such as urban planning, electronic engineering, and computer sciences. This work conducted a comprehensive smart city literature review based on text mining of 3,315 papers on smart cities published in journals indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. These include “all papers” classified as research articles published from 1999 to April 2020. Our findings show the state of the art of research on smart cities, including (i) smart city literature statistics from 1999 to 2019, (ii) 23 research topics related to smart cities, and (iii) geographical variations in smart-city research. Based on these findings, we offer theoretical and practical implications of (1) missing fields of studies, (2) future research directions, and (3) the applicability of text-mining techniques to literature reviews. We believe that this work, which aims to establish a common ground for understanding smart cities from multiple disciplinary perspectives, will encourage further research and development regarding smart cities.},

 abstract = {While recognition of the dangers of extreme heat in cities continues to grow, heat resilience remains a relatively new area of urban planning. One barrier to the creation and successful implementation of neighborhood-scale heat resilience plans has been a lack of reliable strategies for resident engagement. In this research, the authors designed a two-week summer STEM module for youth ages 12 to 14 in Roanoke, Virginia in the Southeastern United States. Participants collected and analyzed temperature and thermal comfort data of varying types, including from infrared thermal cameras and point sensors, handheld weather sensors, drones, and satellites, vehicle traverses, and student peer interviews. Based on primary data gathered during the program, we offer insights that may assist planners seeking to engage residents in neighborhood-scale heat resilience planning efforts. These lessons include recognizing: (1) the problem of heat in neighborhoods and the social justice aspects of heat distribution may not be immediately apparent to residents; (2) a need to shift perceived responsibility of heat exposure from the personal and home-based to include the social and landscape-based; (3) the inextricability of solutions for thermal comfort from general issues of safety and comfort in neighborhoods; and (4) that smart city technologies and high resolution data are helpful “hooks” to engagement, but may be insufficient for shifting perception of heat as something that can be mitigated through decisions about the built environment.},

Transitioning to a low-carbon heating system is critical to the forthcoming generation of energy systems and future carbon–neutral cities. It has been observed that the development of unban centralized heating systems includes both the diversification of energy sources and the development of “smart heating.” This paper firstly summarizes recent work in smart heating technology in the urban centralized heating system, which is representative of large-scale infrastructure smartification during the ongoing smart city transition as observed. It then delves into the essential cyber-physical system technologies that underpin smart heating solutions. Building on this foundation, the discussion pivots to the transition from smart heating to smart IES, examining four critical dimensions: the design of IES digesting renewable energy, the modeling of its dynamics, the vulnerability of multi-energy coupling, and the smartification of its operation control. The efficacy and limitations of this approach are demonstrated through empirical analyses of both real heating systems and park-scale IES cases. This paper should provide both theoretical and practical guidance for the integration of multi-energy systems and smart technologies to achieve comprehensive renewable energy utilization.},

 abstract = {Firms are faced with increased dynamism due to rapid technological development, digitalization, and sustainability requirements, creating novel opportunities for ecosystem innovation. This is particularly prevalent in smart city contexts where initiatives concerning, for example, energy efficient buildings and smart energy grids drive new kinds of ecosystem formation. Orchestrating emerging innovation ecosystems can offer a path to sustained competitive advantage for ecosystem leaders. Yet, it calls for the development of new capabilities to sense, seize, and reconfigure digitalization opportunities in a highly dynamic ecosystem environment. Yet, prior research lacks insights into the dynamic capabilities and routines required for ecosystem innovation. Therefore, this study investigates how firms can develop dynamic capabilities to orchestrate ecosystem innovation and, thus, gain from it. Through a multiple case study of smart city initiatives, we offer insights into the specific micro-foundations or sub-routines underlying the ecosystem leader's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities, which are necessary to orchestrate ecosystem innovation. We develop a capability-based framework demonstrating three orchestration mechanisms – namely, configuring ecosystem partnerships, value proposition deployment, and governing ecosystem alignment. Our findings carry implications for the literature on innovation ecosystems and dynamic capabilities, as well as for managers.},

Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods.},

It underpins a variety of essential and significant tasks in the development of smart city including face recognition, landmark retrieval, pedestrian detection, person/vehicle re-identification, and so on. Traditional pair-based DML methods try to make full use of the data-to-data relations within a (mini-)batch, but they cannot grasp the data distribution information due to the batch size limitation. On the other hand, proxy-based DML schemes use different proxies to approximate the data distribution. However, the proxies are too sample to represent the intra-category variance. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, named soft-instance-label proxy, for embedding learning. It can capture the globe data distribution information while depicting the detailed intra-class data structure. The state-of-the-art empirical results on three public image retrieval benchmarks and two backbone networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our Soft-instance-label proxy method can have a Recall@1 improvement of 2.4% with Googlenet, largely surpassing the current state-of-art-methods while demonstrating great potential in the development of smart city.},

On the other hand, mechanical energies are widely distributed in the urban environment in types of vibrations and rotations, and natural areas in types of water waves, rainfalls, and winds. With the development of mechanical energy harvesting technologies like triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc., various mechanical energy harvesters with optimized structures and selected materials, including triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), electromagnetic generator (EMG), etc., have been demonstrated for efficiently extracting electric power from ubiquitous existed mechanical energy sources like wind, water waves/flows, raindrops, vibrations, human motions, organs, and so on. With a comprehensive review of energy harvesting-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications among smart environmental monitoring (wind, ocean, and agriculture), smart transportations (drivers, vehicles, ships, roads, and bridges), smart homes (windows, floors, accessories, and human-machine interfaces), smart healthcare (wearable/portable devices, and implantable devices), the concept of smart cities are being promoted to conform with requirements of carbon neutrality and environment-friendly. Moreover, by combining developed self-powered sensor nodes, self-sustainable wireless sensor nodes, and self-charging energy storage units, the concept of IoT will be reinforced by increasing 5G endpoints and accelerates digitalization in smart cities.},

The concept of a smart sustainable city proposes a framework to ensure citizens a better life and protect the environment to maintain sustainability through information and communication technologies. This paper constructed a sustainable smart city development indicator system using the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) maturity model and assessed the maturity level of 35 cities in China. Spectral clustering was adopted to recognize development patterns on three dimensions and 53 indicators. The results indicated four development patterns. Completing developing elements converged in comprehensive-development cities. Environmental-friendly cities enhanced environmental quality under government guidance supported by information and communications technology. Welfare cities showed good social welfare via the government's highly focused strategy but lacked economic support. Innovation, trade, capital investment, mental poverty, and poor living conditions characterized undeveloped cities. Practical implications are recommended for each type according to development differences to build a better smart sustainable city.},

Specifically, we investigate how Cognitive Digital Twins - Digital Twins with augmented semantic capabilities - can enhance instantly updated knowledge of parking connectivity to optimize logistics operations planning and urban resource allocation. We present a four-layer architectural framework to integrate individual logistics objects and systems into Smart Cities at a semantic level, with underlying enabling technologies and standards including Property Graph, Web Ontology Language (OWL), and Web of Things. Next, we conduct a case study of parcel delivery in Paris using a real-life Digital Twins platform called Thing in the future (Thing’in) by Orange France, coupled with an agent-based simulation model on AnyLogic, to demonstrate a real-world application of our approach. The results suggest that semantics-enabled Digital Twins connectivity can increase the comprehensive understanding of the delivery environment and enhance cooperation between heterogeneous systems, ultimately resulting in improved logistics efficiency, reduced negative externalities, and better utilization of resources. Furthermore, this work showcases potential new business services for logistics service providers and provides managerial insights for city planners and municipal policymakers. An actual mobile application prototype is presented to showcase the applicability of the work.},

The primary objectives are to enhance electric work for cost reduction and power quality enhancement. The structure utilizes remote switches to adjust the microgrid's power supply route to consumers, minimizing resistive power losses. Additionally, it integrates the mobile storage capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance microgrid operations. The aging costs of battery for EVs are modeled using Wöhler curve. An effective modification technique using Dolphin Echolocation is established to enhance algorithm assortment and prevent premature convergence. The study employs a standard test system to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Simulation results demonstrate that the secure architecture facilitates improved microgrid scheduling through encrypted data packets, optimizing EV charge and discharge. The Energy System Digital Twin (ESDT) plays a crucial role in investigating this stochastic secure energy management architecture for microgrids, incorporating EVs and blockchain. The ESDT dynamically replicates microgrid complexities, integrating stochastic models for renewable energy, EV charging behaviors, and blockchain transactions. This digital twin enables simulations for optimizing EV integration, evaluating blockchain resilience, and strengthening cybersecurity measures.

This study developed a decision-making approach to determine the supply and demand priority of SC services using utility and need theories, with Hong Kong as a case study. The results show that smart environment services should be prioritized for all population groups, while the differences in priority among older adults, people with lower digital literacy, and people with lower income were relatively small. On the one hand, the supply of SC services should be prioritized for those that are closely linked to citizens’ daily lives, have a long-term impact on communities, and are targeted to large user groups. On the other hand, priority should be given to those services that meet citizens’ demands for physiological, safety, and self-actualization needs. This study enriches the theoretical framework of people-centric SC research through the innovative integration of Bradley-Terry and rank-ordered logit models for determining the development priority for SC services, which can serve as a practical decision-making tool for policy makers to effectively allocate resources for sustainable SC development.},

For small and medium-sized cities, the cost of buying drone is too high, and renting drone is more cost-effective. However, the leasing transactions between government departments and drone leasing companies are faced with problems such as distrust, price disputes, and increased costs caused by third-party participation. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a multi-party secure and convenient transaction framework based on alliance blockchain, which helps to build trust between drone leasing companies and government departments without worrying about privacy leakage and transaction data tampering. In addition, an intelligent pricing strategy based on contract theory is designed, which can not only maximize the utility of government departments, but also encourage drone companies to actively participate. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed drone services transaction mechanism based on blockchain and intelligent pricing strategy is very effective.},

Moreover, we suggest a GAN-based network intrusion detection system (GANNIDS) that uses adversarial learning to assist the generator in learning the spatial distribution of normal network flows. The simulation results showed that the proposed eClusterGAN and GANNIDS outperformed the benchmarks in terms of clustering accuracy, running time, precision, recall, and F1, which can support researchers in studying economic data trends. The construction of Smart Cities can effectively ensure healthy market development by discovering and disseminating the potential value of market economic data.},

 abstract = {Smart-cities research has established itself as one of the most dynamic fields in research today, accommodating scholars from diverse disciplines, including engineering and computer science as well as social sciences. Even if only tacitly, the resultant debate increasingly oscillates around how the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) might render cities and urban space better places. This article responds to this imperative by suggesting how to capture users’ views and perceptions of smart city services and applications and in this way enrich the decision- and policy-making processes. It is argued that by developing appropriate scales these otherwise subjective views and perceptions may be objectivized and hence made of great use to managers and policymakers. Accordingly, in this research, a process of scale development is conducted in four phases of both inductive and deductive methods. Following initial rounds of focus groups and assessment by experts, an international survey was conducted with 295 participants from Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Arab Peninsula, and other regions. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 and AMOS 20 tools. The study proposes a 20-item scale in five distinct dimensions: Technology anxiety; Work–life interface; Engagement orientation; Support orientation; and Quality of life. The significant theoretical and managerial implications are discussed to demonstrate how to manage information for the benefit of all stakeholders involved in the making of a smart city.},

Suggestive perspectives of a smart city development were proposed and summarized. A new expert system was presented to determine fuzzy numbers, which can reduce the uncertainties of MCDM methods. The way of the MCDM combined with geographical information system (GIS) techniques provides a significant aspect to consider when developing a flood risk model or early warning system. A case study of flood risk assessment in the Shanghai is used to demonstrate the application of the MCDM techniques incorporating GIS to assess flood risk of metro system. The assessed flood risk of metro systems provides inceptive suggestions for designing flood prevention in metro systems. Based on the initial flood risk of metro systems, a large amount of data collected using 3S including remote sensing (RS), GIS, global position system (GPS) technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and wireless sensor networks, can be adopted to increase the accuracy of flood risk management for metro systems in smart city development. The processing and analysis of big data obtained from wireless sensor networks and AI technologies provides a way of establishing an intelligent technology system for flood management in smart city development.},

Smart cities globally are on the arise, information flow from various intelligent devices such as internet of things(IoT) are captured and transmitted as they traverse either directly or indirectly where performance assessment in such scenarios using mean square error(MSE) and probability of error(Pe) metrics at the backend section baseband section gains significant. By considering wireless signal transmission from various mobile nodes in a simulation testbed mean square error analysis and probability of error are obtained in matrix laboratory(MATLAB)software. Simulation results show that mean square error analysis of LOS is by far improved in 3 dB in comparison to NLOS environment for single antenna technology specified by single input single output(SISO) and multiantenna technology represented in the form of multiple input multiple output(MIMO) technology. Further, probability of error (Pe) of SISO and MIMO systems are also analysed and similar improvement in performance is also obtained for baseband analysis of smart cities. The obtained simulation results, can contribute to further research in upcoming 5G and 6G systems relating to wireless products.},

 abstract = {Today, some cities around the world have tended to use new technologies and become smart city. New technologies improve the quality of citizens’ life. However, the use of any technology raises new issues and challenges. In a smart city, the vulnerable action of an individual or organization can put the entire city at risk. Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction. The aim of this paper is survey and discus on explanation of cyber security, smart cities, and survey of available relevant literature on security in that technology. For this purpose, the present study focuses on the four main components of a smart city, i.e. smart grid, Smart building, Smart transportation system, and Smart healthcare. In particular, summary of two deep learning method and cyber-security programs as well as technology correlation in smart cities are discussed. Furthermore, effective functional solutions in maintaining cyber-security and user privacy in smart cities are explained. The next progress trends of smart city with cyber security are described. Solutions need to be devised to address each of the security issues. The research in this study showed that meeting these challenges depends on the hard work of governments, developers of equipment and software and companies providing IT security services. In addition, designing flexible systems with high information protection capabilities is essential to prevent serious security incidents as these incidents can lead to disastrous financial, data, credit and loss of public trust.},

Orchestrated by electricity utilities, these smart grids offer innovative applications and services, generating substantial data earmarked for cloud-based processing. To reinforce sustainability in financing mechanisms, this research strategically incorporates digital twin technology, optimizing smart grid operations. Employing a fog computing approach, we focus on enhancing cloud data center efficiency at the cloud's edge. A comprehensive four-tiered framework is introduced to mitigate power shortages affecting utility companies and end-users within the context of net-zero energy integration. The cluster layer forms the foundation, interconnecting structures with the smart grid layer, acting as a vital link between the fog and cloud layers and the underlying infrastructure. A comparative analysis of load balancing algorithms, including the Artificial Bee Colony Optimizer (ABCO), Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), and Time-Varying ABCO (TVABCO), reveals TVABCO's superior response and processing times. These findings, aligned with green bonds and public–private partnerships, signify a crucial step towards sustainable energy integration in future smart cities. The integration of digital twin technology enhances precision and optimization, adding depth to this transformative journey.},

Building on existing literature on ITG, smart cities, and the emerging conversation on Adaptive Governance in the public sector, the following exploratory question has been formulated for this study: How are ITG structural mechanisms implemented in city authorities to oversee and govern smart cities? To address this question, a qualitative multiple case study was carried out across three city authorities in Ireland characterised by diversity in their ITG structural arrangements to govern portfolios of smart city initiatives. From this analysis three types of ITG structural implementation are proposed named: Detached, Integrated, and Traditional. These are compared and discussed in relation to: (1) orientation of each approach; (2) decision-making authority; (3) alignment with the IT function and the overall municipal organization; and (4) the challenge perceived by the SCFs under each ITG arrangement. This research contributes to the academic conversation on adaptive governance, smart cities as well as to the broader ongoing debate on ITG in the public sector.},

 abstract = {Sustainability and energy savings are two intertwined research aims for humanity’s long-term survival, aligned with the Paris Agreement and the Egyptian vision of 2030. The purpose of this research is to minimize the cost needed to measure the HVAC energy consumption in educational and commercial buildings to save energy for energy efficiency strategies to serve the future smart and sustainable cities. These facilities are among the most energy-consuming loads, and this research proposes a technique to determine real HVAC energy consumption and cooling load using a single-sensor method. Calculating the as-built HVAC energy usage and real cooling load, especially in complex HVAC systems like VRV, which are some of the most challenging gaps, is achieved through a revolutionary and cost-effective approach. The proposed approach computes the actual HVAC energy consumption of each specific zone in the building using data from a single temperature sensor. Furthermore, the real and instantaneous cooling load of each zone was calculated, and the results show a promising agreement between the proposed techniques and the real measured consumption of the HVAC system. This approach can be integrated into the BMS building management system to determine the actual HVAC energy usage and cooling load for each zone individually in real time, enabling significant energy reduction decisions with optimal cost efficiency. Furthermore, it can be used by the BMS system as a real-time On-Board Diagnostic of the HVAC system.},

Security is one of the key challenges of a smart city. One can enable smart cities with a blockchain to offer enhanced security via storing transactions in a secure, transparent, decentralized, and immutable ledger. However, both blockchain and smart cities are in their infancy and significant research efforts are needed to integrate them. In this paper, we comprehensively review the role of blockchain in enabling IoT-based smart cities. First, we present the evolution of blockchain technology in terms of constituent technologies, consensus algorithms, and blockchain platforms. Second, we discuss and critically evaluate various smart applications enabled by blockchain. Third, we present real-world blockchain implementation in smart cities as case studies. Fourth, we present the key requirements to integrate blockchain with smart cities. Finally, we present open research challenges along with their key causes and possible solutions.},

The DOAQ utilizes additive formulas with predefined coefficients to obtain scores in each tier, thus reflecting the relative importance on data availability and visibility of different air quality data. The scores of DOAQ were compared with the smart cities scorings from Eden Strategy Institute and ONG&ONG Pte Ltd. (2018), and other socioeconomic attributes (i.e., social, political and humane) within the current study. Strong correlations (i.e., 0.4−0.6) among these indices implicate that the status of air quality reporting could be a good proxy to gauge the environmental data openness in a city. Lastly, good practices (e.g., apps and air quality forecasts), essential criteria and directions for future smart city development on air quality reporting were summarized, with the aim of laying down practical and efficient guidelines for individual smart city that desires to seek for improvements in air quality data openness.},

 abstract = {Blockchain-based drug supply management (DSM) requires powerful security and privacy procedures for high-level authentication, interoperability, and medical record sharing. Researchers have shown a surprising interest in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities in recent years. By providing a variety of intelligent applications, such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, and smart financing, smart cities (SC) can improve the quality of life for their residents. Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.},

 abstract = {Complexities associated with real-time objects make simulation of real-time behavior complex without direct real-time data intervention. Knowledge gained from the past behaviors helped design the current simulations; however, made it difficult for decision-makers to predict the future scenarios using real-time data. Industry 4.0 introduced intelligence to machines, connecting machines, making decisions by real-time data-driven simulations, and digital twins. Virtualization and simulations are better than that inferred by the description of the state. Manufacturing, a complex procedure, proposes optimization problems in various domains. Smart manufacturing predominantly uses robotics and artificial intelligence to provide solutions to many problems in manufacturing. Smart cities with high degree of cohesion using Internet of Things devices, made the real-time data collection easier. In this chapter, we present a detailed survey of digital twin, its base technologies, concept of smart cities and smart manufacturing, use cases of digital twin technology in additive manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, shipbuilding industry, advancements so far made in the research field for implementing digital twin technologies in smart cities and smart manufacturing, and plotting the specific significance of integration of blockchain technology with digital twins for smart manufacturing.},

The resulting architecture of a land-based UV allows to identify its main subsystems and sensors as well as their characteristics. And based on this, the general description of the approach to identifying components and changes in time of the characteristics of the UV’s assets. Among the UV parameters and components critical ones are selected, i.e. those whose invalid values or state over a certain period of time will lead to the greatest negative impact, including the destruction, damage or malfunction of the vehicle itself, other UVs, and/or the relevant smart city infrastructure, as well as causing harm to the passengers, cargo transported or other traffic participants. Probabilistic and event approaches are proposed in determining the level of criticality of the UV’s characteristic and its elements respectively. This paper is the first stage of a project intended to develop methods and approaches for assessing the critical characteristics of the UVs.},

 abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as mobile communication networks, and behaviour-based approaches for citizen engagement play a key role in making future cities sustainable and tackling persistent problems in high-density urban areas. In the context of Sharing Cities, an EU-funded programme aiming to deliver smart city solutions in areas such as citizen participation and infrastructure improvements of buildings and mobility, a prominent intervention has been the deployment and monitoring of a Digital Social Market (DSM) tool in Milan (Italy). The DSM allows cities to engage with residents and encourage sustainable behaviours by offering non-monetary rewards. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM approach to promote active travel (cycling and walking) by analysing the data collected through the app as well as through participant surveys. Our model results show that a broader engagement with the DSM app (number of claps to posts, number of posts made, non-monetary rewards earned by participating in non-travel events) is positively correlated with the monitored level of active travel. Lifestyles, attitudes, and social influence also explain the variability in cycling and walking. This highlights the importance of investigating these factors when replicating such initiatives on a large scale.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology involves a network of interconnected devices and sensors that gather and exchange information. In smart cities, IoT devices were utilized in several fields including energy, transportation, waste management, healthcare, etc., to improve the overall quality of life and sustainability of the populace. But, as the usage of IoT increases, the cybersecurity and data privacy become a concern of safety. An anomaly detection system helps to identify possible data breaches or cyber-attacks by identifying abnormal data patterns. Deep learning (DL) driven anomaly detection has emerged as an effective and powerful method for identifying abnormal behaviours or patterns in the data domain. This technique leverages the abilities of a deep neural network for automated learning of complex patterns and representations from data, which make it better for anomaly detection task where irregularities cannot be easily defined by handcrafted rules. This paper establishes a new Billiard Based Optimization with Deep Learning Driven Anomaly Detection and Classification (BBODL-ADC) technique in IoT-assisted Sustainable Smart Cities. The goal of the BBODL-ADC technique lies in the proper recognition and classification of anomalies in the IoT-assisted smart city. To obtain that, the BBODL-ADC system applies a binary pigeon optimization algorithm (BPEO) algorithm for the effectual selection of features. Besides, the BBODL-ADC technique utilizes Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) approach for the recognition and classification of anomalies. Moreover, the BBO system can be used for better parameters chosen by the ERNN algorithm. The stimulation value of the BBODL-ADC algorithm can be executed benchmark database. The achieved outcomes demonstrate the remarkable outcome of the BBODL-ADC methodology of 95.69% and 99.21% compared to existing models under dataset-1 and dataset-2.},

In addition, South Korea submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Nowadays, to mitigate the GHG emission every country explicitly planning to reduce non-renewable energy resource vehicles. The electric vehicle (EV) markets growing rapidly with various technologies, strategies and innovations to support decarbonization. In 2022, by the transportation CO2 (Carbon dioxide) emission report of International Energy Agency (IEA), the cars and vans contributes 48% in the over all CO2 emissions. Increasing the electric micro-mobility service would be one of the best effective approach in accordance to reduce CO2 emission. This research study support to reduce the GHG emission by increasing the clean energy vehicle. A case study conducted to analyze firm-wise e-scooter sharing service performance and its satisfaction in smart cities of South Korea. Lacking in the consistent good quality and performance affects the number of electric vehicle users. Hence, electric vehicle firm should focus into their product better performance and quality. This research supports to analyze the e-scooter based on the various criteria from the user’s perspective. This research study helps to firms to identify their lacking criteria and improve their quality and performance. We considered the performance, accessibility, tangibility, reliability and responsiveness factors which affects user’s perspective in e-scooter sharing services. A survey was conducted over sixty user’s for different e-scooter services with twenty four factors. Generally, MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision-Making) techniques holds two phases to determine the weight of the criteria and another phase to ranking the alternatives. The existing MCDM techniques lacks to handle the user’ satisfaction index analysis and not considering the influence grade of each factors in the analysis. To overcome this draw back and analyze the micro-mobility services based over the user’s point of view, we introduced a novel fuzzy based MCDM method name as Approach for Preference, Performance and Ranking Evaluation with SAtisfaction Level (APPRESAL) approach. The findings show that Lime, a micro-mobility firm, outperformed other firms with high-quality service and user satisfaction, followed by Wind, XingXing, Alpaca, and Beam. The influences of defected factors from the accessibility, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance dimensions had an adverse effect on quality of firm’s micro-mobility service with unsatisfactory performance.},

Smart cities primarily rely on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to manage and maintain its service offerings. In literature, clustering and multihop routing techniques have been proposed, validated and implemented to reduce the consumption of energy in the network. With this motivation, the current study develops Adaptive Parallel Seeker Optimization-based Energy Aware Route Planning Technique (APSO-EARPT) for clustered WSN in smart cities. The presented APSO-EARPT technique concentrates on appropriate selection of Cluster Heads (CHs) and optimal routes in WSN. To accomplish this, APSO-EARPT model encompasses Weight-Based Clustering Scheme (WBCS) for effective selection of CHs. Then, routing process is performed with the help of APSO algorithm. The proposed APSO-EARPT technique computes a Fitness Function (FF) that comprises of three variables such as Residual Energy (RE), distance to Base Station (BS), and node degree. This fitness function helps in optimal selection of routes in WSN. In order to validate the supremacy of the proposed APSO-EARPT model in terms of network lifespan and energy efficiency, simulations were conducted and the results confirmed the excellent performance of the proposed model.},

 abstract = {Smart City dashboards, also known as Mayor's dashboards, are to visualise city's performance on strategic policy areas such as sustainable mobility, energy efficiency, air pollution, etc. Therefore, they use indicators and indices as quantitative means to display performance. This research studies the current delivery of strategic smart city agendas as well as current means to measure and present their performance and proposes a method that uses blockchain to reimagine both in a more empowering and collaborative manner, the so-called People's Smart City Dashboard (PSCD). The thesis of this research is that smart city agendas have failed in their promise of being citizen-centric instruments and this is due to their top-down approach. This can be reversed by using community-led technologies such as blockchain. However, this bottom-up and blockchain-based implementation of smart city agendas will require from new, people-centric measurement tools and thus the so-called Activators and Aggregators are designed as well.},

 abstract = {In their bid to combine economic growth with efficiency gains, environmental improvements, and more positive images, Polish cities have embraced Smart City (SC) strategies. Normative visions of the Smart City couple advances in ICT with the promise of more inclusive, effective and democratic local governance, but critics of SC urge caution. This study identifies the priority areas of large Polish cities with regard to SC and the extent to which social infrastructure and human capital inform development objectives. Work involved content analysis of official documents and websites profiling SC strategies of six Polish cities (Warsaw, Cracow, Łódź, Wrocław, Poznań and Gdańsk) and their metropolitan areas. This was complemented by targeted interviews and seminars. Moreover, an exploratory study of Gdańsk and Gdynia was also carried out. Our evidence suggests that Polish experience with SC represents gradual processes of adaptation and emergent forms of urban politics that reflect tensions between new and more traditional forms of governance and economic, environmental and social goals. Our results indicate that Institutional change has in fact taken place in terms of participatory governance, digitalization in service provision, addressing social needs and linking SC agendas to wider urban development objectives.},

 abstract = {Today, cities are facing many challenges such as pollution, resource consumption, gas emissions and social inequality. Many future city views have been developed to solve these issues such as the Smart City model. In literature several methods have been proposed to plan a Smart city, but, at the best of the authors’ knowledge, only a few of them have been really applied to the urban context. Most of them are indeed theoretical and qualitative approaches, providing scenarios that have not been applied to real cities/districts. Moreover, a comparison among the results of different quantitative planning models applied to real case studies is still missing. In this framework, the aim of the paper is to propose a new quantitative method based on a previous qualitative model developed by the same authors. The feasibility and validity of the method will be tested through the comparison with an existing AHP model and the application of both approaches on two real case studies, characterized by different territorial levels. Results of the analysis show that both methods are consistent, reliable and do provide similar results despite the differences in the application process.},

 abstract = {This chapter addresses the need for a more developed theoretical foundation for smart spaces by conducting an exploration of the nature and prevalence of theory for emergent and evolving smart spaces in urban environments and regions and in everyday life more generally. Motivated by the growing development of theory for smart cities, a review of the research literature pertaining to smart spaces is provided, followed by a review of the research literature for theory and smart environments. A conceptual framework in support of theory for smart spaces is formulated to guide research and practice in smart environments. Using an exploratory case study approach combined with an explanatory correlational design, this work identifies and explores variables of interest for learning more about, and developing an understanding of, smart spaces. This work also seeks to navigate a way of using theory to inform the work of researchers, practitioners, and those concerned with the making and enacting of smart environments. To this end, ambient theory for smart cities is advanced to accommodate smart spaces as a proposed, viable theory, using a number of variables such as connecting and collaborating. While a good correlation among such variables is found, this work also acknowledges limitations, opening the way for opportunities going forward. In conclusion, this work has implications for the mutual enriching of understandings about smart spaces and smart cities in support of dialogue, debate, and interpretation.},

However, scaling a blockchain to accommodate the multitude of energy sources, prosumers, and consumers is an ongoing challenge. To address this issue, we propose AMI-Chain, a cost-effective blockchain solution that leverages the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) for off-chain storage, data aggregation, and compression at the smart meter level. This approach significantly boosts blockchain transaction rates and scalability. However, employing IPFS introduces its unique challenges, particularly in having nodes that stop participating at any given time. Therefore, we also present effective strategies for managing a large number of consumers and introduce a model for optimizing IPFS storage while ensuring data durability. Estimations with our model reveal that AMI-Chain can support over 7.7 million smart meters with a 24-h data compression rate while providing eleven nines for one-year data durability.},

In Brazil, few studies have addressed this issue. Thus, here I analyze the political agenda and economic dynamics involved in the transformation of Brazil's second largest city, Rio de Janeiro, into a climate-smart city. I develop an original conceptualization of “techno-utopian smart city” and apply this framework to analyze the case of Rio. Empirically, I perform a thematic content analysis, including the coding of policy documents, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest that the smart city agenda is still limited to address the challenges of climate change. While smart city and climate policies have been sparsely integrated, “smart” urbanism has privileged the financial, economic, and political dividends of a techno-driven urban transformation, rather than focusing on citizen well-being, climate change mitigation, and adaptation. My conceptualization and empirical analysis suggest that Rio de Janeiro has been i) framing climate governance as a technical issue instead of a complex social challenge, ii) neglecting the environmental footprint of smart technologies, and iii) collecting citizens’ private data with low levels of transparency.},

 abstract = {With the increasing viability of Internet of Things (IoT), more devices are expected to be connected in a smart city environment. It can provide many benefits for people’s daily life, but is also susceptible to many security threats in practice. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), especially signature-based IDSs, are one of the most commonly adopted security mechanisms to safeguard various network environments like IoT-assisted smart city against cyber attacks. The process of signature matching is a key limiting factor for a signature-based IDS, and the exclusive signature matching (ESM) was designed based on the observation that most network packets would not match any IDS signatures. However, exclusive signature matching like the single character frequency-based ESM may be vulnerable to some attacks in a hostile environment. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose a blockchain-enabled single character frequency-based ESM, which can build a verifiable database of malicious payloads via blockchains. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of our approach under flooding and character padding attacks in both a simulated and a real IoT network environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the robustness of single character frequency-based ESM against malicious traffic.},

 abstract = {A massive challenge for future cities is being environmentally sustainable by incorporating renewable energy resources (RES). At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network’s operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system’s characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework’s performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES. Results confirm that the developed LSTM-based attack detection model has a generalization ability to catch modern power grids’ dynamic behaviors, excelling current traditional approaches in the designed case studies and achieves accuracy higher than 90% in all experiments.},

In this article, we argue that the main challenges policymakers confront in deploying these technologies are organizational rather than technological. To do so we draw on research from science and technology studies on sociotechnical systems and interviews with city government officials to characterize smart cities as large technological systems, which are immense, interconnected systems that consist of not just of technologies but organizational and institutional processes. We then use this analysis to identify challenges and opportunities affecting North American smart city initiatives. We find that disparate – and at times competing – stakeholder motives inhibit the deployment of smart city technologies, including in ways that preserve privacy and security, creating organizational challenges that we argue must be overcome for smart city initiatives to succeed. We conclude by drawing on the perspectives of local policymakers and science and technology studies to offer pathways for local governments to overcome these organizational challenges through collective action and facilitate smart city development.},

New Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are changing the way in which the world works. These technologies provide new tools to face the issues of contemporary society (poverty, migrations, sustainable development challenges, governance, etc.). Among them, blockchain emerge as a disruptive technology able to make things in a completely different and innovative way. They can provide solutions where before there were none. Recently, these technologies have become subject of intense research and development by industry and academia. In consequence, a large amount of interesting works is published in many areas, proposing solutions, services, frameworks and applications based on these technologies. The research focusing on the previous challenges are especially interesting in current society. However, the proposals arrive at higher speed than society can assimilate them, and sometimes they are not properly exploited. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the blockchain technology to identify what are its key attributes that enable to successfully address the social challenges. The review has been conducted from three point of views: service-delivery, resource-management and city-administration, and has been focused on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, in order to cover the full agenda of current social issues. The contributions of this work are an exhaustive compilation of the existing research on blockchain technology to tackle the social challenges from several angles, and the identification of the key features and the conditioning factors of the practical applicability of the technology.},

 abstract = {Smart city transitions are a fast-proliferating example of urban innovation processes, and generating the insight required to support their unfolding should be a key priority for innovation scholars. However, after decades of research, governance mechanisms remain among the most undertheorized and relatively overlooked dimensions of smart city transitions. To address this problem, we conduct a systematic literature review that connects the fragmented knowledge accumulated through the observation of smart city transition dynamics in 6 continents, 43 countries, and 146 cities and regions. Our empirical work is instrumental in achieving a threefold objective. First, we assemble an overarching governance framework that expands the theoretical foundations of smart city transitions from an innovation management perspective. Second, we elaborate on this framework by providing a thorough overview of documented governance practices. This overview highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the current approaches to the governance of smart city transitions, leading to evidence-based strategic recommendations. Third, we identify and address critical knowledge gaps in a future research agenda. In linking innovation theory and urban scholarship, this agenda suggests leveraging promising cross-disciplinary connections to support more intense research efforts probing the interaction patterns between institutional contexts, urban digital innovation, and urban innovation ecosystems.},

 abstract = {The present paper aims to describe the project and development of an ECG monitoring system which is able to diagnose specific cardiac pathologies by adapting the processing algorithm to the monitored patient. The system can work standalone by providing the final diagnosis to the patient by a LEDs set. In addition, an IoT based architecture allows the system to share data and diagnosis with a remote cardiologist in real-time or to store data in a FTP folder, as an Holter monitor, for post-processing and further analysis. The system consists of two sections: the digital one, based on the National Instruments MyRIO, digitalises the signal and processes it in real-time to make a diagnosis on possible occurring cardiac pathologies (bradycardia, tachycardia, infarction, ischemia); the analog section, which performs the acquisition, amplification, and preliminary filtering of a 3-leads electrocardiographic signal. The processing algorithm has been developed in NI LabVIEW environment. The main contribution to the state of the art is due to two removable and updatable memory devices. A first memory has been used to store clinical and personal data of patient so to configure the computing algorithm and adapt it to the monitored patient. A second memory has been used to store accuracy and uncertainty specifications of the ECG system in order to improve the reliability of the final diagnosis. The system aims to provide an electrocardiographic monitoring system for healthcare applications in the smart city context. The possibility to monitor constantly the patient health state at home is an important challenge of the next future smart cities. IoT and automation are the main aspects of the proposed system. Patients having chronic heart diseases need frequent hospitalizations to check their heart health. In this scenario, the proposed system is an Ambient Assisted Living solution developed to encourage the independent life of cardiac subjects by supporting his/her care and wellness during the daily life.},

 abstract = {This paper aims to engage with the ongoing debates on the role of planning in future smart cities, to make a case for a reconceptualization of the technocentric notion of the smart city, and to elevate the position of city planning within the smart-city discourse. The central argument made is that the smart city could exploit the synergies between city planning and three techno-scientific domains including Big Data, Geographic Information Science and Systems, and Data Science—which collectively constitute an emerging field known as Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)— to meet four overarching policy goals: 1) to enhance the efficiency of urban services and functions; 2) to improve quality of life for all urban citizens; 3) to address the pressing societal, ecological and economic challenges that could plague urban systems on different levels; and, 4) to contribute to the production of spatial data, information and knowledge on human-urban dynamics. In addition, the paper defines a human-centered conceptual framework illustrating how the cross-pollination between city planning and the three techno-scientific fields could enhance the planning practice and accomplish the smart-city policy goals. The methodology employed in this study entails a systematic review of the literature. In addition to discussing the latest achievements as well as the progress made on the nexus of city planning and GeoAI, the paper also highlights the barriers to the application of GeoAI in the planning, design and management of smart cities and identifies potential avenues for future research.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, an increasing amount of literature acknowledges that smart cities’ core aspect is not technology per se but how organizational characteristics and capabilities influence the technology enactment. However, the extant studies primarily focus on business-led smart city projects. Little attention is paid to the causal relations between organizational conditions and technology enactment in government-led projects. Therefore, there is a research gap concerning what conditions of governmental organizations, singly or jointly, drive technology enactment in smart city projects. To fill the gap, this article establishes three increasing levels of smartness and formulates four government conditions. Based on this conceptual framework, this article explores different configurations of organizational conditions that lead to varying levels of smartness. It uses the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method to study 11 smart city projects in Hangzhou, China. The results generate three configurations of organizational conditions that lead to decisional intelligence, indicating that multiple pathways exist to achieve the highest level of smartness. These configurations often emphasize the significant role of human resource pressure in driving decisional intelligence. But no single condition is necessary because when human resource pressure is absent, strong financial capacity, good information-sharing, and facilitative leadership can work together as a substitution.},

However, Indian smart cities seemed unprepared for the outbreak, with reported highest cases of death and positivity rates. Thus, it becomes essential to understand why these smart cities could not handle the pandemic despite their technologically advanced infrastructures and the citizen’s role in managing it. This paper analyzes the impact of the Smart City Mission (SCM) interventions from a citizen-centric perspective and its influence on pandemic management and citizen inclusivity. The study draws from the right to the smart city framework along with stages of the digital divide. The study conducted a content analysis using secondary sources like published and unpublished papers, policy reports, and news analyses spanning the timeline of 2015-2022. The analysis infers that the lack of initiatives to link marginalized citizens with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) through the SCM policy led to the underutilization of the various initiatives launched during the pandemic, deepening the digital divide. The deduction from the analysis highlights that the ‘chatur citizens’ act as a solution by transitioning their formal access to ICTs into effective access enabling the marginalized communities to bridge the divide.},

 abstract = {Smart cities rely heavily on Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables automation services through interconnected IoT devices. However, the widespread use of IoT applications in smart cities has resulted in security and privacy concerns that must be addressed to protect sensitive data. To safeguard smart cities from cyber attacks, learning theory-based automated attack-detection methods must be adopted. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to create effective models for identifying IoT attacks. However, the majority of IoT detection algorithms have focused on only a few types of IoT attacks, and most IoT threat detection systems have used black-box deep learning models that lack interpretability to support their forecasts. This research aims to detect several types of large-scale attacks on IoT devices using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost) classifier and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches. The proposed method not only improves the model’s performance but also increases trust in the model. The results of the experimental study on the IOTD20 dataset and XAI evaluation of each feature’s contribution to the model demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently identify malicious attacks and threats, reducing IoT cybersecurity threats in smart cities.},

Urban policy in Japan is shifting from hardware-oriented development to software-oriented area management; the Minato Mirai 21 district in the city of Yokohama is a typical example of area management. The essence of smart transition is to enhance various management functions by using smart social technologies, such as advanced information communication. The attractiveness of smart cities with sophisticated area management provided by such technologies will likely be high.

Hence, the need to plan and develop smart cities based solutions for enhanced urban governance is becoming more evident. These solutions are motivated by innovations in Information and Communication Technology to support smart planning for the city and to facilitate enhanced services to its citizens. Important areas where smart city services can be offered include urban planning, transport planning, energy conservation, water management, waste management, environmental monitoring, public safety, healthcare, education, entertainment, and many other services. Hence, the enormous data collected from different networks and applications to facilitate the offering of smart city services requires efficient data scheduling, aggregation, and processing to ensure service quality (QoS). However, existing data scheduling approaches consider scheduling and processing data only in the cloud, while processing also in the data collecting devices is significantly essential. This paper first introduces the multi-layer network architecture comprising sensor/device networks and cloud. The paper then introduces a Multi-layer, Priority-based, Dynamic, and Time-sensitive data processing and Scheduling approach (MPDTS) in the proposed multi-layer networks. Simulation results show that the proposed MPDTS approach achieves lower latency and data processing time than existing traditional data scheduling approaches that work only in the cloud layer.},

To answer this question, we present a case study of a group of Haifa residents who used a digital platform to push for improvement in the ways the local government accommodated their needs. Based on our analysis, we make two arguments of potential interest to scholars and stakeholders involved in smart city initiatives. First, both trust and distrust can motivate residents' involvement in smart city initiatives. Second, examining trust and distrust in light of the relevant citizenship regime (individual-liberal and civic-republican) sheds light on relational and dynamic configurations of residents' involvement in the process of smart urban vitalisation.},

The primary focus is joint optimization, aiming to maximize computing bits while minimizing energy consumption under system constraints. Given the optimization problem’s complexity, we employ a decomposition approach, breaking it into sub-problems. The first part handles mode selection and task segmentation, determining optimal placement and mode selection variables. The second part addresses resource allocation, optimizing transmission power, offloading time, energy harvesting time, and device computational resources. Numerical results demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness compared to relevant benchmark schemes.

 abstract = {As the world's population is becoming progressively urban-dwelling, sustainable development challenges are increasingly concentrated in cities, placing tremendous pressure on society to build more sustainable, innovative, and equitable urban environments. Consequently, today's cities require integrated policies and new innovative ways to manage and improve the complexity of urban living conditions. The growing volume and variety of data produced in the urban ecosystem are crucial for obtaining the city's insights and building knowledge-based solutions for a smarter and more sustainable urban development. In this paper, we look at the open data impacts on these complex ecosystems and its crucial enabler role for the generation and analysis of contextual and actionable data aimed at understanding, managing, and planning the city. Despite the importance of open data, the literature is scarce in systematic and structured research that evaluates its impacts on the smart city context. This paper explores this gap by proposing a theoretical framework, composed of a model and an experiment grounded on the use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT), designed to give a more detailed view concerning the context and characteristics of the impacts of open data initiatives on smart cities' sustainable development. This work will contribute to open data management and smart city development, providing boundaries and theoretical insights for further research and experimentation on how open data can be leveraged to develop better smart cities.},

 abstract = {Smart cities refer to place-specific collaborative systems where multiple actors collaborate to collectively address public problems. However, smart city initiatives regularly frame citizens as the weakest link, as passive consumers rather than active creative agents. This article argues that power imbalances between citizens and other organisational participants structurally mute citizens' voices, ultimately compromising smart cities' aims. Living laboratories are a popular smart city intervention that have the potential to address this power imbalance and empower citizens to influence smart city development. This research theoretically and empirically explores this role of living labs through a multiple-case study of urban living labs in the region of Catalonia. The findings uncover a ‘power banking’ mechanism which, coupled with other critical factors, facilitates the effectiveness of such initiatives. The considerable efforts required to engage citizens at a fairly basic level suggest that incorporating citizens into smart city models is more challenging than simplistic Quadruple Helix discourses convey.},

 abstract = {Many city governments have implemented promising smart initiatives to make cities more efficient, livable, and ecological. To harness the full potential of smart city initiatives, it is vital for policymakers to align citizens with the project objectives. This study comprehensively characterizes and classifies top-down announcements formulated by city developers into six alignment categories (i.e., smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living) using natural language processing. The proposed framework consists of five main processes: (1) web scraping-based extraction of announcements of four smart cities – Boston, Helsinki, Seoul, and Taipei, (2) text data preprocessing, (3) latent Dirichlet allocation-based modeling of strategic topics, (4) quantification of inter-topic similarities using Hellinger distance, and (5) comparison of top-down communication trends with real-world levels of urban performance. Through the comparative analysis of top-down communication trends and actual urban performances, the top-down discourses of smart cities were deconstructed as a reflection of wider political programs developed to enhance citizen alignment and urban performances. Furthermore, inter-topic similarities were also quantified to reflect whether communication strategies are multidisciplinary and city-tailored. In conclusion, the findings of this study can enhance our understanding and provide workable guidance for future smart city development.},

A total of 37 articles have been selected and critically reviewed based on the Sustainable Smart Living framework developed for this paper. This review explores the concept of smart equity among citizens, which empowers them as end-users in cities experiencing the rapid growth of smart urbanism. Citizen adoption is an essential issue for critical consideration to ensure the sustainable smart living throughout urban life. The framework for sustainable smart living has been developed by focusing on citizen adoption in light of essential, interrelated variables, including government role, cognitive entity and intelligence. Based on this framework, the selected articles have been evaluated and analysed in terms of their significance for the sustainable smart living variables. The purposes of this review are twofold: first, to develop a framework for sustainable smart living focusing on citizen adoption; second, to examine the current status of smart city research from a human-centric viewpoint by adopting the framework as a guideline for evaluating and analysing the selected articles on smart urbanism. The results of this review may be extended by future studies on sustainable smart living that focus on smart cities that address citizen adoption from a human-centric viewpoint.},

 abstract = {In the quest for Smart City (SC) development, numerous examples of ‘good practices’ have circulated in national and international policy arenas. Learning from good practices elsewhere is a common approach for cities to initiate and develop SC policies of their own. Nevertheless, because of political, legal and cultural differences across countries and cities, policies will always be context dependent, and prosper under specific conditions. There is a vast literature on policy transfer and policy mobility, but much of it utilizes different concepts (i.e., policy translation, policy learning, and policy diffusion). Nonetheless, a critical omission they all share is limited concern for context-dependence and lack of prescriptive clues. Addressing both omissions would lead to a framework in which learning from good SC policy practices, formulating lessons, transferring them, and then adjusting them to fit the recipient's needs is taken up systematically in a stepwise manner. To develop a theoretical framework for Smart City adoption, this study brings together variegated existing literature under the heading ‘policy transplantation’ and synthesizes existing insights into a prescriptive procedure policymakers can follow. A systematic literature review is conducted to identify all key elements and sub-elements associated with SC policy transplantation, leading to a theoretical framework. This (prescriptive) theoretical framework is subsequently validated using an expert group and illustrated through a real-life case. The framework can be used as an analytical lens by researchers, but also constitutes a practical tool to guide policymakers aiming to use insights from good practices and implement them in line with their own contextual setting. Conducting contextual assessment before transplanting a SC policy is essential.},

The smart city concept was developed to deal with these challenges by incorporating new technologies in order to find solutions that preserve cities’ environment while promoting their residents’ wellbeing. However, for cities to be truly “smart”, they should be evaluated, and, to that end, determinants that facilitate their creation need to be identified. This study thus sought to combine cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach to find which factors foster smart city success, as well as the cause-and-effect relationships among these determinants. In two groupwork sessions, a panel of experts identified a wide range of smart city determinants and analyzed the dynamics of their relationships. The results were validated by the panel members and senior representatives of Cascais and Évora City Councils, Portugal, who confirmed that the analysis system developed provides a deeper understanding of this research context.

Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology has become a buzzword in the industry. It is posited as a forthcoming technology to be grasped in a distant, ultimately green, and future. However, this view is now being challenged as V2G is being deployed at a large scale. The severe challenges of rapid population growth, ecological pollution, and energy deficiency have encouraged the design of smart grids and electric transport systems, especially electric vehicles containing central energy utilization systems in a smart city. This paper proposes a robust and distributed approach to balance supply and demand. This study have constructed a unique framework to manage the ambiguous performances of vehicles and supplied energy resources in a smart city.

Although urban water infrastructure (UWI) performs important functions in a city (e.g., supply of drinking water), information and communication technologies (ICT) and system-wide management of network-based UWI are not yet widely deployed. Therefore, this review summarises first both existing and potential applications related to network-based UWI, characterised by different spatial and temporal resolution of measurement and control data. Second, a comprehensive analysis of ICT is provided, which is extended with exemplary applications in the field. The analysis reveals that a coordination between intended application and usable communication technology is required to realise an efficient monitoring and control network in the field of UWI networks. To overcome this limitation, a detailed framework is developed, which can be used by researcher, network operators, and stakeholder to identify suitable communication technologies for different UWI applications or to determine possible applications for an existing ICT system. Following, the applicability of the framework is demonstrated by selected examples. As the framework also indicates, an integrated approach towards smart water cities requires the combination of different communication technologies to satisfy all specifications.},

 abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have grown in popularity, both in research and in practice. The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.},

The lines of action executed have been identified and compared, using standardised indicators, with the actions conducted in the European metropolis that are smart city references.

 abstract = {Wireless communications for IoT in smart cities may be affected by Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation conditions due to obstacles such as buildings, trees, and others. LoRaWAN technology transmits information through several kilometers in one hop, from a source node to a gateway. However, packet reception decreases when the link has NLOS conditions and there are no alternative routes for packet delivery. This paper presents a LoRa implementation of MACGSP6, a Gossip-based routing algorithm, to improve communications in a LoRaWAN network where all nodes have NLOS conditions. The paper compares the packet delivery ratio of LoRaWAN and MACGSP6. Results show that packet delivery to the gateway increased from 0% with LoRaWAN to a minimum of 53% with the routing algorithm. Additionally, most packets were delivered using the shortest path available, even when the algorithm does not explicitly compute the routes, decreasing the delay associated with this process. Thus, the proposed solution is useful for IoT applications in smart cities, such as smart metering and structural health monitoring, where one relay node can forward the information of many other nodes.},

The research covers the examples of three Polish cities: Gdansk, Warsaw and Wroclaw. We checked how this concept is explained and narrowed down to the framework of the city's strategy and legitimized by city makers. Each of the stories expounds the vision of the city, ways of achieving goals and the approach to residents as users. That might give weight to the nuanced idea and translate into the real urban policy. The conclusions of the study suggest that the smart city concept does not fundamentally change urban policies, but is rather inscribed in the adopted directions and vision, e.g. the city which was wanted to be perceived as academic, identifies “smart” with cooperation with the science sector etc. The results also show that smaller cities that use new technologies more modestly must look for other ways to refer to smart cities for strategic purposes. The empirical basis was the implementation of individual in-depth interviews with city officials, which was supplemented by an analysis of planning, strategic and reporting documents.},

The considered criteria are weighted by multi-expert IVPF Best Worst Method, which has become a popular weighting method in recent years. Later, the energy alternatives for a real case study are prioritized by multi-expert IVPF TOPSIS method. In the analysis, the most important criterion is found as Environmental sustainability (C1) with the defuzzified weight of 0.218 while the other weights are as initial investment (C2) with 0.196, operating expenses (C3) with 0.163, technical feasibility (C4) with 0.154, social acceptability (C5) with 0.140, and scalability (C6) with 0.129. The obtained results indicate that “Investing in advanced technologies” in a smart city with relative degree of closeness (RDC) value of 0.798, has been determined as the best alternative among the considered five alternatives. It is closely followed by “Developing a transportation system” with the RDC value of 0.681. Sensitivity analysis shows that the ranking results are quite robust and reliable.

Big data technologies have become essential to the functioning of cities. The architecture includes complex components to be implemented based on the architectural requirements. A data migration strategy was proposed to handle the various data sources such as IoT devices, video cameras, and drones. The proposed approach also takes into account data processing and data storage. The technical constraints related to data processing in a big-data environment are also studied. We also consider data modeling from a business intelligence point of view and a data science perspective. Our main goal is to favor the facilitation of the daily life practices in the context of a smart city by providing the city administrators with a solution that helps them maintain their city smartly and effectively.},

In this paper, Analytical Network Process (ANP) is used to weight smart and sustainable city criteria. According to the results, while 'smart living' is the most important characteristic with a 35,459% priority, 'smart governance' is the last with 5,738%. The study covers 44 cities around the world and comparisons were made by TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). According to the results, Tokyo, London and New York are in the top three in the overall ranking. But none of these cities is among the top five in terms of smart governance, mobility and environmental dimensions. According to the results obtained, the article provides some recommendations for the cities.

 abstract = {IoT associates with MEMS technology and various other technologies to connect smart devices globally. Providing reliable interaction between the smart devices and maintaining the battery sustainability of smart devices are the major demand since most of the IoT devices are run by a battery source. Device sustainability is the prime concern in most the IoT applications such as smart cities, e-health, smart grid, etc. Thus, we have come up with a cross layer design that improves the device sustainability and lifetime of the IoT networks in smart cities. In the proposed design, physical layer and data link layer information is utilized by the network layer to explore the energy efficient communication among the IoT devices, since 70% - 80% of device energy is utilized for its communication. Cross-layer design can be an optimal solution to enhance the modalities of the wireless network. The Weighted sum approach is used in the proposed model which is an effective computation method to analyze and identify the routing metrics that are associated with energy efficiency. Based on the routing metric analysis (Table 2) it is found that a particular combination of routing metrics performs effective power utilization (by attaining optimal transmission power) and achieves sustained device lifetime. From the obtained results, it is noticed that the MTPM + ETP + ND routing metric combination outperforms all the other combinations, and designing the cross-layer mechanism with the weighted sum approach computation gives better network performance without compromising the device lifetime. In smart cities applications, the device scalability is huge, since frequent battery replacement is a very difficult task. Therefore, we come up with an efficient network model that is more suitable to maintain device sustainability in smart cities.},

The DMS approach supports iterative development and optimisation of routes and route parameters. If the goals are not achieved in the route plan, the data user can use the previous simulation results as a start point, develop the routes and route parameters in the simulation model, and then evaluate the updated route plan in simulations. The route development and simulation can be continued until the desired targets are met in the route plan. The DMS approach is evaluated in a small-scale experiment that simulated the use of autonomous busses and drones for the supply of parking space data in the LuxTurrim5G+’s smart pole pilot network in the city of Espoo in Finland.},

Although, many standard and conventional security solutions have been provided for IoT, it suffers from many privacy and security concerns. Standard security protocols are not suitable for majority of IoT devices because of its decentralized topology and resource-constraints. Blockchain (BC) finds its efficient application in IoT to preserve the five basic cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, availability and non-repudiation. Adoption of conventional BC in IoT causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overheads which are not appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. To mitigate these problems, this work proposes a smart access control framework in a public and a private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient and secure as compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security and privacy issues. Moreover, proposed BC has minimal overhead as well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access control issues which handle multiple permissions of various processing nodes of IoT environment and detects relevant inconsistencies. Comparison in terms of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control. The primary goal of this research article is to explore the possibility of BC as an alternative to standard security solutions for low resource IoT applications.},

 abstract = {The detection of critical situations through the adoption of multi-sensor Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) can significantly reduce the time between the initial stages of urban emergencies and the actual responses to relieve its negative effects, usually through the rescuing of endangered people, the attending to eventual victims, and the mitigating of its causes. However, although the benefits of such units are well known, their proper positioning in a city is challenging when considering a limited set of available units. In this sense, data-driven approaches can be leveraged to provide a better perception of the urban environments under consideration, allowing emergency management systems to be tailored to the specificities of a target city, thus improving the positioning of EDUs. This article proposes the processing of geospatial data of emergency-related urban infrastructure to support the computing of risk zones in a city, which is retrieved from the OpenStreetMap database together with the map of streets within a defined area. Since risk zones indirectly indicate the proportional number of detection units to be deployed, for each configuration setting of the EDUs, we propose an algorithm that computes the positions for such units only on streets, in a balanced way. Furthermore, considering that EDUs are expected to report detected emergencies through a wireless connection, we have also modelled the coverage area of existing networks in a city, which is also processed according to a suitable dataset. The proposed algorithm performs a fine-grained positioning of EDUs based on the number of active networks, flexibly favouring the EDUs' connectivity requirements such as reliability, throughput, latency, and transmission costs according to the actual demands of any urban emergency management system.

 abstract = {Recent developments in smart sensing technologies have fostered the wide-spread utilization of smart city applications, which rely on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks to work efficiently. The terms “smart city” and “IoT framework”, however, have been given several definitions, without consensus. Consequently, definitions of the terms “smart city” and “IoT framework” need to be condensed, consolidating concepts and guidelines of smart cities and IoT frameworks, as will be shown in this study. In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term “smart city” are provided. Materializing the findings achieved in this study, an abstract IoT framework concept for smart city applications is proposed. It is expected that the definition of the term “smart city” may be used as a basis for a generally accepted formal definition and that the proposed IoT framework concept may provide a strong foundation for successful IoT framework implementations in the context of smart city applications.},

 abstract = {Developing smart city applications typically faces challenges such as meeting several complex requirements, integrating heterogeneous data sources, and considering geographical information representing the real-world urban space. Smart city platforms have a key role in realizing these applications as they provide high-level services that can be (re)used by developers. Despite the existence of many platforms to support the development of smart city applications, most of them do not associate the offered services with geographical information, do not support performing semantic queries on the available data, and have limitations that may burden development tasks. This paper presents Smart Geo Layers (SGeoL), a platform for developing smart city applications. Besides integrating urban data with geographical information, SGeoL relies on an underlying middleware infrastructure and leverages it by including high-level abstractions for (i) context data management, (ii) integration of heterogeneous data, (iii) semantic support, (iv) data analysis and visualization, and (v) data security and privacy support. This paper also reports experiences on the real use of SGeoL and empirical results on the evaluation of its performance and scalability.},

 abstract = {Smart cities have emerged as a result of smart interconnections of people, processes, data, and things, representing an excellent case study of the Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm. One of the main challenges in realizing the smart city vision is how to provide seamless interoperability between the IoE entities. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review on the use of semantic technologies to support interoperability between IoE entities in smart cities, with the goal of identifying the main trends and challenges in adopting semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient smart cities. To this end, we have extracted data from selected primary studies over the last decade that address semantic interoperability issues in smart cities through related technologies and techniques such as ontologies, linked open data, knowledge graphs, ontology alignment/matching methods, and automated reasoning mechanisms. We have analyzed the maturity of this research area by exploring three research questions that focus on: i) the importance of semantic interoperability in the smart city domain; ii) the identification of semantic technologies and tools applied in the smart city domain to promote semantic interoperability; and iii) the identification of smart city application areas where semantic technologies are used to efficiently deliver smart services. The analysis provided research insights, including the introduction of a new evaluation framework that assesses semantic interoperability solutions on four maturity levels. The framework includes specific evaluation criteria for attributes such as modeling, scalability, and availability. Finally, an elaborated list of strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of semantic interoperability solutions in smart cities is provided, along with a discussion of open challenges and future work in this domain.},

 abstract = {Smart city development has emerged as a favoured response to the 21st-century urbanisation challenges. A wide range of definitions surfaced over the last decade characterising the smart city, primarily pushed by the global elite corporations and influential academics. Simultaneously, a series of urban development expressions, such as digital city, knowledge city, eco-city is used interchangeably with the smart city, significantly mystifying the reading of the concept. This paper, first argue that smart city interpretation needs and requires the input and contribution of the local stakeholders. The aim of this research is to provide an evidence-based framework to capture the perception of local urban actors in India vis-à-vis their interpretation of smart cities given the existing urban conditions and the proposed developments under the 100 Smart Cities Mission. This research also examines the underlying linkage between the smart city and its conceptual relatives and highlights the ones with a significant convergence with the emerging urban agenda in India's Smart Cities Mission. The analysis presented in this paper show that to emerge as a holistic concept, smart cities definition models should engage with the sustainability and community issues, beyond the use of digital technology. The research reveals that the Indian urban stakeholders strongly associate the smart city concept with sustainable city and eco-city, much more than the technology-loaded phrases such as ubiquitous city and digital city. The first-of-its-kind inclusive approach developed in this paper to define smart city takes on the monopolies of top-down smart city definitions and support the democratisation of the rapidly proliferating concept.},

The urban population has been severely affected by this viral pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns, resulting in increased poverty and inequality, slowed economic growth, and a general decline in quality of life. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the effects of the pandemic by combining agent-based simulations—based on Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model—with a hybrid neural network. A baseline agent-based model (ABM) incorporating various epidemiological parameters of a viral pandemic was developed, followed by an additional functional layer that integrates factors like agent mobility restrictions and isolation. It is inferred from the results that low population densities of agents and high restrictions on agent mobility could inhibit the rapid spread of the pandemic. This framework also envisages a hybrid neural network that combines the layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for predicting the spatiotemporal probability of infection spread using real-world pandemic data for future pandemics. This framework could aid designers, regulators, urban planners, and policymakers develop resilient, healthy, and sustainable urban spaces in post-COVID smart cities.},

More importantly, a growing line of research warns about the north-centric notion of smart city research which underestimates the fast rate of uptake in the global South. In a search for a contextually informed definition of smart cities, the paper focuses on India: Home to one-third of the global South population, and the cradle of the ambitious Smart City Mission to develop 100 smart cities nationwide. It investigates the Smart City Proposals (SCPs) prepared for the first 20 smart cities prioritised, as part of the Mission. Findings offer a typology of smart city approaches; and shed light on the smart dimensions prioritised (e.g. smart governance, smart citizen and smart infrastructure) versus those overlooked (e.g. smart environment and smart economy) at the smart city policymaking level in India. The paper calls for further empirical research to investigate how the typologies pan out at the implementation of smart cities across the nation.},

Using the Indian case as focus, this paper analyses the governance structures, mechanisms, and processes utilised to create smart cities as part of the Smart Cities Mission, introduced by the Government of India in 2015. The paper offers extensive empirical analysis in the three cities of Bhubaneswar, Pune and Chennai that are among the first 20 smart cities prioritised for implementation. We first analyse how the governance framework provided by the Smart Cities Mission in India unfolds at three spatial scales – national, state and local – with the intersection of the scales differing in the three cities. Second, our analysis of the new form of governance involving public–private actors shows the conflict of responsibilities on a local scale. In conclusion, we highlight the absence of collaborative governance and reduced capacity in local governments – as significant challenges for smart city development in India.},

As the spearhead of urban policies, local governments play an important role in crisis management during the pandemic. In the context of smart cities, innovative solutions have been required, especially to improve the local government's capacity to manage health crises. This study asks whether smart cities perform better in governing the COVID-19 pandemic. This article focuses on how urban governance impacted cities’ performance in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a city-level data set from Indonesia, we constructed a COVID-19 response performance index using principal component analysis that is used in an empirical strategy with quasi-experimental cross-sectional methods to minimize the influence of unobserved covariates and selection bias. This study concludes that smart city status does not have a statistically significant impact on the COVID-19 performance index. We offer three possible accounts based on expert insights, previous empirical studies, and digital upshots on data monitoring and reporting cases. Both theoretical and practical implications can be drawn, thus highlighting the lack of effective integration of technological dimensions into health and urban governance systems in the context of a public health crisis.},

 abstract = {UAVs are increasingly incorporated in a wide range of domains such as disaster management and rescue missions. UAV path planning deals with finding the most optimal or shortest path for UAVs such that minimum energy and resources are utilized. This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning’s key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.},

 abstract = {Smart cities are complex endeavors that present several management challenges. The current study proposes a conceptual framework based on Six Sigma for managing smart cities. DMADICV is a novel method proposed in the current study for Six Sigma. The proposed DMADICV framework consists of six key constructs: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Improve, and Control & Verify. These constructs are used as layers in smart cities, and relevant literature is reviewed to highlight the key factors and groups related to each layer. A conceptual framework is provided for smart city management and an assessment mechanism presented for measuring and testing the performance of smart city integrated processes. This is achieved by measuring and controlling the cost of quality non-conformance, right documentation in the first time, and timely implementation of control measures, the activity processing index, and quality controls. Improvement construct has a percentage of 35.67 % share in the DMADICV framework followed by define (16.76 %), design (15.52 %), control & verify (14.33 %), measure (10.08 %), and analyze (8.15 %). The top ten factors for managing smart cities through the Six Sigma method include process quality improvement, organizational development, process analysis, quality management, cost control, DMAIC, change management, project management plan, waste reduction, process quality measurement, and value creation, respectively. The DMADICV framework and its dynamic relations are shown through a system model and its key groups represented in layers of the smart cities whereby the city governance and management teams can provide services to their smart citizens effectively and efficiently. The proposed DMADICV method and associated smart city management framework are a humble addition to the body of knowledge that can be adopted and utilized in other knowledge fields.},

 abstract = {Urbanization is recognized as one of the megatrends of our society, leading to substantial efforts to create effective and smart cities. The scale of this effort is unsuitable for a single player, instead necessitating joint efforts from multiple stakeholders. The global expansion of smart cities has subsequently led to increased research efforts toward building effective smart cities. In theory and practice, collaboration is pivotal for effective urban development, most often seen through the establishment of public-private partnership (PPP). Past research has explored these partnerships in smart city projects. Although PPP is considered to be an effective means to facilitate smart city development, the concept of smart cities remains rather vague and ideological. PPP for smart cities has been substantiated in several case studies; however, a thorough review is lacking. Therefore, to synthesize the existing literature, we carried out an in-depth integrative literature review. From this basis, we executed a content analysis and four key themes emerged: localness, stakeholder complexity, tension, and trust-building. These four themes form the basis of our proposed model and describe the key elements influencing PPP formation in smart city projects. We argue that the partnerships involved in smart city projects need further refinement to allow for transparency and involvement in various contexts. This paper provides timely contributions to smart city research by synthesizing the extant literature as well as laying the foundation for a future research agenda. Critical perspectives are also offered for future practitioners.},

Within ICT, recommender systems are strong tools that filter relevant information, upgrading the relations between stakeholders in the polity and civil society, and assisting in decision making tasks through technological platforms. There are scientific articles covering recommendation approaches in smart city applications, and there are recommendation solutions implemented in real world smart city initiatives. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive review of the state of the art on recommender systems for smart cities. For this reason, in this paper we present a taxonomy of smart city features, dimensions, actions and goals, and, according to these variables, we survey the existing literature on recommender systems. As a result of our survey, we do not only identify and analyze main research trends, but also show current opportunities and challenges where personalized recommendations could be exploited as solutions for citizens, firms and public administrations.},

 abstract = {New and integrated smart cities concept have envisioned more smart and efficient networks for people's health, education, business, and living. Sustainable smart cities always looking for smart and more advanced systems. Smart healthcare is one of the prominent area and domain of smart cities where different types of applications are used for people's health and comfort. Smart health systems are further divided into different areas, such as e-health, e-medicine, personal assistant monitoring, and body area networks. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is one of the popular research area due to its impending use in emergencies such as monitoring and diagnosis patient’s health. Sensor nodes are placed on or inside the human body where the implanted sensor performs the operations for a long time without any replacement of the battery. To avoid frequent change/replacement of the battery, energy management is essential and one of major concern. Facts show that most of the sensor networks use multi-hop and utilizes more resources. Energy-efficient routing protocols play a significant role in energy consumption. Due to the number of sensor nodes attached to the patient body, interference among sensors is one of the reasons for energy wastage. The co-channel interference increases the energy consumption because of the higher number of retransmission efforts required for successful transmission in the presence of interference. The main objective of this paper is to develop an Interference Aware Energy Efficient Transmission Protocol (IEETP) by utilizing the most appropriate routing metrics for smart health systems in smart cities. The proposed protocol selects the next forwarder node based on the residual energy of nodes, distance, node’s position, and node density. The proposed protocol is a multi-hop protocol in which each source node forwards the data towards the coordinator node. The proposed protocol has evaluated with state-of-the-art protocols where the IEETP has higher performance in the network.},

 abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is commonly used as an environmental assessment for products, services or activities; however, LCA is a process that facilitates optimal design and decision making. By combining LCA with artificial intelligence and machine learning, many uncertainties in early stages of design can be prevented which directly contributes to the performance assessment of smart cities environmentally, socially and economically. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of Environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA) in three different well-established industries of three different volumes namely: food, glass and plastics industries. Material and Energy Flow Analysis (MEFA) using Umberto Efficiency + was carried out initially prior to LCA using Umberto LCA + to establish the inventory. The LCA has been conducted according to ISO 14040/14044 standards. Cradle-to-Gate system boundary was set considering the transportation of raw materials, energy and waste handling. Each case study is regarded as a sample representing the industry’s environmental burden respectively. The case studies are chosen with different production scale categorized under small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The case representing the food industry which is considered a Small Enterprise proved to have a higher equivalent carbon footprint than the Medium Enterprise concerned with plastics recycling which points out the importance of performing LCA on all industrial scales.},

 abstract = {We propose a hierarchical blockchain-based platform for ensuring the integrity of smart city Internet-of-Things (IoT) data and blockchain interoperability in this paper. The well-defined structural hierarchy of managing organizations in a smart city face several data management issues. The integration of emerging technologies, such as (IoT), has introduced more complexity to data maintenance in the smart city. At present, cloud-based information systems have become the norm for managing IoT data. Due to the centralized administrative control, the cloud-based information management is untrusted. Hence, it fails to guarantee the integrity of IoT data and traceability of operations to achieve transparency within the smart city organizations. Adoption of blockchain-based information systems can be viable solution to address these challenges. However, it introduces a new challenge of interoperability of transactions among different smart city organizations. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized hierarchy of blockchains, named Blockchain-of-Blockchains (BoBs), for ensuring data integrity and blockchain interoperability at the same time. We implement the proposed concept using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethermint as a proof-of-concept for evaluating the performance of the proposed concept.},

Developing smart cities calls for a suitable while comprehensive assessment framework to assist city planners and decision-makers to suggest future directions for cities on how to become smarter by evaluating the smartness of cities. In this regard, this study follows two primary purposes. First, we investigate the concept of “smart city” and its pillars. Second, we develop a smartness assessment framework by considering both subjective and objective criteria and employing six effective multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methods. A linear assignment model is formulated to find an aggregated ranking vector using the ranking vectors obtained from these MADM methods. Then, as a case study, five out of the most important cities in Iran are compared and evaluated by adopting the proposed framework. Furthermore, different scenarios are introduced to investigate the sensitivity of results to the distribution of the importance weights amongst criteria. The results demonstrate the significance of the governmental, economic, and environmental indicators in evaluating the smartness of cities. Moreover, Tehran, the capital city of Iran, obtains the best ranking in all the methods and weighting scenarios, while Tabriz has the worst ranking among the cities under study.},

 abstract = {Rapid urbanization and the growing tourism industry in the Himalayan region have raised significant concerns about the sustainable handling and management of solid waste in the area. This concern is particularly pronounced in the unique and vulnerable ecosystem of cities nestled in the eastern Indian Himalayas, where geography, ecology, and socio-economic factors converge to create distinctive challenges. This study undertakes a thorough investigation of solid waste management practices and challenges in two smart cities nestled in the eastern Himalayan region of India, specifically Gangtok and Namchi. The primary objective was to unveil the complex challenges confronting these cities by conducting an in-depth exploration of waste management practices. This comprehensive investigation was achieved through the collection of samples, conducting surveys within each ward of the cities, and performing physicochemical characterization analyses. The study also proposes a solution-oriented approach leveraging life cycle analysis. Despite the Himalayan backdrop, waste generation varies significantly, with Gangtok producing substantially more waste (50 tons per day (TPD)) compared to Namchi (4.6 TPD). Both cities excel in waste collection, but Gangtok leads in proactive treatment, with 22% (11 TPD) undergoing composting and recycling. However, shared challenges at riverside disposal sites, including overfilled dumpsites and leachate contamination, pose potential environmental hazards amid the Himalayan allure. Organic waste predominates at 40.9% and 40.01% in both cities, indicating composting potential. Plastic closely at 22.25% (Namchi) and 22.65% (Gangtok) was way above the global (12 %) and national (8.4 %) average respectively, emphasizing the urgency of plastic waste reduction strategy. The 16.95% cardboard in Gangtok highlights potential commerce-related waste. The study also highlights the importance of comprehensive policies for informal sector well-being. The lifecycle assessment of Namchi and Gangtok reveals significant methane emissions (99%) from waste anaerobic decomposition potentially due to poor source segregation. Implementing a futuristic waste strategy reduces emissions by 38% in Namchi and 40% in Gangtok, through biogas utilization and renewable energy adoption. The findings advocate for citizen engagement, improved collection, targeted campaigns, and circular economy principles. To ensure sustainability and resilience in waste management within mountain regions, tailored strategies such as material recycling facilities, community engagement initiatives, and landfill diversion mandates should integrate ecological, socioeconomic, and logistical considerations, fostering awareness and participation among communities.},

These models, which support the IDS’s decision, could be vulnerable to a cyberattack known as adversarial attack. In this type of attack, attackers create adversarial samples by introducing small perturbations to attack samples to trick a trained model into misclassifying them as benign applications. These attacks can cause substantial damage to IoT-based smart city models in terms of device malfunction, data leakage, operational outage and financial loss. To our knowledge, the impact of and defence against adversarial attacks on IDS models in relation to smart city applications have not been investigated yet. To address this research gap, in this work, we explore the effect of adversarial attacks on the deep learning and shallow machine learning models by using a recent IoT dataset and propose a method using adversarial retraining that can significantly improve IDS performance when confronting adversarial attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that the presence of adversarial samples deteriorates the detection accuracy significantly by above 70% while our proposed model can deliver detection accuracy above 99% against all types of attacks including adversarial attacks. This makes an IDS robust in protecting IoT-based smart city services.},

However, there are barriers in the development of smart cities that should be overcome in order to meet these challenges through smart cities. The main barriers identified in this work are poor private-public participation, utilization of fossil fuels, lack of attention to the environment, insufficient internet technology (IT) infrastructure, and old technology throughout the cities. To overcome these barriers, policies must be implemented to improve private-public participation by encouraging public investments and a wider adoption of electrical vehicles that may act as storage device and provide ancillary services to the electricity grid; reduce the use of private cars; strengthen IT infrastructure, deployment of smart technology to allow residents to monitor and control their energy consumption, installation of roof-top solar panels, and better mobility and efficient public services supported by smart technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance the interconnection among smart city systems.},

 abstract = {This study examines how the application of the IoT in smart cities is discussed in the current academic literature. Based on bibliometric techniques, 1,802 articles were retrieved from the Scopus database and analyzed to identify the temporal nature of IoT research, the most relevant journals, authors, countries, keywords, and studies. The software tool VOSviewer was used to build the keyword co-occurrence network and to cluster the pertinent literature. Results show the significant growth of IoT research in recent years. The most productive authors, journals, and countries were also identified. The main findings from the keyword co-occurrence clustering and an in-depth qualitative analysis indicate that the IoT is used alongside other technologies including cloud computing, big data analytics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and wireless telecommunication networks. The major applications of the IoT for smart cities include smart buildings, transportation, healthcare, smart parking, and smart grids. This review is one of the first attempts to map global IoT research in a smart city context and uses a comprehensive set of articles and bibliometric techniques to provide scholars and practitioners with an overview of what has been studied so far and to identify research gaps at the intersection of the IoT and the smart city.},

 abstract = {In a typical smart city, drones can collect (or sense) massive amount of data, that is sent to a computing capability for further analysis to make useful decision making without human intervention. This data is relayed to the Cloud for processing and analysis due to its large-scale infrastructural capabilities. However, the key goal of the drone deployment in smart city scenarios or urban environments is to provide timely and quick response alongside providing an energy-efficient service delivery. Thus, we need a sustainable solution that can be deployed locally (closer to the data source) in a smart city, to process or analyze the data (generated from smart city sources) and provide timely decision making for smart city applications. Edge computing, popularly known as the “cloud close to the ground”, can provide computational and processing facilities at edge of the network in a smart city. Hence, Edge computing act as an effective alternative solution to process and analyze the data closer to the point of it’s generation. Looking into the above discussion, We propose a novel drone-edge coalesce that provides an energy-aware data processing mechanism for sustainable service delivery in the multi-drone smart city networks. In this model, the edge computing layer is deployed to process and store the data sensed and collected by drones in a smart city. In this context, an adaptive edge node selection mechanism has been designed on the basis of decision tree approach. In this coalesce, we have to deal with the conventional problems related to the collision and congestion while providing low-latency and sustainable data transmission in a smart city. So, We have designed an energy-aware multi-purpose algorithm that avoids collisions and provides a congestion free data transmission. The proposed coalesce is validated in a simulated environment on the basis of several performance metrics such as, throughput, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.},

 abstract = {Every day the innovative IoT technology is expanding further and further in our environment, with applications deployed in various contexts including cities. Communities can indeed address problems linked to urbanization thanks to this technology through the Smart City concept and thus support a sustainable development of their cities. Artificial intelligence and namely its machine learning branch is expected to reinforce this trend by making smart cities even smarter. However, smart cities can only be successful if they can be trusted and, with this in mind, machine learning can potentially be an efficient tool to mitigate cyberattacks. This paper can be divided into two main parts. In the first part the ability of Gradient Boosting and Deep Learning to make long-term predictions of noise level is studied based on noise data collected in the suburb of an English city. In the second part, we proposed an approach for detecting noise levels anomalies based on predictions. Two types of injections were taken into consideration namely punctual noise level attacks and gradual noise level attacks. Specifically, for the punctual attacks, when the difference between the actual sensed and predicted noise levels is greater than a given threshold, we considered that there is an anomaly in the data. For the gradual attacks, we used a criterion comparing the mean absolute error of predictions in the attacked set of data to statistics of the absolute error in the training set. The obtained results show that our approach, which uses a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) hybrid network for the noise level prediction, can effectively be used to detect the aforementioned types of anomalies. In the case of punctual attacks an increase in sound intensity of 5 dB was detected, while for gradual attacks, smaller changes can be detected.},

 abstract = {The Smart city is important for sustainability. Governments engaged in developing urban mobility in the smart city need to invest their limited financial resources wisely to realize sustainability goals. A key area for such sustainability investment is how to implement and invest in emerging technologies for urban mobility solutions. However, current frameworks on how to understand the impact of emerging technologies aligned with long-term sustainability strategies are understudied. This article develops a simulation-based comparison between different cities and autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption scenarios to understand which aspects of cities lead to positive AV implementation outcomes. As urban mobility and cities will become smart, the analysis represents a first attempt to explore the impact of AVs on a large scale across different cities around the world. Archetypes are formed and account for most, if not all, world cities. For three of our archetypes (car-centric giants, prosperous innovation centers, and high-density megacities), promoting AV-shuttle use would deliver the greatest advantage as measured by improvements in the model's KPIs. To develop urban powerhouses, however, micromobility would deliver greater benefits. For highly compact middleweights, a shift from private cars to other non-AV modes of transportation would be the smartest choice.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a prominent role in smart cities' development and offers benefits to different services such as finance, healthcare, security, agriculture, transport, education, and manufacturing. Despite the expected benefits, the adoption of AI varies from one smart city to another, due in part to barriers that can inhibit a smart city from adopting AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the barriers faced by smart cities. Through a systematic literature review, this study identifies 18 primary and secondary barriers grouped into three main categories — technology, environment, and organization. This research contributes to the literature by developing a typology of AI adoption barriers based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) perspective. The typology provides a novel mapping of the barriers to AI adoption faced by smart cities and suggests directions for further investigation through a cohesive research agenda. At a practical level, the findings will allow policymakers, planners, and citizens to make more informed decisions about AI adoption. Practical implications are also proposed for guiding smart cities to increase the adoption of AI.},

 abstract = {The pandemic dramatically altered the lives of people in their cities of residence and caused profound effects on both. The urgency to mitigate the pandemic has generated severe effects on society in general, such as economic paralysis, the annulment of social conviviality, the threat to employment and the non-existence of various accessibilities. However, cities should not disappear and have seen a huge adaptation to technologies and an unprecedented digital transformation coupled with good governance practices in order to minimise the effects of these disruptive blockages. Thus, the objective of this study is the measurement of smart performance in cities in pandemic times. To respond to this objective, the composite index of Rodrigues & Franco (2019) for city intelligence based on the subdimensions governance and ICT was adopted, thus following the quantitative methodology and resorting to secondary data. Moreover, this index measures the adjective smartness distinct from smart, whose adoption by cities provides a smart way to solve their daily problems. The sample covered the 308 Portuguese cities and towns, commonly known as municipalities. The results obtained still show some weaknesses to be overcome by municipalities in the future, if they opt for a continued commitment to governance models based on ICT, although the future path is challenging, so that the returns of these strategies are converted into effective offers of hard and soft amenities to citizens, in which urban networks play a key role, with exponential effects on the new demands of citizens regarding their quality of life, given that the pandemic has manifestly changed their behaviours and lifestyles. Finally, the final considerations, implications for theory and practice, limitations and future research agenda are presented.},

Nonetheless, the complexity and dynamic nature of cities makes them context-dependent in their strategic planning processes concerning smart initiatives, which can lead to different solutions and outcomes of cities' development. With the growing number of smart initiatives implemented in SCs, it becomes important both to consider how such initiatives are planned and organised, and to address the complexity and context-dependent dynamic in which such initiatives are implemented. Therefore, this study is a comprehensive analysis of number of initiatives in 12 Spanish SCs (1635 smart initiatives) to identify the relations between key characteristics of the cities (cities and citizens' profiles) and the planning of SC strategies. Findings suggest that formal strategic planning is mainly performed in SCs with higher qualification of inhabitants, mature-aged population, and top-down strategic planning approach.},

 abstract = {Smart city mission is a concept which improves economic growth and quality of life of people by using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Smart cities collect data from various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and manage the resources and provide service to the public. Emergency Vehicle Priority/Pre-emption (EVP) is one of the major IoT components in smart cities which saves many lives by giving right of way green signal to the Emergency Vehicles (EVs) such as ambulances and fire engines. The existing EVP system gives green signal to the EVs immediate by stopping the conflicting movements. The sudden stoppage of normal traffic as well as the sequence change generates confusion to the road users and drivers. This needs an optimal control strategy which gives green signal to EVs as well as it should not affect the normal traffic flow. This paper proposes an optimal control strategy for EVP using edge computing and IoT sensor for smart cities. The experiment was conducted using a GPS based IoT sensor which keeps on sending the Location Information (LI) to the edge server. The edge server computes the optimum timings based on the proposed control strategy algorithm and clears the emergency vehicles. Waiting time of other road vehicles before and after implementing the system have been studied at a traffic junction at Thiruvananthapuram, India. The comparison result shows that the average waiting time of vehicles on the other road is reduced by 73.23% in the proposed system when compared with the existing system. Since, edge computing has been deployed the latency in communication has been reduced less than 100 ms. So, the proposed solution reduces the waiting time of other road vehicles and reduces the latency in communication simultaneously.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) network simulation for Exigency Vehicle routing is proposed in this research utilizing a linguistic interval type 2 fuzzy logic system (LIT2FLS) based data fusion approach. The predicted effectiveness of our model for intelligent city applications, including emergency vehicle routing, is well demonstrated by the LIT2FLS correlation coefficients of 0.994%. This data fusion approach determines the exact level of congestion for a given place by combining sensory data with crowd reactions. In addition, OSRM employs a road communication system to detect real-time traffic variations and choose the least congested route. Furthermore, a sensor station for gathering the speeds and pollutants of moving automobiles on the road has also been established. An Android app has been developed to collect public information on blockages A driver of an Exigency Vehicle (EV) is directed towards a medical facility with the quickest, congestion-aware path by means of the Application software service.

Future cities are expected to be smart and billions of devices will be connected forming a network. The emergence of the Internet of Things proffers to link sensors enabled digital devices with the internet thus offering new services in the context of smart cities. In this regard, it is crucial for the internet service providers (ISPs) to observe/monitor their end-to-end network performance and identify any possible service degradation(s) as the goal of smart cities can only be realized through good quality internet. In this paper, we demonstrate our hardware-software co-designed quality of experience (QoE) management solution for ISPs. Our system is capable of monitoring and reporting the web, video, VoIP, IPTV, and WiFi QoE at various network levels. We experimentally tested our solution at appropriate network locations and demonstrated QoE and latency results for one of the leading ISP of South Asia. Our solution enables the ISPs to remotely monitor the quality of their network and identify any issue(s) which can lower the customer's QoE. As the internet is the backbone of smart cities, we believe our proposed solution for QoE will help expedite the smart cities’ infrastructure and solutions.},

 abstract = {The concept of a smart city has recently gained attention in academic, industry, and governments. Smart cities could be considered as urban areas that use data collection sensors and digital technologies which cooperate to create benefits for citizens in terms of well being, inclusion and participation, environmental quality, and intelligent development. Smart city vendors provide software systems to support application developers, city managers, urban planners, and policy-makers in designing, implementing, deploying, and managing smart city applications for an effective urban development and management. Although there exist a variety of smart city software systems, their benefits and limitations are still unknown. In this paper we review smart city vendors and we provide insight into their software systems for smart cities. Thus, we come up with a good entry point, and here survey a large amount of information to help developers, city managers, urban planners, and policy-makers to take better decisions when choosing smart city software systems.},

 abstract = {The ‘actually existing’ smart city is not a monolith. It is not directed by a universal logic, nor does it develop in a standardised way. As recent research has argued, the spatial, material, and political contexts of cities have major influence over what smart urbanism looks like in practice. This paper adds analytical depth to, and broadens the geographical scope of, research on the variegated modes of making smart cities. Based on empirical research in multiple Australian cities we use three case studies to explore three different modes of smart urbanism, each one centred on the interests of a different key actor: corporate-centric, citizen-centric, and planner-centric. These different modes can, and do, co-exist in the same city. At times, they are competing logics that fight to pull the city in different directions. Yet, they can also work together to shape smart city initiatives. In describing these different modes, we pay particular attention to the ways that these projects and strategies must contend with the already existing spatial, cultural, and political contexts of each place.},

In IoT-enabled smart cities, due to the advancement of technologies, sensors and actuators collect vast quantities of data that are analyzed to extract potentially useful information. However, due to the noise and diversity of the data generated, only a small portion of the massive data collected from smart cities is used. In sustainable Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) management, environmental deterioration resulting from improper land usage in the digital ecosystem is a global issue that has garnered attention. The deep learning techniques of AI are recognized for their capacity to manage vast amounts of erroneous and unstructured data. In this paper, we propose a morphologically augmented fine-tuned DenseNet-121(MAFDN) LULC classification model to automate the categorization of high spatial resolution scene images for environmental conservation. This work includes an augmentation process (i.e. erosion, dilation, blurring, and contrast enhancement operations) to extract spatial patterns and enlarge the training size of the dataset. A few state-of-the-art techniques are incorporated for contrasting the efficacy of the proposed approach. This facilitates green resource management and personalized provision of services.},

 abstract = {Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a crucial component of smart cities, providing ubiquitous access to computational capabilities and data storage that mobile devices do not have. While MCC has numerous advantages, it also raises several security risks. Data breaches, cyber assaults, and privacy concerns can all arise when sensitive data is sent between mobile devices and cloud servers. We investigate the security challenges related to MCC in smart cities and provide viable solutions to these issues in this study. To examine the current state of security in MCC in smart cities, we did a literature analysis of previously published work on the topic and utilized a combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches. According to the findings of this study, there are various security problems related to the usage of MCC in smart cities, including data breaches, cyber assaults, and privacy concerns. We end by emphasizing the need for additional research in this area and suggesting some potential remedies to the discovered security vulnerabilities. This study gives a thorough analysis of the security challenges connected with MCC in smart cities and lays the groundwork for future research in this vital field. Smart cities have become an increasingly essential component of urban development in recent years, harnessing new technologies to improve inhabitants’ quality of life. MCC has emerged as a vital technology for smart cities, allowing users to access data and apps from anywhere, at any time, and on any device. However, the usage of MCC poses a number of security risks, which can negate the benefits of this technology. We investigate the security challenges connected with the use of MCC in smart cities in this research. We begin by doing a thorough evaluation of previously published work on this topic. We then assess the existing level of security in MCC in smart cities using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Our findings indicate that the usage of MCC in smart cities raises a number of security problems, including data leaks, cyber-attacks, and privacy concerns. The complicated network architecture of smart cities, the vast amount of sensitive data exchanged, and the wide range of mobile devices used to access the cloud are identified as important contributors to these security challenges.},

The use of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in smart cities has the potential to enable secure and efficient communication and transactions, optimize resource usage, and improve services. However, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as issues related to data privacy and security and the potential for job displacement. Blockchain technology can be used to securely store and manage data related to smart cities, such as information about energy usage, traffic patterns, and public services. It can also be used to enable secure and efficient communication and transactions between different stakeholders in a smart city, such as government agencies, businesses, and residents. AI, on the other hand, can be used to analyze data collected from smart city sensors to identify patterns and trends and to make predictions about future events. This can help cities optimize their use of resources, improve services, and make more informed decisions. Despite the potential benefits of using blockchain and AI in smart cities, this research aims to explore the potential benefits and limitations of using blockchain and AI in the development of smart cities, with a focus on case studies of cities that have successfully implemented these technologies. The research will provide an overview of the state of the art in this area and will present a methodology for analyzing the benefits and limitations of blockchain and AI in smart cities. The research will also present results and discussion based on a review of relevant case studies and will conclude with a summary of findings and implications for the future development of smart cities.},

 abstract = {A smart city is a dynamic and sustainable urban system that provides a great quality of service to its residents by optimally managing its resources. In smart cities, low-frequency oscillations are a serious concern to the power system as they adversely affect system’s stability. Moreover, power system stabilizers are inefficient due to their fixed-parameter architecture. Flexible ac transmission system controller performs effective damping of low-frequency oscillations when provided with suitable supplementary damping control like a Static synchronous series compensator. In this context, the paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control for smart cities that uses the recurrent Gaussian membership function and recurrent wavelet neural network in antecedent and consequent parts respectively. The paper applies the gradient descent optimization with a back-propagation algorithm to update the parameters of suggested adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control. Simulations are performed on two test systems, both showing the effectiveness of the recommended control scheme as compared to traditional lead-lag control and artificial neuro-fuzzy Takagi Sugeno Kang control. Calculations of performance index for various fault scenarios lead to the conclusion that the control scheme can damp oscillations effectively and enhances the power system’s transient stability.},

 abstract = {Smart cities have been developed over the past decade, and reducing traffic congestion has been the top concern in smart city development. Short delays in communication between vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), smooth traffic flow, and road safety are the key challenges of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). The rapid upsurge in the number of road vehicles has increased traffic congestion and the number of road accidents. To fix this issue, Vehicular Networks (VNs) have developed many new ideas, including vehicular communications, navigation, and traffic control. Machine Learning (ML) is an efficient approach to finding hidden insights into ITS without being programmed explicitly by learning from data. This research proposed a fusion-based intelligent traffic congestion control system for VNs (FITCCS-VN) using ML techniques that collect traffic data and route traffic on available routes to alleviate traffic congestion in smart cities. The proposed system provides innovative services to the drivers that enable a view of traffic flow and the volume of vehicles available on the road remotely, intending to avoid traffic jams. The proposed model improves traffic flow and decreases congestion. The proposed system provides an accuracy of 95% and a miss rate of 5%, which is better than previous approaches.},

 abstract = {Today, communication technologies enable smart cities to become more effective in terms of satisfactory provision of services. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can be considered key elements for today's Intelligent Transportation Systems. A small number of research investigations is found to aim at exploiting the resources of CAVs for services provisioning within a smart city. Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, no research investigations have yet investigated exploiting the computational capabilities of CAVs to become an added value to the computational power of smart cities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Computational Resource (VaCR) and develop a system that enables vehicles to share their computational resources within smart cities. Users rely on Service Provider (SP) to acquire the required services that meet their Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences. The device capabilities of VaCR are one of the main indicators in QoE preferences. To that end, evaluation models are developed based on aggregate statistics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the discovery and selection of the appropriate VaCRs to participate in the provisioning of services. The deployment is modeled using a multiagent system. Then, game theory is used to model the recruitment that aims at optimizing QoE for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Thorough simulations, analyses, and evaluations of the proposed VaCR system are carried out. The performed validations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing QoE and the successful VaCR system operation, while attaining appealing performance characteristics.},

Demand for these objects is driving up data traffic, which in turn is placing strain on the network.

This article proposes an Information-centric Networking System using Multiaccess Edge Computing (ICNMEC) to reduce computation offloading and optimize data traffic. This system's 5G network slicing approaches combine edge computing and software characterization. Internet of Things applications have been used to store and analyze the information gathered. In addition, an algorithm known as OMNM (Optimized Memory Network Management) is created to control network traffic better and better use of storage. With minimal delays, network traffic, and storage ratio, the system's modelling tests demonstrate that it is very efficient. This method can progressively enhance the pace at which one can access and use the system. The performance assessment shows that the proposed method can improve the efficiency ratio of 95.141%, storage utilization ratio of 60.1% and access rate by 0.9, reducing network traffic and delay by 0.6.},

A central administrator appointed by the government manages and maintains the security of each node. Smart City relies upon millions of sensors that are heterogeneous and do not support standard security architecture. Different manufacturers have weak protection protocols for their products and do not update their firmware upon newly identified operating systems’ vulnerabilities. Adversaries using brute force methods exploit the lack of inbuilt security systems on IoT devices to grow their bot network. Smart cities require a standard framework combining soft computing and Deep Learning (DL) for device fleet management and complete control of sensor operating systems for absolute security. This paper presents a real-world application for IoT fleet management security using a lightweight container-based botnet detection (C-BotDet) framework. Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server. The framework quickly updates the standard Linux-based operating system IoT device fleet without relying on different manufacturers to update their system security individually. The simulation and analysis of the C-BotDet framework are presented in a practical working environment to demonstrate its implementation feasibility.},

This study focuses on digital participatory planning (DPP) as a precondition for social sustainability in SSC and aims to summarise and assess the current relevant local policies and endeavours in Oman; and to develop a generic framework to evaluate the readiness for DPP. In doing so, selective key literature, policies and initiatives were critically reviewed covering the SSC concept, establishing the link between the SSC and DPP, and eliciting a list of comprehensive DPP readiness factors. The results indicated that the Omani government has a clear will to move towards SSC and the country has already witnessed few initiatives supporting this direction. However, there is a lack of a clear action plan regarding DPP. Therefore, more work is required to systemise efforts.

Smart city applications have a critical role in improving public services quality, and security is their main weakness. Hence, a systematic multidimensional approach is required for data storage and security. Routing attacks, especially sinkholes, can direct the network data to an attacker and can also disrupt the network equipment. Communications need to be with integrity, confidentiality, and authentication. So, the smart city and urban Internet of Things (IoT) network, must be secure, and the data exchanged across the network must be encrypted. To solve these challenges, a new protocol using CLustering Multi-Layer Security Protocol (CL-MLSP) with AODV has been proposed. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is aligned with the proposed protocol for encryption and decryption. The shortest path is obtained by the clustering method based on energy, mobility, and distribution for each node. Ns2 is used to evaluate the CL-MLSP performance, and the parameters are network lifetime, latency, packet loss, and security. We have compared CL-MLPS with ECP-AODV, Probe, and Multi-Path. The proposed method superiority rates in energy consumption, drop rate, delay, throughput, and security performance are 6.54%, 12.87%, 8.12%, 9.46%, respectively.},

In recent decades, academics and industry have spent considerable time and energy discussing security and privacy. Other systems, known as intrusion detection systems, are required to breach firewalls, antivirus software, and other security equipment to provide complete system security in smart operation systems. There are three aspects to an intrusion detection system: the intrusion detection method, the architecture, and the intrusion response method. In this study, we combined linear correlation feature selection methods and cross-information. The database used in this article is KDD99. This paper examines applying two feature selection methods in predicting attacks in intrusion detection systems based on INTERACT and A multilayer perceptron (MLP). Since the number of records associated with each attack type differs, one of our suggestions is to continue using data balancing techniques. As a result, the number of records associated with each type of network status becomes closer together.

 abstract = {The rapid urbanization of global population causes many social, economic, and environmental issues, which does significantly influence the quality of life and living conditions of the people over the past years. The idea of smart city has grown popular, and it brings the opportunity to solve these urban issues. The motives of smart cities are to create the best use of public resources, enhance the quality life of people, and provide high quality services. Also, smart cities benefit from innovative applications of new kinds of information and communication technology to support communal sharing. Blockchain technology (BT) is more helpful to promote the development of smart cities through the implementation of BT in all the sectors. Blockchain-based smart contracts are disrupting the smart real estate sector of the smart cities. With this background, the study aims to explore the adoption of green BT in real estate sector toward the implementation of smart cities.},

 abstract = {Food wastage is a major problem in today’s world and the distribution of food surplus is undoubtedly one of the leading solutions to the problem. Surplus distribution is widely practised across the globe and there are several communities for the same as well. However, the success of these movements are determined by the active participation of volunteers. In addition, volunteer availability is an issue that is dependent on several different factors. An incentive module for the volunteers can normalize the availability of the volunteers. Such incentive modules are prone to identity duplication attacks and the implemented solutions do not really encourage volunteer hierarchical structures. In this paper, an incentive module that resists identity duplication and promotes the hierarchical structure between volunteers is presented. In addition, an improved matching module to match the food donors to the receivers utilizing the available volunteers optimally is also proposed. For the simulation, we have used real data taken from a real life smart city context, namely, we have used the OPEN DATA BARCELONA at https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-cadastre-carrecs-us and cast it to our simulation settings using Python libraries.},

Extracting useful knowledge or actionable insights from city data and building a corresponding data-driven model is the key to making a city system automated and intelligent. Data science is typically the scientific study and analysis of actual happenings with historical data using a variety of scientific methodologies, machine learning techniques, processes, and systems. In this paper, we concentrate on and explore “Smart City Data Science”, where city data collected from various sources such as sensors, Internet-connected devices, or other external sources, is being mined for insights and hidden correlations to enhance decision-making processes and deliver better and more intelligent services to citizens. To achieve this goal, artificial intelligence, particularly, machine learning analytical modeling can be employed to provide deeper knowledge about city data, which makes the computing process more actionable and intelligent in various real-world city services. Finally, we identify and highlight ten open research issues for future development and research in the context of data-driven smart cities. Overall, we aim to provide an insight into smart city data science conceptualization on a broad scale, which can be used as a reference guide for the researchers, industry professionals, as well as policy-makers of a country, particularly, from the technological point of view.},

 abstract = {Urban mobility plays a key role in any modern society. The advent of digital platforms and dedicated mobile apps, as well as new business models based on the concept of access over ownership and sharing economy (sharing mobility and Mobility as a Service), promises to reshape this sector. It will facilitate and speed up the diffusion of more sustainable and efficient means of transportation based on an intermodal mobility management perspective. The main goal of this paper is to examine the current state of smart mobility together with those factors that may influence the extent of modern sharing mobility proliferation and penetration through ICT applications and social media. The authors applied the content analysis using a sample of more than 1000 citizens' and visitors' reviews published on the official digital platforms of the smart city of Milan. The paper includes a comparison with data drawn from the public urban mobility services users. Based on the nodes resulting from the content analysis, the STEEP method was adopted in order to apply a more complex perspective concerning social, technological, environmental, economic and political issues. This strategic analytical tool was combined with the SWOT analysis dimensions to provide a comprehensive practical contribution to modern municipal smart mobility management systems. The results highlight the need for both smart mobility solutions suppliers and institutions to properly understand and communicate how digital services can be implemented across different users' touchpoints and communication channels to increase the value-added provided to citizens and visitors alike.},

 abstract = {This paper explores how urban planners can use a hybrid organization to manage smart city initiatives. We use an inductive qualitative case study approach based on connecting emergent concepts through Gioia's method to answer the following research question: “How can hybrid organizations manage a complex network of actors in smart city initiatives?”. The study highlights that in managing smart city initiatives, hybrid organizations benefit from actor-network theory. Additionally, for a more in-depth view, the study investigates the framework provided by Chourabi to test the hybridity theory. Overall, the results suggest that hybridity is feasible and increases the output directed towards citizens. The paper contributes to the existing literature on both hybrid organizations and smart cities. We conclude that despite the conventional distinction between public and private entities, managing smart city initiatives that include complex factors such as new technologies may require the adoption of hybrid management solutions by urban planners, especially when multidisciplinary and complex skills are required. Thus, smart city solutions are most effective when combined with hybrid management models. This research has utility for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers. It aims to support practical management solutions (analysed through a theoretical lens) to foster smart city initiatives.},

An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country analysis highlights gaps in transparency, reporting and communication of results, and the consequent allocation of resources in smart cities. Thus, this study identifies literature streams embracing the notion of smart cities and reporting. It employs a bibliometric and structured literature review analysis. Accordingly, this study proposes a framework comprising four macro-areas, several micro-elements, and the most appropriate implementation of technologies for sustainability challenges. Notably, it contributes to strengthening the smart city as an unconventional source of innovation, providing policymakers an opportunity to account for the smart city's weaknesses and identify areas for significant improvement efforts to be channelled.},

AIMS-SB helps to predict energy analysis, renewable energy production, and recycling evaluation based on prediction model strategies. AIMS-SB developed eco-design monitoring systems for smart buildings to optimize energy consumption, utilization, and drain characteristics. These efficient implementation strategies and methods for harnessing renewable energy help to improve the safety process, recycling, and reuse of our energy resources for smart building energy management.

Energy management of active power and frequency control approach is based on the intelligent probabilistic wavelet fuzzy neural network-deep reinforcement learning algorithm (IPWFNN-DRLA). The control strategy is formulated with deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Markov decision process and solved by the soft actor-critic algorithm. The NMG local controller (NMGLC) provides information such as the frequency, active power, power generation data, and status of the electric vehicle's battery energy storage system to the NMG central controller (NMGCC). Then the NMGCC calculates active power and frequency support based on the IPWFNN-DRLA approach and sends the results to the NMGLC. The proposed model is developed in a continuous problem-solving space with two structures of offline training and decentralized distributed operation. For this purpose, each NMG has a control agent (NMGCA) based on the IPWFNN algorithm, and the NMGCA learning model is formulated based the online back-propagation learning algorithm. The proposed approach demonstrates a computation accuracy exceeding 98%, along with a 7.82% reduction in computational burden and a 61.1% reduction in computation time compared to alternative methods.},

Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks. The benefits due to the expanded network access and enhanced connectivity between devices also intrinsically increase cybersecurity risks. Cyber attackers will be provided with additional digital targets; in addition, wireless and mobile network including the access channel infrastructure will be shared between independent services. To address these cybersecurity issues, this article presents the Blockchain Random Neural Network for Cybersecurity applications in a holistic digital and physical cybersecurity user and channel authentication methods. The user identity is kept secret as the neural weights codify the user information, although in case of cybersecurity breach, the confidential identity can be mined and the attacker identified. The proposed method therefore enables a decentralized authentication method. The validation results prove that the addition of the Blockchain Random Neural Network provides a user access control algorithm with increased cybersecurity resilience and decentralized user access and connectivity.},

The model network encodes the fully connected layer to fine-tune the CNN output and decodes the temporal prediction relations based on gate recurrent unit (GRU) to obtain more accurate results. The reliability of the proposed method is verified through a case study from Shantou City, China. The model performance is compared with the recently developed and traditional deep learning models. Results reveal that the proposed method has good precision in the multiscale air quality predictions. Compared with CNN-GRU, convolutional long short-term memory, and CNN models, the forecasting results of the proposed method are significantly improved. The presented method in this article can support the early warning systems in multiple regions for air pollution modeling studies.},

A qualitative comparison of the smart city initiatives in selected target countries and cities were done. The research strategy in this study approximates the grounded theory, utilising inductive reasoning to generate arguments and conclusions about the form, validity and future of the smart city. Various actors responsible to convert a traditional city to a smart city are defined and analysed within the context of this study. The main conclusion of this study was that the current research on smart city does not fully address the complex nature, conflicts and interdependencies of the smart city objectives. Moreover, the study found that the smart city initiatives form complex and multidisciplinary platforms that require holistic evaluation as the current evaluation methods and rankings of the smart cities vary considerably, making the evaluation of the success of the smart cities difficult.},

Some possible IoT application areas have not been looked into yet or do not have enough information on how to approach them. This shows that more research needs to be done in this difficult area to find new and potentially big benefits for society. Although smart cities offer residents and providers of capital several advantages, there are numerous ways that breaches could compromise the safety and security of individuals. As a result, several different recommendation designs can coexist in the IoT. This research examines the effects of ethics and technology on the security of IoT-enabled systems in smart city infrastructure. Hence provides a secure IoT network architecture for smart cities combining blockchain and deep learning to safeguard privacy and credibility. This research presents a Secure Smart City Infrastructure using Blockchain and Deep Learning (SSCI-BDL) framework to ensure privacy protection and trustworthiness among IoT communication in smart cities. This framework involves the blockchain network for security management in the smart city infrastructure. This framework integrates the deep learning model with an optimization algorithm that maintains efficient resource utilization in the smart city infrastructure. The simulation results show that the system has high security of 99.5% and the lowest latency rate of 4.1% compared to existing models. Overall, the proposed framework’s efficiency gives the highest rate of 99.8%.},

The need for the use of information and communication technology in various forms is needed in such cities. There are different dimensions that are to be considered for smart city planning and implementation. This complexity of the dimension, the use of technology, and their integration bring the risk perspectives into the implementation of the smart city concept. If such risks are not adequately understood and addressed, they can create issues in terms of privacy and security and, therefore, the functioning of smart cities. In this review, the identification of dimensions, smart city assessment tools, the available technologies, and the technical and non-technical risk parameters related to smart cities implementation are discussed. The current methods of risk assessment and the possible enhancements are highlighted. The findings of the literature review illustrate that not all smart cities adapt all of the smart city dimensions. The dominant technology used in smart cities’ applications is found to be the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and blockchain. The paper also provides some research directions for the design, implementation, and operation of smart cities.},

Different aspects of smart city assessment tools including scale of assessment, target groups, type of data, source of data, and geographical focus are studied. It is discussed that major approaches to assessment include benchmarking, baseline assessment, maturity assessment, assessment against peers, assessment against desirable targets, and scenario making. Currently, benchmarking is the most popular approach. However, depending on the specific needs of a development, other approaches may also be used to better inform decision making toward climate resilient cities. It is discussed that smart city should be evaluated at different levels and dimensions. There are six dimensions to cover all aspects of smart city including smart economy, smart people, smart mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart data. Different indicators related to these dimensions are provided that can inform planners and policy makers in their efforts. The chapter argues that smart city assessment tools should be able to facilitate transition toward climate resilience. In this regard, our analysis showed that existing assessment tools are relatively suitable for informing planning and policy making related to environmental and social dimensions. However, better integration of issues and indicators related to other dimensions such as infrastructure is needed. We hope these will be further investigated in the future research.},

 abstract = {Along with sustainability, smartness, and resilience are two key concepts that have dominated the scientific literature and policy discourses on cities over the past 2 decades. Multiple issues related to these concepts have been studied in the literature, and there are also many tools and indicator sets for assessing the smartness or resilience of cities, neighborhoods, communities, and projects. However, limited efforts have been made to probe interactions between smart cities and urban resilience. In particular, there is a lack of tools and indicator sets for assessing the contributions of smart city solutions and technologies to urban resilience. To fill this gap, in this chapter, we propose a set of indicators related to multiple dimensions of smart cities, namely, environment, economy, people, data, living, mobility, and governance. Overall, 98 indicators have been identified, and their potential linkages to resilience abilities are also highlighted and discussed. The proposed indicators can be used to develop tools for assessing the resilience of cities using smart city indicators. This could provide further opportunities for integrating the two concepts and contribute to developing resilient smart cities that facilitate addressing societal challenges, such as climate change, environmental degradation, and inequitable access to resources.},

 abstract = {Efforts aimed at addressing climate change have gained significant momentum in the past few years and following the Paris Climate Agreement. Recent data show that global temperatures are already about 1.1°C above preindustrial levels and the window to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C is rapidly closing. Cities account for over 70% of global CO2 emissions, indicating their significance for achieving climate stabilization targets. Recognizing this, many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and strategies to contribute to climate change mitigation. In the meantime, smart technologies are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in many cities around the world and governments and local authorities have used this as an opportunity to develop and implement smart city programs. While the impacts of smart city programs on urban CO2 emissions are not yet fully examined, it is hoped that they can contribute to meeting climate change mitigation targets. Through text mining of bibliometric data archived in the Web of Science, this chapter seeks to provide an overview of existing research at the intersection of climate change mitigation and smart city solutions and technologies. The chapter aims to discuss actual and potential contributions of smart city solutions, related to various urban systems, to climate change mitigation. Based on outputs of bibliometric analysis (term co-occurrence) obtained from the VOSviewer software tool, issues related to urban planning, buildings, transportation, waste management, energy and water resource, economy, urban infrastructure, and urban governance are discussed. It is argued that smart solutions and technologies have high potential to contribute to climate change mitigation. They can also provide co-benefits for climate change adaptation and sustainable development. However, appropriate planning and regulating measures are needed to avoid potential trade-offs and rebound effects. Such effects and trade-offs have also been discussed. Further, the need for integrated systems that accommodate different urban sectors is highlighted.},

 abstract = {Digital twins provide insights into physical objects by serving as advanced virtual representations. Their sensors capture detailed information about an object’s functionality through their use of various sensors. It is possible to gain a deep understanding of the object’s performance and potential areas for improvement by collecting data, which includes metrics such as energy output, temperature, and weather conditions. Digital twins are becoming important in a variety of research and industrial application sectors as production lines and processes become more digitalized and as improved data analysis techniques such as machine learning and enhanced visualization techniques are used. There is no unified definition of the digital twin concept in scientific literature, which results in imprecise applications and the weakening of its terminology. However, this study demonstrates how digital twin models can be applied to urban drainage systems. As a result, this highlights the relatively novel use of digital twins within the field of urban water system engineering. Our review of the language, practices, and directions in smart stormwater management provides a framework to organize and comprehend the current research landscape while highlighting crucial areas for future research. Our results demonstrate that there is near-unanimous agreement within the literature that smart technology has been, or will be, advantageous for stormwater management. However, while some progress has been made in terms of quantity management, maturity in water quality management has not yet been achieved. This study examines the scientific literature on digital twins in the application of artificial intelligence for smart city stormwater infrastructure systems, specifically focusing on urban drainage systems. A demonstration of the workflow and features of current digital twin applications in urban drainage systems is also presented, providing valuable insights and guidance for future research and development in this field.},

The architecture proposal is based on sensors for monitoring environmental parameters and to process the information through sensors and IoT application. The proposed fire detection system is the combination of wireless sensor technologies, UAVs, and cloud computing. Some image processing techniques are also integrated into the proposed fire detection system to identify the fire event with better accuracy and used as an integrated solution. To improve the true detection rate, rules are also designed. The simulation results of the proposed fire detection system are compared with several existing methods.

 abstract = {The current study is a preliminary approach to develop a structural framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) adoption barriers that exist in the waste management systems of smart cities in developing economies such as India. To attain this aim, the present study uses hybrid Multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) and has identified 15 adoption IoT Barriers (IoTBs) from literature review obstructing the IoT implementation in smart cities of India. The IoTBs are further analyzed through the Total Interpretative structural modeling (TISM) approach, the Fuzzy Matriced’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquéan Classement (MICMAC) model, and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The TISM approach is used to develop a structural framework of IoTBs in smart cities’ waste management (SCWM) projects. The literature shows that several bottlenecks exist. Such bottlenecks may include operational cost and payback; a lack of standardization, regulations, directions, and policy norms; incomplete technical knowledge among policymakers; internet connectivity, privacy, and security issues; or problems with mobility, transparency, and a lack of IT infrastructure; all of these issues influence IoT adoption in SCWM. The present work discloses that the lack of regulations, directions, and policy norms, and the lack of standardization and Internet connectivity are the most critical IoT barriers hindering the development of smart cities, particularly in their waste management practices. The Fuzzy-MICMAC approach is useful in calculating driving and dependence powers of the IoTBs, and the DEMATEL method helps reveal the influence/strength of IoTBs that affect SCWM. This study will help policymakers, stakeholders, and government to understand the significant IoTBs affecting waste management practices, and it will definitely assist them to undertake decisions for eradicating these barriers for a more efficient IoT implementation in SCWM projects.},

However, the quality of the air is deteriorating due to the emission of pollutants from vehicles, industries, and landfill sites. Concerning the landfill scenario, it is a challenge for a human to monitor the air quality continuously due to the emission of stinky smells and gases from the landfill sites. In this study, we implement a UAV network based on IoT (Internet of Things) and a cloud server for the smart city for tracking the air quality of the landfill sites in real-time and alerting the UAV for capturing the visuals from the camera for detecting the exact cause of the pollutant in the landfill sites. The gas that causes the most air pollution is Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ozone, dioxins and furans, etc. In this paper, continuous monitoring of these harmful gases is done to alert the people to protect them from harm. The study is also carrying the discussion about the industry 5.0 perspectives using UAV long-range communication. The objective of this study is to record the sensory data and visuals of the various gases (NO2, VOC, CO2, SO2) of landfill sites using IoT & UAV and then visualized in a graphical user interface form. The concentration of each gas that is stored in the cloud server is presented in the graphical representation. Different parameters such as Eigenvalues, Correlation Coefficients, and Regression Parameter have also been analysed graphically for the recorded data. The visuals captured from the UAV camera are employed for estimating the cause of the rise in pollutants in landfill sites.},

This paper aims to prioritise social risks for smart city development and to investigate the correlations between these risks and sociodemographic factors by conducting a questionnaire survey. The results revealed that social exclusion is the highest social risk, and older adults and females are the most sensitive sociodemographic groups regarding smart city risks. The finding also indicated that income and academic degree have no meaningful correlation with social risks.

Hence in this paper, the Optimized energy-efficient sensible edge processing (OEE-SEP) model for IoV in smart cities has been proposed for vehicle activity discharging with the estimated amount of time with less energy consumption. The sensible edge processing model comprises undirected activity discharging and similar activity discharging protocol, concerning the number of duties per unit time and the estimated time of completion for the same amount of information imported. An optimized energy-efficient model is formulated to reduce the total transmission delay and reduce the energy consumed during discharge. OEE-SEP leads to less energy consumption during activity discharging when the IoV processes and information loading activities are considered. The experimental results show that the suggested model enhances the performance rate of 97.45% with less transmission delay, less energy consumption for vehicle automation systems in smart cities.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) can provide intelligent and effective solutions to various applications with higher accuracy that requires less or no human intervention. Smart Cities are one of the significant applications of the IoT comprising a collection of various services such as intelligent transportation, waste management, smart homes, etc. These heterogeneous services offer a wide range of collaborative applications in smart cities. A smart municipality in a smart city is a concept in which a digital municipal corporation is developed to provide comprehensive local government collaboration services based on digitization and automation aiming towards raising the living standards of citizens. Interoperability between heterogeneous services for collaborative tasks creates challenges for data security and privacy. Ensuring integrity and confidentiality of information is critical, and reliable data is essential to both the government and its citizens. In this paper, we proposed a service security architecture based on authentication and authorization for constrained environments during collaborative tasks for Software Defined Networking (SDN) and smart contract-enabled municipal smart cities. The proposed collaborative service security framework is being tested on the Multichain Blockchain networks. We present a novel method for using smart contracts in multichain blockchains for data security during collaborative tasks in smart city municipal architecture. The proposed security solution is based on the dynamism of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions securely between different heterogeneous IoT networks. We implemented a supportive use case for collaborative services in an SDN-enabled IoT architecture to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed service security architecture.},

 abstract = {Modern cities currently face numerous challenges related to mobility, waste management, access to resources, etc. Smart Cities integrate information and communication technologies (ICT) to develop innovative solutions that can solve such challenges and create a higher quality of life for their citizens. Two elements need to be considered for smart cities to be successful. First, citizens must participate in the design of the smart city to take advantage of their ideas so that the smart city answers their real needs. Secondly, each city has its own unique characteristics that need to be considered to design a citizen participation strategy truly tailored and adapted to their respective context. In line with these two considerations, the goal of this paper is to identify the context factors that impact citizen participation strategies in smart cities. In order to reach that goal, we performed a qualitative case study of two cities that strive to be smart: Namur (Belgium) and Linköping (Sweden). This analysis allows us to understand how participation is implemented in two different cases and to infer the context factors that impact the respective strategies. Five context-factors have been identified in this study: the smart city consideration, the drivers for participation, the degree of centralization, the legal requirements, and the citizens’ characteristics. By identifying these factors, we can derive context-dependent recommendations about citizen participation for smart cities. These recommendations are then applied to the case of Brussels in Belgium.},

 abstract = {Smart cities refer to the application of information and communication technologies to improve the quality of life of citizens. Smart city projects may fail if citizens do not actively participate in their design. In smart cities, this participation often occurs through dedicated participation platforms where citizens can vote, discuss, and submit ideas. However, current platforms are not always aligned with the requirements of citizens in a representative way. Furthermore, they are neither always aligned with the reality of the administration and the requirements of public servants. In this paper, we examine what characteristics a participation platform should possess to be aligned with the requirements of citizens and public servants. A quantitative survey of citizens and qualitative interviews of several public servants are performed to elicit those requirements. The most important requirements for citizens are free access, user friendliness, and government usage of the ideas while the most important for public servants are the representation of the city's identity, back-end functionalities, and inclusivity. Afterwards, a guiding framework, following Design Science Research, is composed based on the requirements and applied to the platform LeuvenMaaktHetMee. Furthermore, the framework updates the founding framework of Macintosh and Whyte from 2008, allowing to guide the development and implementation of participation platforms.},

Numer- ous aspects of smart cities are being investigated, with a few applications being developed in each. This article conducts a survey to describe various sensor network choices for smart cities. The research explores message transmission challenges via the lens of applications such as taxi sharing, ambulance services, and other emergency services that rely on real-time traffic data provided by the smart traffic domain to work successfully. Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are employed in a range of areas due to its advantage in rapidly establishing networks. The network will perform ideally if mobile nodes collaborate and trust one another; hence, message transmission for this service, as well as the utility of MANET routing algorithms, are examined.},

Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

 abstract = {Due to the increasing need for time with respect to industrial growth and the speeding up of human day-to-day work, network evolution is always the center of focus for research organizations. Artificial intelligence (AI), on the other hand, is playing an increasingly important role in automating systems, increasing efficiency, and ensuring high dependability in complicated activities. Network and AI research are generating a boom in IoT applications, as firms strive to serve their consumers with ever-improving features and functionality. In this article, we look at the evolution of network technology across time as well as the role of AI in the next generation of networks.  First, we will introduce the reader to the features of different network generations, technology used in. Second in the context of network evolution and AI, we will define the scope of IoT applications and their need in order to alleviate user demand. Consequently, we provide the requirements of advanced models in smart cities applications and insights on the development of future network for those applications. Our study showed that, though important features were introduced in the advanced automated networks, these are still to be tested under for automated applications that have strict requirements in terms of low latency, high reliability, and fast transmission.},

 abstract = {Traffic management is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. There has been a continuous emphasis from the research community to predict air quality and manage traffic for congestion-free roads. This paper proposes a novel framework to identify traffic congestion and estimate air quality using crowdsourced information. Navigation Reference Spatial Data (NRSD) was created using the spatial likelihood method using GPS trajectories and OpenStreetMap. This NRSD was also used to design the traffic environment using distance, speed, and time interval mapping. After the NRSD creation, the framework used the real-time data of the registered user to compute the traffic density using the Graham scan with the k means algorithm. Eight standard air quality parameters were used to identify the air quality index of a particular node using a Bayesian Classifier. A case analysis was performed on the road network of three major cities of north India lying within a bounding box of (lat:30.518065, lon:76.659055) to (lat: 30.512501, lon:76.658808) was performed to validate the proposed framework. Based on the performed experiment, the proposed framework achieved maximum accuracy of 98 percent. Similarly, NSRD improves the framework's accuracy by 3.8% in comparison to the baseline dataset. In 87 percent of scenarios, this framework can also determine the shortest path by avoiding traffic.},

 abstract = {Due to the gigantic rise in the use of high data rate-based applications and the ongoing transformation of Indian cities into smart cities, there is a need for a high-speed communication framework to handle the enormous data traffic. The radio frequency (RF) and microwave links seem to be incapable of offering sufficient bandwidth required by the data-hungry applications and consequently, the need for a more effective solution for tackling the issue of scarcity of bandwidth resources has become the necessity of current network infrastructure in India. In this study, a hybrid optical fiber-free space optical (OF-FSO) system for offering high-speed data services has been proposed to assist the implementation of smart city infrastructure in India. This study aims to inspect the system performance of the proposed model under the climatic conditions of mountainous, desert, flatland, and seaside regions of India. The proposed hybrid OF-FSO system comprises a fixed single-mode fiber (SMF) of 20 km and an FSO link (having a varied transmission range between 0–2 km). The proposed hybrid model can support an FSO link of 1.72 km for a fixed SMF of 20 km, corresponding to a bit error rate of the order of 10−4 for atmospheric conditions of the seaside location of Chennai and the range of FSO link varies from 1.32 km to 1.57 km for other locations of India, for the same length of SMF and bit error rate. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid OF-FSO has demonstrated a reduction of 30.8% in Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) cost in contrast to the conventional passive optical network (PON) system.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary development that facilitates the instant communication of data among devices, making it an essential paradigm in today's world. It enables the development of smart infrastructure and provides assistance in emergency services during disasters. However, there is a growing need to develop energy-conserving paradigms that cover all aspects of a smart city. In this work, the authors present a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) inspired greedy strategy-based mutation operation for IoT-enabled heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) distributed architecture in a technology driven city. The proposed protocol aims to design a weighted fitness function that considers four parameters: node density, residual and average energy, and distance parameters. Additionally, a 3-tier heterogeneity is considered to prolong the network functional duration, and a deployment strategy is addressed to position these nodes in an energy-efficient manner. The proposed algorithm achieves 31.41%, 20.42%, 13.37%, 1.59% increase in network lifespan compared to GA-based optimized clustering (GAOC), optimized GA with single sink (OptiGAS-StSS), multiple sinks (MS) based GAOC and optimized GA with multiple sink (OptiGAS-StMS), respectively. The significant enhancement in network lifespan is an outcome of choosing the most efficient CH nodes based on the proposed fitness function. Overall, the proposed protocol contributes to developing an energy-conserving paradigm for a smart city.},

The paper maps, evaluates and analyses the strategic actions of the Greek Municipalities from an internal and external perspective of a public authority. Results show most local authorities try to formulate a coherent framework to efficiently utilize available resources and enhance productivity and quality of the services provided. Even though the majority of cities have embedded in their digital strategies various forms of smart projects, a rather partial implementation of relevant initiatives in their day-to-day operations is noticed. The challenges and prerequisites for an effective implementation of smart strategies have been explored. Furthermore, we assess their design, which may mitigate risks and lead to higher returns, at the earliest possible stage. This allows us to map the crucial factors that may open their “appetite” for a successful strategy towards a smarter future.},

Drawing on policy mobility studies and cosmopolitisation – defined as globalization from within – it focuses on the roll-out and take-up of smart city narratives and interventions in South Africa since 2005. Based on a media analysis on national and local scales, the paper shows that the smart city effect is an entangled phenomenon. Generally speaking, it consists of a lexical glue that holds together processes of data-driven neoliberalisation of urban governance. However, at municipal level we observe more variegated effects of reverse-scale policymaking, labelling and territorialisation where the smart city appears as a more-than-mobile but also as a more-than-local urban policy.},

The results show that SCPs have a positive effect on both economic and total ecological efficiency (incorporating resource consumption and pollution emissions). However, the environmental protection effect is not as strong as the resource-preserving effect. These results may be related to China's current stage of development.

Based on a literature review on smart city construction and carbon emissions, this study uses a multi-period difference-in-difference model for empirical analysis, aiming to assess the impact of smart city pilot policy on carbon productivity. We find that: (1) Smart city construction has increased urban carbon productivity by 2.045%. Among them, the promotion effect of eastern and central cities is noticeable, while western cities have a restraining effect. (2) The impact of smart city construction on carbon productivity has a time-lag effect. The pilot policy will take effect in the third year of implementation and reach its maximum value in the fifth year. (3) Smart city construction can improve urban carbon productivity through technological progress, industrial structure upgrading, and energy structure optimization. Therefore, it is recommended to formulate policies from collaborative innovation between cities, optimizing industrial structure, and accelerating renewable energy replacement to achieve sustainable economic development.},

 abstract = {These days, the development of smart cities, specifically in location-aware, latency-sensitive, and security-crucial applications (such as emergency fire events, patient health monitoring, or real-time manufacturing), heavily depends on more advanced computing paradigms to address these requirements. In this regard, fog computing, a robust cloud computing complement, plays a preponderant role by virtue of locating closer to the end-devices. Nonetheless, utilized approaches in smart cities are frequently cloud-based, which causes not only the security and time-sensitive services to suffer but also its flexibility and reliability to be restricted. In order to obviate the limitations of cloud and other related computing paradigms such as edge computing, this paper proposes a study for the state-of-the-art fog-based approaches in smart cities. Furthermore, according to the reviewed research content, a classification is proposed that falls into three classes: service-based, resource-based, and application-based. This study also investigates the evaluation factors, used tools, evaluation methods, merits, and demerits of each class. Types of proposed algorithms in each class are mentioned as well. Above all else, by taking various perspectives into account, comprehensive and distinctive open issues and challenges are provided via classifying future trends and issues into practical sub-classes.},

This review paper examines advancements in machine learning for macronutrient recovery in city organic waste systems for a circular economy. The use of ML will greatly improve the scalability, transparency, productivity and accuracy of nutrient: recovery technologies, logistics, dissemination, and reuse. ML can also be combined with hardware to automate tedious waste separation, recovery and agricultural tasks using drones, hydroponics and satellites. Meanwhile, crop yields, nutrient demand-supply efficiencies, food security, environmental soil monitoring, and prosumer involvement could all increase.

The research focus is on developing countries and cities not yet fully aligned with smart city standards. The methodological approach of examining citizens' readiness was based on an analysis of crowdsourcing models, such as crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting and crowdsensing, and their application in various fields, such as traffic, environmental conservation, utility services and health. The data was gathered in the city of Belgrade, Republic of Serbia, for two years through a survey that included a sample of 210 citizens. The results indicate that citizens are ready to accept crowdsourcing services related to environmental conservation (crowdfunding services that support solar energy development and environmental protection) and public transportation (crowdvoting and crowd wisdom services that can improve the state of the public transport). The proposed methodological approach and obtained results could serve as a good basis for initiating the implementation of smart city projects in Serbia and other cities and governments.},

 abstract = {ICT tools based on abstract spaces can be considered as the "younger sibling" of GIS tools. While GIS tools based on real spaces, i.e. those that are easy for users to imagine, are developing more and more, tools based on abstract spaces are still in their infancy. The aim of this article is to show the possibilities and directions of application of ICT tools based on abstract spaces and to present the current state of their application. The article shows which elements of GIS technology can be used in tools based on abstract spaces and what differentiates the discussed types of spaces. The approach to the proposed tools was made from three points of view. First - the types of abstract spaces were presented. Second - the areas of their application were indicated along with the application of higher information functions (such as spatial data collection for abstract spaces, their single- and multi-area visualisation, environmental analysis and assessment, planning, inspiration and support of decision-making processes presented in abstract spaces). And thirdly, they were framed from the point of view of modern technologies such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality) or hyperlinks. The reflections were concluded with an analysis of the current state of application of the technology in question in Polish public administration offices. The results of the surveys show that the proposed solutions are not currently used in city halls and are at the conceptual stage. The topic of AI is well known among the respondents. This is probably due to the popularity of the concept in popular science publications. Respondents show much less interest in the area of abstract spaces. Furthermore, they are of the opinion that their GIS solutions do not support this type of space, or if they do, they have no idea how to use it.},

 abstract = {The smart city concept has emerged as an attractive label to address pressing issues of global urbanization and combat the critical challenges to attain sustainable development. Sustainability is still often conceived through a green environmental lens, but any change in the built environment also has implications for the social environment. Social sustainability is a dynamic concept that combines design of the physical realm with design of the social world and promotes infrastructure to support social needs and concerns. While smart cities primarily aim at enhancing performance through innovative use of digital data and technology, a social sustainability perspective stresses the critical interconnections between people and place. Through a critical systematic literature review, this paper establishes a dialogue between the smart city and social sustainability. It evaluates the smart city concept through a social sustainability lens within a built environment paradigm. A multi-stage conceptual framework is advanced around notions of place, identification of core social sustainability themes and related factors, and sensitivity to broader policy and detailed implementation scales. The framework provides guidance for further studying both the social objectives and outcomes of smart city policies.},

 abstract = {A data fusion and information integration (DFII-VT) framework is proposed to solve the batch-based vehicle matching/tracking problem using heterogeneous fixed-location and mobile sensing data available in smart cities. To make the model more realistic, traffic knowledge such as lane-choice decision, traffic merging, travel time and vehicle characteristics are calibrated using the historical dataset and then integrated into the model. The problem can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization model, and solved using a dynamic programming/Kuhn-Munkres algorithm-based two-step approach. By doing so, the proposed method can obtain individual travel times of the matched data pairs, and these can be directly used to estimate the corridor travel times of individual vehicles. The experimental results show that the fusion of mobile sensing data and fixed-location data yields significantly better results than using single-source data. Significant improvements in matching accuracy are obtained as more traffic information is integrated into the model. Therefore, the method may be considered a framework for integrating the manifold traffic information acquired within smart cities to obtain more accurate matching results and further used to optimize other fine-grained traffic applications, such as estimating vehicle trajectories along arterial corridors, estimating individual vehicle-based fuel consumption/emissions, and helping to infer real-time queuing processes at signalized intersections. The paper also studies some practical issues related to the use of heterogeneous traffic data, such as data errors, and detection failures.},

 abstract = {A Sustainable Smart City (SSC) has become the largest industrial sector that encompasses advanced cognitive, information, and computing methods for providing better big data handling to enhance the quality of life and urban operations with optimized resource utilization. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used as Air Taxis (ATs) in SSC, bypassing traffic congestion. However, the integration of ATs in SSC is very challenging, seeking high safety and security for the passengers. Such an autonomous system carries vital information, becoming vulnerable to furtive False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA), which have not received considerable research attention heretofore. To address the problem, this article establishes a model-free FDIA employing a recurrent deterministic policy gradient to exploit the data integrity of AT’s sensors, leading to collisions. Thereafter, a decentralized threat detection model, a deep optimized attentive federated aggregation learning is deployed, to counteract the threat and protect the data privacy of each AT. The suggested method is parallelizable and can accurately detect an unobservable FDIA in a distributed manner. The simulation findings show that the proposed attack–defense model investigates in-depth system’s vulnerabilities and tackles the risk with a higher detection rate and reduced computing cost while maintaining privacy preservation that surpasses modern approaches.},

The deep integration in this data-driven model poses heightened risks to infrastructure while enhancing control over automation processes. A significant concern is the false data injection attack (FDIA), which intricately targets sustainable energy system state estimation. This attack allows adversaries to bypass detection methods, manipulate outcomes, and jeopardize secure grid operation. This study explores FDIA identification in smart grids, focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for detection. The objective is to assess the proposed detection methodology through simulation experiments on the IEEE standard test scheme, validating practicality under diverse sustainable energy conditions. This study undertakes a focused exploration into the realm of identifying FDIAs within smart grids, centering on the utilization of Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) as a machine learning approach for detection. The objective is to assess the efficacy of the proposed detection methodology through rigorous imitation experiments conducted on the IEEE standard test scheme. Various contrasting scenarios are meticulously designed to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the detection model under diverse conditions. In the intricate landscape of Fault Detection, Isolation, and Diagnosis in smart grids, the imperative is to recognize and comprehend abnormal conditions or faults within the grid's operational framework. A robust strategy poised to detect FDIAs in Smart Grids involves the strategic implementation of an advanced digital twin known as the “Cyber-Physical Digital Twin for Smart Grid Security.” This digital twin is meticulously engineered to emulate the intricate dynamics of the Smart Grid, seamlessly integrating both its physical and cyber elements.},

 abstract = {In the era of smart cities, the advent of the Internet of Things technology has catalyzed the proliferation of multimodal sensor data, presenting new challenges in cross-modal event detection, particularly in audio event detection via textual queries. This paper focuses on the novel task of text-to-audio grounding (TAG), aiming to precisely localize sound segments that correspond to events described in textual queries within an untrimmed audio. This challenging new task requires multi-modal (acoustic and linguistic) information fusion as well as the reasoning for the cross-modal semantic matching between the given audio and textual query. Unlike conventional methods that often overlook the nuanced interactions between and within modalities, we introduce the Cross-modal Graph Interaction (CGI) model. This innovative approach leverages a language graph to model complex semantic relationships between query words, enhancing the understanding of textual queries. Additionally, a cross-modal attention mechanism generates snippet-specific query representations, facilitating fine-grained semantic matching between audio segments and textual descriptions. A cross-gating module further refines this process by emphasizing relevant features across modalities and suppressing irrelevant information, optimizing multimodal information fusion. Our comprehensive evaluation on the Audiogrounding benchmark dataset not only demonstrates the CGI model’s superior performance over existing methods, but also underscores the significance of sophisticated multimodal interaction in improving the efficacy of TAG in smart cities.},

The enormously rising population in cities brings with it numerous problems that need to be deeply addressed. New approaches are required in solving many issues such as the management of scarce resources in the city, and the access of city residents to clean air and water. The smart city concept, which freshly emerged with the approach of adapting advanced technological facilities to city administrations, may be able to assist to cope with these problems. The levels of embracement and implementation of the smart city concept play a fundamental role in the well-being of people living in urban areas. Measuring smart city performances, especially in metropolitan cities, can guide the management of local or national investments to improve society's quality of life. In this study, the smart city performance assessment of 30 metropolitan municipalities in Türkiye using a two-stage methodology is included. The scores of smart city index indicators determined by the literature review for Türkiye were calculated using MEthod based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC), which is a recent multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. In the second part of the methodology, 30 metropolitan municipalities were ranked based on weighted criteria using another MCDM approach Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS). The methodology is compared with different MCDM approaches. As a result of the study, it has been revealed that the best city according to the methodology is İstanbul. Also, Antalya, İzmir and Konya have also been among the prominent cities with high smart city scores.

 abstract = {With the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the construction of the smart city came into being. Compared with the traditional city, a smart city can reduce resource consumption, improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental pollution, reduce traffic congestion, reduce potential safety hazards, improve the quality of life of citizens, etc. In order to collect a large amount of data to provide accurate decision-making recommendations for the management of smart cities, a large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) system needs to be built as the basis. For most applications in smart cities, it is very important to obtain the physical location information of the data during the data collection. However, it is a challenging issue for most sensor devices in the IoT system, because sensor devices are hard to equip positioning equipment as limited by cost. To tackle this, a Low-Cost Physical Locations Discovery (LCPLD) Scheme is proposed in this paper. In LCPLD scheme, mobile vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used for physical location discovery on the wireless sensor networks which are the important component of the IoT system in a smart city. In order to further reduce cost, we propose a task application mechanism to reduce the cost of vehicle broadcasting and the Adaptive UAV Flight Path Planning (AUPPP) algorithm to reduce UAV flight cost. In order to reduce localization error, the Large Error Rejection (LER) algorithm and the UAV Same Position Broadcast Repeat (USPBR) algorithm are proposed in this paper. After simulation experiments based on real vehicle driving data, the experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme: Compared with the comparison scheme, the LCPLD scheme proposed has a cost reduction of 16.58% ∼19.88%, an average reduction of 78.80% in positioning error, and an average reduction of 99.88% in the variance of positioning error.},

@article{THAMARAI2023104816,
 abstract = {Population growth and industrialization lead to a proportionate increase in cities' daily waste generation rates. Communities in developing cities often turn to waste disposal methods that have proven destructive to human health and the environment. Further, the disposal of waste is not treated and utilized for waste-to-energy (WtE)-based energy generation. To overcome this situation, many researchers proposed various solutions. However, the optimal utilization of this waste for power generation still needs to be solved. The proposed work discusses a self-powered garbage management system using a Convolution Neural Network and IOT for households in smart cities. The proposed system collects household wastes and segregates them into organic and inorganic wastes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The inorganic waste is sent to the recycling bin, and the organic waste is used for power generation. The residue of the organic waste after power generation is utilized as fertilizer for plants. The proposed system comprises five modules: a garbage collector, a segregation unit, a power generator unit, an inorganic waste collection bin with IoT-enabled sensors, and an electronic control unit. The garbage collector unit collects household waste. The CNN-based waste classifier in the segregator unit separates the waste into organic and inorganic, and the organic waste is sent to the power generation unit. The waste is grinded using a combustion unit in the power generator, producing biogas for electric power generation. The system is fully automatic, and a Raspberry Pi controller controls the complete process with the help of sensors and various motors. The system monitors the inorganic waste collection bin level using sensors. It sends a notification to the municipality's Garbage Collection Van operator using the IoT module once the bin is full and can be sent for recycling. The accuracy of the proposed CNN for waste segregation is 98%. While comparing with other pre-trained CNN models, such as InceptionV3 and Inception ResNet, the proposed method produces satisfactory results with 14% and 12% accuracy gains, respectively. The segregated and decomposed 50 kg of organic waste can produce 6 m3 of biogas which in turn can produce 114 MJ of electric energy, which can be utilized for street lights and also for the proposed smart self-power generating garbage management system to function. The proposed system is highly adaptable in smart cities for household municipal waste management with minimum routine monitoring and operational time requirements. Further, the system generates only a fraction of the required energy.},

 abstract = {This paper reviews the emergence and development of the “smart energy city” as an academic, normative, and applied concept. An examination of the academic literature since the early 2000s reveals the unfolding of spatiotemporal trends relating to this concept. It has been emerging to represent a sector-specified version of its sister concept of smart cities, also popularized in the past decade. However, the idea of the smart energy city has its own historic precursors and nationally specific trajectories. It rose from concerns with energy efficient/green buildings as well as smart grids for low carbon and distributed energy generation and distribution, which were later scaled up to the whole urban scale, and to embrace multiple other urban sectors and urban domains. By so doing, and combining the developments in ICT-led smart cities and sustainable energy, the notion of the smart energy city has come close to represent a digitally-mediated variant of low carbon cities. It can, thus, be conceptualized as a blend of smart cities and low carbon cities. National and urban case studies help to further distinguish “actually existing” projects, patterns, and conceptualization relating to both smart cities and smart energy cities and barriers to their practical integration. A greater focus on intersystem integration and a multistakeholder approach more recently offers a stronger representation of interdisciplinarity and conveys the complexity of the system involved, where humans and social systems become increasingly more central.},

 abstract = {The present study presents an investigation into the utilization of artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple linear regression model (MLR) for the prediction of traffic noise levels in various locations of Dhanbad city at varying intervals. Traffic noise indices measurements were carried out using sound pressure level meter (SLM). The prediction of equivalent A-weighted sound level (LAeq) and the sound level exceeding 10 percent of the time (L10) is carried out using various influencing factors such as number of cars, number of 2 wheelers, number of 3 wheelers, number of heavy vehicle, number of medium commercial vehicles, and traffic speed. The findings demonstrate the ANN model's proficiency in comparison of MLR model for providing precise prediction accuracy of traffic noise indices with a R2 of 0.94 for LAeq and 0.91 for L10. Furthermore, the frequency spectrum analysis reveals that high peaks were observed at lower frequencies ranging from 31.5 Hz to 50 Hz, middle frequencies from 500 to 800 Hz and higher frequencies from 3.5 kHz to 5 kHz. The noise maps at varying intervals revealed that most of the locations are having higher noise levels due to increase in vehicular movement. The study emphasizes on the potential significance of the proposed neural network-based prediction model in collaboration with noise mapping as a vital tool for the anticipation of traffic noise levels and the formulation of noise mitigation strategies in context of the mid-sized smart city like Dhanbad, India.},

 abstract = {Technological advances have enabled multiple countries to consider implementing Smart City Infrastructure to provide in-depth insights into different data points and enhance the lives of citizens. Unfortunately, these new technological implementations also entice adversaries and cybercriminals to execute cyber-attacks and commit criminal acts on these modern infrastructures. Given the borderless nature of cyber attacks, varying levels of understanding of smart city infrastructure and ongoing investigation workloads, law enforcement agencies and investigators would be hard-pressed to respond to these kinds of cybercrime. Without an investigative capability by investigators, these smart infrastructures could become new targets favored by cybercriminals. To address the challenges faced by investigators, we propose a common definition of smart city infrastructure. Based on the definition, we utilize the STRIDE threat modeling methodology and the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool to identify threats present in the infrastructure and create a threat model which can be further customized or extended by interested parties. Next, we map offences, possible evidence sources and types of threats identified to help investigators understand what crimes could have been committed and what evidence would be required in their investigation work. Finally, noting that Smart City Infrastructure investigations would be a global multi-faceted challenge, we discuss technical and legal opportunities in digital forensics on Smart City Infrastructure.},

Although the relevance of new technologies as strategic levers for crisis resolution has been widely debated before the pandemic, especially in the smart cities' context, how individuals have agreed to include the technological changes dictated by the pandemic in their daily interactions remains an open question. This paper aims at detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology before and after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) to analyze a large corpus of tweets. Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies. In this way, the study enhances scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the strategies for enabling the use of technology within smart cities to manage the transformations introduced by the health emergency and guide citizens’ behaviour.},

All metropolises have incorporated GIS as a part of their information infrastructure. It is used in process of investments and in the dynamic management of widely understood projects. GIS is not a new solution, however, in recent years new areas of its use have emerged. The tools and technologies related to the idea of Smart City, such as Internet of Things, are gaining popularity. As a result, new potential areas for cooperation and integration of data and information resources emerge. The aim of the study was to determine the levels of application of GIS in the perspective of relations and links with Smart City tools. The first part of the article presents the levels of use of GIS in city management. In the next part, attention was paid to the potential use of GIS in Smart City. The third part of the article covers the results of the survey referred to the selected group of cities in 2021. The previous publication of the authors concerned the ten largest cities in Poland. Current questionnaires were focused on the next 30 cities from the list, including terms of population. The results of the study indicate that although there are many potential common areas of integration, these technologies are implemented and used separately from each other.},

In addition to the collection and cartographic visualisation of data, higher-level information functions such as automatic analysis, control, spatial planning or decision support can be realised. GIS technology can also be used to visualise abstract spaces. The article deals with the application of GIS in different types of cities. The article is intended to be the result of an analysis of the direction of the use of GIS technology in public administration in Poland. For this purpose, a model was developed to examine the state of GIS technology application. Two criteria were used to determine the state: groups of factors influencing the use of GIS technology (organisational, functional, informational and technical) and the level of maturity of GIS tools. Four levels were distinguished (from zero, i.e. no application of GIS technology, to a third level indicating the strategic importance of the tools studied). To this end, an empirical study was developed to determine the level of maturity of the application of the tools in question. After analysing the results, it can be concluded that the systems studied are still evolving. From the perspective of the proposed model, it can be assumed that the development of GIS tools has reached the second level in most of the surveyed offices. However, it will still be difficult to develop the software if not all the currently available GIS software capabilities are used.},

 abstract = {Sustainable smart cities are confronted by technological, organisational and external risks, making their governance difficult and susceptible to manipulation. Based on a comprehensive literature review of 796 systematically retrieved articles, the current study proposes a multilayered technology-organisation-environment (TOE-based) risk management framework for sustainable smart city governance. A total of 56 risks are identified and grouped into TOE categories. There are 17 technological risks, including IoT networks, public internet management and user safety concerns, with a 38.7% contribution to smart city governance risks. With a 15.6% share, there are 11 organisational risks, including user data security and cloud management. There are 28 external risks with a contribution of 46.7% to the smart city governance and consist of smart city's environment, governance, integration and security risks. A multilayered TOE-based risk management framework is proposed to identify and manage the risks associated with smart city governance in the current study. The framework links smart citizens to each other through the smart city governance team and the integrated TOE layers. The iterative risk management process of identification, analysis, evaluation, monitoring and response planning is carried out in the TOE layers, both at the external layer levels and internal management levels. The proposed framework operationalises the risk management process for smart city governance by presenting the collection of pertinent risks and their thematic TOE categorisation. The criticality of the identified risks in line with the study's rankings can help researchers and practitioners understand the top risks of smart city governance. These risks present investment opportunities for city governance bodies to develop critical and effective responses as well as provide safety, security and enhanced privacy for citizens.},

 abstract = {Using big data in supply chain management (SCM) has the potential to have a significant impact on the industry in general and international transportation in particular. Big data have a direct influence on transportation capacity in future cities. There has been a significant increase in urbanization over the last decade in which one in three people will live in an urban area by 2050. An updated transportation infrastructure is essential to keep up with the present flow of goods, while also limiting its impact on the environment and human health and this is likely to be achieved using big data analytics technique. To overcome this problem, smart cities are becoming more popular. With the use of information and communication technology (ICT), a smart city aims to address public concerns in an inclusive, municipally-based partnership. A big data transportations system may be built using the superstructure of a smart city. A good way to define it is the modeling and analysis of urban transportation and distribution networks using enormous data sets created by GPS, mobile phones, and transactional data from company activities. Big Data analytics may be used in public transportation to better understand how people go about the city. A better understanding of passengers’ travel patterns might help transportation providers make better judgments regarding service quality. People who travel by automobile on a regular basis may now be predicted based on the triangulation of mobile phone data from millions of anonymous users. Local and national polls may demonstrate the paradigm’s applicability. To compute the time it takes for passengers to board and exit trains, Metro and iBus vehicle position data may be combined with information from smart cards. Big Data analytics for traffic management may benefit from these findings.},

 abstract = {This article contributes to the emerging body of urban digitalisation scholarship concerned with alternative practices at the grassroots level by reviewing and structuring the literature in relation to the production of urban space and governance. By drawing a conceptual framework for grassroots digital urbanism, the paper first brings the ongoing discussions around the smart city and platform urbanism into critical conversation through the lenses of right to city and platform capitalism discourses. Then it reviews the literature on the unfolding alternative ideas and practices mobilised at the grassroots level to discursively and practically contest these techno-capitalist models. The outputs of this literature review are conceptualising a version of grassroots digital urbanism that is at the intersection of grassroots urban movement and digital sovereignty and highlighting the lack of empirical work and critical accounts on the resulting implications of relevant initiatives in reshaping the production of urban space and reconfiguring urban governance.},

 abstract = {We propose a systematic literature review using text mining. The methodology has two main directions: (i) analyzing the evolution of concepts and topics explored throughout time by using word frequency counts in abstracts, and (ii) Detecting the main topics expressed in literature by using topic modeling and bigrams in full papers. Additionally, using text mining in reviews can help summarize, detect patterns, and better explore papers. The proposed methodology (and code) is reproducible and can be applied to different research fields. As a case study, we systematically review smart road space allocation literature and the role of big data and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in promoting emerging urban solutions. Even though, recently there has been a significant rise in studies related to smart cities and big data, few papers consider these approaches in road space allocation. On the one hand, temporary solutions are mainly held in local access streets to achieve place-making and reclaim vacant public spaces. On the other hand, intermittent and dynamic solutions are mainly studied in arterials and highways and focused on traffic performance. Ultimately, new road space allocation proposals are not sufficiently studied where there is a high dispute and limited space to allocate space. Big data and smart technologies have the potential to collect real-time data and adapt the infrastructure according to fluctuations of demand and also in case of an unpredictable event.},

 abstract = {The implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation within the European Union intensifies regulatory requirements in terms of data protection for Smart City services. In particular, the mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process constitutes a complex managerial challenge. To reduce the complexity, this study develops a typology of Flemish Smart City services based on DPIA costs. Our explorative case study, based on face-to-face interviews and a workshop, shows that DPIA costs vary along the complexities of i) the urban environment in which a Smart City service is provided, and ii) the Smart City service itself. The research further demonstrates that these complexities represent multilayered concepts. The complexity of the urban environment consists of three layers: i) city size, ii) diversity of urban stakeholders, and iii) total of Smart City services in the urban region. Similarly, the complexity of the Smart City service is composed of five layers: i) number of different data streams, ii) clarity of data ownership, iii) amount of use-cases, iv) privacy invasiveness, and v) visibility of the Smart City service. While most layers of the respective complexities unequivocally matter in the eyes of the experts, others are more contested, such as the size of the city and the visibility of the Smart City service. This cost-based framework is of value to city administrations and Smart City service providers as it allows them to make the DPIA process more efficient by shortening the learning curve and improving decision making by clustering services based on data protection needs. In particular, stakeholders that have little expertise in-house, and that are looking for an easy-to-understand, rational framework can benefit from these results. Furthermore, based on both the literature review and the obtained results, our systematic data protection impact-cost-approach is generalizable beyond the EU-borders.},

 abstract = {Incorporating natural spaces within urban areas has been shown to have multiple benefits. However, despite greening and adaptation strategies at different levels of government, progress remains slow with a lack of easy to use and comprehensive tools identified as key to overcoming this. This paper presents a co-designed tool with academic and local authority partners to demonstrate the ecosystem service benefits of small-scale urban green infrastructure projects. Through the tool, users can readily assess the impact of green infrastructure investments on the delivery of a selection of ecosystem services in the early stages of a project. Furthermore, the tool provides a standardised assessment of cultural ecosystem services’ contributions, as well as offering a method to score spatial designs on the impact on habitat for biodiversity. Use of the tool is demonstrated using a pilot study in Kapelle, the Netherlands. The results set out an overview of the impacts of the spatial design on estimated ecosystem service delivery. They also show the tool’s potential to add value in early project stages and as a planning and design tool, helping to maximise the benefits that can be achieved through green infrastructure design. Complementing these arguments with ball-park estimations on green infrastructure costs, the Nature Smart Cities Business Model aims to offer public sector officers the means to create a business case for green infrastructure measures, facilitating the translation from strategies to actual plans, thus benefitting green infrastructure implementation in the public realm.},

However, a comprehensive understanding of citizen discontent with the smart city is missing. This study systematically reviews academic research addressing citizen discontent with the smart city. Based on a set of 58 articles, two perspectives on citizens' discontent are identified. One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies’, ‘the right rules’, and ‘the right information’, or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment’ and the ‘right to participate and challenge’. Based on our findings, a fine-grained understanding of attitudes and behavior, and government actions to address citizen discontent is developed.},

Whilst much theorizing and conceptualization have made concrete advancements in establishing the research agenda for this topic, case-based research on citizens’ perceptions of smart city initiatives is still scarce. Through examination of surveys and content analysis of plans and documents exploring smart city development in Saint Petersburg, this paper looks at differences between perceptions of authorities and citizens in local government initiatives towards smart city development in the referred city. Results suggest that there seems to be a gap in the way citizens and sponsors – authorities, in particular – understand smart city endeavors. In St. Petersburg, Russia, the gap compromises levels of participation and engagement in smart city initiatives despite high levels of engagement with traditional e-government technologies. Such circumstances may reflect an expectation-results divide that has been described in collaborative e-government literature, but is yet to receive empirical scrutiny in the context of smart city development. The paper ends by critically examining risks of ignoring perceptions from different stakeholders and not monitoring gaps such as the one examined in this practical case.},

Whereas there is a certain commonsensical promise in it, in that -- since we live it -- we ‘ought’ to be able to understand more and explain more about the related phenomena, the challenge that arises is that we do not necessarily see more. Accordingly, whichever story about the world, in this case about smart cities and/or human-computer behavior or combinations of them, we may wish to tell, each of them will bear the mark of our prior knowledge, experiences, and worldviews. Not always will it expand and deepen the exploratory and explanatory potential of the ensuing research .The papers included in this special issue seek to navigate this challenge.},

 abstract = {The concept of a smart city comes with the need to support a data platform that can gather, process and export the data of millions of sensors, coming from different sources, with information in different formats, in a scalable approach for real-time and historical data visualization, processing, and actuation in the city. This paper proposes a Data Platform for the Aveiro Tech City Living Lab, to gather, process, visualize and actuate on mobility, environmental and network data. The architecture of the platform provides a real open platform that is accessible for third-parties to collect data and to experiment their own solutions, through a secure and open data platform at their disposal. The platform was also designed to be scaled and modified when necessary, being composed by distributed solutions across the existent modules. The results with respect to the amount of data gathered, the ingestion and query performance comparison between the persistence solutions considered, and examples of data, show how this platform can be used to efficiently develop new applications and use both real-time and historical data for future predictions and actuations in a smart city.},

 abstract = {Urban Living Labs (ULLs) have been implemented in many cities, but their organizational and legal structure has not often been analyzed. ULLs aim to provide a space for different parties to research, develop, and test solutions to urban problems whilst engaging with local communities. Their experimental approach to urban innovation and to public-private collaboration makes flexibility, openness, and informality important. However, ULLs are also confronted with existing legal frameworks, responsibilities, and liabilities. Whilst they aim at shared decision-making and horizontality, they must navigate public and private interests, and interact with local government as well. To understand these dynamics, this article examines the legal and organizational structures of ULLs, the factors and trade-offs that influence it, and the role municipal government plays in in these structures. This article analyzes the different forms and trajectories of ULLs in practice, through semi-structured interviews held in four labs in Amsterdam. Through qualitative research, we found that 1) ULLs are partnerships that exist on a spectrum of formalization, from informal to highly formal; 2) the degree of formalization is influenced by financial, legal, and organizational factors that change over time; 3) each degree of formalization is associated to trade-offs, even if these trade-offs are not explicitly formulated by the people involved; 4) tensions arise from the municipality's double role as public authority and as partner. We conclude that ULLs could gain from clearly identifying the legal frameworks that condition their structure, actions, and future.},

 abstract = {Since ancient times, humanity has envisioned a world where people and things connect and interact. The advent of generation mobile systems, the so-called 5 G in the early century, has realized this dream. 5 G can provide network services with extremely-high throughput and extremely-low delay and allows a huge device number to connect based on Internet infrastructure, forming the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has been applied in various fields serving humanity, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, education, military, and IoT ecosystems. One of the main challenges of IoT applications is computing solutions to reduce service response times. This study proposes an efficient edge computing management mechanism for IoT applications in smart cities. Our mechanism proposes a small database (called an information map) that allows edge computing servers of smart cities to store edge service information. When the mobile end-users move to the new edge server' managed coverage, properties related to the EC service are exchanged between the edge servers. The experiment results have shown that our proposed mechanism improves service response time and energy consumption many times compared to the traditional mechanism. We hope that this mechanism will be strongly applied to sustainable smart cities in the future.},

To achieve this, we evaluated the performance and efficiency of 32 smart cities in China between 2012 and 2017. The 32 cities were divided into four categories according to average performance and efficiency. The process of change in the smart cities between 2012 and 2017 was mapped and three primary trends in performance and efficiency were identified. The final status reached by the 32 cities was predicted according to the three trends. To more effectively implement smart city initiatives, two evolutionary routes for smart cities are proposed. The findings demonstrate that the performance of smart city implementation is consistent with economic development but not with efficiency. The status of smart city implementation is not static; it depends on the context of the city and can shift between the four city categories. Smart city initiatives should be driven by technology firms with appropriate governmental guidance.},

In this article, Energy Efficient Integrated Planning Framework (EEIPF) has been proposed for sustainable smart cities to enhance energy efficiency and performance. Energy efficiency planning over smart cities involves the primary and secondary strategies used in modern cities to improve energy efficiency. Integrated Planning Framework provides a numerical model for selecting energy efficiency methods to optimize economic and environmental impacts.

Although a Smart City has the potential to change our cities for the better, it also may unintentionally reinforce existing inequalities. In particular, without appropriate strategies that support inclusion, persons with disabilities and seniors may experience social and digital exclusion in communities. This study explored current progress toward building an “Inclusive Smart City (ISC)” through the 2015 U.S. DOT Smart City Challenge. It examined the range and frequency of inclusive strategies that were proposed by cities in their applications and the differences between successful and unsuccessful proposals. After reviewing and analyzing documentation from both rounds, we conclude: (1) insufficient attention was given to these underrepresented population groups in the proposals; (2) more ISC strategies are needed to address these groups’ needs and guarantee their rights; (3) government policies to support ISCs are needed to insure that the implementation of Smart City ideas addresses the needs of these groups; and, (4) universal design practices could be used to address the needs of many underrepresented populations.},

The coupling coordination degree model was used to evaluate coordinated development levels of smartness and sustainability, and the Panel Vector Auto-Regression (PVAR) model was adopted to explore how three dimensions of smartness, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), human capital, and smart governance, dynamically influence urban sustainability. Further, the 77 smart cities were classified according to SCI status, economic development level, and population density to conduct the PVAR model. Results showed that the two subsystems of urban smartness and sustainability are coordinated, and coordinated degrees exhibited an upward trend. The impacts of ICT, human capital, and smart governance on urban sustainability differed in smart cities with different contexts. ICT and smart governance had a long-term positive impact on urban sustainability, while human capital did not have an overall significantly positive impact.

Therefore, in order to reduce cost of FAP’s sales enterprise and improve the distribution efficiency, based on the distribution mode of third-party logistics, an optimization objective mathematical model with the minimum distribution cost charged by mileage stage and time window penalty cost is established in this paper, an improved ant colony algorithm is designed to solve it. After testing, it is concluded that when the number of customer points and demand change, the FAP’s sales enterprise can intelligently choose to cooperate with different third-party logistics distribution companies. In addition, when the distribution demand of FAP’s sales enterprise changes, the third-party logistics company should adjust the charging mode in time, so as to improve the market competitiveness to promote the cooperation with the FAP’s sales enterprise.},

We first measured the urban GTFP using the Luenberger productivity indicator derived from the directional distance function, and further investigated the impact of SCP on urban GTFP using the difference-in-differences (DID) model, and its heterogeneities, impact mechanism, and spatial spillover effect were examined using balanced panel data for 283 prefecture-level cities from 2004 to 2017. The study produced five key results. (1) SCP can significantly promote urban GTFP in China, and a series of robustness checks verified the validity of this finding. (2) There was a positive spatial spillover effect of SCP on GTFP in neighboring non-pilot cities, while the spillover effect on the neighboring pilot cities was poor. (3) There was heterogeneity among Chinese cities, with the promotional effect of SCP on GTFP being more significant in eastern cities, super cities, non-resource-based cities, and cities with high levels of human capital, financial development, and information and communication infrastructure construction. (4) The regression results of a mediating effect model showed that SCP can promote GTFP through technological innovation, upgrading the industrial structure, and resource allocation optimization. (5) Smart city policy improved urban GTFP mainly by improving technical efficiency rather than technological progress. These conclusions are of great theoretical and practical significance for the Chinese government, and can be used to transform the extensive urban development mode and achieve high-quality development.},

The results show that implementing a smart city construction policy improves the urban innovation output, and that the effect on the degree of urban innovation was relatively significant after implementation. A further heterogeneity analysis showed that smart city development in different regions has different impacts on urban innovation; specifically, compared with the central and western regions, smart city construction in eastern China was seen to have a higher impact on urban innovation output. Moreover, the findings also demonstrated that smart city construction policies have different impacts on urban innovation output in cities of different urban scales.

Subjective QOL was measured by three indicators: life satisfaction, frequency of happy emotions, and frequency of depressed emotions. Results show that ICT is negatively associated with life satisfaction and the frequency of happy (positive) emotions, but not associated with depressed (negative) emotions. Human capital, by contrast, has a positive impact on life satisfaction and the frequency of happy emotions but has a negative impact on the frequency of depressed emotions. Further, ICT and human capital can affect subjective QOL through perceived government corruption and government performance.

In smart medicine, intelligent dialogue system is playing an important role in providing personalized and efficient healthcare services to improve the quality of life for human beings. The Bert model has become a popular way to construct intelligent medical dialogue system. However, the current Bert model is difficult to achieve desirable results for this task since its input does not reflect the difference in roles. To overcome this drawback, we present a role distinguishing Bert model for intelligent medical dialogue system to help construct the sustainable smart city. Particularly, we segment and label the utterances depending on different dialogue roles, and then construct the corresponding segment embedding as the input of our model. Furthermore, we substitute the NSP task with the SOP task to better learn the coherence between sentences. Finally, we verify the proposed model by comparing it with Ernie on some online E-commerce datasets for intent recognition, semantic matching, and session dialogue classification. The results demonstrate that our proposed model improves the average 1% accuracy for different tasks in dialogue system, proving the potential of the proposed model for establishing intelligent medical dialogue system in smart city.},

According to the theoretical basis of DTs and the smart city construction, the five-dimensional DTs model is discussed to propose the conceptual framework of the DTs city. Then, edge computing technology is introduced to build an intelligent traffic perception system based on edge computing combined with DTs. Moreover, to improve the traffic scene recognition accuracy, the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm is optimized by the residual network, form the SSD-ResNet50 algorithm, and the DarkNet-53 is also improved. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effects of the improved algorithms and the data enhancement method. The experimental results indicate that the SSD-ResNet50 and the improved DarkNet-53 algorithm show fast training speed, high recognition accuracy, and favorable training effect. Compared with the original algorithms, the recognition time of the SSD-ResNet50 algorithm and the improved DarkNet-53 algorithm is reduced by 6.37ms and 4.25ms, respectively. The data enhancement method used in the present work is not only suitable for the algorithms reported here, but also has a good influence on other deep learning algorithms. Moreover, SSD-ResNet50 and improved DarkNet-53 algorithms have significant applicable advantages in the research of traffic sign target recognition.

 abstract = {This paper focuses on whether the construction of smart cities can expand green space. Based on smart cities policy in China, a quasi-natural experiment is conducted by using the Heterogeneity - Robust estimator in differences-in-differences model. According to detailed theoretical analysis and rigorous empirical research, and main conclusions are as follows. First, the construction of smart cities can directly expand the green space due to the land resource allocation. The above basic conclusion remains reliable after a series of robustness tests. Second, the effect of construction of smart cities on the green space is heterogenous. The construction of smart city in the three batches has a positive impact on expending green space and the strongest positive effect on green space is seen in the smart cities established in 2012. The high-level economic scale and high-level science and technology are vital premises for smart cities to expand green space. Third, the construction of smart cities can indirectly expand the green space by promoting online work and services and increasing disposable income. Last, the “Broadband China” Strategy has a positively moderate effect on the construction of smart cities in expanding green space.},

 abstract = {Connecting to the internet will increase our computing challenges as it becomes an integral part of our daily lives. Therefore, it is necessary to advance the service qualities of Internet of Things (IoT) applications because the data produced by all these devices will need to be processed quickly and sustainably. Previously, cloud data centers with large capacity interface IoT devices with support servers. While IoT devices proliferate and generate massive amounts of data, communicating between devices and the Cloud is becoming more complex and harder, resulting in high costs and inefficiencies. Fog computing emerges as an approach to address the growing demand for IoT solutions. In this article, an IoT-fog-cloud application’s general framework is developed, followed by an algorithm for Energy efficiency through an integrated approach computation model. Fog-Enabled Smart Cities (FESC) are proposed to minimize service delay and response time by using a fog offloading policy for the fog-enabled IoTs. Also, we developed an analytical model evaluating the proposed framework's effectiveness in reducing the delay of IoT services. Comparing the proposed model and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM-VS) algorithm, the proposed model performs significantly better. Thus, by optimizing response and processing times, fog-enabled smart grids determine whether computation will be performed autonomously or semi-autonomously on fog nodes or in the Cloud.},

 abstract = {Distributed renewable energy is penetrating the urban energy system with a continuously increasing proportion. However, due to its natural randomness, a large number of energy storage resources are necessary. Electrolytic hydrogen could quickly follow the fluctuations of renewable energy and transform excess renewable energy into hydrogen stored for future use, which not only promotes the accommodation of renewable energy, but also drives the low-carbon development of construction, transportation, electricity, and other industries, thereby helping construct future low-carbon energy systems (FCES). However, few existing studies have conducted a systematic investigation on the role of electrolytic hydrogen in smart city decarbonization from both the supply and demand sides. Here, we develop a full-life-cycle optimization model of FCES with photovoltaic (PV) and power-to-hydrogen (P2H) planning to achieve decarbonization goals in China. Our results show that the annual hydrogen potential of 10 selected cities with different energy structures and quantities varies from 0.236 to 9.795 megatons, with a gap of more than 40-fold. Considering PV and P2H integration in FCES, the CO2 emissions of 10 cities in related fields decreased obviously under an 80 % photovoltaic penetration level (PPL). Compared with electrochemical storage, P2H shows better performance in PV integration of FCES from both economics and CO2 emissions. However, this advantage needs to be based on diverse terminal uses of electrolytic hydrogen.},

However, despite the recent increase of research on UDTs due to its widespread diffusion much more recently, there is a lack of studies examining the existing bottlenecks to its implementation. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic literature review on the key challenges and open issues pertaining to the implementation of an UDT. Results indicate 8 important categories of challenges related to (1) interoperability and semantics; (2) infrastructure, including storage, computation, network; (3) data acquisition and actuation; (4) data quality and harmonization; (5) modeling, simulation and decision-support; (6) data visualization and information display; (7) human and capital resources; and finally (8) governance, organizational and social issues. All topics are significantly raised in the literature, with most emphasis on issues pertaining to data and model semantics, missing data, data quality and modeling. The findings serve to inform practitioners about the bottlenecks delaying the implementation of UDTs.},

Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.},

 abstract = {In the smart city agenda, data plays a key role in shaping governance and participation around urban planning, and this data is increasingly derived from sensors of all kinds. These sensors increasingly include physiological and sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional states of urban citizens. In urban planning, emotional data has so far been conceptualised as ‘people as sensors’ where data is used to create an aggregated emotion layer for real-time urban planning. This paper argues this approach does not enable citizens any meaningful participation in urban planning. In contrast, this paper demonstrates what emotion can ‘do’ when citizen actively use emotions to participate in the problem framing in smart city governance. The paper offers a framework of smart city participation with emotion data by focusing on the Bio Mapping project, where physiological sensors are used as participatory mapping approach that led to urban planning. This approach enabled citizens to engage in a dialogue around their emotional response to urban space and articulate the potential for emotion data in urban governance. There needs to be a consideration of 1) multi-dimensional emotion data, 2) an active participant role, 3) extended participation within the planning process 4), and empowerment within urban governance. The paper argues that a participatory approach to emotion data can function as a dynamic leverage point of negotiation in smart city governance between citizens, urban space, and civic agencies.},

In this novel study, we investigate the effect of China's smart city policy on household daily consumption and carbon emissions. The empirical analysis is based on a difference-in-differences regression, in which the dependent variable is the household indirect carbon emissions estimated based on the consumer lifestyle approach and a dataset of 201 Chinese cities between 2010 and 2018. The main findings are as follows. First, the smart city policy significantly reduces household indirect carbon emissions, and the reduction is greater when the policy pilot region includes the whole city rather than only certain subareas. Second, the mechanisms through which the smart city influences household indirect carbon emissions are mainly the reductions in transportation- and education-related emissions resulting from developments in smart technology. Third, the above effects last for years, and they are regionally heterogeneous and more significant in the cities of eastern China. The findings in this paper suggest that smart cities can potentially achieve city sustainability by promoting greener consumption behavior.},

 abstract = {Existing studies are mixed about whether smart city construction (SCC) can alleviate urban environmental pollution. This study takes three batches of smart city pilots implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China as a quasi-natural experiment. We construct the panel dataset of 286 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period 2006 to 2018, then applies the multi-stage difference-in-differences method to investigate the environmental benefits of SCC policies. The results show that SCC can significantly reduce air pollution by 2.6% ∼ 18 %, except for ozone (increase by 13.9%), water pollution by 0.7%∼ 11.8%, and solid waste pollution by 5.8%∼ 19.7%. Meanwhile, SCC policy shows a more prominent reduction effect in eastern cities, megacities, young local officials and regions with high government capacity. The dynamic effect reveals that the environmental benefits take effect after 2∼4 years of SCC implementation, and then the benefit will increase significantly over time. The mechanism tests indicate that although the rebound effect will deteriorate the environmental quality, SCC can reduce pollution through industrial structure optimization and technological innovation. Overall, this finding inspires other emerging economies to solve the dilemma of economic development and environmental governance at the level of new infrastructure construction.},

 abstract = {In the pursuit of carbon neutrality goals, the manufacturing industry is compelled to adopt smart manufacturing practices to comply with environmental regulations. Smart manufacturing, characterized by the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, offers the potential to reduce energy consumption, emissions, and enhance productivity. This study investigates the influence of the low-carbon city pilot (LCP) policy on smart manufacturing and its underlying mechanisms. Leveraging data spanning 2003 to 2020 from China’s A-share-listed manufacturing companies, several key findings emerge. First, the LCP policy exerts a significant positive impact on the smart manufacturing capabilities of companies operating within LCPs. Furthermore, this impact strengthens over time. Second, a company’s innovation and effective resource allocation act as active mediators in the correlation between the LCP policy and smart manufacturing, whereas government intervention plays a positive moderating role. Lastly, state-owned manufacturing companies exhibit a lesser positive effect from the LCP policy compared with their non-state-owned counterparts in terms of smart manufacturing. Moreover, the positive effect of the LCP policy on manufacturing companies in cities with traditional industrial bases is relatively smaller than that in cities with emerging industrial bases. Building upon these findings, this study offers targeted recommendations to promote smart and sustainable manufacturing.},

A combination of these technologies could provide a core technology for the urban digital twin to support sustainable smart city design. Through an insightful literature review, this paper summarizes the different disciplinary classifications of GIS and BIM functional integration, distills the value of data, and discusses the ontology-based data integration approach that GIS and BIM should take in the future to conduct research on integration applications in smart cities. To verify this view, keyword analysis, co-country analysis, and co-citation and coupling analyses are conducted using CiteSpace. GIS and BIM integration has attracted much attention. However, a professional disconnect and fragmented composition pose challenges in the field of GIS and BIM integration.

 abstract = {Nowadays, the concept of smart cities evolves from conceptual models to various stages of development. The smart services of cities like smart buildings, smart hospitals, smart traffic, smart factories, and smart transportation are vital to energizing resilient, reliable, seamless energy and electrical flow. One of these smart services' critical challenges is anticipated to run without disruptions using smart energy and smart electrical grids. Hence, in this research, the Internet of Things (IoT) role in green energy resources incorporation into smart electrical grids has been introduced using the Multi-Objective Distributed Dispatching algorithm (MODDA). Efficient energy management includes a tradeoff between the cost linked with utility function and energy consumption. The utility function can be the living comfort of the consumers or the utility firm's gross income. The interchanges between utility and energy consumption must, therefore, be recognized. The algorithm is intended to transmit the renewable green energy available to the battery, thermal, and load storing while preserving a thermal and battery storage limit. The experimental results at the lab-scale show the proposed dispatching algorithm minimizing the system cost and energy consumption. It is shown that substantial energy waste can be reduced by equipping a smart building with the proposed IoT system for effective green energy management.},

Wireless power transfer technology is well-known for its dependability, security, and adaptability, and has reached billions of market share in China alone in the cell phone and electric vehicle sectors over the past decade, with the electric vehicle wireless charging market expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 30% by 2023. Combining WPT with renewable energy, electric vehicles, and recharge infrastructure is a promising new application for smart city development. This paper examines the history, characteristics, and six classifications of WPT technology through the lens of urban development, in addition to its successful implementations in seven contexts, such as portable devices and transportation, based on a survey of 161,425 papers. We propose a dependable and efficient research-to-application life cycle for high-power WPT operations, which is capable of achieving efficiencies of approximately 90 percent at approximately 50 percent of the original cost. In addition, the significance of incorporating WPT technology, renewable energy sources, and urban infrastructure into the design of sustainable cities is highlighted. This study determined that WPT is advantageous for promoting the construction of space and ground photovoltaic plants, as well as photovoltaic rooftops, and also serves to accelerate the promotion of electric vehicles, smart devices, and charging roads. The findings of this study cast light on three problem areas and six future prospects of WPT, as well as its multifaceted benefits in terms of energy, the environment, and the social economy of sustainable cities.},

To this end, this paper proposes a traffic flow prediction method for smart cities (RL-GCN) based on graph convolution, LSTM network and reinforcement learning, aiming to solve the problem of urban traffic flow prediction. Firstly, we use the graph convolutional neural network to process the urban traffic network data features, then use the LSTM network model to learn the temporal information, and then combine the reinforcement learning algorithm to develop the optimal traffic control strategy based on which the future traffic flow is predicted. Our experiments on several datasets show that the model developed in this paper has outstanding performance for urban traffic flow prediction. Compared with the traditional traffic flow prediction methods, the method in this paper has significantly improved prediction accuracy.

Dual-pilot policies of the low-carbon city and smart city can create a synergistic emission reduction effect by improving the level of urban digital innovation, market-oriented innovation, and industrial innovation. The carbon emission reduction effect of Dual-pilot policies has regional heterogeneity and is more obvious in the eastern cities in China. The research can provide theoretical support for the planning of pilot cities, which is conducive to the sustainable development of the low-carbon economy in China.},

 abstract = {Sustainable smart city idea is rapidly evolving with the aim of improving the quality of life of residents utilizing the integration of information and communication technologies(ICT) with state-of-the-art technology in practice. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been widely used in sustainable smart city construction due to its advantages such as low price, good maneuverability and strong flexibility. However, as the heterogeneity of smart city systems and the high mobility of UAV network nodes cause them to face more serious security threats, ensuring the security and authenticity of message is crucial for UAVs to correctly perform the tasks issued by the command center. To fix the above-mentioned issues, many digital signature schemes have been presented in recent years. Regrettably, most existing schemes either have security vulnerabilities or poor performance. Very recently, He et al. came up with a certificateless designated verifier proxy signature (CLDVPS) scheme and advocated that it was secure. But, we find that their scheme cannot achieve its stated purpose because it fails to resist user impersonation attack. We put forward a new CLDVPS scheme to address the data security and privacy issues in UAV networks. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme can realize a higher security level while greatly reducing communication and computation overheads. Compared with related schemes, our scheme is more suitable for the application of UAV network in sustainable smart city.},

 abstract = {As major producers in the national economy, industrial enterprises bear great responsibility for carbon emissions. A smart city pilot policy (SCPP) with innovative advantages and environmentally friendly features provides a feasible way to scientifically achieve carbon emission reduction targets while maintaining industrial growth. However, there is a lack of specific understanding of the microscopic carbon reduction mechanisms of the policy. Thus, based on the data of A-share listed industrial firms from 2009 to 2018 in China, this study explores the impact mechanism of the SCPP on the CO2 emissions from industrial firms with the time-varying DID methodology and the mediating effect model. The results demonstrate that the SCPP can curb CO2 emissions from industrial firms in China by 23% by strengthening the intensity of environmental regulation and promoting green technological innovation. Further analysis indicates that the mediating effect of resource allocation efficiency only works in industrial firms in low-carbon industries, not high-carbon industries. In addition, the heterogeneity test suggests a pronounced reduction effect of the SCPP on non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs), and industrial enterprises in low-carbon industries, resource-based cities and eastern China. This paper is of great significance for providing theoretical and practical implications for making rational use of smart city policies to improve the carbon reduction performance of enterprises.},

 abstract = {The escalating demand for electricity, driven by the confluence of population growth, technological advancements, and economic progress, has precipitated an energy shortfall within the smart city landscape. In addressing this challenge, smart city enterprises are strategically deploying smart grids to implement innovative Demand Response (DR) programs. These initiatives aim to optimize energy consumption by incentivizing citizens through public–private partnerships and exploring financing avenues like green bonds, thereby fostering sustainable and resilient urban energy ecosystems. The initial contribution of this paper introduces an energy management (EM) approach. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) procedure is implemented to address the comprehensive planning problem across three researches: one without SOLAR batteries, one with SOLAR systems, and one incorporating SOLAR batteries. The model aims to decrease energy prices, mitigate peak-load, reduce carbon dioxide discharges, and prevent rebound peaks, ultimately enhancing user comfort. Simulations are conducted to match the efficacy of this proposed approach with obtainable ways. The results demonstrate that the recommended ACO procedure effectively reduces energy prices, carbon dioxide discharges, and peak loads across various researches. Consequently, this ACO procedure-based EM routine outperforms existing benchmark approaches. Meanwhile, digital twin (DT) technology is reshaping the renewable energy sector by offering virtual replicas of physical systems. This article delves into the applications, advantages, and challenges associated with digital twin modeling in renewable energy. The technology entails the creation of virtual replicas for renewable energy systems, integrating real-time data to facilitate precise simulation. Key advantages encompass accurate prediction, dynamic monitoring, and the optimization of energy production. The synergy between digital twin modeling and smart grids enhances flexibility and bolsters grid reliability. Nevertheless, challenges include ensuring data security, managing system interconnectivity, and addressing computational demands. In essence, digital twin modeling presents a pathway for realistic representation and efficient management of renewable energy, although challenges must be navigated to unleash its full potential.},

 abstract = {Smart grid is considered a cyber-physical system, which is a combination of physical devices and computational processes. Since there are lots of interactions between the cyber layer and the physical layer, the operation, management, and security of the entire system are crucial topics that must be taken into account. In this regard, this paper tackles two problems in AC MGs, as a special case of smart cities. Firstly, a framework is proposed to solve the optimal scheduling problem in these systems. In this stage, the optimal management and scheduling of the system are structured and modeled as an optimization problem. The dragonfly is utilized as a powerful optimization technique to solve this optimization problem. It is worth noting that in this paper different renewable energy sources, as well as batteries are considered. Since cyber-attacks are among the greatest threats to the system and can cause disruption and outage in smart grids, in this paper a deep-learning-based method called long short-term memory along with the concept of prediction interval is utilized to develop a cyber-attack detection model for false data injection attacks on smart meters. The proposed cyber-attack detection model is first trained using historical data and then is used in real-time for detection. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheduling scheme, the modified IEEE 33-bus test system is utilized. Also, for testing the proposed cyber-attack detection model a real-world dataset is used. The simulation results show the great performance and effectiveness of both proposed methodologies. It should be noted that all model are simulated in digital twin simulator. The novel LSTM-based cyber-attack detection model enhances security in electric grids, demonstrating remarkable accuracy.},

 abstract = {In the construction of smart cities, facial expression analysis plays a crucial role. It can be used in traffic monitoring systems to alleviate traffic pressure by analyzing the emotional states of drivers and passengers. In the field of smart healthcare, it can provide more precise treatment and services to patients. In the realm of social entertainment, it can offer more intelligent and personalized interactions. In summary, the application of emotion computing technology will play an increasingly significant role in the development of smart cities in the future. In the task of dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER), analyzing the spatial–temporal features of video sequences has become a common research approach. However, facial expression sequences often contain a significant number of neutral frames and noisy frames, potentially increasing computational costs and reducing performance. Effectively extracting key frames for spatial–temporal feature analysis is a critical aspect of dynamic facial expression recognition. To address this issue, we proposed a sampling-wise dynamic facial expression recognition via frame-Sequence contrastive learning method, called SW-FSCL. The SW-FSCL method aims to improve the performance of DFER by using intelligent dual-stream sampling strategies and frame-sequence contrastive learning, extract key frame and reduce the impact of neutral frames and noisy frames. We proposed a key frame proposal (KFP) block to analyze the spatial–temporal features of sequences, calculating weight ratios for key frame extraction. Due to potential information loss in long sequences, we introduce a temporal aggregation (TA) block to prevent data loss and ensure the integrity of temporal information. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that the proposed approach not only outperforms all current state-of-the-art algorithms on two widely-used benchmark datasets (DFEW, FERV39k), but also visualization results produces insights into the interpretability of the SW-FSCL method.},

Given the scarcity of a historically informed understanding of a smart city in the existing literatures on smart urbanism, this paper argues that a genealogical method helps us to counter the sweeping binarism that obscures the complexity and diversity of actually existing smart cities today. Through genealogy, this study underscores the multifaceted nature of the smart city, which consists of a combination of multiple urban diagrams that grows out of distinct problems and objectives of urban management – mobility, security, environment, and futurity. This paper illustrates how a smart city emerged out of multiple strings of history and problematizations that are contingently interweaved at a given time and space in multiple and diffused forms.},

 abstract = {Smart cities are rapidly developing with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Walkability-enhanced ICT (WICT) caters to pedestrian needs and preferences by providing intelligent real-time information as a person strolls in an urban environment. Governments invest heavily in various ICTs and big data as part of their planning decisions in smart cities. The walkability enhancement enabled by integrated ICTs needs to be evaluated by urban planners, but this aspect is not covered in previous studies. WICT is usually provided free of charge to users. The benefits enjoyed by pedestrians are intangible with a non-market nature. This research looks into the walkability performance of WICT by evaluating its benefits to pedestrians. A survey was carried out in Hong Kong for a WICT installable in smartphones. The Contingent Valuation was used to evaluate the non-market benefits quantitatively, employing ordinal regression. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) is estimated as the proxy of monetary value for the benefit enjoyed by individual users, which may be aggregated for a Cost-Benefits Analysis. This econometric approach intends to assist in decision making for continued investment in similar information systems of Smart City. Influential factors affecting WTP are also highlighted for targeting policies. Recommendations for city managers are proposed to establish a rational basis for planning smart cities.},

After the theoretical analysis of IoT and RFID technology under the background of smart city, the study discusses the information acquisition principle of RFID technology. Second, based on IoT and smart grid, the study takes the power equipment of power company A as an example, and puts forward the power inspection scheme, including the information required for inspection and the inspection of primary and secondary equipment. The specific contents are as follows: health assessment is carried out according to the real-time alarm of power equipment, and the control command is sent to the downstream control equipment to confirm the alarm information. Meantime, based on the alarm information of power equipment and related equipment, the expert analysis system is used for reasoning and analysis, and the RFID tag is used to supervise the inspectors to arrive at the site and inspect the situation according to the predetermined route. The temperature of the cable of power company A is measured under normal and hidden dangers, and the body insulation test is conducted on No. 1 main transformer. The results show that under normal operation, the cable temperature at each point is slightly different, which is basically about 40 °C. The temperature before the fourth point of the cable rises obviously, indicating that the fourth point has faulty. Over time, the more chemical molecules are detected in phase A. When phase B and phase C are tested on the same day, the difference of chemical molecular content is relatively small. It indicates that the chemical molecular content detected by chromatographic test of bulk insulating oil is normal. To sum up, smart power, as the objective need of urban intelligent development, is an important foundation of smart city.

The increase in supply-side energy production is one method of alleviating peak demand proposed by a few investigations. As peak loads last for a short time, additional installations might be required. In addition, facilities that store energy can be used to reduce peak demand. As a consequence of the previous investigation, interruptible load regulation was not taken into account in optimizing system performance. The regulation of interruptible loads can greatly reduce system peak loads in smart city and within the concept of microgrids (MGs). The study proposes an interruptible load scheduling (ILS) scheme that considers consumer subsidy rates with the goal of reducing the peak load of the MG and its operating prices. To this end, a digital twin is developed in which the consumer interruption load time and minimal per-day load decrease restrictions have been completely met in the scheme. The ILS model is solved using a combination of the Min-Conflict Algorithm and the Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested algorithm and the show the substantial benefits of the scheme in reducing peak loads and operating prices in smart cities.},

Among them, there is an obvious positive correlation between the EPI and the EADI of coal enterprises, and the EPI of coal enterprises has a positive impact on financial performance. The EADI of coal enterprises plays a partial mediating effect on the impact of EPI on financial performance. Additionally, the correlation analysis determines the correlation between EPI, EADI, and the financial performance of coal enterprises. Finally, the regression analysis is carried out again by replacing variables. The regression results are consistent with the previous conclusions, increasing the empirical results' robustness. It is concluded that improving the EADI will give enterprises better future financial data.},

Urban big data and data-driven technologies have played an increasingly important role in building smart and resilient cities that can respond rapidly to these perturbations. However, many existing approaches had limited capabilities for processing big data, which has led to time-consuming and costly decision-making. Thus, we develop a real-time data-driven analytical and geo-visual system to enable smart and rapid responses to urban extreme events. The system is built on ArcGIS’s GeoEvent Server and Apache Spark and processes streaming data from social media with high speed, massive volume, and multiple modalities. The system employs online topic modeling and domain-adaptive sentiment analysis to track small-scale, undefined events, visualizes their spatial and semantic dynamics, and provides early alerts for crises and emergencies via an interactive online GIS platform. The proposed system has been applied during a large-scale hurricane and demonstrated effectiveness and agility in tracking and reporting emerging small-scale crises. The developed system can be applied in various urban scenarios to enable timely situation awareness and rapid response. This research contributes to the smart city safety and building rapidity of resilient cities.},

 abstract = {Fast-growing smart city applications, such as smart delivery, smart community, and smart health, are generating big data that are widely distributed on the internet. IoT (Internet of Things) systems are at the centre of smart city applications, as traditional cloud computing is insufficient for satisfying the critical requirements of smart IoT systems. Due to the nature of smart city applications, massive IoT data may contain sensitive information; hence, various privacy-preserving methods, such as anonymity, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, have been utilised over the years. Furthermore, limited concern has been given to the resource consumption for data privacy-preserving in edge computing environments, which are resource-constrained when compared with cloud data centres. In particular, differential privacy (DP) has been an effective privacy-preserving method in the edge computing environment. However, there is no dedicated study on DP technology with a focus on smart city applications in the edge computing environment. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive study on DP in edge computing-based smart city applications, covering various aspects, such as privacy models, research methods, mechanisms, and applications. Our study focuses on five areas of data privacy, including data transmitting privacy, data processing privacy, data model training privacy, data publishing privacy, and location privacy. In addition, we investigate many potential applications of DP in smart city application scenarios. Finally, future directions of DP in edge computing are envisaged. We hope this study can be a useful roadmap for researchers and practitioners in edge computing enable smart city applications.},

 abstract = {The combination of low-carbon electricity and electric vehicles brings considerable economic and environmental benefits but also introduces challenges due to the complexity and uncertainty of system synergies in smart cities. To fully exploit the advantages of photovoltaic power generation and electric vehicles and to release the potential of electric vehicles as distributed energy storage facilities, this paper develops a multi-objective robust optimization framework that accounts for the benefits of multiple parties of smart charging and discharging systems and depicts a bounded uncertainty set based on partial statistical information from real data. The original model is scalarized and linearized using efficient methods such as max-ordering scalarization and the robust augmented weighted Tchebycheff to facilitate the solution. Moreover, a smart charging and discharging scheduling strategy based on a convergent demand response strategy is proposed to achieve better demand-side management. A case study, based on real data from Car2go and the solar radiation intensity in Portland, Oregon, shows that (1) The methodological framework effectively addresses the smart scheduling issue that considers the interests of multiple parties in complex systems with uncertainty, in contrast to conventional methods. (2) The designed convergent demand response strategy promotes photovoltaic power generation and charging demand synergy and achieves regulation effects such as peak shaving and valley filling. (3) The proposed method and strategy yield good results in multiple aspects, such as charging costs, load regulation, and clean energy utilization, while enhancing the economic and environmental benefits.},

To fill this gap, we develop a new index system involving three dimensions of digital infrastructure, smart living, and digital economy. Moreover, compared with studies that use subjective weighting methods to rank the smartness of cities, we combine the Shannon entropy weighting method with three multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to show the objectiveness of the evaluation process. Through analyzing the quantitative data from nine cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China, we find that digital infrastructure is the most important first-level indicator, accounting for 46.92%, followed by the digital economy and smart life accounting for 32.48% and 20.60% respectively. More importantly, when the nine cities in the PRD region are ranked by three MCDM methods, the correlation between the results is over 90%, thus proving robustness. We contribute to the current smart city literature by enriching the components of the smart city index system, as well as evaluation methods. Our findings also guide decision-makers in formulating more targeted smart city construction plans.},

This study examines the nexus between smart infrastructure and carbon emission intensity (CI) in China, encompassing 251 cities from 2011 to 2019. The findings indicate that: (1) Every 1% improvement in smart infrastructure reduces carbon emission intensity by 0.2810%. This effect is significant only in more advantageous geographic locations and non-resource-dependent cities. (2) Panel threshold regression analysis demonstrates a nonlinear relationship between smart infrastructure and carbon intensity, showing a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend under different energy consumption levels. (3) Mechanism analyses show that smart infrastructure affects carbon intensity through technological innovation and agglomeration effects. (4) Smart infrastructure exerts spatial spillover effects on carbon intensity with substantial spatial decay effects.

 abstract = {The convergence of technology and the city is commonly referred to as the ‘smart city’. It is seen as a possible remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of the current common smart city practice.},

 abstract = {This study aims to develop a new optimization model in order to design and analyze a 100% renewable energy network. Two distinct smart energy systems are proposed: electrified and hydrogen cities, in which electricity and hydrogen are used to transfer energy from a variety of renewable sources to different energy demands (electricity, thermal energy, and hydrogen). The proposed optimization model includes minimizing the total annual cost as an objective function subject to various constraints that represent the features of the smart energy cities, such as different types of communities (urban and rural) and energy distribution methods (electricity and hydrogen grids). We then applied the proposed model to the design problem of a 100% RES energy network in Jeju Island, Korea. As a result, we identified the optimal system configuration and energy flow in each smart energy system and analyzed the major cost drivers in the levelized cost of energy of 0.43–0.65 $/kWh. Based on the results of the case study, we investigated the sensitivity of crucial factors such as the cost of the technology, the quantity and structure of the demand, and renewable sources potentials on the system configuration and economics. The global sensitivity analysis study provides comprehensive solutions for the design and operation of two smart energy systems in different locations and types of city.},

Existing road infrastructure systems fail to meet intelligent functional O&M requirements since they do not incorporate a unified method to organize and integrate road life-cycle spatio-temporal data. Capitalizing on the developments in AEC (Architecture, Engineering & Construction) and IS fields, this paper proposes a solution (ICT Artifact) for achieving urban road intelligent O&M following the Design Science Research (DSR) framework. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) proposed method for organizing, collecting and fusing spatio-temporal data of the road’s entire life cycle, based on extended COBie standard to facilitate the linking and interoperability of multi-source heterogeneous data; (2) new Road Operation and Maintenance Functional Requirements (ROMFR) from the perspective of smart cities, which provide a complete definition of road intelligent O&M functional requirements; and (3) based on ROMFR and a new generation of information technologies, the design and implementation of a system named RIOMS (Road intelligent operation and maintenance system) that supports the intelligent functional requirements. The proposed solution has been applied to Yanggao Road (Pudong New Area, Shanghai) as a case study to demonstrate its feasibility and validity. Specifically, the proposed ICT artifact has been utilized in handling typical scenarios of road O&M and its effectiveness has been assessed through survey questionnaire and smart city assessment system.},

Activated carbon fiber has a strong adsorption capacity due to its large specific surface area, and can adsorb and remove organic matter in water, including some carcinogenic or toxic macro-aromatic substances. Physical adsorption is caused by electrostatic interaction between the surface molecules of the adsorbent and the adsorbate molecules, which is characterized by adsorption without selectivity. Chemical adsorption is due to the chemical bonding between the two molecules, forming a strong chemical bond and also the surface complex. Chemical adsorption has the certain selectivity, generally monolayer adsorption. With the large increase in vehicle usage and the exhaust emissions from equipment such as oil-fired boilers, the pollution of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide gas has become an important issue in environmental management. Adsorption or catalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide is an important means of treatment. This paper integrates the smart city scenario to construct the novel scenario for the analysis and research. The simulation results prove the effectiveness.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT
The purpose of a Smart City is to solve its inherent problems while simultaneously reducing its expenditure and improving its quality of life. Through the 4th Industrial Revolution technology, the advantages of Smart City are estimated to overcome the city’s expenses with city platformization. While a city traditionally is the subject of creation and not consumption, a Smart City currently is the key industry in generating more than 60% of its GDP in value creation from a production viewpoint. Moreover, with the expansion of online-offline convergence, cities can grow without limitation on its size, where connectivity and innovation determine the inclination of the city’s benefit-cost curve. As a city platform is responsible for connectivity, its value drastically increases through the 4th Industrial Revolution’s O2O (online to offline convergence) platform. When a city reflects on its own as a Digital Twin in the Cloud and when complete information becomes accessible through citizen’s participation through smartphones (Edge), Self-organization takes place, an ideal linkage between the city and citizens. Cities go through the self-organizing process of complex adaptive systems like the human brain. This research proposes a future model of a “Self-organizing City,” and suggests implementing the Smart City model based on the Smart City Tech-Socio Model in implementing strategies.},

The new method can generate sufficient electricity to run the low-power facilities of the smart cities in real-time and provide enough power for further applications using energy storage devices. Unlike the current road energy harvesters, the new harvester has a compact design, negligible mismatch risk between the components, and is more compatible with high-speed roadways. It can be used as road rumbles, transverse rumbles, or smooth speed bumps with a minimal vertical displacement of a maximum of 25 mm. It is shown that the harvester can illuminate LED light bulbs of 2 W at a displacement of 18 mm, which is compatible with the required depth of road rumbles. This power generation level satisfies sensors and IoT requirements and can also be stored for large-scale applications.},

People use multiple scientific advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for data acquisition and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for big data analytics to enhance the integration and sharing of data and optimize the basic standards of smart cities. Past few years, the concept behind the Internet of Things has been a major research topic in the development of smart cities, education, industry, and commerce. Services and applications of IoT are the major factors for creating a sustainable urban life that is employed by smart cities. The stakeholders of smart cities become more aware, efficient, and interactive using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in IoT. The applications of smart cities based on IoT have been increased in number which leads to production and increase in the amount of data and its processing. Moreover, the city stakeholders and governments take prior actions/precautions for processing the collected data from the IoT devices and predicting the future consequences for securing a sustainable environment. Artificial Intelligence is one of the key research techniques which several researchers have analysed and proved to be the best in improving the performance of detecting fire hazard in smart cities. In this research, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (R-LSTM-NN) is proposed for prediction of big data that are collected from smart cities based on IoT. Moreover, the proposed model mainly concentrates in predicting the fire hazard values that gathered from smart cities using IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique proves to be better when compared with other existing techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The proposed model detects the fire outbreak with a 98.4% of accuracy that having 0.14% of minimal error rate. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used for various prediction problems that are faced by smart cities.},

Firstly, we consider the influence of item attributes on user scoring. Naive Bayesian classifier is used to score unrated items, which can effectively fill in the missing values in the score matrix and solve the problem of data sparsity. Secondly, to ensure sustainable recommendations for uncertain goals, the three-way decisions is introduced into the collaborative filtering recommendation system, three-way recommendation rules are formulated, and 3NBCFR is constructed. Finally, the model is applied to the movie recommendation system. The experiment on Movielens shows that compared with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, 3NBCFR algorithm reduces the recommendation cost and improves the recommendation quality.

Based on the development realities of cities in China, this study arranged an in-depth analysis of the current literature and policies and established an evaluation system with five dimensions and 30 indicators. The entropy method and TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) were comprehensively applied to evaluate 15 new first-tier cities in China. The study results demonstrated that these 15 new first-tier cities still had a relatively low smart level, and the gaps among different cities were significant. Because of the differences in the emphasis of the smart city construction of various cities, their performances under different dimensions were widely divergent. Among the five dimensions, smart infrastructure, economy and life had poor performance compared with smart governance and the environment. In addition, some recommendations were initiated to boost the construction of smart cities in China, including accelerated construction for new infrastructure, more emphasis on the digital economy, acceleration in the development of important mechanisms, etc.},

 abstract = {To systematically adjust and coordinate interest conflicts, it is necessary to identify the influencing factors of interest conflicts comprehensively and accurately. Based on theoretical and practical research, this paper initially screened 52 factors affecting the interest conflict in the construction of smart city PPP projects, and then conducted expert interviews and questionnaire analysis to adjust and revise the index system, and finally formed 27 relevant index systems. In order to further identify the key influencing factors and clarify the importance of the factors, the interval gray number-DEMETAL method is used to identify the key factors that induce multiple interest conflicts in the construction of smart city PPP projects to enhance the identification effect. The research shows that: the complexity of the project, the comprehensive quality of project personnel, and the differences in ideological and cultural concepts have become the main factors. Project social benefit, project quality compliance rate, project profit rate or rate of return become the most important result factors. Government behavior is the primary influence and restriction of the interest conflict in the construction of smart city PPP projects. In addition, interest conflicts are closely related to other project stakeholders, especially the private sector, social capital, and public behavior. Therefore, the government's decision-making behavior and incentive and restraint mechanism must first examine the interests of stakeholders and their behavior strategies, especially the behavior evolution trend under the government's incentive and restraint mechanism, which implement a flexible incentive and restraint mechanism.},

 abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, demand for renewable energies has increased significantly. Among all sources of renewable energy, tidal energy is one of the most efficient. In order to accurately simulate and predict tidal current (TC), a novel two-stage methodology is suggested in this paper which not only can benefit the smart cities, but also can help for a more fitting landscape design in offshore areas. The integration of digital twin technology in landscape planning facilitates a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy systems in smart cities, enabling proactive decision-making and sustainable development strategies. To extract the most desirable characteristics from the dataset measuring TC speed and direction, the suggested method uses a unique fuzzy feature selection (FFS) technique. The Long short-term memory (LSTM) is further trained for precise prediction using the chosen characteristics. In order to improve the performance of the LSTM, an evolutionary optimization technique is developed to train the parameters of the proposed model to reach the best training objectives. The efficiency and precision of the model are evaluated using real tidal data from the Qinhuangdao beach. The outcomes demonstrate the proposed model's suitable performance and excellent precision in contrast to other well-known techniques like shallow NNs and well-known linear techniques.},

 abstract = {Summary
5G has taken off at a brisk speed over the years, bringing significant benefits to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wireless sensor nodes. The launching of 5G technology provides an excellent opportunity for the faster development of smart cities. Nanogenerators (NGs) have been widely demonstrated as sustainable power sources and self-powered active sensors. The last 15 years of research on NGs have revealed that it can contribute to the digitalization of smart city services, such as localized renewable energy supplies, intelligent transportation, smart vehicles, and digital healthcare applications. The integration of novel NG technology in smart cities will solve problems pertinent to sustainable power sources for decentralized IoT devices and provide pathways for realizing self-powered active sensing systems. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive review of current research on NGs’ applications in different sectors of a smart city. More importantly, we will show how NGs can be a game changer in the development of smart cities under 5G services and how the usage of NGs can boost the convenience of city dwellers. Our aim is to draw more attention to NG applications in the digitalization of smart cities and provide a guideline for applying smart concepts in future urban planning.},

To this end, the price data of rental housing in Hefei in 2022 were hereby collected to build a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, and the mechanism of various factors on the price of rental housing in Hefei was discussed. Spatial correlation analysis revealed a notable autocorrelation of rental housing prices in Hefei, exhibiting a distribution pattern of decreasing values from the city center outward. Besides, the impact of 13 factors on house rent was examined. Overall, factors such as building area, proximity to wet markets, and distance from the top three hospitals were demonstrated to exert the most significant influence on rental housing prices in Hefei. The decision-making of smart cities needs to be scientifically analyzed to find out the factors affecting the price of rental housing in the region, and the research conclusions can provide certain references for urban decision-makers in the overall management of urban resources and targeted solutions to regional housing rental and other issues.},

 abstract = {The phenomenon of shrinking and aging populations has profound implications for socioeconomic sustainability and presents unique challenges for managing municipal solid waste (MSW). These challenges have yet to be comprehensively understood thus far. In this study, we focus on the Circum-Bohai-Sea area in China (CBS) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of MSW generation under the population shrinking and aging. Results showed that the MSW growth rate reduced from 3.2% (2011–2015) to 1.6% (2016–2020) with population shrinking and aging. Geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) revealed that disposable personal income and total population are the predominant drivers of MSW growth. In contrast, the population change rate and the proportion of elderly were the key factors for MSW reduction. Urban MSW reduction exhibited higher sensitivity to population shrinking, resulting in a 141.6% greater reduction compared to rural MSW for every 1% population shrinking. Conversely, rural MSW reduction displayed a greater response to population aging, with a 19.7% reduction more than urban MSW for every 1% increase in the proportion of the elderly. Based on scenario analysis, the smart city development will curb population shrinking (7.6%), while increasing the well-being, life expectancy, and population share of the elderly (3.4%). Future population shrinking and aging is expected to contribute to the growth of MSW, and this trend is further amplified by the development of smart city. However, smart city development led to MSW reduction overall with an MSW amount of 76.8 Mt (7.5% lower than in the business-as-usual scenario) by 2040, mainly attributed to smart sanitation technology. This study offers valuable insights for decision-makers in MSW management, not only in China but also for other countries grappling with population regression challenges.},

However, despite the recent large-scale development of smart cities in China, it is still uncertain whether smart cities could effectively promote urban resilience. Exploiting the quasi-experimental nature of smart city development in China, this paper uses DID and PSM-DID to determine their impact on urban resilience. Four aspects of urban resilience are analyzed: economic resilience, social resilience, ecological resilience, and infrastructure resilience. The results show that the development of smart cities can improve social resilience considerably without any obvious effect on economic and ecological resilience and even negatively affect infrastructure resilience; the distribution effect, technological effect, and structural effect are important mechanisms for smart cities to influence urban resilience; and smart cities that have a sound industrial structure, enough good-quality companies, large size, and a large pool of highly-skilled labor are much more likely to be associated with a high level of urban resilience. Policy suggestions are also provided to promote the simultaneous improvement of smart cities and urban resilience, and hence help establish a new ‘urban resilience’ model.},

 abstract = {The Smart City is a hot topic at present. Pedestrian tracking and behavior analysis play an important role in Smart City system. Therefore, it is urgent to design an universal and robust multi-object tracking(MOT) algorithm. MOT is a challenging problem with numerous significant applications, including robot navigation, autonomous driving and pedestrian behavior analysis. Among the existing MOT approaches, MOT models which joint learning detection and Re-ID are attracting increasing attention. Subsequently, there is competition between these two tasks jointly in a network inevitably leading to performance degradation. To address these difficulties, we propose an adaptive joint learning approach, called UnionTrack, for MOT in this paper. It handles with the problem of uniform learning between tasks in online MOT system. Firstly, UnionTrack introduces a scale-aware attention network that aggregates features from different scales for object localization and learning of the corresponding discriminative embeddings. Secondly, a cross-correlation module is designed to construct task-relevant feature maps and interact adaptively during training detection and Re-ID. Then, we perform inter-frame correlation at different stages by using high and low confidence detection to avoid occlusions and backgrounds. UnionTrack is trained in an end-to-end manner to better accommodate the training between detection and Re-ID tasks. Finally, our proposed UnionTrack is compared with state-of-the-art methods in extensively experiments and detailed performance analysis is performed in MOT15, MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 which are all urban scene to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Looking forward to playing a role in the Smart City systems.},

Based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model and uncertain management theory, this study analyses the impact of the service quality of smart city system on citizen engagement in a public emergency. Data were collected in Chinese smart cities. Three valuable and novel results are identified. First, high-quality information content, highly reliable systems and highly responsive systems have a significant positive effect on citizens' continuous experiences, but not on citizens' immediate experiences. Second, both the immediate and continuous experiences of citizens have a significant positive effect on citizen engagement. Third, continuous experiences impose a full mediation effect between information content and citizen engagement, between reliability and citizen engagement and between responsiveness and citizen engagement. As its main contribution, this study focuses on the construction of a theoretical model. Based on this model, smart city managers can understand citizens' reactions in public emergencies from stimulation to experience and their behaviours in relation to smart city services.},

By applying HDSC mechanism in investigating Manchester's Smart City initiatives, the mechanism is proven effective to help decision makers understand the status quo of Smart City development in their urban context, based upon which the strength and weakness in the process of HDSC development can be drawn out. Consequently, Smart City blueprint can be better achieved towards a happiness-driven direction via dynamic assessment and adjustment.},

We argue that smart city app artifacts are linked to citizens’ psychological, social, and political empowerment, and empowerment, in turn, shapes citizens' satisfaction with both the smart city technology and government. Using Jakarta's smart city app Qlue as the research context, we explore how Qlue enhances citizens' empowerment based on survey data from 358 users. The results verified that the app's IT artifacts, especially external properties such as addressability, sensibility, communicability, and associability, play a crucial role in citizen empowerment, leading to higher psychological, social, and political empowerment. Internal properties are related to psychological empowerment only, giving citizens more feelings of control with its programmability, traceability, and memorability features. Empowered citizens, in turn, are generally more satisfied with both the App and the government.},

 abstract = {China, renowned for being one of the world's largest smart city testing fields, has witnessed the emergence of numerous smart cities. Existing publications highlight the diversity in smart city development, wherein cities with different contexts and institutional factors exhibit distinct characteristics. To delve deeper into this subject, we employed a mixed methods approach to classify 49 Chinese smart cities and subsequently developed a typology for Chinese smart cities in this study. Our methodology involved three steps. Initially, we devised a classification framework based on the input-throughput-output model and conducted content analysis to identify the characteristics of the 49 cities. Subsequently, we utilized a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering analysis to categorize these cases. Finally, we formulated a typology consisting of five types of Chinese smart cities: knowledge-technocratic smart cities, holistic smart cities, green smart cities, equipment-technocratic smart cities, and emerging smart cities. The findings reveal that different smart city types are characterized by distinct features and priorities in input, throughput, and output. The development of smart cities should comprehensively consider and respect the local urban contexts and the challenges they present. The insights from this study hold relevance for both policymakers and academic researchers.},

 abstract = {The rapid urbanization and increasing energy demands necessitate innovative solutions for efficient energy governance in smart cities from the social science perspective. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for Urban Energy Governance (UEG), focusing on the collaboration of three urban systems in energy exchange considering social and environmental impacts. To address the challenges of security, energy forecasting, and nonlinear optimization, we employ advanced techniques, including blockchain technology, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for accurate energy forecasting, and a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for solving the proposed nonlinear optimization problem. The utilization of blockchain enhances the security and transparency of energy transactions, fostering trust among stakeholders. Additionally, LSTM models leverage historical data to provide precise energy forecasts, optimizing resource utilization. The modified PSO algorithm tailors optimization to the specific nonlinearities of the proposed problem, ensuring efficient and effective decision-making in the context of Urban Energy Governance. Through a multi-faceted approach, our framework contributes to the advancement of smart city systems, providing a secure, forecast-driven, and optimized energy governance model for sustainable urban development.},
