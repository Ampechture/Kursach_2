abstract = {Recently, the concept of the smart city has gained growing popularity. As cities worldwide have set the aim to harness digital technologies to their development, increasing focus came to lie on the potential challenges and concerns related to data-driven urban practices. In the existing literature, these challenges and concerns have been dominantly approached from a pragmatic approach based on the a priori assumed ‘goodness’ of the smart city; for a small group of critics, the very notion of the smart city is questionable. This paper takes the middle-way by interrogating how municipal and civil society stakeholders problematize the challenges and concerns related to data-driven practices in five Dutch cities, and how they act on these concerns in practice. The lens of problematization posits that the ways of problematizing data-driven practices contribute to their actual enactment, and that this is an inherently political process. The case study shows that stakeholders do not only perceive practical challenges but are widely aware of and are (partly) pro-actively engaging with perceived normative-ethical and societal concerns, leading to different (sometimes inter-related) technological, legal/political, organizational, informative and participative strategies. Nonetheless, the explicit contestation of smart city policies through these strategies remains limited in scope. The paper argues that more research is needed to uncover the structural-institutional dynamics that facilitate and/or prevent the repoliticization of smart city projects.}

Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks. The benefits due to the expanded network access and enhanced connectivity between devices also intrinsically increase cybersecurity risks. Cyber attackers will be provided with additional digital targets; in addition, wireless and mobile network including the access channel infrastructure will be shared between independent services. To address these cybersecurity issues, this article presents the Blockchain Random Neural Network for Cybersecurity applications in a holistic digital and physical cybersecurity user and channel authentication methods. The user identity is kept secret as the neural weights codify the user information, although in case of cybersecurity breach, the confidential identity can be mined and the attacker identified. The proposed method therefore enables a decentralized authentication method. The validation results prove that the addition of the Blockchain Random Neural Network provides a user access control algorithm with increased cybersecurity resilience and decentralized user access and connectivity.}

Smooth functioning of smart cities is conditioned on seamless communication between users and devices. Smart devices equipped with biometric authentication can offer security as well as personalized experience to the end users. Currently, a number of smart devices employ face, fingerprint, and voice modalities for user verification. However, the biometric data acquired by these devices can be digitally manipulated or tampered with, that can compromise the security of the smart environment. Further, the preponderance of biometric data such as face and voice in social media applications, necessitates the validation of their integrity.

Many Ambient Assisted Living systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes. Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for Android Apps. The proposed algorithms can improve the privacy protection of Ambient Assisted Living App users in smart cities and relieve them through cognitive offloading.}

abstract = {A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical process, person, place, system or device. Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.}

By considering wireless signal transmission from various mobile nodes in a simulation testbed mean square error analysis and probability of error are obtained in matrix laboratory(MATLAB)software. Simulation results show that mean square error analysis of LOS is by far improved in 3 dB in comparison to NLOS environment for single antenna technology specified by single input single output(SISO) and multiantenna technology represented in the form of multiple input multiple output(MIMO) technology. Further, probability of error (Pe) of SISO and MIMO systems are also analysed and similar improvement in performance is also obtained for baseband analysis of smart cities. The obtained simulation results, can contribute to further research in upcoming 5G and 6G systems relating to wireless products.}

abstract = {Owing to some special characteristics and features, blockchain is a very useful technique that can securely organize diverse devices in a smart city. It finds wide applications, especially in distributed environments, where entities such as wireless sensors need to be certain of the authenticity of the server. As contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have not been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the post-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from quantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction capacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded. Thus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm for security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used to not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to existing classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining. Meanwhile, an identity-based post-quantum signature is embedded into a transaction process to construct lightweight transactions. Subsequently, we provide a detailed description on the execution of the post-quantum lightweight transaction in a blockchain. Overall, this work can help enrich the research on future post-quantum blockchain and support the construction or architecture of emerging blockchain-based smart cities.}

In the water sector, smart water metering infrastructure has been positioned to alleviate key water management and water access challenges. To date, there has been little empirical investigation into how it is deployed, implemented and experienced by end-users in urban Global South contexts. This study uses a socio-technical lens to address this evidence gap with a mixed-method empirical case study from urban Ghana. Results show smart meters as a utility-centric socio-technical infrastructure, with the water utility having designed the customer out of its current rollout approach. The utility's approach is an incremental one that is responsive to the existing context yet provides limited upgrades and impacts to existing systems and actors. We demonstrate how smart meters are much more than neutral, often shaped through everyday realities but have also become new junctions of friction, mistrust and scepticism between the utility and users. In exploring these issues, we raise questions about the smart metering agenda and related digital transformation policies of utilities, highlighting directions towards more customer-centric design and implementation in the design and deployment of digital water infrastructure.}

Therefore, considering the significance of sensor data in this guided vehicle environment, this article introduces Responder-dependent Additive Information Fusion (RAIF) scheme. This scheme observes the responding sensor information for determining the achievement level of the target endorsed for the guided vehicle. The multi-instance sensor information is gathered from the Internet of Things (IoT) based connected devise. The timely responding sensors and its data are correlated with the previous history for improving the precision of navigation of the guided vehicles. This scheme relies on classification machine learning for identifying remitting and un-remitting instances based on correlation for information fusion.

New Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are changing the way in which the world works. These technologies provide new tools to face the issues of contemporary society (poverty, migrations, sustainable development challenges, governance, etc.). Among them, blockchain emerge as a disruptive technology able to make things in a completely different and innovative way. They can provide solutions where before there were none. Recently, these technologies have become subject of intense research and development by industry and academia. In consequence, a large amount of interesting works is published in many areas, proposing solutions, services, frameworks and applications based on these technologies. The research focusing on the previous challenges are especially interesting in current society. However, the proposals arrive at higher speed than society can assimilate them, and sometimes they are not properly exploited. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the blockchain technology to identify what are its key attributes that enable to successfully address the social challenges. The review has been conducted from three point of views: service-delivery, resource-management and city-administration, and has been focused on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, in order to cover the full agenda of current social issues. The contributions of this work are an exhaustive compilation of the existing research on blockchain technology to tackle the social challenges from several angles, and the identification of the key features and the conditioning factors of the practical applicability of the technology.}

Discourses on “smart urbanism” are being discussed and lead to the proposal of changes to urban models and reference systems through local anchoring, a rethinking of governance, the participation of citizens, and the strengthening of their capacities (“smart citizens”). In this contribution, we observed the path of learning cities promoted by UNESCO, which, as the French examples (Clermont-Ferrand) have shown us, is decisive for the “good life”. We can see the emergence of a coexistence between “smart city” and “learning city”, which contributes to the management of urban transitions and can lead to functional complementarities and increase the capacity for adaptation and resilience. Hybridization creates tensions and controversies but also helps with regulations and coordination. It encourages citizen participation, collective dynamics, and lifelong learning but also new forms of local anchoring, relationships with the environment and social interactions favorable to the quality of life.}

abstract = {The amalgamation of Internet of Things (IoT) and communication systems within Smart Grid Control Systems (SGCS) has amplified their susceptibility to cyber-attacks, posing a significant threat. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs), originally designed for securing IT systems, exhibit limitations in SGCS due to reliance on predefined structures and training on specific cyber-attack patterns. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework to establish balanced representations for the inherently asymmetric SGCS datasets. These representations are seamlessly integrated into a dedicated DL-based model for attack detection within the SGCS environment. Utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), the model identifies novel cyber-attack representations. Performance evaluation through 10-fold cross-validation on two real SGCS datasets reveals the proposed approach's superiority over traditional methods like Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Additionally, the generalized method can be effortlessly implemented in existing SGCS infrastructures with minimal complexity. This study introduces a novel cybersecurity enhancement method for Smart Grid Control Systems by integrating a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin with a deep learning-based IDS. This approach intricately models both physical and cyber components, facilitating real-time training and fine-tuning of the intrusion detection model using synthetic cyber threats. The digital twin undergoes rigorous testing to assess the model's effectiveness, employing scenario analyses to identify vulnerabilities and formulate response strategies. The adaptive digital twin fosters a proactive cybersecurity stance by implementing security measures such as access controls and cyber range simulation. Real-time monitoring, analytics, and stakeholder collaboration enhance incident response readiness. The lifecycle simulation, spanning from model development to deployment, ensures alignment with regulations. This integrated approach not only detects but proactively responds to cyber threats, fortifying Smart Grid Control Systems against evolving risks.}

abstract = {Smart city projects stand out for including a wide array of communication systems and heterogeneous technologies operated by multiple entities that collect data from citizens in very different ways. Basically, these projects involve three main actors that may have conflicting interests regarding the ownership and exploitation of the generated data: public administrations, service providers and citizens. Nevertheless, this is not a new problem. Actually, the most popular communication systems on the Internet, such as social networks, often have issues of this kind that can become highly visible in the press, especially when service providers, who commonly store data generated by their users via centralized models, have a security issue leading to a massive data leak, or when providers take advantage of their dominant position to exploit data improperly or sell it to third parties. This paper proposes an architecture to create user-centric data management applications for communications in smart cities where data is stored and managed in a decentralized way to reduce dependency on service providers and return control of the data to the different actors involved in the communications. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed architecture is implemented, using Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the main tools, to demonstrate its feasibility, show concrete protocols, and discuss the proposal on an empirical basis.}

abstract = {There has been a surge in telecommunication network deployments across the globe to facilitate advanced communication infrastructure which is necessary for smart cities. This has in turn increased the power consumption of telecommunication networks, thus motivating the need to adopt green energy solutions like solar energy to power them. Base stations (BSs) are the primary entities contributing to the power consumption in the telecommunication network. To efficiently deploy solar powered base stations, it is imperative to optimally provision them with appropriate Photo Voltaic (PV) panel and battery resources. The ultimate goal of such dimensioning is to provide best possible quality of service (QoS) to the consumers while maintaining an optimal cost of deployment and operation. Both PV panels and the batteries are major contributors while calculating the overall cost of deployment and operation for a solar powered BSs. Therefore an accurate calculation of battery lifetime with respect to different PV panel dimension and battery sizes is an important step in cost optimal resource provisioning for the solar powered BSs. This issue is addressed in this paper by presenting an analytical scheme to estimate the battery lifetime for a particular resource provisioning of PV panels and batteries. This is then used for evaluating the cost-optimal photo-voltaic panel dimensions and battery size for the base station with acceptable limit of outage probability. The proposed methodology would find great relevance in developing energy efficient sustainable telecommunication networks for upcoming smart cities.}

This article aims to design an early fire detection system to get rid of fire events using the concept of senor network and UAV’s technology. The architecture proposal is based on sensors for monitoring environmental parameters and to process the information through sensors and IoT application. The proposed fire detection system is the combination of wireless sensor technologies, UAVs, and cloud computing. Some image processing techniques are also integrated into the proposed fire detection system to identify the fire event with better accuracy and used as an integrated solution. To improve the true detection rate, rules are also designed. The simulation results of the proposed fire detection system are compared with several existing methods. It is observed that the proposed system has a higher fire detection rate to improve the true detection of forest fire from 95 to 98 percent.}

Smart city applications have a critical role in improving public services quality, and security is their main weakness. Hence, a systematic multidimensional approach is required for data storage and security. Routing attacks, especially sinkholes, can direct the network data to an attacker and can also disrupt the network equipment. Communications need to be with integrity, confidentiality, and authentication. So, the smart city and urban Internet of Things (IoT) network, must be secure, and the data exchanged across the network must be encrypted. To solve these challenges, a new protocol using CLustering Multi-Layer Security Protocol (CL-MLSP) with AODV has been proposed. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is aligned with the proposed protocol for encryption and decryption. The shortest path is obtained by the clustering method based on energy, mobility, and distribution for each node. Ns2 is used to evaluate the CL-MLSP performance, and the parameters are network lifetime, latency, packet loss, and security. We have compared CL-MLPS with ECP-AODV, Probe, and Multi-Path. The proposed method superiority rates in energy consumption, drop rate, delay, throughput, and security performance are 6.54%, 12.87%, 8.12%, 9.46%, respectively.}

Whilst much theorizing and conceptualization have made concrete advancements in establishing the research agenda for this topic, case-based research on citizens’ perceptions of smart city initiatives is still scarce. Through examination of surveys and content analysis of plans and documents exploring smart city development in Saint Petersburg, this paper looks at differences between perceptions of authorities and citizens in local government initiatives towards smart city development in the referred city. Results suggest that there seems to be a gap in the way citizens and sponsors – authorities, in particular – understand smart city endeavors. In St. Petersburg, Russia, the gap compromises levels of participation and engagement in smart city initiatives despite high levels of engagement with traditional e-government technologies. Such circumstances may reflect an expectation-results divide that has been described in collaborative e-government literature, but is yet to receive empirical scrutiny in the context of smart city development. The paper ends by critically examining risks of ignoring perceptions from different stakeholders and not monitoring gaps such as the one examined in this practical case.}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used as Air Taxis (ATs) in SSC, bypassing traffic congestion. However, the integration of ATs in SSC is very challenging, seeking high safety and security for the passengers. Such an autonomous system carries vital information, becoming vulnerable to furtive False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA), which have not received considerable research attention heretofore. To address the problem, this article establishes a model-free FDIA employing a recurrent deterministic policy gradient to exploit the data integrity of AT’s sensors, leading to collisions. Thereafter, a decentralized threat detection model, a deep optimized attentive federated aggregation learning is deployed, to counteract the threat and protect the data privacy of each AT. The suggested method is parallelizable and can accurately detect an unobservable FDIA in a distributed manner. The simulation findings show that the proposed attack–defense model investigates in-depth system’s vulnerabilities and tackles the risk with a higher detection rate and reduced computing cost while maintaining privacy preservation that surpasses modern approaches.}

Through the tool, users can readily assess the impact of green infrastructure investments on the delivery of a selection of ecosystem services in the early stages of a project. Furthermore, the tool provides a standardised assessment of cultural ecosystem services’ contributions, as well as offering a method to score spatial designs on the impact on habitat for biodiversity. Use of the tool is demonstrated using a pilot study in Kapelle, the Netherlands. The results set out an overview of the impacts of the spatial design on estimated ecosystem service delivery. They also show the tool’s potential to add value in early project stages and as a planning and design tool, helping to maximise the benefits that can be achieved through green infrastructure design. Complementing these arguments with ball-park estimations on green infrastructure costs, the Nature Smart Cities Business Model aims to offer public sector officers the means to create a business case for green infrastructure measures, facilitating the translation from strategies to actual plans, thus benefitting green infrastructure implementation in the public realm.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the main component in the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities to sense our environment, gather essential and meaningful data, and forward it to the base station (BS). Nowadays, IoT utilizes WSN as a necessary platform for sensing and communication of the data. One of the main strategies to minimize consumption of energy in a WSN with highly dense sensors is to maximize sleeping sensors at each time. This way implies to schedule the activity of sensors, i.e. determining when a sensor node is kept idle (sleep mode) and when a sensor node is activated to sense environment (active mode). Due to heterogeneity of the sensor nodes in WSNs-based IoT for smart cities, one approach for scheduling the sensing activity is clustering the sensors into K mutually different subsets, so that every subset of sensors alone can cover all targets of the network. In this case, we can solve finding the maximum number of sensor subsets, or equivalently sensor covers problem, by conversion it to SET K-COVER problem. In this paper, an energy aware Grouping Memetic Algorithm (GMA) is proposed for solving the SET K-COVER problem. The proposed GMA varies in four general ways from any of the other evolutionary algorithms for solving the SET K-COVER problem. First, to transform solution structures linked to the SET K-COVER problem into chromosome genes, a new encoding scheme was being used. Second, specific genetic operators appropriate for the chromosomes are used, based on the encoding used. Third, to direct the search process in the solution space of the SET K-COVER problem, a novel proper fitness function is proposed. Fourth, a local improvement algorithm which uses a sensor dominance rule is proposed. This study, carried out detailed experiments of different numbers of targets and different numbers of sensors in WSNs to assess the proposed algorithm. In several instances of the problem, the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm works considerably better in terms of solution quality than many other heuristics and evolutionary algorithms and significantly outperformed the evolutionary algorithms in terms of runtime, suggesting the usefulness of the proposed algorithm to increase the lifetime of WSN in IoT and smart cities.}

The ETDS consists of a blockchain-based decentralized access control system and a commutative encryption and fingerprint system. ETDS not only implements data access authorization in a decentralized environment but also implements an efficient accountability mechanism for data leakages. Unlike other accountability solutions, the data accountability mechanism of ETDS is implemented in scenarios where the data and the applications are decoupled. This paper demonstrates the security and availability of ETDS through security analysis and an efficiency evaluation.}

Like any computerized service system, they generate voluminous and complex data that the use of which is essentially limited to the management and operation of the system. The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station. For this, we propose an approach that integrates in these systems both the new IoT for smart city technologies and machine learning in order to facilitate the task of management, availability and profitability. In addition, we propose an automatic management system capable of predicting the number of bikes shared per hour, day or month by taking several dynamic parameters.

Two elements need to be considered for smart cities to be successful. First, citizens must participate in the design of the smart city to take advantage of their ideas so that the smart city answers their real needs. Secondly, each city has its own unique characteristics that need to be considered to design a citizen participation strategy truly tailored and adapted to their respective context. In line with these two considerations, the goal of this paper is to identify the context factors that impact citizen participation strategies in smart cities. In order to reach that goal, we performed a qualitative case study of two cities that strive to be smart: Namur (Belgium) and Linköping (Sweden). This analysis allows us to understand how participation is implemented in two different cases and to infer the context factors that impact the respective strategies. Five context-factors have been identified in this study: the smart city consideration, the drivers for participation, the degree of centralization, the legal requirements, and the citizens’ characteristics. By identifying these factors, we can derive context-dependent recommendations about citizen participation for smart cities. These recommendations are then applied to the case of Brussels in Belgium.}

The proposed optimization model includes minimizing the total annual cost as an objective function subject to various constraints that represent the features of the smart energy cities, such as different types of communities (urban and rural) and energy distribution methods (electricity and hydrogen grids). We then applied the proposed model to the design problem of a 100% RES energy network in Jeju Island, Korea. As a result, we identified the optimal system configuration and energy flow in each smart energy system and analyzed the major cost drivers in the levelized cost of energy of 0.43–0.65 $/kWh. Based on the results of the case study, we investigated the sensitivity of crucial factors such as the cost of the technology, the quantity and structure of the demand, and renewable sources potentials on the system configuration and economics.

Recent data show that global temperatures are already about 1.1°C above preindustrial levels and the window to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C is rapidly closing. Cities account for over 70% of global CO2 emissions, indicating their significance for achieving climate stabilization targets. Recognizing this, many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and strategies to contribute to climate change mitigation. In the meantime, smart technologies are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in many cities around the world and governments and local authorities have used this as an opportunity to develop and implement smart city programs. While the impacts of smart city programs on urban CO2 emissions are not yet fully examined, it is hoped that they can contribute to meeting climate change mitigation targets. Through text mining of bibliometric data archived in the Web of Science, this chapter seeks to provide an overview of existing research at the intersection of climate change mitigation and smart city solutions and technologies. The chapter aims to discuss actual and potential contributions of smart city solutions, related to various urban systems, to climate change mitigation. Based on outputs of bibliometric analysis (term co-occurrence) obtained from the VOSviewer software tool, issues related to urban planning, buildings, transportation, waste management, energy and water resource, economy, urban infrastructure, and urban governance are discussed. It is argued that smart solutions and technologies have high potential to contribute to climate change mitigation. They can also provide co-benefits for climate change adaptation and sustainable development. However, appropriate planning and regulating measures are needed to avoid potential trade-offs and rebound effects. Such effects and trade-offs have also been discussed. Further, the need for integrated systems that accommodate different urban sectors is highlighted.}

abstract = {In the smart city environment, parking vehicle management is an essential requirement for citizens in the current situation because every city is rapidly growing as a crowded environment. Specific planning, operation, and thinking can address this problem with the Internet of things (IoT) and Information Communication Technologies (ICT). Existing research provides various solutions and methods for parking systems in the smart city. However, smart parking has many challenges, such as centralization, communication bandwidth, energy efficiency, integrity, security, and privacy. Inspired by Blockchain and AI technology, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Secure Framework for Energy-Efficient Smart Parking in Sustainable City Environment. The transport layer implements the ECC algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the parking zones data for secure communication. The RSU-based-Blockchain network offers authentication and verification of data at the security layer in a distributed manner. Virtualization technology is used for data storage and provides an energy-efficient environment using virtual machines. With Deep LSTM networks, we analyze the parking zone's data and offer the best parking space to the drivers with the best location and timing. We evaluate the proposed architecture using quantitative, qualitative analysis and provide the driver's best parking space.}

The search revealed that social media and smart tourism are the themes with the greatest potential; sustainable cities, local destination development, changes in tourist behavior, and tourists’ risk perception are underdeveloped streams with enormous relevance and growth in the new normal. Research on the effects of COVID-19 on citizen health and its economic impact on the tourism industry and cities are intersectional and highly developed topics, although of little relevance. The current study also identifies the challenges of destination research for planners and proposes future research directions. Consequently, this paper contributes to the existing literature on COVID-19 and sustainable cities, as it develops a critical examination of the extant research and points out the research gaps that must be filled by future studies.}

Multiple issues related to these concepts have been studied in the literature, and there are also many tools and indicator sets for assessing the smartness or resilience of cities, neighborhoods, communities, and projects. However, limited efforts have been made to probe interactions between smart cities and urban resilience. In particular, there is a lack of tools and indicator sets for assessing the contributions of smart city solutions and technologies to urban resilience. To fill this gap, in this chapter, we propose a set of indicators related to multiple dimensions of smart cities, namely, environment, economy, people, data, living, mobility, and governance. Overall, 98 indicators have been identified, and their potential linkages to resilience abilities are also highlighted and discussed. The proposed indicators can be used to develop tools for assessing the resilience of cities using smart city indicators. This could provide further opportunities for integrating the two concepts and contribute to developing resilient smart cities that facilitate addressing societal challenges, such as climate change, environmental degradation, and inequitable access to resources.}

The paper provides a perspective regarding the opportunity available in addressing the urban air quality management (UAQM) issues using smart city framework in the context of ‘urban computing’. Traditionally, UAQM has been built on sparse regulatory monitoring, enhanced with satellite data and forecast models. The ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, smartphones, social and cloud computing are reshaping urban conglomerates, worldwide. Cities can harness these ubiquitous technologies in concert with traditional methods for betterment of air quality governance and to improve quality of life. This paper discusses the role of urban computing in UAQM through a review of scientific publications and ‘grey literature’ from technical reports of governments, international organizations and institutional websites. It provides an interdisciplinary knowledge repository on urban computing applications for air quality functions. It highlights the potential of integrated technologies in enabling data driven, strategic and real-time mitigation governance actions and helping citizens to take informed decisions. It recommends ‘fit for the purpose’ multitechnology framework for UAQM services in emerging smart cities.}

An ICT-enabled city is often referred to as a smart city. A distinction is made between "intelligent" or "smart" cities. It is a city that has been wired for information technology to be referred to as an "intelligent city." Sustainability is the ultimate goal of a smart city. As a result, performance analysis has become a crucial tool for planning and evaluating city development and projects, as well as assessing cities. City rankings are a hot topic right now, and people are paying more and more attention to them. New residents and investors alike can benefit from comparing cities. Aside from that, it can help cities assess their own strengths and weaknesses and devise development goals and strategies that will help them better fit into the urban system as a whole. Appropriate evaluation mechanisms and indicators are required for proper city comparison, requirement setting during planning phases, and project performance evaluation. This is also true when it comes to implementing smart city strategies and initiatives.}

In the context of Sharing Cities, an EU-funded programme aiming to deliver smart city solutions in areas such as citizen participation and infrastructure improvements of buildings and mobility, a prominent intervention has been the deployment and monitoring of a Digital Social Market (DSM) tool in Milan (Italy). The DSM allows cities to engage with residents and encourage sustainable behaviours by offering non-monetary rewards. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM approach to promote active travel (cycling and walking) by analysing the data collected through the app as well as through participant surveys. Our model results show that a broader engagement with the DSM app (number of claps to posts, number of posts made, non-monetary rewards earned by participating in non-travel events) is positively correlated with the monitored level of active travel. Lifestyles, attitudes, and social influence also explain the variability in cycling and walking. This highlights the importance of investigating these factors when replicating such initiatives on a large scale.}

A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of the current common smart city practice.}

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) proposed method for organizing, collecting and fusing spatio-temporal data of the road’s entire life cycle, based on extended COBie standard to facilitate the linking and interoperability of multi-source heterogeneous data; (2) new Road Operation and Maintenance Functional Requirements (ROMFR) from the perspective of smart cities, which provide a complete definition of road intelligent O&M functional requirements; and (3) based on ROMFR and a new generation of information technologies, the design and implementation of a system named RIOMS (Road intelligent operation and maintenance system) that supports the intelligent functional requirements. The proposed solution has been applied to Yanggao Road (Pudong New Area, Shanghai) as a case study to demonstrate its feasibility and validity. Specifically, the proposed ICT artifact has been utilized in handling typical scenarios of road O&M and its effectiveness has been assessed through survey questionnaire and smart city assessment system.}

abstract = {A smart city is a dynamic and sustainable urban system that provides a great quality of service to its residents by optimally managing its resources. In smart cities, low-frequency oscillations are a serious concern to the power system as they adversely affect system’s stability. Moreover, power system stabilizers are inefficient due to their fixed-parameter architecture. Flexible ac transmission system controller performs effective damping of low-frequency oscillations when provided with suitable supplementary damping control like a Static synchronous series compensator. In this context, the paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control for smart cities that uses the recurrent Gaussian membership function and recurrent wavelet neural network in antecedent and consequent parts respectively. The paper applies the gradient descent optimization with a back-propagation algorithm to update the parameters of suggested adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control. Simulations are performed on two test systems, both showing the effectiveness of the recommended control scheme as compared to traditional lead-lag control and artificial neuro-fuzzy Takagi Sugeno Kang control. Calculations of performance index for various fault scenarios lead to the conclusion that the control scheme can damp oscillations effectively and enhances the power system’s transient stability.}

Urban big data and data-driven technologies have played an increasingly important role in building smart and resilient cities that can respond rapidly to these perturbations. However, many existing approaches had limited capabilities for processing big data, which has led to time-consuming and costly decision-making. Thus, we develop a real-time data-driven analytical and geo-visual system to enable smart and rapid responses to urban extreme events. The system is built on ArcGIS’s GeoEvent Server and Apache Spark and processes streaming data from social media with high speed, massive volume, and multiple modalities. The system employs online topic modeling and domain-adaptive sentiment analysis to track small-scale, undefined events, visualizes their spatial and semantic dynamics, and provides early alerts for crises and emergencies via an interactive online GIS platform. The proposed system has been applied during a large-scale hurricane and demonstrated effectiveness and agility in tracking and reporting emerging small-scale crises. The developed system can be applied in various urban scenarios to enable timely situation awareness and rapid response. This research contributes to the smart city safety and building rapidity of resilient cities.}

abstract = {The accessibility of accurate location information for operators in mission-critical scenarios would considerably increase their mission success. In order to obtain precise location information, numerous algorithms and technologies have been suggested. These methods and systems show varying performances under different conditions, and with the help of machine learning techniques, their reliability can be enhanced dramatically. In this paper, we overview the state-of-the-art in emerging algorithms and technologies employing cognitive solutions in mission critical localization applications. We compare these algorithms in terms of different localization parameters such as scalability, power consumption, availability, service quality and accuracy. Consequently, this survey will assist researchers who are working in the area of RF-based localization to achieve better performance in mission critical scenarios that can be experienced in smart city applications.}

abstract = {In the quest for Smart City (SC) development, numerous examples of ‘good practices’ have circulated in national and international policy arenas. Learning from good practices elsewhere is a common approach for cities to initiate and develop SC policies of their own. Nevertheless, because of political, legal and cultural differences across countries and cities, policies will always be context dependent, and prosper under specific conditions. There is a vast literature on policy transfer and policy mobility, but much of it utilizes different concepts (i.e., policy translation, policy learning, and policy diffusion). Nonetheless, a critical omission they all share is limited concern for context-dependence and lack of prescriptive clues. Addressing both omissions would lead to a framework in which learning from good SC policy practices, formulating lessons, transferring them, and then adjusting them to fit the recipient's needs is taken up systematically in a stepwise manner. To develop a theoretical framework for Smart City adoption, this study brings together variegated existing literature under the heading ‘policy transplantation’ and synthesizes existing insights into a prescriptive procedure policymakers can follow. A systematic literature review is conducted to identify all key elements and sub-elements associated with SC policy transplantation, leading to a theoretical framework. This (prescriptive) theoretical framework is subsequently validated using an expert group and illustrated through a real-life case. The framework can be used as an analytical lens by researchers, but also constitutes a practical tool to guide policymakers aiming to use insights from good practices and implement them in line with their own contextual setting. Conducting contextual assessment before transplanting a SC policy is essential.}

At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network’s operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system’s characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework’s performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES. Results confirm that the developed LSTM-based attack detection model has a generalization ability to catch modern power grids’ dynamic behaviors, excelling current traditional approaches in the designed case studies and achieves accuracy higher than 90% in all experiments.}

Security is considered as one of the most important challenges facing IoT. Key distribution techniques are at the core of security provision and are critical components of any system in order to establish a secure connection between any two objects. In this paper a new Hierarchical Key Distribution (HKD) architecture and a set of Hierarchical Hybrid Key Distribution (H2KD) protocols are presented for IoT environment to support the provision of smart cities applications. The applicability of this protocols has been studied over HKD architecture and simulated using AVISPA tool and using Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic. The targeted features of designing the architecture and the protocols are supporting mobility, scalability, heterogeneity and supporting constrained nodes’ limited capabilities. The performance of H2KD set of protocols has been evaluated based on a quantitative measure of several performance metrics including the memory storage, the computation cost for the constraint nodes, the number of messages exchanged and needed to establish a new session key for a mobile node. Scalability and resilience of the proposed protocols have been also measured. Simulation results show that H2KD protocols are safe against various attacks. Moreover, the analysis results show that the H2KD reduces communication, computation, and the storage costs for constraint nodes by 51.5% compared with related protocols. Additionally, H2KD has been found to provide more scalability and resilience than rival protocols.}

For small and medium-sized cities, the cost of buying drone is too high, and renting drone is more cost-effective. However, the leasing transactions between government departments and drone leasing companies are faced with problems such as distrust, price disputes, and increased costs caused by third-party participation. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a multi-party secure and convenient transaction framework based on alliance blockchain, which helps to build trust between drone leasing companies and government departments without worrying about privacy leakage and transaction data tampering. In addition, an intelligent pricing strategy based on contract theory is designed, which can not only maximize the utility of government departments, but also encourage drone companies to actively participate. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed drone services transaction mechanism based on blockchain and intelligent pricing strategy is very effective.}

This study contributes to filling this gap. We start by identifying the potential sources of entrepreneurial opportunities that a medium-sized smart city may offer based on the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship. We then provide empirical evidence that the Smart City label has positively influenced the effective creation of new businesses. To this end, we examine 44 Spanish Smart City initiatives included and classified in the Smart City Index according to their smartness level. Our results confirm the relation between the Smart City label and the entrepreneurship rate. Moreover, they allow us to present some relevant considerations and implications concerning the maturing process of Smart City initiatives.

These characteristics are challenged in the academic literature, especially the technocentric approach and the central position of private companies. Moreover, the lack of proper conceptualisation pushes cities to claim themselves ‘smart’. Finally, there are few rigorous analytical or statistical analyses of the concept and its application to territories. Therefore, this paper studies how Belgian municipalities understand the concept of Smart Cities in 2016. Based on the groundwork of literature on Smart Cities and the results of a survey of 113 Belgian municipalities, a typology of four understandings of the Smart City (technological, societal, comprehensive and non-existent) is elaborated. The results also show that municipalities with no understanding of the Smart City concept or with a technical understanding are mostly located in small and rural municipalities. This could be a sign of rejection of the phenomenon in this context. Conversely, medium and large-sized municipalities mostly develop a societal or comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this study highlights a dichotomy of understanding and acceptance of the concept of the Smart City between peripheral (rural and small size municipalities) and central municipalities (urban, medium and large size municipalities).}

Among the smart city era, billions of widely distributed sensor nodes are demanded to detect physical signals, raising the challenges in the sustainable supply of the distributed power and the wireless transmission of the distributed signals. Here, the concept of tribophotonics represents a new research direction by using the electrostatic induction brought by triboelectric charges to tune or generate the optical or electromagnetic wave transmission, as coupling the triboelectricity with photonics. Triboelectricity brings the capabilities of energy harvesting and self-powered sensing from the mechanical motions, addressing the challenge of the power supply, and photonics can be modulated to transmit signals wirelessly without using cables, addressing the challenge of the wireless signal transmission. With the unified design of tribophotonic devices, an emerging fully-self-powered wireless sensing and transmission solution can be achieved through multiple technological routes following the general trends of functionality, miniatured integrability, wireless portability, and self-power-ability. This review discusses the realization methods, applications, challenges, and development trends of tribophotonics.}

This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold. As for now, however, there seems to be insufficient social trust to exploit this on a wider scale without creating even more scepticism and distrust.}

The integration of these appliances in lower grid levels will likely require grid reinforcements. However, some of these appliances are flexible and there is an opportunity to explore their flexibility potential to optimise the investment costs further. This paper proposes an optimal design strategy for a grid-connected site that returns the renewable generation and storage’s optimal sizing capacities and the required network reinforcement capacity. The novelty of the work is integrating network upgrade costs and considering flexibility from distributed flexible resources across planning and operation. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer piecewise linear problem, with the capacities of generation, storage and network upgrade as decision variables. The piecewise linear cost function related to the upgrade costs figuring in the objective function is then recast as a mixed-integer problem, and the flexible resources are modelled through an approximation method as a single virtual flexible asset. The application of the strategy on the Perth West smart city project as a case study demonstrates the importance of considering flexibility in the planning phase. The costs related to the storage system can decrease by up to 76%, and the overall costs by up to 35%, with the highest levels of savings, reached for the highest rates of electric vehicle adoption.}

To attain this aim, the present study uses hybrid Multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) and has identified 15 adoption IoT Barriers (IoTBs) from literature review obstructing the IoT implementation in smart cities of India. The IoTBs are further analyzed through the Total Interpretative structural modeling (TISM) approach, the Fuzzy Matriced’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquéan Classement (MICMAC) model, and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The TISM approach is used to develop a structural framework of IoTBs in smart cities’ waste management (SCWM) projects. The literature shows that several bottlenecks exist. Such bottlenecks may include operational cost and payback; a lack of standardization, regulations, directions, and policy norms; incomplete technical knowledge among policymakers; internet connectivity, privacy, and security issues; or problems with mobility, transparency, and a lack of IT infrastructure; all of these issues influence IoT adoption in SCWM. The present work discloses that the lack of regulations, directions, and policy norms, and the lack of standardization and Internet connectivity are the most critical IoT barriers hindering the development of smart cities, particularly in their waste management practices. The Fuzzy-MICMAC approach is useful in calculating driving and dependence powers of the IoTBs, and the DEMATEL method helps reveal the influence/strength of IoTBs that affect SCWM. This study will help policymakers, stakeholders, and government to understand the significant IoTBs affecting waste management practices, and it will definitely assist them to undertake decisions for eradicating these barriers for a more efficient IoT implementation in SCWM projects.}

In addition, an IoT based architecture allows the system to share data and diagnosis with a remote cardiologist in real-time or to store data in a FTP folder, as an Holter monitor, for post-processing and further analysis. The system consists of two sections: the digital one, based on the National Instruments MyRIO, digitalises the signal and processes it in real-time to make a diagnosis on possible occurring cardiac pathologies (bradycardia, tachycardia, infarction, ischemia); the analog section, which performs the acquisition, amplification, and preliminary filtering of a 3-leads electrocardiographic signal. The processing algorithm has been developed in NI LabVIEW environment. The main contribution to the state of the art is due to two removable and updatable memory devices. A first memory has been used to store clinical and personal data of patient so to configure the computing algorithm and adapt it to the monitored patient. A second memory has been used to store accuracy and uncertainty specifications of the ECG system in order to improve the reliability of the final diagnosis. The system aims to provide an electrocardiographic monitoring system for healthcare applications in the smart city context. The possibility to monitor constantly the patient health state at home is an important challenge of the next future smart cities. IoT and automation are the main aspects of the proposed system. Patients having chronic heart diseases need frequent hospitalizations to check their heart health.

The traditional approach utilizing IoT-based techniques for data collection and transmission for waste management applications is not energy-efficient and currently infeasible for such LS-WSNs, thus necessitating the need for a transformation to an IoV-based technique, where vehicular networks can be opportunistically exploited for efficient data collection for waste management strategies in SCs. This paper gives two contributions to research in waste management for SCs. First, a comprehensive study of the various IoT-based techniques for waste management in SCs is presented. Survey studies present energy consumption of the sensor-nodes due to high routing/transmission/control overheads as a major challenge. Several IoT-based techniques have been used to optimize the energy efficiency of the sensor-nodes. However, none has effectively addressed the challenges of energy consumption and optimization. The second contribution proposes an IoV-based technique for data collection for waste management in SCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of such a proposed scheme for SC waste management strategies. Thus, this paper is the first attempt to propose a novel IoV-based model for SC waste management strategies. This technique involves the use of vehicles as opportunistic MDCs to optimize energy efficiency. The paper also proposes using swarm-intelligence-based methods to increase energy efficiency and data collection for SC waste management application. An energy-efficient routing model is very critical to IoT-based applications. Hence, the paper presents an energy-efficient opportunistic model utilizing the ant-based routing algorithms for LS-WSN SC waste management applications. The paper also provides some analytical approaches to determine the energy consumption of the network model. The final part presents experiments in different application scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results present the proposed approach in good performance in terms of the performance metrics compared to the conventional techniques for waste management strategies.}

abstract = {Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR) have seen significant advances as independent disciplines over the past 50 years. XR has been developed as an umbrella domain, covering Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR), giving rise to human–machine interactions. This intersection sees diverse applications ranging from rehabilitation, navigation, entertainment, robotics and home control for smart cities. This review takes an in-depth look at BCI and XR technologies, and gives examples of how their combination produces promising results pertaining to the above stated applications. It presents a detailed discussion on the background of BCI, VR and AR technologies and further their individual applications. The review then discusses the works that use the conjunction of these technologies for various real life applications in smart cities. In addition, we also present the future scope of applications that use a combination of BCI and XR technologies.}

Future cities are expected to be smart and billions of devices will be connected forming a network. The emergence of the Internet of Things proffers to link sensors enabled digital devices with the internet thus offering new services in the context of smart cities. In this regard, it is crucial for the internet service providers (ISPs) to observe/monitor their end-to-end network performance and identify any possible service degradation(s) as the goal of smart cities can only be realized through good quality internet. In this paper, we demonstrate our hardware-software co-designed quality of experience (QoE) management solution for ISPs. Our system is capable of monitoring and reporting the web, video, VoIP, IPTV, and WiFi QoE at various network levels. We experimentally tested our solution at appropriate network locations and demonstrated QoE and latency results for one of the leading ISP of South Asia. Our solution enables the ISPs to remotely monitor the quality of their network and identify any issue(s) which can lower the customer's QoE. As the internet is the backbone of smart cities, we believe our proposed solution for QoE will help expedite the smart cities’ infrastructure and solutions.}

People use multiple scientific advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for data acquisition and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for big data analytics to enhance the integration and sharing of data and optimize the basic standards of smart cities. Past few years, the concept behind the Internet of Things has been a major research topic in the development of smart cities, education, industry, and commerce. Services and applications of IoT are the major factors for creating a sustainable urban life that is employed by smart cities. The stakeholders of smart cities become more aware, efficient, and interactive using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in IoT. The applications of smart cities based on IoT have been increased in number which leads to production and increase in the amount of data and its processing. Moreover, the city stakeholders and governments take prior actions/precautions for processing the collected data from the IoT devices and predicting the future consequences for securing a sustainable environment. Artificial Intelligence is one of the key research techniques which several researchers have analysed and proved to be the best in improving the performance of detecting fire hazard in smart cities. In this research, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (R-LSTM-NN) is proposed for prediction of big data that are collected from smart cities based on IoT. Moreover, the proposed model mainly concentrates in predicting the fire hazard values that gathered from smart cities using IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique proves to be better when compared with other existing techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The proposed model detects the fire outbreak with a 98.4% of accuracy that having 0.14% of minimal error rate. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used for various prediction problems that are faced by smart cities.}

Surplus distribution is widely practised across the globe and there are several communities for the same as well. However, the success of these movements are determined by the active participation of volunteers. In addition, volunteer availability is an issue that is dependent on several different factors. An incentive module for the volunteers can normalize the availability of the volunteers. Such incentive modules are prone to identity duplication attacks and the implemented solutions do not really encourage volunteer hierarchical structures. In this paper, an incentive module that resists identity duplication and promotes the hierarchical structure between volunteers is presented. In addition, an improved matching module to match the food donors to the receivers utilizing the available volunteers optimally is also proposed. For the simulation, we have used real data taken from a real life smart city context, namely, we have used the OPEN DATA BARCELONA at https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-cadastre-carrecs-us and cast it to our simulation settings using Python libraries.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the links between smart cities and urban energy sustainability. Because achieving a “smart city” is a wide agenda rather than a specific set of interventions, smartness itself cannot easily be measured or quantifiably assessed. Instead, we understand smart cities to be a broad framework of strategies pursued by urban actors, and ask whether and how smart city projects catalyze urban energy sustainability. We use case studies of three cities (Nottingham, Stavanger, and Stockholm) funded by the Horizon 2020 Smart Cities and Communities program and examine how urban energy sustainability was advanced and realized through the smart city initiatives. We find first that while sustainability is not always a major objective of local implementation of smart city projects, the smartness agenda nevertheless increases the ambition to achieve energy sustainability targets. Second, the sustainability measures in smart cities are rarely driven by advanced technology, even though the smart city agenda is framed around such innovations. Third, there is significant sustainability potential in cross-sectoral integration, but there are unresolved challenges of accountability for and measurability of these gains.}

SCM is to drive economic growth of the country and to increase the quality of living life of the people through technology-based outcomes. AI plays an important role in forming the SCM implementation. This study focuses on the identification of the duties and responsibilities of the officials in executing the AI and to implement SCM. The study intends to collect data from stakeholders and experts who are related to the implementation of the SCM. A survey method has been followed and percentage analysis using MS excel has been used to do data analysis. The outcome of the research shows how the different levels of the organizational structure are having different duties and responsibilities to exhibit in executing the AI for SCM implementation. Also, the results and findings obtained for this research study would be of more useful to the policy makers and people who are responsible to take necessary decisions at each level of the organizational structure. This study contributes to the theory and practice of the organizational behavior on which the people working in each and every level or designation would learn their responsibilities and duties to be followed to use artificial intelligence in implementing smart cities in the Coimbatore district. The study result is also useful to the government officials who give sanctions to the smart cities projects in Tamil Nadu. Since determination of effective and appropriate organizational structure is very important before executing new schemes, this study aims to determine the same in Smart Cities Mission.}

While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real’ smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings’.}

Different kinds of Smart City APIs enable smart city services and applications, while their effectiveness depends on the architectural solutions to pass from data to services for city users and operators, exploiting data analytics, and presenting services via APIs. Therefore, there is a strong activity on defining smart city architectures to cope with this complexity, putting in place a significant range of different kinds of services and processes. In this paper, the work performed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city project on defining a smart city architecture addressing a wide range of processes and data is presented. To this end, comparisons of the state of the art solutions of smart city architectures for data aggregation and for Smart City API are presented by putting in evidence the usage semantic ontologies and knowledge base in the data aggregation in the production of smart services. The solution proposed aggregate and re-conciliate data (open and private, static and real time) by using reasoning/smart algorithms for enabling sophisticated service delivering via Smart City API. The work presented has been developed in the context of the Sii-Mobility national smart city project on mobility and transport integrated with smart city services with the aim of reaching a more sustainable mobility and transport systems. Sii-Mobility is grounded on Km4City ontology and tools for smart city data aggregation, analytics support and service production exploiting smart city API. To this end, Sii-Mobility/Km4City APIs have been compared to the state of the art solutions. Moreover, the proposed architecture has been assessed in terms of performance, computational and network costs in terms of measures that can be easily performed on private cloud on premise. The computational costs and workloads of the data ingestion and data analytics processes have been assessed to identify suitable measures to estimate needed resources. Finally, the API consumption related data in the recent period are presented.}

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of Environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA) in three different well-established industries of three different volumes namely: food, glass and plastics industries. Material and Energy Flow Analysis (MEFA) using Umberto Efficiency + was carried out initially prior to LCA using Umberto LCA + to establish the inventory. The LCA has been conducted according to ISO 14040/14044 standards. Cradle-to-Gate system boundary was set considering the transportation of raw materials, energy and waste handling. Each case study is regarded as a sample representing the industry’s environmental burden respectively. The case studies are chosen with different production scale categorized under small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The case representing the food industry which is considered a Small Enterprise proved to have a higher equivalent carbon footprint than the Medium Enterprise concerned with plastics recycling which points out the importance of performing LCA on all industrial scales.}

Detailed frameworks and techniques are consequently having to manual, operationalize, and degree the implementation manner in addition to the effect of the respective technology. This chapter discusses about blockchain era, a unique motive force of technological transformation that contains a mess of underlying technology and protocols, and its capability effect on clever towns. The chapter deals with the query of ways the blockchain era may also advantage the improvement of city regions. Based on a complete literature review, we gift a framework and study propositions. Nine software fields of a blockchain era withinside the smartization of towns: (1) healthcare, (2) logistics and deliver chains, (3) mobility, (4) energy, (5) management and services, (6) e-voting, (7) factory, (8) domestic, and (9) education are discussed. Contemporary-day tendencies in those fields illustrate how they're laid low with the blockchain era and derive propositions to manual destiny studies’ endeavors. Further sections of the chapter are well organized as follows. Section 1 is the introductory part of the eco-friendly blockchain technology for smart cities. Section 2 reflects types of blockchain executions and some common consent algorithms. Section 3 illustrates the benefits of blockchain combination with smart cities and reconnoiters ways it plays an essential role in creating and benefitting smart cities. Fifteen benefits of smart cities with blockchain are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 defends how blockchain is eco-friendly, and finally, Section 6 summarizes and concludes all sections.}

The key finding is that the ratio of the accident count with the automation system status being on to that with it being off (i.e. manual driving per se) is substantially smaller at a high speed (74 km per hr or above) of the vehicle than at a low speed. Current automation systems are far more technologically, legally, economically and financially valuable and helpful to human beings for travelling on vehicles at high speeds.}

abstract = {Smart city development has emerged as a favoured response to the 21st-century urbanisation challenges. A wide range of definitions surfaced over the last decade characterising the smart city, primarily pushed by the global elite corporations and influential academics. Simultaneously, a series of urban development expressions, such as digital city, knowledge city, eco-city is used interchangeably with the smart city, significantly mystifying the reading of the concept. This paper, first argue that smart city interpretation needs and requires the input and contribution of the local stakeholders. The aim of this research is to provide an evidence-based framework to capture the perception of local urban actors in India vis-à-vis their interpretation of smart cities given the existing urban conditions and the proposed developments under the 100 Smart Cities Mission. This research also examines the underlying linkage between the smart city and its conceptual relatives and highlights the ones with a significant convergence with the emerging urban agenda in India's Smart Cities Mission. The analysis presented in this paper show that to emerge as a holistic concept, smart cities definition models should engage with the sustainability and community issues, beyond the use of digital technology. The research reveals that the Indian urban stakeholders strongly associate the smart city concept with sustainable city and eco-city, much more than the technology-loaded phrases such as ubiquitous city and digital city. The first-of-its-kind inclusive approach developed in this paper to define smart city takes on the monopolies of top-down smart city definitions and support the democratisation of the rapidly proliferating concept.}

It involves establishing an inclusive transportation system to address many issues, like traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond environmental concerns, robust mobility management has social and economic advantages, fostering improved access to vital services like healthcare, education, and employment. Software-defined networking (SDN) presents a viable solution for enhancing MM within networks. Unlike traditional setups, SDN merges MM through a programmable control plane, streamlining network configurations and enabling features like handover, load balancing, and quality of service (QoS). The utilization of SDN technology extends to various facets of sustainable city networks, encompassing areas like network security, performance optimization, big data processing, energy efficiency, emergency management, carbon emissions reduction, intelligent services, and MM in vehicular networks. Despite the advantages of SDN-based mobility management, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges and limitations posed by traditional MM methods that SDN aims to overcome. The paper explores SDN's potential in sustainable cities, focusing on how it can transform mobile device management, support various networking technologies, and evaluate the impact of SDN methods on existing MM systems, considering factors like scalability and compatibility. The paper asserts that SDN-based MM has substantial potential for promoting sustainable urban development. By centralizing control, adapting to changing conditions, and optimizing resource allocation, SDN can contribute to reduced energy consumption, lower carbon emissions, and more efficient urban mobility. It emphasizes the importance of addressing potential drawbacks to ensure successful implementation in sustainable cities.}

However, due to its natural randomness, a large number of energy storage resources are necessary. Electrolytic hydrogen could quickly follow the fluctuations of renewable energy and transform excess renewable energy into hydrogen stored for future use, which not only promotes the accommodation of renewable energy, but also drives the low-carbon development of construction, transportation, electricity, and other industries, thereby helping construct future low-carbon energy systems (FCES). However, few existing studies have conducted a systematic investigation on the role of electrolytic hydrogen in smart city decarbonization from both the supply and demand sides. Here, we develop a full-life-cycle optimization model of FCES with photovoltaic (PV) and power-to-hydrogen (P2H) planning to achieve decarbonization goals in China. Our results show that the annual hydrogen potential of 10 selected cities with different energy structures and quantities varies from 0.236 to 9.795 megatons, with a gap of more than 40-fold. Considering PV and P2H integration in FCES, the CO2 emissions of 10 cities in related fields decreased obviously under an 80 % photovoltaic penetration level (PPL). Compared with electrochemical storage, P2H shows better performance in PV integration of FCES from both economics and CO2 emissions. However, this advantage needs to be based on diverse terminal uses of electrolytic hydrogen.}

This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning’s key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.}

The concept of a smart city is fast becoming a key instrument in transforming living environments in a better way to enhance the operational efficiency of a transportation system. This paper presents a framework to assess transportation performance measures and smart-growth of cities around the U.S. by including physical activity as one of the main criteria.
Methods
This study employs Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. The proposed assessment framework is comprised of the evaluation of an individual criterion and the assessment of comprehensive results. The criteria are categorized into four groups including network performance, traffic safety, environmental impact, and physical activity. As a case example, the proposed performance measures were examined for forty-six cities in the U.S., and the required data was gathered from multiple sources.
Results
The output of the framework contains sustainability and smart-growth rankings of the selected cities as well as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis was utilized to determine the quantity that each performance measure or weighting factor requires to alter the smart-growth score. It has been illustrated that the dominancy between reversible pairs in the ranking is critically sensitive for almost 15% of cases.
Conclusion
The results of the proposed framework can be an effective decision supporting tool in analyzing traffic management strategies. Results from the score sensitivity calculation indicate that the proposed framework can be adopted in multifaceted transportation system performance in sustainability and smart-growth of cities.}

It can provide many benefits for people’s daily life, but is also susceptible to many security threats in practice. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), especially signature-based IDSs, are one of the most commonly adopted security mechanisms to safeguard various network environments like IoT-assisted smart city against cyber attacks. The process of signature matching is a key limiting factor for a signature-based IDS, and the exclusive signature matching (ESM) was designed based on the observation that most network packets would not match any IDS signatures. However, exclusive signature matching like the single character frequency-based ESM may be vulnerable to some attacks in a hostile environment. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose a blockchain-enabled single character frequency-based ESM, which can build a verifiable database of malicious payloads via blockchains. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of our approach under flooding and character padding attacks in both a simulated and a real IoT network environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the robustness of single character frequency-based ESM against malicious traffic.}

Energy management of active power and frequency control approach is based on the intelligent probabilistic wavelet fuzzy neural network-deep reinforcement learning algorithm (IPWFNN-DRLA). The control strategy is formulated with deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Markov decision process and solved by the soft actor-critic algorithm. The NMG local controller (NMGLC) provides information such as the frequency, active power, power generation data, and status of the electric vehicle's battery energy storage system to the NMG central controller (NMGCC). Then the NMGCC calculates active power and frequency support based on the IPWFNN-DRLA approach and sends the results to the NMGLC. The proposed model is developed in a continuous problem-solving space with two structures of offline training and decentralized distributed operation. For this purpose, each NMG has a control agent (NMGCA) based on the IPWFNN algorithm, and the NMGCA learning model is formulated based the online back-propagation learning algorithm. The proposed approach demonstrates a computation accuracy exceeding 98%, along with a 7.82% reduction in computational burden and a 61.1% reduction in computation time compared to alternative methods.}

This study focuses on digital participatory planning (DPP) as a precondition for social sustainability in SSC and aims to summarise and assess the current relevant local policies and endeavours in Oman; and to develop a generic framework to evaluate the readiness for DPP. In doing so, selective key literature, policies and initiatives were critically reviewed covering the SSC concept, establishing the link between the SSC and DPP, and eliciting a list of comprehensive DPP readiness factors. The results indicated that the Omani government has a clear will to move towards SSC and the country has already witnessed few initiatives supporting this direction. However, there is a lack of a clear action plan regarding DPP. Therefore, more work is required to systemise efforts. The study provides a generic framework to assess the readiness of the government and society for DPP and concludes with recommendations for policymakers.}

The purpose of a Smart City is to solve its inherent problems while simultaneously reducing its expenditure and improving its quality of life. Through the 4th Industrial Revolution technology, the advantages of Smart City are estimated to overcome the city’s expenses with city platformization. While a city traditionally is the subject of creation and not consumption, a Smart City currently is the key industry in generating more than 60% of its GDP in value creation from a production viewpoint. Moreover, with the expansion of online-offline convergence, cities can grow without limitation on its size, where connectivity and innovation determine the inclination of the city’s benefit-cost curve. As a city platform is responsible for connectivity, its value drastically increases through the 4th Industrial Revolution’s O2O (online to offline convergence) platform. When a city reflects on its own as a Digital Twin in the Cloud and when complete information becomes accessible through citizen’s participation through smartphones (Edge), Self-organization takes place, an ideal linkage between the city and citizens. Cities go through the self-organizing process of complex adaptive systems like the human brain. This research proposes a future model of a “Self-organizing City,” and suggests implementing the Smart City model based on the Smart City Tech-Socio Model in implementing strategies.}

It underpins a variety of essential and significant tasks in the development of smart city including face recognition, landmark retrieval, pedestrian detection, person/vehicle re-identification, and so on. Traditional pair-based DML methods try to make full use of the data-to-data relations within a (mini-)batch, but they cannot grasp the data distribution information due to the batch size limitation. On the other hand, proxy-based DML schemes use different proxies to approximate the data distribution. However, the proxies are too sample to represent the intra-category variance. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, named soft-instance-label proxy, for embedding learning. It can capture the globe data distribution information while depicting the detailed intra-class data structure. The state-of-the-art empirical results on three public image retrieval benchmarks and two backbone networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our Soft-instance-label proxy method can have a Recall@1 improvement of 2.4% with Googlenet, largely surpassing the current state-of-art-methods while demonstrating great potential in the development of smart city.}

However, the issue of bias in these data and the fairness of outcomes in smart cities has received relatively limited attention. This is a troubling and significant omission, as social equity should be a critical aspect of smart cities and needs to be addressed and accounted for in the use of new technologies and data tools. This paper examines bias in resident-reported data by analyzing socio-spatial disparities in ‘311’ complaint behavior in Kansas City, Missouri. We utilize data from detailed 311 reports and a comprehensive resident satisfaction survey, and spatially join these data with code enforcement violations, neighborhood characteristics, and street condition assessments. We introduce a model to identify disparities in resident-government interactions and classify under- and over-reporting neighborhoods based on complaint behavior. Despite greater objective and subjective need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems. Our findings form the basis for acknowledging and accounting for data bias in self-reported data, and contribute to the more equitable delivery of city services through bias-aware data-driven processes.}

abstract = {While there are several partial solutions to model some aspects of cities (e.g. transportation or energy), there is no framework allowing modelling of a complex system such as a city. This paper aims on providing a solution that can be used by practitioners to model impact of different scenarios and smart city projects encapsulating different subsystems, such as transportation, energetics or, for example, eGovernment. The term “smart cities” is classified into Systems Theory, particularly focusing on Cyber-Physical Systems. This classification is further elaborated to define a new term, so-called Smart City Agent (SCA). The SCA is considered as the main building block for modelling smart cities. The approach within this paper however stresses the interconnection of different systems within a city. Its’ strength is in better exchange of data and among heterogeneous agents. This information management approach is the missing key in the growing market of partial smart city solutions as it will allow simulation of solutions in complex systems such as a city. The suitability of usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a use case dealing with charging of electrical vehicles. The results show that the approach is suitable for modelling of dynamic behaviour.}

abstract = {Cities influence climate change since they consume large amounts of energy leading to higher carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and environmental degradation. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis establishes that renewable energy consumption in India can significantly offset CO2 emissions. The application of the “Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF)” on the use of renewable energy (RE) for electricity in 45 Indian cities under smart city mission and its results are presented here. The analysis show that the penetration of RE in cities is low. Apart from electricity generation within cities, the best performing ones could successfully harness RE from outside city limits through regulatory incentives. The potential and strategies to harness more RE in cities is presented. The challenges in higher RE adoption in cities and required policy recommendations are also discussed.}
