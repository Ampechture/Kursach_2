abstract = {Nowadays, with continuous integration of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies, there are increasing demands and specific requirements for data sharing in sustainable smart cities: (1) practical data sharing should be implemented in the non-interactive fashion without a trusted third party to be involved; (2) dynamic thresholds are preferred since the participants may join or leave at any time; (3) multi-secret sharing is desirable to increase the packing capacity. To fulfil these requirements, we propose a general construction of ideal threshold changeable multi-secret sharing scheme (TCMSS) with information-theoretic security, in which polynomials are employed to achieve dealer-free and non-interactive in the secret reconstruction phase. The TCMSS scheme can be built on any existing linear secret sharing scheme, and it is simpler and more efficient than the existing TCSS schemes in the literature. The main difference between TCMSS and Shamir’s SS is that univariate polynomial is used in Shamir’s SS to generate the shares for all shareholders; while in TCMSS, each shareholder can recover her own univariate polynomial using her share. This article demonstrates that with this novel modification, the classic polynomial-based SS can be transformed into an ideal TCMSS. Moreover, the TCMSS scheme is lightweight and it can resist both internal and external attacks. It does not require pairwise key distribution and its secret reconstruction phase is improved with enhanced properties. Therefore, the designed proposal is fairly suitable and attractive to be deployed in sustainable cities.}

Education is one of the areas of focus in smart cities and in this context, smart education is a term used to refer to education provided by smart cities. As research in this area has expanded recently as shown by the number of literature reviews in a smart city context, a review could help summarize existing directions focusing in this case on education in the smart cities context. As our understanding on negative consequences is limited, this research will address this knowledge gap by concentrating on challenges and difficulties when it comes to education in smart cities. The articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science were review and a qualitative analysis of the articles fitting our research criteria was done. Three themes were identified: shortcomings on the existing educational initiatives to address the needs of smart cities, negative consequences of smart city education in other areas and problems that arise as a result of employing technology in education.}

Most of the surveillance data recorded by the IoT devices is in the form of video and needs to be transmitted to the admin or server by video streaming technology. Fractal video compression uses a self-similarity concept for video compression, meaning the fractal image contains self-similarity of itself that is explained and denoted by change. Computational cost is more in fractal video coding; different methods have been developed to reduce this computational cost. The proposed work's main objective is to implement a video streaming approach by combining the Diamond-search-pattern- block-matching motion estimation algorithm and hash-based fractal video compression algorithm to reduce the encoding time. It improves both the delay and security of the block matching system and the developed approach measures based on evaluation parameters: Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), encoding time, decoding time, Mean squared error (MSE), and Compression ratio for Smart City Applications. Compared to other algorithms, the IoTs video data is streamed efficiently in a smart city to analyse the abnormalities.}

To date, few studies have been conducted on the effects of service quality on citizen engagement in smart cities in a public emergency. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model and uncertain management theory, this study analyses the impact of the service quality of smart city system on citizen engagement in a public emergency. Data were collected in Chinese smart cities. Three valuable and novel results are identified. First, high-quality information content, highly reliable systems and highly responsive systems have a significant positive effect on citizens' continuous experiences, but not on citizens' immediate experiences. Second, both the immediate and continuous experiences of citizens have a significant positive effect on citizen engagement. Third, continuous experiences impose a full mediation effect between information content and citizen engagement, between reliability and citizen engagement and between responsiveness and citizen engagement. As its main contribution, this study focuses on the construction of a theoretical model. Based on this model, smart city managers can understand citizens' reactions in public emergencies from stimulation to experience and their behaviours in relation to smart city services.}

abstract = {Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) based on deep learning models can identify and mitigate cyberattacks in IoT applications in a resilient and systematic manner. These models, which support the IDS’s decision, could be vulnerable to a cyberattack known as adversarial attack. In this type of attack, attackers create adversarial samples by introducing small perturbations to attack samples to trick a trained model into misclassifying them as benign applications. These attacks can cause substantial damage to IoT-based smart city models in terms of device malfunction, data leakage, operational outage and financial loss. To our knowledge, the impact of and defence against adversarial attacks on IDS models in relation to smart city applications have not been investigated yet. To address this research gap, in this work, we explore the effect of adversarial attacks on the deep learning and shallow machine learning models by using a recent IoT dataset and propose a method using adversarial retraining that can significantly improve IDS performance when confronting adversarial attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that the presence of adversarial samples deteriorates the detection accuracy significantly by above 70% while our proposed model can deliver detection accuracy above 99% against all types of attacks including adversarial attacks. This makes an IDS robust in protecting IoT-based smart city services.}

The theory is tested using the Akaike Information Criterion Stepwise OLS regression model with data from 329 cities in the United States and 13 smart city technologies. The study finds that adoption of smart city technologies is indeed contingent with managerial incentives, constraints and context. Funding from state governments, availability of technical assistance and city branding have positive and statistically significant effects on smart technology adoption. Conversely, lack of leadership, legacy systems and lack of understanding of technology have negative and statistically significant effects. Demography, geography and form of government are also associated with technology adoption. Managerial contingency theory opens a new field of research on smart cities.}

abstract = {Innovative cities that use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) while guaranteeing that they meet current generations’ needs for life quality, operating efficiency, and competitive nature are known as Smart Sustainable Cities (SSCs). Green spaces and eco-friendly practices are integrated into the urban area to reduce pollution levels and CO2 emissions and protect the natural resources within the city. Apps for smart cities are designed to control traffic and respond to emergencies in real-time. Therefore, smart cities may be better equipped to react to challenges than those with a straightforward transaction processing relationship with their residents. Existing high-speed internet and underground wiring in major metro areas are both in need of replacement due to deterioration from decades of use. Although the availability of wireless broadband service is expanding, some parts of the country’s largest cities are still without it. In order to maintain cities in a sustainable fashion, there are several obstacles that must be faced. Congestion, a lack of funding for essential services, a lack of suitable accommodation, deteriorating infrastructure, and increasing air pollution are all common problems in cities. The major challenges such as the best use of urban buildings’ energy generation, storage, consumption, fossil fuel use, disregard for the environment, and limited internet technology (IT) architecture are all contributing factors in the city’s decline addressed in this research. Therefore, this paper proposes the social collaboration of renewable energy resources (SC-RER) technique to overcome the basic challenges described above. With the help of the proposed technique, local renewable energy sources can be used to their full potential. Smart block innovation (SBI) is used to make smart community planning mode. Energy-Efficiency (EE) model is framed to reduce the energy consumed significantly. As a result, it helps increase the method’s efficiency to gain a 95.4% maximum level, suitable for making sustainable smart cities.}

It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others. The 6G communication network takes care of latency and reliability issues in the smart city with their unique characteristics such as latency (10–100 μs) and reliability (99.99999%). Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review for blockchain technology and IoT together functional to smart cities. First, state-of-art-the works and contextual information are introduced. Then, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized architecture for IoT-integrated smart cities covering different application perspectives, such as smart grid, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and healthcare 5.0 underlying 6G communication networks. Next, we describe the challenges of the proposed architecture respective to each application, as mentioned above. Finally, we collated the open research issues and future direction to efficiently integrate blockchain into IoT-envisioned smart cities.}

Taking 153 cities from China as the research sample, we evaluated the impact of smart city policy (SCP) on urban ecological total factor energy efficiency (ETFEE) using the generalized synthetic control method. The main results are as follows. (1) SCP significantly improves urban ETFEE after controlling the endogeneity and unobserved time-varying confounders, and this conclusion is strongly supported by multiple robustness tests. (2) There is a two-stage mediating mechanism through which SCP functions. Specifically, SCP promotes innovation by enhancing intelligence (including informatization, human capital, and technology), thereby improving urban ETFEE. (3) Public participation and market conditions play moderating effects, and they improve the contribution of SCP on urban ETFEE. (4) For heterogeneity, SCP plays a significant role in eastern cities, large-size cities, non-resource-based cities, and non-old industrial base cities, whereas it has little impact on other cities’ ETFEE. This study provides empirical evidence and policy insights for constructing smart cities in China and even other emerging economies.}

The framework translates abstract ethical requirements into a set of systematically derived governance mechanisms which are at the same time anchored in the concept of democratic accountability. This guiding principle does not demand that citizens necessarily become active themselves to realize citizen-centric data governance for socially sustainable smart city development. Rather, it demands that data governance comprises a suitable set of accountability measures that put the purposes of any data use center-stage.}

In this sense, we fit the compound ROA with the framework of a typical smart city project in solar energy field. We also provide a case study to make a comparison between classical Expected Net Present Value (ENPV) approach and compound ROA. The results show that ENPV underestimates the project value, whereas compound ROA allows to obtain a more attractive valuation of the project by embedding in the analysis the managerial flexibility value.}

This paper introduces a novel model to assess cities for their smartness. A smart city is characterized by assessing 8 main domains including economy, environment, society, governance, energy, infrastructure, transportation, and pandemic resiliency. Each domain is evaluated by assessing several key parameters that reflect the condition of that domain in any given city. All indicators are measurable and can be assessed, which gives this approach more credibility and accuracy. This model has been applied on 20 cities worldwide. Enhancing the smart energy index by 25 % results in doubling the smart economy index for all cities. Furthermore, enhancing the GDP per capita by 50 % results in modest increase in the smart economy index. Smart governance has a positive and linear relationship with smart economy with a p value of 0.004. Montreal has the highest Smart City Index of 0.8 while Abuja has the lowest of 0.3. Socioeconomic and energy domains are critical domains that must be improved to achieve higher Smart City Index scores and therefore resilient and smart cities.}

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can be considered key elements for today's Intelligent Transportation Systems. A small number of research investigations is found to aim at exploiting the resources of CAVs for services provisioning within a smart city. Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, no research investigations have yet investigated exploiting the computational capabilities of CAVs to become an added value to the computational power of smart cities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Computational Resource (VaCR) and develop a system that enables vehicles to share their computational resources within smart cities. Users rely on Service Provider (SP) to acquire the required services that meet their Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences. The device capabilities of VaCR are one of the main indicators in QoE preferences. To that end, evaluation models are developed based on aggregate statistics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the discovery and selection of the appropriate VaCRs to participate in the provisioning of services. The deployment is modeled using a multiagent system. Then, game theory is used to model the recruitment that aims at optimizing QoE for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Thorough simulations, analyses, and evaluations of the proposed VaCR system are carried out. The performed validations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing QoE and the successful VaCR system operation, while attaining appealing performance characteristics.}

However, various strategies for determining cities' smartness/smart development levels are mostly inconclusive by not considering all the dimensions in urban space in their assessments. This study adopted a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) technique to model the smartness/smart development levels of a developing country city using a six-dimensional framework which provides a comprehensive perspective on the characterization of urban frameworks of cities. A positivism research philosophy using deductive approach and purposive sampling technique was adopted. Quantitative data were collected from experts using a close-ended questionnaire in which 76 responses were retrieved. The study modeled eight indicators for each of the six dimensions using FSE to determine the smartness/smart development level index of each dimension towards the determination of the overall smartness/smart development level index of the developing country city. After analysis, the developing country city and each of the six dimensions used to characterize the city were determined as fairly developed. The implications of such level of ranking meant that the city is below the acceptable smart city status, and hence, improvement should be made in policy applications along the 48 identified indicators such as empowering human resources, sustainable resource consumption, etc., to propel the six dimensions towards smart city. This study could also serve as a theoretical model for determining the smartness/smart development levels of developing countries’ cities. The study also reveals aspects in the urban framework where policy makers and urban developers could target to improve the smartness/smart development levels of cities towards the smart city status.}

Until now, studies on citizen participation in smart cities have mainly focused on the participation characteristics of general citizens. Thus, this study categorizes the key considerations for encouraging the participation of information-disadvantaged groups in smart cities and analyzes the difference in the relative importance between types using a series of Delphi surveys to collect the opinions of smart city experts in South Korea. The findings show that service accessibility is significantly important in encouraging participation, while the calculation of appropriate service cost and developing a support plan for service delivery are paramount in improving service accessibility. Furthermore, financial support for reducing the digital divide and citizens’ understanding of the purpose of participation for increasing participative receptivity are found to be statistically significant.}

abstract = {Smart cities attempt to reach net-zero emissions goals by reducing wasted energy while improving grid stability and meeting service demand. This is possible by adopting next-generation energy systems, which leverage artificial intelligence, the Internet of things (IoT), and communication technologies to collect and analyze big data in real-time and effectively run city services. However, training machine learning algorithms to perform various energy-related tasks in sustainable smart cities is a challenging data science task. These algorithms might not perform as expected, take much time in training, or do not have enough input data to generalize well. To that end, transfer learning (TL) has been proposed as a promising solution to alleviate these issues. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper presents the first review of the applicability of TL for energy systems by adopting a well-defined taxonomy of existing TL frameworks. Next, an in-depth analysis is carried out to identify the pros and cons of current techniques and discuss unsolved issues. Moving on, two case studies illustrating the use of TL for (i) energy prediction with mobility data and (ii) load forecasting in sports facilities are presented. Lastly, the paper ends with a discussion of the future directions.}

At such BSCSs, users of mobile information communication technology (ICT) equipment like mobile phones, tablet computers, lap-tops, etc. and electric vehicles can swap and trade their standardized battery modules whenever depleted for fully charged ones almost in no time virtually anytime and everywhere without ever worrying about battery depletion of the equipment and the extended time and specialized chargers for recharging. Harnessing earlier technologies of the author, this design could be a game-changer to “disrupt” the current battery usage ecosystem consisting of an excessively large number of, sometimes costly, infrastructures and chargers to recharge individuals’ equipment, the cumbersome practice to recharge with specialized chargers at designated locations over extended time periods, and bulky secondary power banks being hand-carried. The key is that in this schema, disparity of battery modules’ estimated remnant energy storage capacities can be offset by monetary payments.}

In this view, smart city may be viewed as a – one of its kind – laboratory to query the complex human-computer relationship from a multi-dimensional perspective. By adopting this perspective, this paper queries the existing smart city surveillance systems to identify their key limitations and sources of frequently justified controversies. It is argued that to bypass these – first – the value of mesh-technology should be explored. It is also argued that – second – it is necessary not only to bring citizens back in the discussion on smart city, but also to highlight the mechanisms by means of which they might be involved in the co-design of smart city solutions and in urban decision-making. To bridge these two imperatives, smart city is conceptualized as a smart service system and, consequently, a wireless integrated mesh-technology enhanced (WIMTE) smart city surveillance system is elaborated.}

Developing smart cities calls for a suitable while comprehensive assessment framework to assist city planners and decision-makers to suggest future directions for cities on how to become smarter by evaluating the smartness of cities. In this regard, this study follows two primary purposes. First, we investigate the concept of “smart city” and its pillars. Second, we develop a smartness assessment framework by considering both subjective and objective criteria and employing six effective multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methods. A linear assignment model is formulated to find an aggregated ranking vector using the ranking vectors obtained from these MADM methods. Then, as a case study, five out of the most important cities in Iran are compared and evaluated by adopting the proposed framework. Furthermore, different scenarios are introduced to investigate the sensitivity of results to the distribution of the importance weights amongst criteria. The results demonstrate the significance of the governmental, economic, and environmental indicators in evaluating the smartness of cities. Moreover, Tehran, the capital city of Iran, obtains the best ranking in all the methods and weighting scenarios, while Tabriz has the worst ranking among the cities under study.}

This paper examines the influence of smart city construction on urban green total factor productivity (GTFP), explores the influence mechanism and further investigates the heterogeneous influence among the factors of urban scale, human capital and financial development, by conducting a quasi-natural experiment based on the first batch of pilot smart city in China and using panel data of 174 prefecture level cities over the period of 2005−2016. Our findings show that: (1) Smart city construction pilot significantly improves GTFP and green technological progress (GTP) in China, but its influence on GTE is not significant, which means smart city construction promotes GTFP mainly through promoting GTP. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. (2) The estimation result of mediating effect models is that smart city construction promoted GTFP and GTP mainly through boosting urban technological innovation. The influence path of “smart city construction→technological innovation→GTFP” is verified. (3) Regarding city heterogeneity, cities with larger scale, richer human capital and higher level financial development have stronger positive effects on GTFP and GTP. These conclusions are of vital significance to improve the urban ecological environment and promote the high-quality development of urban economy.}

The urban population has been severely affected by this viral pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns, resulting in increased poverty and inequality, slowed economic growth, and a general decline in quality of life. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the effects of the pandemic by combining agent-based simulations—based on Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model—with a hybrid neural network. A baseline agent-based model (ABM) incorporating various epidemiological parameters of a viral pandemic was developed, followed by an additional functional layer that integrates factors like agent mobility restrictions and isolation. It is inferred from the results that low population densities of agents and high restrictions on agent mobility could inhibit the rapid spread of the pandemic. This framework also envisages a hybrid neural network that combines the layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for predicting the spatiotemporal probability of infection spread using real-world pandemic data for future pandemics. This framework could aid designers, regulators, urban planners, and policymakers develop resilient, healthy, and sustainable urban spaces in post-COVID smart cities.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

In the first phase, a qualitative analysis is established to determine the smart city concept. In the second phase, the DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) technique is used to examine smart city focusing on the dimensions derived from the literature in the form of six main and 33 sub-dimensions. Data is collected by contacting ten academia experts through a questionnaire specifically designed; open-ended questions and DEMATEL technique assessments. Results indicated that both phases had different outputs. While technology was highlighted and possible managerial issues emerged in the qualitative section, on the contrary, in the quantitative section, ‘smart people’ has emerged as the most important predictor of the smart city while ‘smart governance’ was the least. By the DEMATEL, not only the most and the least important dimensions within each group revealed but also the causer and receiver effects of each dimension. Further, the results and implications of the study are discussed.}

However, the approach faces challenges when multiple goals shall be simultaneously achieved. For illustration, we study a multi-agent system, where agents have a plurality of different, and mutually inconsistent goals. We then allow agents in the system to vote on which traffic signal controllers, which were trained on different goals using deep reinforcement learning, would control the intersection. Taking decisions based on suitable voting procedures turns out to lead to favorable solutions, which perform highly for several goals rather than optimally for one goal and poorly for others. This opens up new opportunities for the management or even self-governance of complex systems that require the consideration and achievement of multiple goals, such as many systems involving humans. Here, we present results for traffic flows in urban street networks, which suggest that “democratizing traffic” would be a promising alternative to centralized control of traffic flows.}

In order to further identify the key influencing factors and clarify the importance of the factors, the interval gray number-DEMETAL method is used to identify the key factors that induce multiple interest conflicts in the construction of smart city PPP projects to enhance the identification effect. The research shows that: the complexity of the project, the comprehensive quality of project personnel, and the differences in ideological and cultural concepts have become the main factors. Project social benefit, project quality compliance rate, project profit rate or rate of return become the most important result factors. Government behavior is the primary influence and restriction of the interest conflict in the construction of smart city PPP projects. In addition, interest conflicts are closely related to other project stakeholders, especially the private sector, social capital, and public behavior. Therefore, the government's decision-making behavior and incentive and restraint mechanism must first examine the interests of stakeholders and their behavior strategies, especially the behavior evolution trend under the government's incentive and restraint mechanism, which implement a flexible incentive and restraint mechanism.}

The raw coal output and growth rate in China from 2015 to 2021, the output of major coal-producing areas from 2018 to 2021, and the revenue and profit statistics of coal enterprises from 2017 to 2021 are collected and studied. The quantitative indicators (financial performance, EPI, and EADI) are selected to verify the results. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and moderating effect analysis are chosen to analyze the related explained, explanatory, intermediary, and control variables. Among them, there is an obvious positive correlation between the EPI and the EADI of coal enterprises, and the EPI of coal enterprises has a positive impact on financial performance. The EADI of coal enterprises plays a partial mediating effect on the impact of EPI on financial performance. Additionally, the correlation analysis determines the correlation between EPI, EADI, and the financial performance of coal enterprises. Finally, the regression analysis is carried out again by replacing variables. The regression results are consistent with the previous conclusions, increasing the empirical results' robustness. It is concluded that improving the EADI will give enterprises better future financial data.}

This study demonstrates that the innovation network is driven by the activities of searching, acting, and convincing actors of an opportunity to develop smart city solutions. The findings also show that innovation networks emerge not solely from a business goal, but also from a social goal and can still generate business opportunities for companies. Therefore, innovation for smart cities specifically requires a new form of configuration (public–private and citizens’ participation), drivers (economic and social), and resources (technological and non-technological) in both its development and implementation.

AIMS-SB helps to predict energy analysis, renewable energy production, and recycling evaluation based on prediction model strategies. AIMS-SB developed eco-design monitoring systems for smart buildings to optimize energy consumption, utilization, and drain characteristics. These efficient implementation strategies and methods for harnessing renewable energy help to improve the safety process, recycling, and reuse of our energy resources for smart building energy management.

The process of change in the smart cities between 2012 and 2017 was mapped and three primary trends in performance and efficiency were identified. The final status reached by the 32 cities was predicted according to the three trends. To more effectively implement smart city initiatives, two evolutionary routes for smart cities are proposed. The findings demonstrate that the performance of smart city implementation is consistent with economic development but not with efficiency. The status of smart city implementation is not static; it depends on the context of the city and can shift between the four city categories.

abstract = {The world is facing substantial challenges related to population growth and the derived pressure on environment, energy, and other natural resources. Cities contribute to these problems due to the ever-increasing urbanization. As a solution, smart cities are managed and optimized across traditional boundaries and through the exchange of information between physical objects, citizens, and stakeholders. However, there are barriers in the development of smart cities that should be overcome in order to meet these challenges through smart cities. The main barriers identified in this work are poor private-public participation, utilization of fossil fuels, lack of attention to the environment, insufficient internet technology (IT) infrastructure, and old technology throughout the cities. To overcome these barriers, policies must be implemented to improve private-public participation by encouraging public investments and a wider adoption of electrical vehicles that may act as storage device and provide ancillary services to the electricity grid; reduce the use of private cars; strengthen IT infrastructure, deployment of smart technology to allow residents to monitor and control their energy consumption, installation of roof-top solar panels, and better mobility and efficient public services supported by smart technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance the interconnection among smart city systems.}

One such application area lies in the field of human–computer interaction, where it can improve user experiences by allowing systems to adjust based on users’ emotional states by leveraging the capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate more responsive interactions. The increasing demand for precise and immediate emotion analysis across various applications drives the need for FER utilizing deep transfer learning (DTL). In this study, a novel Mist-Fog framework for real-time FER is introduced, which employs a DTL algorithm called Mobile-Net for quick and easy image classification on mobile and embedded devices. It addresses the challenges of operating deep neural networks (DNN) under limits on power and processing resources. By utilizing depth-wise separable convolutions, the MobileNet algorithm reduces computational complexity while maintaining reasonable accuracy on the FER-2013 dataset. A Fog-based architecture, in which a mist layer comprising edge devices like Raspberry-Pi (RPi), an ARM-based single-board computer, was considered for a smart city scenario. Further, the M/M/1/K queuing system was considered, which follows the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling criteria and a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) arrival rate to evaluate the system’s performance. The effectiveness of this novel approach towards industrial computer vision paradigms is assessed pertaining to different performance criteria.}

One of the main challenges that resulted from the exponential spread of IoT is the dense number of nodes with the huge amount of data over different networks that influence the collision probability, and network congestion. Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques.}

This article uses the research object of the smart city construction model to study the advantages of smart city construction based on big data and rational planning theory and its impact on people’s lives. This article differs from previous qualitative research on smart cities, from the perspective of quantitative research based on the dual difference method to assess whether smart cities can provide a new impetus to economic growth. The results of the research show that the construction of smart cities can significantly promote regional economic growth and the DID rate is stable between 0.054–0.059 and the construction of smart cities can promote regional economic growth by 5.4% to 5.9%. Improving the efficiency of urban enterprises, thus leading to regional economic development. Building a smart city requires residents to be able to live independently, seek development, serve others and serve society using media and information technology. There is a link between promoting the construction of smart cities and improving the media literacy of residents. Improving media information literacy of residents will help fully unleash the vitality of smart city construction.}

abstract = {The smart cities agenda has garnered considerable interest recently as the spread of mobile technologies and notions of ‘big data’ have opened possibilities for promoting greater efficiencies in urban metabolisms. This has been particularly prominent in the realm of environmental sustainability, where smart technologies have been viewed as a way of reducing traffic congestion and delivering energy efficiencies. Key to these aspirations is the way in which technologies are seen to interact with human behaviour and how digital technologies can promote behavioural change through the provision of ‘better’ information. However, smart city programmes adopt a particular intellectual and pragmatic framing of behavioural change that we argue is fundamentally narrow and unambitious, raising concerns about how behavioural science is mobilised, by whom and its potential to promote sustainable urban futures. First, we propose that the focus in smart city narratives on quantitative data and insights from ‘big data’ is methodologically narrow and is representative of a highly individualised, libertarian paternalist perspective that privileges rationalistic and atomised understandings of behaviour. Second, we argue that the logic of smart cities leads city governments towards a focus on superficial change and the language of ‘encouraging’ shifts in individual behaviour that presents a distraction from the urgent need to reconfigure city infrastructures for low carbon forms of living. Third, we explore how such behavioural change approaches are fundamentally didactic and often lapse into assuming that publics are the passive receivers of ‘smarter’ information rather than active citizens who can question, campaign and present alternative visions to those of corporate-government interests. In this way, we argue that the suffusing of the smart cities and behavioural change agendas act as a neo-liberal distraction to the ways in which cities can develop to support the priorities of human and ecological wellbeing.}

A travelogue describes Kochi as ‘magical without any trace of trickery’. It is among the 100 Indian cities selected to be transformed into a smart city. The population of the city region is expected to reach 2.27 million by 2031. This drastic increase calls for an urgent examination of several key aspects of the city infrastructure in order to ensure that Kochi is able to live up to the standard of a smart city. It is important to ensure the quality of urban development by studying the city's location at the junction of several ecosystems. Further, this paper looks beyond the smart city vision to making Kochi a creative city as well. Kochi has a unique mixture of ethnicity, culture, architecture and cuisine owing to the influence of traders from around the world as well as various parts of India. Thus, Kochi possesses the potential to push creative, knowledge-based economic activities. Strategies should be developed to encourage education and employment generation such that a creative class of people and occupations can flourish in the city.}

Traffic noise indices measurements were carried out using sound pressure level meter (SLM). The prediction of equivalent A-weighted sound level (LAeq) and the sound level exceeding 10 percent of the time (L10) is carried out using various influencing factors such as number of cars, number of 2 wheelers, number of 3 wheelers, number of heavy vehicle, number of medium commercial vehicles, and traffic speed. The findings demonstrate the ANN model's proficiency in comparison of MLR model for providing precise prediction accuracy of traffic noise indices with a R2 of 0.94 for LAeq and 0.91 for L10. Furthermore, the frequency spectrum analysis reveals that high peaks were observed at lower frequencies ranging from 31.5 Hz to 50 Hz, middle frequencies from 500 to 800 Hz and higher frequencies from 3.5 kHz to 5 kHz. The noise maps at varying intervals revealed that most of the locations are having higher noise levels due to increase in vehicular movement. The study emphasizes on the potential significance of the proposed neural network-based prediction model in collaboration with noise mapping as a vital tool for the anticipation of traffic noise levels and the formulation of noise mitigation strategies in context of the mid-sized smart city like Dhanbad, India.}

This data fusion approach determines the exact level of congestion for a given place by combining sensory data with crowd reactions. In addition, OSRM employs a road communication system to detect real-time traffic variations and choose the least congested route. Furthermore, a sensor station for gathering the speeds and pollutants of moving automobiles on the road has also been established. An Android app has been developed to collect public information on blockages A driver of an Exigency Vehicle (EV) is directed towards a medical facility with the quickest, congestion-aware path by means of the Application software service.

For this purpose, they conducted representative surveys in 287 Polish cities, taking into account 5 groups of parameters related to the subsequent stages of the evolution of smart cities. According to the obtained results, the key barrier to the development of smart cities in Poland is the unsatisfactory level of prosperity of the residents and the difficult financial situation of cities, which means that the vast majority of the surveyed areas are not able to attempt to get closer to the Smart City 1.0 generation. In contacts with stakeholders, Polish cities prefer the triple helix model, focused on business cooperation and creating favourable conditions for commercial entrepreneurship. Relationships of higher order helices (with communities or ecological organisations) are not a priority for them, which may contribute to the aggravation of urban pathologies in the form of unsustainability and socio-economic exclusion. Conclusions and recommendations resulting from the research contribute to the economics of smart cities and can be used in the practical improvement of the process of their creation and development.}

Thus, this study explores how SVC contributes to achieving the SDGs at the city level. We performed the Cross-Network Information Analysis protocol, which is properly designed for investigating dyadic phenomena. The main findings revealed that SVC contributes to most SDGs in cities, mainly 11, 17, 9, and 8. Consensus building, smart sustainable cities, and innovation ecosystems are central aspects of the SVC contribution to the SDGs in general. Other relevant aspects are: shared meaning, networking strategy, socio-spatial & cultural patterns, technology, circular economy, sharing economy, corporate social responsibility, entrepreneurship, social bricolage, knowledge sharing, open innovation, ethics, and creativity. However, there has been no empirical evidence of SVC contribution to reaching the SDGs 5, 14, and 15.

The sophistication of the energy networks and their critical function make energy management one of the most challenging urban centers' problems. The essential methods are widely used to determine intelligent technologies' technical and policy impacts for modeling and simulation Planning to move from existing towns to smarter ones. Energy consumption has been increasing due to the growing population and intensified in dense metropolitan centres. It has changed Energy consumption, resulting in a strong demand for oil and electricity and more pollutants and heat production in these urban areas. This paper looks at energy-related work on smart city models and planning by classifying their spectrum based on active and passive approaches and infrastructure management models. The purpose of this paper is to examine economic performance determinants and to determine the energy protection requirements of smart cities for efficient energy management based on active and passive models. Further, the paper’s principal approaches include the economic study of upgrades to infrastructure, leading to a decline in the smart cities' energy demand identified by the street lighting intelligent diode (LED). Our results indicate that smart city models are designed to pursue alternatives to promote more clean energy sources on grids with smart linked urban energy storage systems. Our findings may be of great concern to city planners, municipal residents, and urban decision-makers interested in smart cities' design and operation.}

However, despite the recent large-scale development of smart cities in China, it is still uncertain whether smart cities could effectively promote urban resilience. Exploiting the quasi-experimental nature of smart city development in China, this paper uses DID and PSM-DID to determine their impact on urban resilience. Four aspects of urban resilience are analyzed: economic resilience, social resilience, ecological resilience, and infrastructure resilience. The results show that the development of smart cities can improve social resilience considerably without any obvious effect on economic and ecological resilience and even negatively affect infrastructure resilience; the distribution effect, technological effect, and structural effect are important mechanisms for smart cities to influence urban resilience; and smart cities that have a sound industrial structure, enough good-quality companies, large size, and a large pool of highly-skilled labor are much more likely to be associated with a high level of urban resilience. Policy suggestions are also provided to promote the simultaneous improvement of smart cities and urban resilience, and hence help establish a new ‘urban resilience’ model.}

abstract = {Unprecedented urbanization and rapid population growth have increased waste generated annually posing challenges to cities globally. The annual World Health Organization reports indicate that many people die from preventable diseases as a result of improper waste disposal and management. The provision of garbage bins is inadequate in the management of solid waste in smart cities. The major problem is that garbage bins fill up quickly, and it takes time for the municipal workers to empty the bins. This paper focuses on a real-time smart garbage bin mechanism for solid waste management in smart cities. Conventional garbage collection and management systems have many shortcomings, including inaccessibility to actual data required, lack of throughput, and late unloading. The mechanism proposed accesses real-time information of any smart garbage bin deployed across the city and helps to resolve the problem of waste overflow from garbage bins and keep the smart cities clean. Fuzzy logic is applied in the strategic deployment of smart garbage bins across the smart cities. The system is implemented on Net-logo which is widely used in multi-agent modelling environments. The significant advantage of the system is its novelty in real-time decision-making and real-time monitoring using the fuzzy logic process.}

Rooftop photovoltaics is a promising solution for sustainable energy production in urban environments. Understanding their potential and their obstacles is critical for their better performance and establishment, both in financial and environmental terms. The main factors that influence solar photovoltaic efficiency are the percentage of sunlight and the power capacity, that's why many studies have proposed various installed power capacity assessment models and they have tried to analyze the so-called shadow effect. Ιn a more inclusive context, smart energy or renewable cities, an advanced term of smart city scenario, are a concept that implies that not only individual owners will benefit of the advantages from renewable sources, but whole places will integrate physical, digital, and human systems in traditional networks and services to better use energy resources and reduce emissions to the benefit of citizens and businesses. Already many countries around the world, with several policies and proposals, are promoting more sustainable urban areas with the use of latest smart technologies and renewable energy sources. Examples given from many different countries are analyzing the installation process, the financial benefits, the local policies, and other factors that affect rooftop PVs in various study cases. The concept of Smart Renewable Cities refers to cities that are willing or have already made a commitment for a green transition focusing on the production of electricity by the use of renewable energy sources, mainly solar and wind energy. Smart city, smart energy city, and smart renewable city terms are developed and analyzed with corresponding examples and references at global and local level.}

Indeed, the deep and rapid penetration of renewable energy-based technologies have been believed to very well fit into a smart city under various scales, this could supply a secure basis for a modern society with a low-carbon economy. In this review paper, the main components and roles of renewable energy resources (such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, and biofuels) for the smart city were fully introduced. Besides, integrating the renewable sources form into the energy systems of smart cities was thoroughly analyzed on the basis of technical and economic criteria. Finally, existing challenges and future scenarios were also discussed in detail to clarify the progress and perspective of smart renewable energy systems for the smart city. In general, the integration of renewables into energy systems of the smart city is a sagacious perspective and solution aiming to achieve cleaner process and more sustainable development. However, the optimization issues of the energy system for integrating of renewable components, ensuring good stability, maximizing the operating range, and minimizing the investment costs should be critically evaluated in the future works.}

Each sustainable application has its own set of requirements, including energy efficiency, Quality of Service (QoS), hardware, and software resources. Even though green IoT devices operate in a resource-constrained environment. Monitoring, recognizing, and responding to activities that entail continuous access to timely information in a partially or fully distributed ecosystem is a difficult task. To overcome the challenges of resource management in the IoT, we proposed an energy-efficient Dynamic Clustering Routing (DCR) protocol using a neuro-fuzzy technique for restricting the resources of IoT devices. The proposed protocol uses a dynamic self-organizing neural network to create dynamic clusters in a network. The test-bed analysis is for computing the real-time event detection and clustering sensor nodes using TinyOS. The simulation result shows that the proposed protocol achieved a significant gain over peer-competing well-known green communication routing protocols like Low-energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Low-energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy-Centralized (LEACH-C). The proposed model results show that using neuro-fuzzy logic is effective for sustainable IoT devices and green smart city applications in terms of resource management and dynamic clustering. The result analysis shows that the proposed protocol shows an average 35% significant gain on the First Node Dies (FND), Last Node Dies (LND), the number of packets sent to CH & BS, network convergence time, network overhead, and average packet delay to compare with the LEACH and LEACH-C.}

The urgency to mitigate the pandemic has generated severe effects on society in general, such as economic paralysis, the annulment of social conviviality, the threat to employment and the non-existence of various accessibilities. However, cities should not disappear and have seen a huge adaptation to technologies and an unprecedented digital transformation coupled with good governance practices in order to minimise the effects of these disruptive blockages. Thus, the objective of this study is the measurement of smart performance in cities in pandemic times. To respond to this objective, the composite index of Rodrigues & Franco (2019) for city intelligence based on the subdimensions governance and ICT was adopted, thus following the quantitative methodology and resorting to secondary data. Moreover, this index measures the adjective smartness distinct from smart, whose adoption by cities provides a smart way to solve their daily problems. The sample covered the 308 Portuguese cities and towns, commonly known as municipalities. The results obtained still show some weaknesses to be overcome by municipalities in the future, if they opt for a continued commitment to governance models based on ICT, although the future path is challenging, so that the returns of these strategies are converted into effective offers of hard and soft amenities to citizens, in which urban networks play a key role, with exponential effects on the new demands of citizens regarding their quality of life, given that the pandemic has manifestly changed their behaviours and lifestyles. Finally, the final considerations, implications for theory and practice, limitations and future research agenda are presented.}

This paper contextualizes its research within the theoretical literature of smart cities, innovation, knowledge management, and governance and compares 17 smart city pilot projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. The cases were selected according to the research objective and analyzed using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The findings show two paths of city-wide scale-up, which we term “bureaucratic tailoring” and “low-uncertainty partnering.” This article makes three important theoretical contributions. First, it is possible for smart city pilot projects to scale-up to an entire city through different paths. Second, differentiating the role and capabilities of the municipality in terms of these different paths and in relation to the other governance conditions is essential. Third, the social perception of technological uncertainty is not static but fluid, and is highly related to other governance conditions. Future-oriented policy makers might find the paths explained here useful for anticipating how projects might scale-up.}

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has been widely used in sustainable smart city construction due to its advantages such as low price, good maneuverability and strong flexibility. However, as the heterogeneity of smart city systems and the high mobility of UAV network nodes cause them to face more serious security threats, ensuring the security and authenticity of message is crucial for UAVs to correctly perform the tasks issued by the command center. To fix the above-mentioned issues, many digital signature schemes have been presented in recent years. Regrettably, most existing schemes either have security vulnerabilities or poor performance. Very recently, He et al. came up with a certificateless designated verifier proxy signature (CLDVPS) scheme and advocated that it was secure. But, we find that their scheme cannot achieve its stated purpose because it fails to resist user impersonation attack. We put forward a new CLDVPS scheme to address the data security and privacy issues in UAV networks. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme can realize a higher security level while greatly reducing communication and computation overheads. Compared with related schemes, our scheme is more suitable for the application of UAV network in sustainable smart city.}

abstract = {Visually-impaired people encounter a series of challenging tasks in their daily life that are easy to the majority of society. For example, crossing a street, which is a critical task for a pedestrian traveling in a city, actually involves a set of orientation and navigation sub-tasks. The typical form of assistive technology as a solution today for street crossing relies upon an accessible pedestrian signal (APS) usually in the mode of audio signals broadcasted at a cross street. As popular as such APS is, there are various pain points to visually-impaired users who are trying to rely on conventional APS when crossing a street. Given the prevalence of smartphones among the visually-impaired around the world, there is still a vacuum in the literature as to the possibility of providing them, through a smartphone, a safer solution to address those pain points so that users can more confidently walk across a street. In this paper we look at how mobile technology relevantly helps the visually-impaired to cross streets more comfortably and confidently by presenting an action-research-based case of developing and deploying a smart accessible pedestrian signal system (SAPSS) in Taiwan. Originated from an ability-based design principle so as to ensure accessibility, the system integrates hardware, software, and a user-side mobile app into an enhanced solution for the visually-impaired to comfortably cross a street. Two field tests by 19 visually-impaired end users help modify the system and confirm its usability. From the positive feedbacks of these test participants, SAPSS has been formally deployed in three cities in Taiwan. This case study reports the development, the tests, and the deployment of the system in detail and also discusses implications of such a new generation assistive technology in the development of smart cities.}

The research explores message transmission challenges via the lens of applications such as taxi sharing, ambulance services, and other emergency services that rely on real-time traffic data provided by the smart traffic domain to work successfully. Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are employed in a range of areas due to its advantage in rapidly establishing networks.

Since workload at fog nodes can anytime see sudden changes in demand, hence load migration among fog nodes becomes viable. However, improper migration can lead to further migrations, eventually decreasing performance. In this paper, we present a multi-channel queuing model based smart distributed service management approach and an intelligent resource-aware forecasting technique to predict the required context and resource management. The scheme accomplishes live migration by a resource-aware ensemble forecast method that used current and predicted resource utilization and their context availabilities to address the delay requirement for cross-domain IoT applications.

These constructs are used as layers in smart cities, and relevant literature is reviewed to highlight the key factors and groups related to each layer. A conceptual framework is provided for smart city management and an assessment mechanism presented for measuring and testing the performance of smart city integrated processes. This is achieved by measuring and controlling the cost of quality non-conformance, right documentation in the first time, and timely implementation of control measures, the activity processing index, and quality controls. Improvement construct has a percentage of 35.67 % share in the DMADICV framework followed by define (16.76 %), design (15.52 %), control & verify (14.33 %), measure (10.08 %), and analyze (8.15 %). The top ten factors for managing smart cities through the Six Sigma method include process quality improvement, organizational development, process analysis, quality management, cost control, DMAIC, change management, project management plan, waste reduction, process quality measurement, and value creation, respectively. The DMADICV framework and its dynamic relations are shown through a system model and its key groups represented in layers of the smart cities whereby the city governance and management teams can provide services to their smart citizens effectively and efficiently. The proposed DMADICV method and associated smart city management framework are a humble addition to the body of knowledge that can be adopted and utilized in other knowledge fields.}

We use an inductive qualitative case study approach based on connecting emergent concepts through Gioia's method to answer the following research question: “How can hybrid organizations manage a complex network of actors in smart city initiatives?”. The study highlights that in managing smart city initiatives, hybrid organizations benefit from actor-network theory. Additionally, for a more in-depth view, the study investigates the framework provided by Chourabi to test the hybridity theory. Overall, the results suggest that hybridity is feasible and increases the output directed towards citizens. The paper contributes to the existing literature on both hybrid organizations and smart cities. We conclude that despite the conventional distinction between public and private entities, managing smart city initiatives that include complex factors such as new technologies may require the adoption of hybrid management solutions by urban planners, especially when multidisciplinary and complex skills are required. Thus, smart city solutions are most effective when combined with hybrid management models. This research has utility for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers. It aims to support practical management solutions (analysed through a theoretical lens) to foster smart city initiatives.}

abstract = {Nature inspired artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are gaining traction in air quality modeling. A mathematical simulation of how air pollutants distribute and react in the atmosphere to impact ambient air quality is known as air quality modeling. Modeling aids in estimating the correlation between pollution levels and their impacts on air quality. Outdoor ambient air quality is important because it affects indoor air quality. Unprecedented growth of urban agglomeration, population blast, and unrestricted use of natural resources as well as nonrenewable fuels eventually results in higher pollution and driving the world away from the sustainable development goals. Rising air pollution levels around the globe is an alarming situation for all lifeforms. It also affects the nonliving things such as structures, metals, and water bodies. In this chapter, to predict air quality in seven Indian smart cities, a data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) is merged with particle swarm optimization (PSO), a nature-inspired optimization technique. The PSO technique presented in this chapter functions as an ANN optimization technique. The data were obtained from the online web repository called Kaggle. The data-sets for 12 pollutants were selected for 7 Indian smart cities. The datasets were recorded during the last 5 years from 2016 to 2020 and were included for computation. Models can be used by air quality managers to forecast the effects of prospective new emissions. Policy makers often use models to predict ambient air pollution concentrations under various scenarios as a decision-making tool. Because of the robustness and effectiveness of AI models, the public will be able to get early warning for a high concentration level of pollutants in big cities, potentially lowering cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. The findings proved PSO's outstanding performance while evaluating high-dimensional data.}

Smart cities can offer various smart applications such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, smart banking, among others, for boosting the life quality of citizens.

One can enable smart cities with a blockchain to offer enhanced security via storing transactions in a secure, transparent, decentralized, and immutable ledger. However, both blockchain and smart cities are in their infancy and significant research efforts are needed to integrate them. In this paper, we comprehensively review the role of blockchain in enabling IoT-based smart cities.

In the case of the ASCN, technocratic regionalism is used to spur urban development through the rollout of smart city plans, policies and projects across Southeast Asia. As such, it is a regional strategy designed to scale smartness, and thus deprovincialise the city by embedding it within transnational flows of capital, ideas and expertise. At the same time, however, already existing urban issues have the potential to re-provincialise the city. The vagaries of local contexts, structures of governance and urban cultures complicate processes of scalar ascendency and thus foreground the paradox of (de)provincialisation. We identify three challenges – divergent infrastructural developments, vertical and horizontal (non-)integration, and the need to reconcile (in)formal spaces of the “smart” city – that underpin the translational politics of technocratic regionalism, and which are likely to compromise the efficacy and success of the ASCN.}

The paper offers extensive empirical analysis in the three cities of Bhubaneswar, Pune and Chennai that are among the first 20 smart cities prioritised for implementation. We first analyse how the governance framework provided by the Smart Cities Mission in India unfolds at three spatial scales – national, state and local – with the intersection of the scales differing in the three cities. Second, our analysis of the new form of governance involving public–private actors shows the conflict of responsibilities on a local scale. In conclusion, we highlight the absence of collaborative governance and reduced capacity in local governments – as significant challenges for smart city development in India.}

Due to the problems arising from urbanisation, local governments construct smart cities as inherent innovative advantages that can improve their level of science and technology, and efficiency in resource allocation, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Through this innovation-driven channel, shocks to the degree of city smartness can have a significant impact on the regional environment. In order to compute the sensitivity of urban pollution to the degree of city smartness in China both conceptually and empirically, we modify a theoretical model of classic land allocation decisions to demonstrate how local officials’ responsibilities to protect the ecological environment and promote economic growth can lead to the long-run spatial expansion of smart cities, resulting in the improvement of EEQ. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, we find that from 2005 to 2017 period, smart city initiatives in China reduced industrial exhaust gas and industrial wastewater by approximately 20.7% and 12.2%, respectively, such that most of the reduction may be attributed to the technology effect and allocation effect of urban innovation.}

Based on a media analysis on national and local scales, the paper shows that the smart city effect is an entangled phenomenon. Generally speaking, it consists of a lexical glue that holds together processes of data-driven neoliberalisation of urban governance. However, at municipal level we observe more variegated effects of reverse-scale policymaking, labelling and territorialisation where the smart city appears as a more-than-mobile but also as a more-than-local urban policy.}

Walkability-enhanced ICT (WICT) caters to pedestrian needs and preferences by providing intelligent real-time information as a person strolls in an urban environment. Governments invest heavily in various ICTs and big data as part of their planning decisions in smart cities. The walkability enhancement enabled by integrated ICTs needs to be evaluated by urban planners, but this aspect is not covered in previous studies. WICT is usually provided free of charge to users. The benefits enjoyed by pedestrians are intangible with a non-market nature. This research looks into the walkability performance of WICT by evaluating its benefits to pedestrians. A survey was carried out in Hong Kong for a WICT installable in smartphones. The Contingent Valuation was used to evaluate the non-market benefits quantitatively, employing ordinal regression. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) is estimated as the proxy of monetary value for the benefit enjoyed by individual users, which may be aggregated for a Cost-Benefits Analysis. This econometric approach intends to assist in decision making for continued investment in similar information systems of Smart City. Influential factors affecting WTP are also highlighted for targeting policies. Recommendations for city managers are proposed to establish a rational basis for planning smart cities.}

Additionally, using text mining in reviews can help summarize, detect patterns, and better explore papers. The proposed methodology (and code) is reproducible and can be applied to different research fields. As a case study, we systematically review smart road space allocation literature and the role of big data and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in promoting emerging urban solutions. Even though, recently there has been a significant rise in studies related to smart cities and big data, few papers consider these approaches in road space allocation. On the one hand, temporary solutions are mainly held in local access streets to achieve place-making and reclaim vacant public spaces. On the other hand, intermittent and dynamic solutions are mainly studied in arterials and highways and focused on traffic performance. Ultimately, new road space allocation proposals are not sufficiently studied where there is a high dispute and limited space to allocate space. Big data and smart technologies have the potential to collect real-time data and adapt the infrastructure according to fluctuations of demand and also in case of an unpredictable event.}

Such a scenario also comprises the interpretation of smart cities as tools to assist policymakers and city administrators in directing solutions based on emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) to the materialization of urban strategic plans addressing these confrontations. There are, however, no established indicator systems that attest to the substantiation of such plans by smart city solutions, nor to their alignment with the goals of urban sustainable development. Therefore, an analytical framework is proposed here to address this knowledge gap. It enables guiding the leverage of smart cities’ ICTs, not only for the achievement of economic goals, a feature intrinsic to smart city innovations, but also to reach other sustainability dimensions, as the environmental, social, institutional and cultural. To this end, generic sustainability indicator frameworks and also a set of smart city indicators are explored. They are examined as potential sources of specific taxonomies in smart city services for urban sustainable development. From this compilation of options, the Dashboard of Sustainability, once one of the indicator systems most recommended by experts, is revisited. It is adapted as a framework for analyzing and helping to maintain the strategic targeting of smart city solutions, during their entire lifecycle, at sustainability. To complete the qualitative-analytical-taxonomic frame, the services offered by a real smart city solution, the Rio de Janeiro Center of Operations, are employed as a model. This allows investigating its 9-year transition from a wider, larger capacity, strategic and innovative configuration in orientation towards sustainability perspectives, to a more narrow, operational composition, that is predominantly devoted to the economic dimension.}

Smart cities primarily rely on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to manage and maintain its service offerings. In literature, clustering and multihop routing techniques have been proposed, validated and implemented to reduce the consumption of energy in the network. With this motivation, the current study develops Adaptive Parallel Seeker Optimization-based Energy Aware Route Planning Technique (APSO-EARPT) for clustered WSN in smart cities. The presented APSO-EARPT technique concentrates on appropriate selection of Cluster Heads (CHs) and optimal routes in WSN. To accomplish this, APSO-EARPT model encompasses Weight-Based Clustering Scheme (WBCS) for effective selection of CHs. Then, routing process is performed with the help of APSO algorithm. The proposed APSO-EARPT technique computes a Fitness Function (FF) that comprises of three variables such as Residual Energy (RE), distance to Base Station (BS), and node degree. This fitness function helps in optimal selection of routes in WSN. In order to validate the supremacy of the proposed APSO-EARPT model in terms of network lifespan and energy efficiency, simulations were conducted and the results confirmed the excellent performance of the proposed model.}

5G has taken off at a brisk speed over the years, bringing significant benefits to the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wireless sensor nodes. The launching of 5G technology provides an excellent opportunity for the faster development of smart cities. Nanogenerators (NGs) have been widely demonstrated as sustainable power sources and self-powered active sensors. The last 15 years of research on NGs have revealed that it can contribute to the digitalization of smart city services, such as localized renewable energy supplies, intelligent transportation, smart vehicles, and digital healthcare applications. The integration of novel NG technology in smart cities will solve problems pertinent to sustainable power sources for decentralized IoT devices and provide pathways for realizing self-powered active sensing systems. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive review of current research on NGs’ applications in different sectors of a smart city. More importantly, we will show how NGs can be a game changer in the development of smart cities under 5G services and how the usage of NGs can boost the convenience of city dwellers. Our aim is to draw more attention to NG applications in the digitalization of smart cities and provide a guideline for applying smart concepts in future urban planning.}

abstract = {In a typical smart city, drones can collect (or sense) massive amount of data, that is sent to a computing capability for further analysis to make useful decision making without human intervention. This data is relayed to the Cloud for processing and analysis due to its large-scale infrastructural capabilities. However, the key goal of the drone deployment in smart city scenarios or urban environments is to provide timely and quick response alongside providing an energy-efficient service delivery. Thus, we need a sustainable solution that can be deployed locally (closer to the data source) in a smart city, to process or analyze the data (generated from smart city sources) and provide timely decision making for smart city applications. Edge computing, popularly known as the “cloud close to the ground”, can provide computational and processing facilities at edge of the network in a smart city. Hence, Edge computing act as an effective alternative solution to process and analyze the data closer to the point of it’s generation. Looking into the above discussion, We propose a novel drone-edge coalesce that provides an energy-aware data processing mechanism for sustainable service delivery in the multi-drone smart city networks. In this model, the edge computing layer is deployed to process and store the data sensed and collected by drones in a smart city. In this context, an adaptive edge node selection mechanism has been designed on the basis of decision tree approach. In this coalesce, we have to deal with the conventional problems related to the collision and congestion while providing low-latency and sustainable data transmission in a smart city. So, We have designed an energy-aware multi-purpose algorithm that avoids collisions and provides a congestion free data transmission. The proposed coalesce is validated in a simulated environment on the basis of several performance metrics such as, throughput, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.}

By applying this strategy, the amount of light and the energy consumption of LED light sources is restricted under conditions where no activity occurs in the environment or the level of the performed activity is limited. The results of system simulation and implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.

The collection of waste is important in smart city service and smart technology has great potential for increasing garbage collection efficiency and quality all around the world. This is a waste of resources since garbage is emptied even half-full, city resources are misused, and vehicle gas is wasted. High costs and poor effectiveness are the two main problems with smart city garbage collection. This problem can be solved by recycling since it reduces the garbage that has to be disposed of and protects valuable storage space. Although the recycling rates are rising, estimates predict that people can generate more waste than ever before. A key focus of machine learning is developing algorithms that can acquire and utilize information in the learning process to make future predictions. Therefore, this paper’s automatic machine learning-based waste recycling framework (AMLWRF) has been proposed to classify and separate materials in a mixed recycling application for improved separation of complicated waste. The major goal of this research is to examine machine learning algorithms utilized in recycling systems. This paper suggests the ML and Internet of Things (IoT) for smart waste management to overcome this problem in the smart city. The IoT-powered devices may be installed in waste containers including recycling bins and it gives real-time data on garbage generating behavior. Image processing may be used to calculate a dump’s garbage index. They offer a clear picture of trash and recycling trends and suggestions on improving productivity. This research compiles the most recent advances in recycling-related machine learning.}

abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have emerged with energy conservation systems for managing energy in cities as well as buildings. Although many studies on energy conservation systems of smart homes have already been conducted, energy management at the city level is still a challenge due to the various building types and complex infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigated the research themes on smart homes and cities through a quantitative review and identified barriers to the progression of smart homes to sustainable smart cities through a qualitative review. Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the “bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)” are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level. This paper is expected to play a leading role as a knowledge-based systematic guide for future research on the implementation of energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities.}

The study aims to improve the efficiency of power inspection in power enterprises and provide intelligent technology for power inspection. After the theoretical analysis of IoT and RFID technology under the background of smart city, the study discusses the information acquisition principle of RFID technology. Second, based on IoT and smart grid, the study takes the power equipment of power company A as an example, and puts forward the power inspection scheme, including the information required for inspection and the inspection of primary and secondary equipment. The specific contents are as follows: health assessment is carried out according to the real-time alarm of power equipment, and the control command is sent to the downstream control equipment to confirm the alarm information. Meantime, based on the alarm information of power equipment and related equipment, the expert analysis system is used for reasoning and analysis, and the RFID tag is used to supervise the inspectors to arrive at the site and inspect the situation according to the predetermined route. The temperature of the cable of power company A is measured under normal and hidden dangers, and the body insulation test is conducted on No. 1 main transformer. The results show that under normal operation, the cable temperature at each point is slightly different, which is basically about 40 °C. The temperature before the fourth point of the cable rises obviously, indicating that the fourth point has faulty. Over time, the more chemical molecules are detected in phase A. When phase B and phase C are tested on the same day, the difference of chemical molecular content is relatively small. It indicates that the chemical molecular content detected by chromatographic test of bulk insulating oil is normal. To sum up, smart power, as the objective need of urban intelligent development, is an important foundation of smart city. The power inspection scheme based on IoT and RFID technology proposed has high detection efficiency.}

In this article, we argue that the main challenges policymakers confront in deploying these technologies are organizational rather than technological. To do so we draw on research from science and technology studies on sociotechnical systems and interviews with city government officials to characterize smart cities as large technological systems, which are immense, interconnected systems that consist of not just of technologies but organizational and institutional processes. We then use this analysis to identify challenges and opportunities affecting North American smart city initiatives. We find that disparate – and at times competing – stakeholder motives inhibit the deployment of smart city technologies, including in ways that preserve privacy and security, creating organizational challenges that we argue must be overcome for smart city initiatives to succeed. We conclude by drawing on the perspectives of local policymakers and science and technology studies to offer pathways for local governments to overcome these organizational challenges through collective action and facilitate smart city development.}

However, data privacy becomes a real issue. This problem can be addressed by using federated learning trusted authority principle. In this paper, we investigate a novel federated deep learning approach to urban traffic flow forecasting that graph learning, and trusted authority mechanism. The road network is first pre-processed to eliminate the noise from the traffic data. Next, detecting anomalous features is performed to prune irrelevant edges and patterns. The generated graph is then utilized to learn a graph convolutional neural network for calculating the future city’s traffic flow. We extensive evaluate our federated learning-based framework, where a case study on predicting the future traffic flows has been carried out using multiple datasets. We examine it with different baseline techniques as well. The findings show that the suggested framework greatly outperforms the baseline methods, particularly when the graph has a lot of nodes. Importantly, our approach is the first one that integrates trusted authority principle in federated learning and, by doing so, it is able to efficiently secure model data. Moreover, the average precision of the developed model reached 84%, while the baseline solutions did not exceed 77%.}

A traffic flow prediction model is constructed based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) algorithm. The target road section and its historical traffic flow data in Tianjin are collected and pre-processed. Then, several Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are stacked together to form a DBN, which is trained as a generative model. Finally, its performance is analyzed by the simulation experiment. The algorithm model proposed is compared with Neuro Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) model, Deep Learning Architecture (DLA), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the algorithm model proposed are 4.42%, 6.21%, and 8.03%, respectively. Its prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that of the other three algorithms. In addition, the algorithm can effectively suppress the spread of congestion in the smart city, achieving timely evacuation of traffic congestion. In short, the constructed Deep Learning-based traffic flow prediction model has a high-precision prediction effect and traffic congestion evacuation performance, which can provide experimental references for the later construction of smart cities.}

Short delays in communication between vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), smooth traffic flow, and road safety are the key challenges of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). The rapid upsurge in the number of road vehicles has increased traffic congestion and the number of road accidents. To fix this issue, Vehicular Networks (VNs) have developed many new ideas, including vehicular communications, navigation, and traffic control. Machine Learning (ML) is an efficient approach to finding hidden insights into ITS without being programmed explicitly by learning from data. This research proposed a fusion-based intelligent traffic congestion control system for VNs (FITCCS-VN) using ML techniques that collect traffic data and route traffic on available routes to alleviate traffic congestion in smart cities. The proposed system provides innovative services to the drivers that enable a view of traffic flow and the volume of vehicles available on the road remotely, intending to avoid traffic jams. The proposed model improves traffic flow and decreases congestion. The proposed system provides an accuracy of 95% and a miss rate of 5%, which is better than previous approaches.}

To address these problems, various studies have been conducted to determine an improvement method for the energy performance of aged buildings by adopting the smart city concept. However, because they have primarily focused on the software aspects of monitoring and control using IT technologies, studies on the hardware aspects (that is, the characteristics of buildings and renovation techniques for energy saving) that affect energy performance have been underrepresented in the context of smart cities. Therefore, by using the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, this study aims to analyze the causal relationship by examining how the characteristics of buildings and energy-saving techniques affect the energy performance of EU smart city projects. To implement SEM for depicting causal relationships, a case study based on 55 building cases on 11 EU smart city projects was conducted, and the significant direct/indirect effects of hardware aspects on energy-saving performance were successfully suggested.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely utilized as the major significant element of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for feasible smart cities due to the capability of IoT for supporting sustainability in numerous domains. There is a need for fault avoidance via the continuous and dynamic utilization of network behavior for achieving the necessary quality of the IoT communication system that allows us to get sustainable enhancement in smart cities regarding IoT communication systems. While considering the IoT-assisted network, the basic part of the IoT model is considered a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), especially for data management that consists of various sensor nodes in the smart city area. Moreover, every node in a WSN is considerably utilized for a specific reason and thus, every node is handled by a battery that increases the consumption of energy in the entire smart city scheme for processing the data regarding communication. On the other hand, there exist various limitations like scalability, communication latency, centralization, privacy, security, etc. Thus, this paper plans to develop the IoT and WSN-based smart city application using novel intelligent techniques, aiming for the optimal performance classification of the network. The infrastructure of IoT will consist of WSN, Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET), Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Here, the efficiency of the whole IoT system is acquired from the efficiency of the whole IoT module. Hence, the IoT network efficiency rates of the individual must be predicted in an earlier stage to predict the effectiveness of the complete IoT system. The efficiency of each network is forecasted with the help of the constraints such as energy consumption, gathered data size, transmitted data size, mobility, false positive, throughput, packet loss, and delay. The output from each network is considered as input to the Optimized Recurrent Neural Network (ORNN) for predicting the ending superiority of the whole IoT network. Here, the parameter tuning in the RNN is done by the Self Adaptive Honey Badger Algorithm (SA-HBA). The empirical outcomes confirmed that the designed method has forecasted and enhanced the superiority of a whole simulated IoT system in an accurate manner. Throughout the result analysis, the given designed method attains minimum energy consumption rate and also better prediction accuracy.}

Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods.}

However, the extant studies primarily focus on business-led smart city projects. Little attention is paid to the causal relations between organizational conditions and technology enactment in government-led projects. Therefore, there is a research gap concerning what conditions of governmental organizations, singly or jointly, drive technology enactment in smart city projects. To fill the gap, this article establishes three increasing levels of smartness and formulates four government conditions. Based on this conceptual framework, this article explores different configurations of organizational conditions that lead to varying levels of smartness. It uses the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method to study 11 smart city projects in Hangzhou, China. The results generate three configurations of organizational conditions that lead to decisional intelligence, indicating that multiple pathways exist to achieve the highest level of smartness. These configurations often emphasize the significant role of human resource pressure in driving decisional intelligence. But no single condition is necessary because when human resource pressure is absent, strong financial capacity, good information-sharing, and facilitative leadership can work together as a substitution.}

Smart manufacturing, characterized by the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, offers the potential to reduce energy consumption, emissions, and enhance productivity. This study investigates the influence of the low-carbon city pilot (LCP) policy on smart manufacturing and its underlying mechanisms. Leveraging data spanning 2003 to 2020 from China’s A-share-listed manufacturing companies, several key findings emerge. First, the LCP policy exerts a significant positive impact on the smart manufacturing capabilities of companies operating within LCPs. Furthermore, this impact strengthens over time. Second, a company’s innovation and effective resource allocation act as active mediators in the correlation between the LCP policy and smart manufacturing, whereas government intervention plays a positive moderating role. Lastly, state-owned manufacturing companies exhibit a lesser positive effect from the LCP policy compared with their non-state-owned counterparts in terms of smart manufacturing. Moreover, the positive effect of the LCP policy on manufacturing companies in cities with traditional industrial bases is relatively smaller than that in cities with emerging industrial bases. Building upon these findings, this study offers targeted recommendations to promote smart and sustainable manufacturing.}
