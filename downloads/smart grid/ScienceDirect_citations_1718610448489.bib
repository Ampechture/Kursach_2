abstract = {This study investigates the convergence of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) with traditional grid systems, culminating in the development of smart grids. Orchestrated by electricity utilities, these smart grids offer innovative applications and services, generating substantial data earmarked for cloud-based processing. To reinforce sustainability in financing mechanisms, this research strategically incorporates digital twin technology, optimizing smart grid operations. Employing a fog computing approach, we focus on enhancing cloud data center efficiency at the cloud's edge. A comprehensive four-tiered framework is introduced to mitigate power shortages affecting utility companies and end-users within the context of net-zero energy integration. The cluster layer forms the foundation, interconnecting structures with the smart grid layer, acting as a vital link between the fog and cloud layers and the underlying infrastructure. A comparative analysis of load balancing algorithms, including the Artificial Bee Colony Optimizer (ABCO), Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), and Time-Varying ABCO (TVABCO), reveals TVABCO's superior response and processing times. These findings, aligned with green bonds and public–private partnerships, signify a crucial step towards sustainable energy integration in future smart cities. The integration of digital twin technology enhances precision and optimization, adding depth to this transformative journey.}

abstract = {In this study, the challenges of incorporating PV systems and wind energy sources into smart city power grids are addressed. The fluctuating nature of renewable energy is considered, and microgrid energy management is investigated using probabilistic and deterministic assumptions. To enhance energy management, digital twin simulations are employed, providing a virtual representation of the power grid. This enables accurate analysis and prediction of system behavior in different scenarios. Digital twins help simulate the effects of load profiles on microgrids, facilitating better energy planning and decision-making. The proposed framework considers objective functions related to cost reduction, voltage profile improvement, and voltage stability enhancement. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is applied to solve the complex and nonlinear energy management problem, aiming to minimize costs and enhance voltage stability. Simulation results show that an optimally installed PV system and wind turbines reduce energy costs and improve overall system efficiency in smart cities. Furthermore, the objective function of WOA outperforms particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution algorithm (DEA) in achieving the desired outcomes.}

abstract = {In this paper, the performance of smart city network infrastructure is studied using space shift keying (SSK) modulation and radio-frequency (RF) based energy harvesting with cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. Here, the Wireless-enabled sites can communicate data to the control unit via the access point (AP). The sites function by utilizing an energy-saving mechanism, which leads to a notable improvement in spectral efficiency. The Markov chain considers the number of active sites in the network dynamically. Moreover, energy harvesting-assisted AP helps overcome the rising demands of the city by providing an enhanced data rate, low latency, shorter coverage, widespread connectivity of the massive number of sites, and energy efficiency. The channel between sites to the AP is Nakagami-m distributed, whereas the AP is connected with the control unit through the free space optical (FSO) link. The FSO link is modelled with Gamma–Gamma distribution with pointing error impairments. The mathematical equations for average bit error probability (ABEP) are obtained for smart cities by considering mixed channels and utilizing the multi-user selection combination. The Monte Carlo simulation technique verifies the accuracy of the numerical results. According to the findings, using SSK modulation in combination with energy harvesting strategies can enhance the effectiveness of smart cities.}

However, after decades of research, governance mechanisms remain among the most undertheorized and relatively overlooked dimensions of smart city transitions. To address this problem, we conduct a systematic literature review that connects the fragmented knowledge accumulated through the observation of smart city transition dynamics in 6 continents, 43 countries, and 146 cities and regions. Our empirical work is instrumental in achieving a threefold objective. First, we assemble an overarching governance framework that expands the theoretical foundations of smart city transitions from an innovation management perspective. Second, we elaborate on this framework by providing a thorough overview of documented governance practices. This overview highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the current approaches to the governance of smart city transitions, leading to evidence-based strategic recommendations. Third, we identify and address critical knowledge gaps in a future research agenda. In linking innovation theory and urban scholarship, this agenda suggests leveraging promising cross-disciplinary connections to support more intense research efforts probing the interaction patterns between institutional contexts, urban digital innovation, and urban innovation ecosystems.}

Language-conditioned robot behavior plays a vital role in executing complex tasks by associating human commands or instructions with perception and actions. However, most language-conditioned policy-related research is limited to specific datasets and cannot generalize across different environments. In this study, we propose a novel imitation learning framework tailored for language-conditioned robotic tasks. Our framework includes specialized encoders designed for various benchmarks and utilizes two distinct models: the Transformer and Diffusion models. We rigorously evaluate this framework in three different robotic environments. Our findings indicate that the framework consistently delivers superior performance across multiple domains. Notably, we observe that the Transformer model is particularly effective in managing tasks with long trajectories, whereas the Diffusion model demonstrates enhanced proficiency in generating trajectories from limited training datasets. Our approach showcases remarkable generalization capabilities across a range of tasks and achieves significantly higher success rates in task completion.}

A new design for an electromagnetic road energy harvester is proposed, and its performance is evaluated through numerical simulations and experiments. The new method can generate sufficient electricity to run the low-power facilities of the smart cities in real-time and provide enough power for further applications using energy storage devices. Unlike the current road energy harvesters, the new harvester has a compact design, negligible mismatch risk between the components, and is more compatible with high-speed roadways. It can be used as road rumbles, transverse rumbles, or smooth speed bumps with a minimal vertical displacement of a maximum of 25 mm. It is shown that the harvester can illuminate LED light bulbs of 2 W at a displacement of 18 mm, which is compatible with the required depth of road rumbles. This power generation level satisfies sensors and IoT requirements and can also be stored for large-scale applications.}

At present the only battery energy storage is available, and it is effective only for storing modest quantities of energy for short periods of time. The other storage technology options are not often commercially available items; rather, they are just good concepts that need to be tested for viability. Currently, the only alternative options for turning an urban development into one that exclusively uses green energy is to use that energy to generate hydrogen through electrolyzers, then use this fuel to generate the required electricity in order to stabilize the grid. Even more appealing is the idea of using wind and photovoltaic energy to transform smart communities into a centre for producing hydrogen in addition to a city that solely uses renewable energy. The most likely solution, absent an urgent debate inside the science establishment, will be to import electricity from the burning of hydrocarbons while continuing to pay carbon offsets, which is incompatible with the goal of using only renewables. The smart city has not officially accepted this issue, just like the science establishment.}

This approach significantly boosts blockchain transaction rates and scalability. However, employing IPFS introduces its unique challenges, particularly in having nodes that stop participating at any given time. Therefore, we also present effective strategies for managing a large number of consumers and introduce a model for optimizing IPFS storage while ensuring data durability.

Question, however, remains whether the accumulation of these attributes results in tangible benefits for local residents. To answer this question, we compare different metrices of city smartness with several indicators of intra–urban income disparity and environmental performance, using data available for 100+ major cities worldwide. As the analysis indicates, the proliferation of internet technologies and the number of universities the city hosts, i.e., popular ways of advancing “smartness”, are not related to either intra–urban income disparity or environmental performance of cities per se. We thus suggest that the transition of cities towards greater smartness should be focused on people's needs and ICT-using skills, not on ICT proliferation per se. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that links the level of city smartness with intra–urban income inequality and environmental performance of cities and substantiates these links empirically. By accumulating this knowledge, the study helps to understand better the smart city phenomenon and its impact on urban development.}

The enormously rising population in cities brings with it numerous problems that need to be deeply addressed. New approaches are required in solving many issues such as the management of scarce resources in the city, and the access of city residents to clean air and water. The smart city concept, which freshly emerged with the approach of adapting advanced technological facilities to city administrations, may be able to assist to cope with these problems. The levels of embracement and implementation of the smart city concept play a fundamental role in the well-being of people living in urban areas. Measuring smart city performances, especially in metropolitan cities, can guide the management of local or national investments to improve society's quality of life. In this study, the smart city performance assessment of 30 metropolitan municipalities in Türkiye using a two-stage methodology is included. The scores of smart city index indicators determined by the literature review for Türkiye were calculated using MEthod based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC), which is a recent multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. In the second part of the methodology, 30 metropolitan municipalities were ranked based on weighted criteria using another MCDM approach Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS). The methodology is compared with different MCDM approaches. As a result of the study, it has been revealed that the best city according to the methodology is İstanbul. Also, Antalya, İzmir and Konya have also been among the prominent cities with high smart city scores. The aim of this study is to contribute to the analysis of the issues where the investment should be focused on by measuring the smart city performances of metropolitan cities.}

Also, the suggested technique maintains minimum lighting levels and satisfies users' visual comfort. The proposed strategy can also be applied to a wide variety of demands in a building. By categorizing loads as fundamental and flexible, comparable patterns can be defined to control other flexible loads in a complex. Results from the system simulation confirm the precision of this technique. According to the results, for variations in BIPV production, the control system applies the necessary settings based on the defined algorithm and regulates energy consumption and lighting levels. This method is recommended to develop more sustainable and smarter cities.}

Integrating digital technologies into urban areas affects individuals differently based on their sociodemographic factors such as age, academic degree, income, and gender. There are various studies on smart cities social risks, however, the relationship between sociodemographic factors and social risks in smart city development programs has not been thoroughly understood to date. This paper aims to prioritise social risks for smart city development and to investigate the correlations between these risks and sociodemographic factors by conducting a questionnaire survey. The results revealed that social exclusion is the highest social risk, and older adults and females are the most sensitive sociodemographic groups regarding smart city risks. The finding also indicated that income and academic degree have no meaningful correlation with social risks. This study highlights the significance of social risks and their correlations with sociodemographic factors for developing smart cities. It enables city authorities and local governments to create an effective risk management plan for their smart city development programs.}

Smart public lighting systems are designed using LED light sources in combination with a controller based on light intensity and motion sensors to control the brightness in working areas as per standard requirements. The control of smart public lighting systems is designed to operate in three modes: manual, scheduled, and auto modes, which are tested and compared in terms of lighting and power quality. Other functions of IoT, such as air pollution detection, security system-based video surveillance, and warning systems for flood disasters, are integrated into smart public lighting systems. A prototype of the designed smart public lighting system is presented in this paper. The parameters of average illuminance, overall uniformity, and threshold increment were implemented using DIALux software to optimise the luminaire spacing. The results showed that the goal of energy saving could be achieved using the auto mode. Although the automatic mode caused current harmonic distortion to the electrical grid, the harmonic value was less than the specified standard. Furthermore, the precision of IoT system operation was dependent on environmental variations and the reliability of wireless network technology.}

Nonetheless, the environmental aspects of urban sustainability are often de-emphasized in favor of discourses around the technical characteristics of SC technologies. In order to integrate the two, the article introduces the notion of a smart green city (SGC) in which technological means and environmental outcomes are in sustainable balance. SGC is presented here as a unifying concept integrating smart city and green city concepts through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework. To illustrate the positive synergy between a city's greenness and smartness, we derive operational definitions of both based on the online media's attention to the related technology and sustainability initiatives. After calculating the two indices for all the cities worldwide with over one million inhabitants (498 cities), regression analysis is performed to determine the strength and direction of the relationships between a city's greenness and smartness. We find that a city's greenness is positively related to its smartness. Principal component analysis reveals a potential relationship between a city's population and the two indices. In particular, a large city's population negatively affects its greenness but positively affects its smartness. A joint index of smartness and greenness is negatively related to a city's population. Hence, the containment of uncontrolled urban growth is critical for successfully implementing SGC initiatives. The analysis results are of use to policy-makers, city managers, and planners intending to integrate the ESG framework into their future urban development strategies. Moreover, to our knowledge, a joint evaluation of a city's greenness and smartness has never been performed before on the inter-regional level of analysis. Accordingly, such a holistic assessment can be of methodological interest to scholars of smart and sustainable cities.}

Thanks to the integration of shared storage technologies, these power systems allow for higher penetration of distributed renewable generation (DGs) and better mitigation of imbalances between demand and generation. This responds to social and environmental requirements in terms of decarbonizing energy and also contributes to strengthening smart cities. DC (Direct Current) microgrids offer several advantages compared to AC (Alternating Current) type microgrids, like superior efficiency, better control, stability, compatibility with the DC nature of renewables and storage sources, and the absence of reactive and synchronization problems. However, before fully exploiting the potential of microgrids in renewable-powered smart grids, it is necessary to conduct further research and discussion on critical technical and socio-economic challenges. This paper presents a review of the existing state-of-the-art research in DC microgrid development, relevant challenges related to security, communication, power quality, and operation, as well as the appropriate control and energy management strategies to handle them. As control and energy management strategies considerably impact other performance indicators such as operating cost, emissions, and power system safety, this paper offers a perspective on the potential improvement of such management solutions.}

The advent of generation mobile systems, the so-called 5 G in the early century, has realized this dream. 5 G can provide network services with extremely-high throughput and extremely-low delay and allows a huge device number to connect based on Internet infrastructure, forming the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has been applied in various fields serving humanity, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, education, military, and IoT ecosystems. One of the main challenges of IoT applications is computing solutions to reduce service response times. This study proposes an efficient edge computing management mechanism for IoT applications in smart cities. Our mechanism proposes a small database (called an information map) that allows edge computing servers of smart cities to store edge service information. When the mobile end-users move to the new edge server' managed coverage, properties related to the EC service are exchanged between the edge servers. The experiment results have shown that our proposed mechanism improves service response time and energy consumption many times compared to the traditional mechanism. We hope that this mechanism will be strongly applied to sustainable smart cities in the future.}

Based on smart cities policy in China, a quasi-natural experiment is conducted by using the Heterogeneity - Robust estimator in differences-in-differences model. According to detailed theoretical analysis and rigorous empirical research, and main conclusions are as follows. First, the construction of smart cities can directly expand the green space due to the land resource allocation. The above basic conclusion remains reliable after a series of robustness tests. Second, the effect of construction of smart cities on the green space is heterogenous. The construction of smart city in the three batches has a positive impact on expending green space and the strongest positive effect on green space is seen in the smart cities established in 2012. The high-level economic scale and high-level science and technology are vital premises for smart cities to expand green space. Third, the construction of smart cities can indirectly expand the green space by promoting online work and services and increasing disposable income. Last, the “Broadband China” Strategy has a positively moderate effect on the construction of smart cities in expanding green space.}

However, we know very little about the roles and effect of smart city policy in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution. Using Chinese city-level panel data, we investigate the impact of national smart city pilots on satellite-derived ground level NO2 concentrations by Difference-in-Differences method. The results show that the smart city policy is conductive to mitigating the NO2 concentrations in pilot cities, especially for the cities with large population, high administrative hierarchies and located in eastern China. In particular, the mitigation effect of first round smart city pilots is greater than the second and third rounds. The mechanisms of smart city policy mitigating NO2 concentrations is to optimize energy structure and advance treatment technology, rather than directly reduce fossil energy consumption. Therefore, smart city policy may be a win-win choice for developing countries to break the trade-off between air pollution and economic development.}

A comprehensive empirical analysis follows, revealing a noteworthy reduction in mean squared error and root mean squared error with increasing iterations, reaching a minimum of 0.007 and 0.103, respectively—figures that are the lowest among all considered machine learning models. Moreover, the mean absolute percentage error value is remarkably low at 0.0923. The data illustrate a gradual decline in average prediction error and standard deviation throughout the model optimization process, indicative of both model convergence and heightened prediction accuracy.

The increase in supply-side energy production is one method of alleviating peak demand proposed by a few investigations. As peak loads last for a short time, additional installations might be required. In addition, facilities that store energy can be used to reduce peak demand. As a consequence of the previous investigation, interruptible load regulation was not taken into account in optimizing system performance. The regulation of interruptible loads can greatly reduce system peak loads in smart city and within the concept of microgrids (MGs). The study proposes an interruptible load scheduling (ILS) scheme that considers consumer subsidy rates with the goal of reducing the peak load of the MG and its operating prices. To this end, a digital twin is developed in which the consumer interruption load time and minimal per-day load decrease restrictions have been completely met in the scheme. The ILS model is solved using a combination of the Min-Conflict Algorithm and the Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested algorithm and the show the substantial benefits of the scheme in reducing peak loads and operating prices in smart cities.}

The detection of such hotspots can serve as a valuable organizational technique for framing detailed information about a metropolitan area, providing high-level spatial knowledge for planners, scientists, and policymakers. From the algorithmic viewpoint, classic density-based clustering algorithms are very effective in discovering hotspots characterized by homogeneous density; however, their application on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. For such a reason, since metropolitan cities are characterized by areas with significantly variable densities, multi-density clustering approaches are more effective in discovering city hotspots. Moreover, the growing volumes of data collected in urban environments require the development of parallel approaches, in order to take advantage of scalable executions offered by Edge and Cloud environments. This paper describes the design and implementation of a parallel multi-density clustering algorithm aimed at analyzing high volumes of urban data in an efficient way. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed parallel clustering approach takes out encouraging advantages in terms of execution time, speedup, and efficiency.}

In addressing this challenge, smart city enterprises are strategically deploying smart grids to implement innovative Demand Response (DR) programs. These initiatives aim to optimize energy consumption by incentivizing citizens through public–private partnerships and exploring financing avenues like green bonds, thereby fostering sustainable and resilient urban energy ecosystems. The initial contribution of this paper introduces an energy management (EM) approach. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) procedure is implemented to address the comprehensive planning problem across three researches: one without SOLAR batteries, one with SOLAR systems, and one incorporating SOLAR batteries. The model aims to decrease energy prices, mitigate peak-load, reduce carbon dioxide discharges, and prevent rebound peaks, ultimately enhancing user comfort. Simulations are conducted to match the efficacy of this proposed approach with obtainable ways. The results demonstrate that the recommended ACO procedure effectively reduces energy prices, carbon dioxide discharges, and peak loads across various researches. Consequently, this ACO procedure-based EM routine outperforms existing benchmark approaches. Meanwhile, digital twin (DT) technology is reshaping the renewable energy sector by offering virtual replicas of physical systems. This article delves into the applications, advantages, and challenges associated with digital twin modeling in renewable energy. The technology entails the creation of virtual replicas for renewable energy systems, integrating real-time data to facilitate precise simulation. Key advantages encompass accurate prediction, dynamic monitoring, and the optimization of energy production. The synergy between digital twin modeling and smart grids enhances flexibility and bolsters grid reliability. Nevertheless, challenges include ensuring data security, managing system interconnectivity, and addressing computational demands. In essence, digital twin modeling presents a pathway for realistic representation and efficient management of renewable energy, although challenges must be navigated to unleash its full potential.}

The results show that smart environment services should be prioritized for all population groups, while the differences in priority among older adults, people with lower digital literacy, and people with lower income were relatively small. On the one hand, the supply of SC services should be prioritized for those that are closely linked to citizens’ daily lives, have a long-term impact on communities, and are targeted to large user groups. On the other hand, priority should be given to those services that meet citizens’ demands for physiological, safety, and self-actualization needs.

To this end, the current paper aims to provide a research agenda reviewing the relevant literature that touches on smart technologies during emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a systematic methodology centred on text mining analysis, our research identified the following three themes: (a) emergency response, which covers emergency management, traffic and unmanned aerial vehicles, waste disposal, and contact tracing; (b) motivation and outcome, which includes such sub-themes as smart urbanism, quality of life and the economy; and (c) technology and data, which covers social media, machine learning, Internet of Things, data-driven applications, and object detection.

With the growing number of smart initiatives implemented in SCs, it becomes important both to consider how such initiatives are planned and organised, and to address the complexity and context-dependent dynamic in which such initiatives are implemented. Therefore, this study is a comprehensive analysis of number of initiatives in 12 Spanish SCs (1635 smart initiatives) to identify the relations between key characteristics of the cities (cities and citizens' profiles) and the planning of SC strategies. Findings suggest that formal strategic planning is mainly performed in SCs with higher qualification of inhabitants, mature-aged population, and top-down strategic planning approach.}

This shows that more research needs to be done in this difficult area to find new and potentially big benefits for society. Although smart cities offer residents and providers of capital several advantages, there are numerous ways that breaches could compromise the safety and security of individuals. As a result, several different recommendation designs can coexist in the IoT. This research examines the effects of ethics and technology on the security of IoT-enabled systems in smart city infrastructure. Hence provides a secure IoT network architecture for smart cities combining blockchain and deep learning to safeguard privacy and credibility. This research presents a Secure Smart City Infrastructure using Blockchain and Deep Learning (SSCI-BDL) framework to ensure privacy protection and trustworthiness among IoT communication in smart cities. This framework involves the blockchain network for security management in the smart city infrastructure. This framework integrates the deep learning model with an optimization algorithm that maintains efficient resource utilization in the smart city infrastructure. The simulation results show that the system has high security of 99.5% and the lowest latency rate of 4.1% compared to existing models. Overall, the proposed framework’s efficiency gives the highest rate of 99.8%.}

Among them, the promotion effect of eastern and central cities is noticeable, while western cities have a restraining effect. (2) The impact of smart city construction on carbon productivity has a time-lag effect. The pilot policy will take effect in the third year of implementation and reach its maximum value in the fifth year. (3) Smart city construction can improve urban carbon productivity through technological progress, industrial structure upgrading, and energy structure optimization.

We find that (1) smart city construction has reduced PM2.5 concentrations by 5.34%, and the reducing effect is increasing over time. The results remained valid after overcoming endogeneity problems and passing a series of robustness tests. (2) Smart city pilots have spatial spillover effect, which has a positive impact on PM2.5 of cities within 50km, while significantly reduces PM2.5 of surrounding cities within 50km-250km. (3) The PM2.5 reducing effect of smart cities is primarily the result of technological effect and allocation effect generated by promoting innovation and industrial upgrading.

The research covers the examples of three Polish cities: Gdansk, Warsaw and Wroclaw. We checked how this concept is explained and narrowed down to the framework of the city's strategy and legitimized by city makers. Each of the stories expounds the vision of the city, ways of achieving goals and the approach to residents as users. That might give weight to the nuanced idea and translate into the real urban policy. The conclusions of the study suggest that the smart city concept does not fundamentally change urban policies, but is rather inscribed in the adopted directions and vision, e.g. the city which was wanted to be perceived as academic, identifies “smart” with cooperation with the science sector etc. The results also show that smaller cities that use new technologies more modestly must look for other ways to refer to smart cities for strategic purposes. The empirical basis was the implementation of individual in-depth interviews with city officials, which was supplemented by an analysis of planning, strategic and reporting documents.}

Their sensors capture detailed information about an object’s functionality through their use of various sensors. It is possible to gain a deep understanding of the object’s performance and potential areas for improvement by collecting data, which includes metrics such as energy output, temperature, and weather conditions. Digital twins are becoming important in a variety of research and industrial application sectors as production lines and processes become more digitalized and as improved data analysis techniques such as machine learning and enhanced visualization techniques are used. There is no unified definition of the digital twin concept in scientific literature, which results in imprecise applications and the weakening of its terminology. However, this study demonstrates how digital twin models can be applied to urban drainage systems. As a result, this highlights the relatively novel use of digital twins within the field of urban water system engineering. Our review of the language, practices, and directions in smart stormwater management provides a framework to organize and comprehend the current research landscape while highlighting crucial areas for future research. Our results demonstrate that there is near-unanimous agreement within the literature that smart technology has been, or will be, advantageous for stormwater management. However, while some progress has been made in terms of quantity management, maturity in water quality management has not yet been achieved. This study examines the scientific literature on digital twins in the application of artificial intelligence for smart city stormwater infrastructure systems, specifically focusing on urban drainage systems. A demonstration of the workflow and features of current digital twin applications in urban drainage systems is also presented, providing valuable insights and guidance for future research and development in this field.}

Under such a context, it is of great significance to arrange effective and comprehensive evaluations on the construction level of these smart cities. Based on the development realities of cities in China, this study arranged an in-depth analysis of the current literature and policies and established an evaluation system with five dimensions and 30 indicators. The entropy method and TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) were comprehensively applied to evaluate 15 new first-tier cities in China. The study results demonstrated that these 15 new first-tier cities still had a relatively low smart level, and the gaps among different cities were significant. Because of the differences in the emphasis of the smart city construction of various cities, their performances under different dimensions were widely divergent. Among the five dimensions, smart infrastructure, economy and life had poor performance compared with smart governance and the environment. In addition, some recommendations were initiated to boost the construction of smart cities in China, including accelerated construction for new infrastructure, more emphasis on the digital economy, acceleration in the development of important mechanisms, etc.}

A smart municipality in a smart city is a concept in which a digital municipal corporation is developed to provide comprehensive local government collaboration services based on digitization and automation aiming towards raising the living standards of citizens. Interoperability between heterogeneous services for collaborative tasks creates challenges for data security and privacy. Ensuring integrity and confidentiality of information is critical, and reliable data is essential to both the government and its citizens. In this paper, we proposed a service security architecture based on authentication and authorization for constrained environments during collaborative tasks for Software Defined Networking (SDN) and smart contract-enabled municipal smart cities. The proposed collaborative service security framework is being tested on the Multichain Blockchain networks. We present a novel method for using smart contracts in multichain blockchains for data security during collaborative tasks in smart city municipal architecture. The proposed security solution is based on the dynamism of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions securely between different heterogeneous IoT networks. We implemented a supportive use case for collaborative services in an SDN-enabled IoT architecture to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed service security architecture.}

This study focuses on the development of a precise and rapidly convergent STLF model within the context of digital twin technology for renewable energy integration. To enhance prediction accuracy, we employ two widely recognized methods: mutual data-enabled attribute selection and a modified flower pollination algorithm (MFPA) aimed at error reduction. Additionally, we adapt heuristic algorithms and training procedures for artificial neural networks to expedite the convergence rate of our comprehensive prediction approach. Through extensive simulations, our findings demonstrate that this proposed prediction method achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.5 percent while significantly reducing the average runtime, by 52.38 percent, compared to traditional bilevel forecasting approaches.

Moreover, engineers, architects, and designers deal with city planning, for smart and floating settlements as a difficult design challenge, and evolutionary algorithms could be employed to address this complex problem by optimizing residents' needs. As a continuation of our previous studies on this topic, this time, we develop a multi-objective continuous genetic algorithm with differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy (MO_CGADE) and a multi-objective ensemble differential evolution algorithm (MO_EDE) to solve the problem on hand. Then, we compare the performance of the MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) to maximize two conflicted objective functions, namely, scenery, and walkability in the proposed smart floating city model created in the Grasshopper Algorithmic Modeling Environment. The parametric model that we create in the Grasshopper software includes 64 decision variables, area constraints and objective functions to be optimized by MO_CGADE, MO_EDE, and NSGAII algorithms. Computational results show that MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms generate better Pareto ranking results than the traditional NSGAII algorithm in terms of cardinality, distribution spacing, and coverage metrics.}

When evaluating urban energy execution, it was critical to include the energy contribution as an appraisal pointer. Although there was a negative relationship between population thickness and urban energy execution, the temperature record, urbanization rate, and family vehicle possession were all extremely associated with urban energy execution.

abstract = {Intelligent transportation management, as an important component of intelligent city supervision, has practical value in improving the effectiveness of urban management. To improve the efficiency of intelligent city traffic management, this study proposes to use convolutional neural networks to improve the performance of navigation and intelligent transportation networks in intelligent transportation. This network is used for vehicle recognition in navigation to predict road congestion and determine the optimal driving path. This structure is applied in the intelligent road network to monitor the driving status of vehicles on the road. It is combined with the vehicle networking system to locate abnormal vehicles to achieve intelligent traffic management and supervision. These results confirm that this algorithm achieves a vehicle recognition accuracy of 91.2 % after 96 iterations and completes the recognition process within 163 ms. This algorithm converges to a vehicle positioning accuracy of 82.4 % after 93 iterations and achieves positioning within 277 ms. This algorithm can not only improve the optimal path planning effect of navigation, but also identify abnormal vehicles within 77 ms. Therefore, the proposed algorithm has high practical value in intelligent transportation management.}

The smart city is a key answer that will allow us to continue with our regular lives during and after the epidemic. To better serve its citizens, a smart city takes advantage of modern technology and innovative solutions in areas including healthcare, educational, energy provision, transport, and communications. Applications of the Internet of Things have led to the development of "Smart Cities" all around the globe. In order to further the development of smart cities toward effective sharing and interconnection, this study will examine the smart city data technology based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing (CC). Initially, we gather IoT data based on the smart cities. The gathered data is normalised. Machine learning sets the way for the IoT, which allows machines to communicate with one another without any human intervention. So we utilize machine learning algorithm called Advanced Random Forest (ARF). For multi-criteria optimization, we suggest Adaptive cloud computing virtual machine resource allocation technique (ACC-VMRA). We analyse and simulate the use of IoT and CC technologies in a smart city to verify its efficacy. The experimental finding demonstrates the recommended optimization algorithm's superior efficiency to other currently used techniques.}

IoT (Internet of Things) systems are at the centre of smart city applications, as traditional cloud computing is insufficient for satisfying the critical requirements of smart IoT systems. Due to the nature of smart city applications, massive IoT data may contain sensitive information; hence, various privacy-preserving methods, such as anonymity, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, have been utilised over the years. Furthermore, limited concern has been given to the resource consumption for data privacy-preserving in edge computing environments, which are resource-constrained when compared with cloud data centres. In particular, differential privacy (DP) has been an effective privacy-preserving method in the edge computing environment. However, there is no dedicated study on DP technology with a focus on smart city applications in the edge computing environment. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive study on DP in edge computing-based smart city applications, covering various aspects, such as privacy models, research methods, mechanisms, and applications. Our study focuses on five areas of data privacy, including data transmitting privacy, data processing privacy, data model training privacy, data publishing privacy, and location privacy. In addition, we investigate many potential applications of DP in smart city application scenarios. Finally, future directions of DP in edge computing are envisaged. We hope this study can be a useful roadmap for researchers and practitioners in edge computing enable smart city applications.}

The way of the MCDM combined with geographical information system (GIS) techniques provides a significant aspect to consider when developing a flood risk model or early warning system. A case study of flood risk assessment in the Shanghai is used to demonstrate the application of the MCDM techniques incorporating GIS to assess flood risk of metro system. The assessed flood risk of metro systems provides inceptive suggestions for designing flood prevention in metro systems. Based on the initial flood risk of metro systems, a large amount of data collected using 3S including remote sensing (RS), GIS, global position system (GPS) technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and wireless sensor networks, can be adopted to increase the accuracy of flood risk management for metro systems in smart city development.

Since the administrative authorities that manage cities often lack the knowledge and skills needed to transform their operations in this way, smart city initiatives usually involve a complex set of actors, from local urban authorities and their technical departments to small and large IT firms, academics, and civic organizations, as well as individual citizens. Mediating organizations are often set up to coordinate and manage such interactions. However, little is known about the roles and activities of such bodies. Using data from the Dublin smart city projects, this study draws on the concept of boundary spanning to develop a taxonomy of the work of such intermediaries. Divided into technical, political, social, and cultural domains, the study demonstrates the critical role of the work done by such bodies in enhancing collaboration among and the participation of a diverse group of citizens, IT and digital strategy departments of local authorities, universities and local/international IT companies (e.g., Google, Facebook or Airbnb), leading to a bottom-up governance style of leading smart city initiatives and projects.}

The findings indicate that: (1) Every 1% improvement in smart infrastructure reduces carbon emission intensity by 0.2810%. This effect is significant only in more advantageous geographic locations and non-resource-dependent cities. (2) Panel threshold regression analysis demonstrates a nonlinear relationship between smart infrastructure and carbon intensity, showing a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend under different energy consumption levels. (3) Mechanism analyses show that smart infrastructure affects carbon intensity through technological innovation and agglomeration effects. (4) Smart infrastructure exerts spatial spillover effects on carbon intensity with substantial spatial decay effects.

We reflect on approaches that leverage smart city maturity models to capture the evolution and trajectory of a city in its quest for smartness. By adopting the cross-methodology borrowed from the macroeconomics domain, we illustrate how a maturity model can be actionable in the sense that it can reveal the equilibria of supply and demand of a given smart city dimension or parameter. To evaluate this methodology, we study a well-known use case in cybersecurity, specifically incident response, against crowdsourcing, a key enabler of a data-driven circular economy. Our findings confirm that when crowdsourcing is injected into smart city infrastructure, the city's maturity is expected to increase as the additional capabilities can contribute to addressing cybersecurity incidents.}

The scale of this effort is unsuitable for a single player, instead necessitating joint efforts from multiple stakeholders. The global expansion of smart cities has subsequently led to increased research efforts toward building effective smart cities. In theory and practice, collaboration is pivotal for effective urban development, most often seen through the establishment of public-private partnership (PPP). Past research has explored these partnerships in smart city projects. Although PPP is considered to be an effective means to facilitate smart city development, the concept of smart cities remains rather vague and ideological. PPP for smart cities has been substantiated in several case studies; however, a thorough review is lacking. Therefore, to synthesize the existing literature, we carried out an in-depth integrative literature review. From this basis, we executed a content analysis and four key themes emerged: localness, stakeholder complexity, tension, and trust-building. These four themes form the basis of our proposed model and describe the key elements influencing PPP formation in smart city projects. We argue that the partnerships involved in smart city projects need further refinement to allow for transparency and involvement in various contexts. This paper provides timely contributions to smart city research by synthesizing the extant literature as well as laying the foundation for a future research agenda. Critical perspectives are also offered for future practitioners.}

In smart cities, IoT devices were utilized in several fields including energy, transportation, waste management, healthcare, etc., to improve the overall quality of life and sustainability of the populace. But, as the usage of IoT increases, the cybersecurity and data privacy become a concern of safety. An anomaly detection system helps to identify possible data breaches or cyber-attacks by identifying abnormal data patterns. Deep learning (DL) driven anomaly detection has emerged as an effective and powerful method for identifying abnormal behaviours or patterns in the data domain. This technique leverages the abilities of a deep neural network for automated learning of complex patterns and representations from data, which make it better for anomaly detection task where irregularities cannot be easily defined by handcrafted rules. This paper establishes a new Billiard Based Optimization with Deep Learning Driven Anomaly Detection and Classification (BBODL-ADC) technique in IoT-assisted Sustainable Smart Cities. The goal of the BBODL-ADC technique lies in the proper recognition and classification of anomalies in the IoT-assisted smart city. To obtain that, the BBODL-ADC system applies a binary pigeon optimization algorithm (BPEO) algorithm for the effectual selection of features. Besides, the BBODL-ADC technique utilizes Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) approach for the recognition and classification of anomalies. Moreover, the BBO system can be used for better parameters chosen by the ERNN algorithm. The stimulation value of the BBODL-ADC algorithm can be executed benchmark database. The achieved outcomes demonstrate the remarkable outcome of the BBODL-ADC methodology of 95.69% and 99.21% compared to existing models under dataset-1 and dataset-2.}

This research introduces a novel IoT-driven SPMS that leverages Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology, termed as IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN, to surmount typical restrictions related to communication range, energy usage, and implementation cost seen in traditional systems. IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN features intelligent sensing nodes that incorporate an Arduino UNO microcontroller and two sensors—a triaxial magnetic sensor and a waterproof ultrasonic sensor. These components collaboratively detect vehicle occupancy and transmit this data to the server via a LoRaWAN gateway. Notably, the integration of LoRa technology enables extensive network coverage and energy efficiency. Users are provided with real-time updates on parking availability via the accessible AllThingsTalk Maker graphical user interface. Additionally, the system operates independently, sustained by a solar-powered rechargeable battery. Practical testing of IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN under various scenarios validates its merits in terms of functionality, ease of use, reliable data transmission, and precision. Its urban implementation is expected to alleviate traffic congestion, optimize parking utilization, and elevate awareness about available parking spaces among users. Primarily, this study enriches the realm of smart city solutions by enhancing the efficiency of parking management and user experience via IoT.}

This article proposes an Information-centric Networking System using Multiaccess Edge Computing (ICNMEC) to reduce computation offloading and optimize data traffic. This system's 5G network slicing approaches combine edge computing and software characterization. Internet of Things applications have been used to store and analyze the information gathered. In addition, an algorithm known as OMNM (Optimized Memory Network Management) is created to control network traffic better and better use of storage. With minimal delays, network traffic, and storage ratio, the system's modelling tests demonstrate that it is very efficient. This method can progressively enhance the pace at which one can access and use the system. The performance assessment shows that the proposed method can improve the efficiency ratio of 95.141%, storage utilization ratio of 60.1% and access rate by 0.9, reducing network traffic and delay by 0.6.}

One of the main challenges in realizing the smart city vision is how to provide seamless interoperability between the IoE entities. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review on the use of semantic technologies to support interoperability between IoE entities in smart cities, with the goal of identifying the main trends and challenges in adopting semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient smart cities. To this end, we have extracted data from selected primary studies over the last decade that address semantic interoperability issues in smart cities through related technologies and techniques such as ontologies, linked open data, knowledge graphs, ontology alignment/matching methods, and automated reasoning mechanisms. We have analyzed the maturity of this research area by exploring three research questions that focus on: i) the importance of semantic interoperability in the smart city domain; ii) the identification of semantic technologies and tools applied in the smart city domain to promote semantic interoperability; and iii) the identification of smart city application areas where semantic technologies are used to efficiently deliver smart services. The analysis provided research insights, including the introduction of a new evaluation framework that assesses semantic interoperability solutions on four maturity levels. The framework includes specific evaluation criteria for attributes such as modeling, scalability, and availability. Finally, an elaborated list of strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of semantic interoperability solutions in smart cities is provided, along with a discussion of open challenges and future work in this domain.}

The heterogeneous tests show that the smart city's green technological innovation effects are heterogeneous by geographic location, urban population size, economic development level, and information facilities infrastructure. Moreover, the paper explores the role of green technological innovation as an essential mechanism of the other aspects of green development. The mediating effect analyses show that smart city can promote urban industry structure upgrading and green efficiency through green technological innovation.}

abstract = {The technologically endowed Smart Cities take credit for managing the COVID-19 pandemic more effectively than other urban centers. However, Indian smart cities seemed unprepared for the outbreak, with reported highest cases of death and positivity rates. Thus, it becomes essential to understand why these smart cities could not handle the pandemic despite their technologically advanced infrastructures and the citizen’s role in managing it. This paper analyzes the impact of the Smart City Mission (SCM) interventions from a citizen-centric perspective and its influence on pandemic management and citizen inclusivity. The study draws from the right to the smart city framework along with stages of the digital divide. The study conducted a content analysis using secondary sources like published and unpublished papers, policy reports, and news analyses spanning the timeline of 2015-2022. The analysis infers that the lack of initiatives to link marginalized citizens with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) through the SCM policy led to the underutilization of the various initiatives launched during the pandemic, deepening the digital divide. The deduction from the analysis highlights that the ‘chatur citizens’ act as a solution by transitioning their formal access to ICTs into effective access enabling the marginalized communities to bridge the divide.}

abstract = {The phenomenon of shrinking and aging populations has profound implications for socioeconomic sustainability and presents unique challenges for managing municipal solid waste (MSW). These challenges have yet to be comprehensively understood thus far. In this study, we focus on the Circum-Bohai-Sea area in China (CBS) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of MSW generation under the population shrinking and aging. Results showed that the MSW growth rate reduced from 3.2% (2011–2015) to 1.6% (2016–2020) with population shrinking and aging. Geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) revealed that disposable personal income and total population are the predominant drivers of MSW growth. In contrast, the population change rate and the proportion of elderly were the key factors for MSW reduction. Urban MSW reduction exhibited higher sensitivity to population shrinking, resulting in a 141.6% greater reduction compared to rural MSW for every 1% population shrinking. Conversely, rural MSW reduction displayed a greater response to population aging, with a 19.7% reduction more than urban MSW for every 1% increase in the proportion of the elderly. Based on scenario analysis, the smart city development will curb population shrinking (7.6%), while increasing the well-being, life expectancy, and population share of the elderly (3.4%). Future population shrinking and aging is expected to contribute to the growth of MSW, and this trend is further amplified by the development of smart city. However, smart city development led to MSW reduction overall with an MSW amount of 76.8 Mt (7.5% lower than in the business-as-usual scenario) by 2040, mainly attributed to smart sanitation technology. This study offers valuable insights for decision-makers in MSW management, not only in China but also for other countries grappling with population regression challenges.}

This paper assesses the impact of Smart Cities construction on urban entrepreneurial activity using the difference-in-difference (DID) model based on panel data from 265 prefecture-level cities in China from 2002 to 2019. The empirical results show that Smart Cities policies significantly enhance urban entrepreneurial activity. After the parallel trend and placebo test, the estimation results based on the PSM-DID (Propensity Score Matching-Difference in Difference) method are robust and consistent with the baseline regression results. The mechanism analyses indicate that the possible channels for Smart Cities policies to exert a positive impact on urban entrepreneurial activity are improving the city's ability to attract investment and enhancing technological innovation. Furthermore, Smart Cities policies have a more significant incentive effect on entrepreneurial activity in eastern regions, larger-scale cities, and cities with higher levels of service informatization and a larger scale of government financial expenditure. This paper contributes to the policy effects of Smart Cities pilots and the factors influencing entrepreneurial activity. This paper has important implications for enhancing entrepreneurial market dynamics and promoting urban transformation programs in developing countries to empower a sustained wave of urban entrepreneurship.}

abstract = {In the era of smart cities, the advent of the Internet of Things technology has catalyzed the proliferation of multimodal sensor data, presenting new challenges in cross-modal event detection, particularly in audio event detection via textual queries. This paper focuses on the novel task of text-to-audio grounding (TAG), aiming to precisely localize sound segments that correspond to events described in textual queries within an untrimmed audio. This challenging new task requires multi-modal (acoustic and linguistic) information fusion as well as the reasoning for the cross-modal semantic matching between the given audio and textual query. Unlike conventional methods that often overlook the nuanced interactions between and within modalities, we introduce the Cross-modal Graph Interaction (CGI) model. This innovative approach leverages a language graph to model complex semantic relationships between query words, enhancing the understanding of textual queries. Additionally, a cross-modal attention mechanism generates snippet-specific query representations, facilitating fine-grained semantic matching between audio segments and textual descriptions. A cross-gating module further refines this process by emphasizing relevant features across modalities and suppressing irrelevant information, optimizing multimodal information fusion. Our comprehensive evaluation on the Audiogrounding benchmark dataset not only demonstrates the CGI model’s superior performance over existing methods, but also underscores the significance of sophisticated multimodal interaction in improving the efficacy of TAG in smart cities.}

Without an investigative capability by investigators, these smart infrastructures could become new targets favored by cybercriminals. To address the challenges faced by investigators, we propose a common definition of smart city infrastructure. Based on the definition, we utilize the STRIDE threat modeling methodology and the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool to identify threats present in the infrastructure and create a threat model which can be further customized or extended by interested parties. Next, we map offences, possible evidence sources and types of threats identified to help investigators understand what crimes could have been committed and what evidence would be required in their investigation work.

To explore this dynamic, we conducted a sentiment analysis of tweets regarding four smart city projects in Africa using the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The analysis revealed strong and consistent positive associations with words annotated with the emotions of Anticipation, Trust, and Joy.

This article presents a novel ensemble deep learning method able to capture spatiotemporal features on short-term time intervals and extract high data abstraction levels. This method uses a hierarchical framework with a new activation function called HT-Tanh to improve the prediction of air pollutant emissions in real time. As such, a residual neural network (ResNet) is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to deeply extract the temporal and spatial features from pollutant and meteorological data. The model network encodes the fully connected layer to fine-tune the CNN output and decodes the temporal prediction relations based on gate recurrent unit (GRU) to obtain more accurate results. The reliability of the proposed method is verified through a case study from Shantou City, China. The model performance is compared with the recently developed and traditional deep learning models. Results reveal that the proposed method has good precision in the multiscale air quality predictions. Compared with CNN-GRU, convolutional long short-term memory, and CNN models, the forecasting results of the proposed method are significantly improved. The presented method in this article can support the early warning systems in multiple regions for air pollution modeling studies.}

abstract = {Smart cities rely heavily on Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables automation services through interconnected IoT devices. However, the widespread use of IoT applications in smart cities has resulted in security and privacy concerns that must be addressed to protect sensitive data. To safeguard smart cities from cyber attacks, learning theory-based automated attack-detection methods must be adopted. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to create effective models for identifying IoT attacks. However, the majority of IoT detection algorithms have focused on only a few types of IoT attacks, and most IoT threat detection systems have used black-box deep learning models that lack interpretability to support their forecasts. This research aims to detect several types of large-scale attacks on IoT devices using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost) classifier and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches. The proposed method not only improves the model’s performance but also increases trust in the model. The results of the experimental study on the IOTD20 dataset and XAI evaluation of each feature’s contribution to the model demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently identify malicious attacks and threats, reducing IoT cybersecurity threats in smart cities.}

However, due to the overemphasis on physical and technological aspects, social rights and democratic values have often been neglected in smart city projects. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ‘societal smart city’ and discuss how and why it should be prioritized in the post-pandemic era. We argue that a societal smart city is a city that integrates social rights and democratic values with technological innovations. Six major dimensions of a societal smart city are: social sustainability, citizen-centeredness, e-democracy, social justice, participatory governance, and cultural resilience. We encourage urban planners and policymakers to pay attention to these dimensions and caution against physical and technological determinism.}

These problems cannot be solved with the traditional urban understanding as not meet the needs of modern people. Solving the main problems encountered in cities with science and technology approach brings us the concept of smart city. Today, it has become inevitable to offer citizen-oriented solutions to urban problems in order to ensure a sustainable environment for high level of welfare/public health and to manage the effective and correct use of resources. In this review, environmental problems that can be encountered in any city are classified under four main headings as water, waste, air and traffic, and approaches that can be applied in smart city management for the solution of these problems encountered in traditional cities are emphasized in the light of studies in literature, by considering the main environmental problems encountered in cities. Thus, smart methods based solutions are presented against basic problems such as water/wastewater management, waste management, air pollution control and effective transportation encountered in a city.}

While many aspects of smart cities have been explored, there has been a disproportionate focus on physical and technological elements at the expense of social justice and democratic values. Although there have been attempts to advance the ideas of human-centric or people-centric approaches, a comprehensive perspective encompassing social rights, democratic values, and social justice is still missing. To fill this gap, this study introduces the concept of 'societal smart city', discusses its dimensions, and clarifies aspects of social justice as one of the main dimensions of a societal smart city. In addition to theoretical elaborations, we offer a case study of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, which has recently invested significantly in its technological infrastructure. For this purpose, we conducted a questionnaire survey. Results of the Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) indicate that four key factors, namely citizen-centric governance (α: 0.92, loading 15 variables), inclusive services (α: 0.91, loading 11 variables), resilient infrastructure (α: 0.9, loading 8 variables), and information literacy (α: 0.91, loading 6 variables) are the main underlying factors of social justice in Tehran. The study highlights the importance of social justice as a major dimension of the societal smart city and provides new insights for urban planners and policymakers on how to realize a societal smart city that offers benefits beyond physical and technological advances.}

Despite the expected benefits, the adoption of AI varies from one smart city to another, due in part to barriers that can inhibit a smart city from adopting AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the barriers faced by smart cities. Through a systematic literature review, this study identifies 18 primary and secondary barriers grouped into three main categories — technology, environment, and organization. This research contributes to the literature by developing a typology of AI adoption barriers based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) perspective. The typology provides a novel mapping of the barriers to AI adoption faced by smart cities and suggests directions for further investigation through a cohesive research agenda. At a practical level, the findings will allow policymakers, planners, and citizens to make more informed decisions about AI adoption. Practical implications are also proposed for guiding smart cities to increase the adoption of AI.}

abstract = {Smart grid is considered a cyber-physical system, which is a combination of physical devices and computational processes. Since there are lots of interactions between the cyber layer and the physical layer, the operation, management, and security of the entire system are crucial topics that must be taken into account. In this regard, this paper tackles two problems in AC MGs, as a special case of smart cities. Firstly, a framework is proposed to solve the optimal scheduling problem in these systems. In this stage, the optimal management and scheduling of the system are structured and modeled as an optimization problem. The dragonfly is utilized as a powerful optimization technique to solve this optimization problem. It is worth noting that in this paper different renewable energy sources, as well as batteries are considered. Since cyber-attacks are among the greatest threats to the system and can cause disruption and outage in smart grids, in this paper a deep-learning-based method called long short-term memory along with the concept of prediction interval is utilized to develop a cyber-attack detection model for false data injection attacks on smart meters. The proposed cyber-attack detection model is first trained using historical data and then is used in real-time for detection. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheduling scheme, the modified IEEE 33-bus test system is utilized. Also, for testing the proposed cyber-attack detection model a real-world dataset is used. The simulation results show the great performance and effectiveness of both proposed methodologies. It should be noted that all model are simulated in digital twin simulator. The novel LSTM-based cyber-attack detection model enhances security in electric grids, demonstrating remarkable accuracy.}

Using the Chinese smart city pilot policy as a natural experimental group, we use a difference-differences model to explore the relationship between smart cities and clean energy development. There are three findings in this paper. First, we find that smart city pilots drive clean energy development. Second, we find that digital technologies can reinforce the positive impact of smart city pilots and that innovation and financial inclusion have a positive mediating role. Third, we find that the impact of smart city pilots has a heterogeneous impact. Namely, pilots in coastal, large, and resource-based cities have a more positive impact on clean energy development. Existing smart city pilots significantly impact energy security and sustainable development. Our study provides a new perspective on urban planning and clean energy development in emerging countries such as China.}

Although different smart city (SC) classifications exist, these classifications are not always balanced, with some of them placing an emphasis on ICTs and infrastructure, while others prioritize social performance of cities and their physical environment. In this study, we suggest a relatively simple SC ranking system, based on two basic principles – direct relevance to human welfare and equal representation of key dimensions of sustainability. The proposed assessment system, composed of nine quantitative metrics, is applied to 100+ major cities worldwide, helping us to identify the best and the worst SC performers. As the study also reveals, there are clear regional differences in the interpretation components and underlying dimensions of SCs with an emphasis on “economy and technology” in North America, “the environment” in Europe, and “society” in Asia.}

Considering that, due to multiple environmental and societal pressures, land use, has become more political than ever, whereby pleas for open and transparent methods of coordination, deliberation, and participation proliferate, it is imperative that citizens are involved in the land use policymaking at the level of the city and the neighborhoods. Even if substantial literature addressing each of these issues exists, approaches that would fit these multiple pieces of the puzzle together in one equation are still missing. By elaborating on the findings of an online survey (N = 5752) involving the citizens of a smart city (Lublin, Poland), this paper responds to this imperative. The findings suggest that utilizing insights from e-participation tools and surveys, in combination with more traditional instruments, such as meetings, debates, and workshops, may significantly improve land use policies in (smart) cities.}

After reviewing the literature, we conducted semi-structured interviews with smart city managers in 40 smart cities. We identified five dynamic capabilities that effectively contribute to smart city transformation: seizing, sensing, innovation, integrative, and empowering capability. Our analysis also reveals that a city administration's organizational readiness plays a critical role in these transformative processes and relies on four factors: innovation readiness, resource readiness, a participatory and collective mindset, and strategic readiness. Based on our findings, we suggest a theoretical framework composed of 10 propositions that describe the mutual influences of these dynamic managerial capabilities and organizational readiness factors, together with their contributions to smart city transformation. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and the implications for future research and practice.}

This study analyzes smart cities built and operated by major countries and companies within the smart city framework. Firstly, the direction of smart city development in each city is changing. In the past, the goal of a smart city was to build urban infrastructure. However, the current focus is on providing smart city services. Thus, the operation and maintenance of smart city services are becoming more important than building them. Secondly, the manner in which companies secure smart city services has become diverse. As such, companies may be classified into those that secure the entire value chain of smart cities and those that own only some smart city services. Thirdly, companies are actively establishing a cooperative system to secure smart city technology. Rather than developing all the required technology, they demonstrate flexibility in responding to various smart city needs by collaborating with companies that provide individual services.}

abstract = {Cities of the 21st century are buffeted with challenges, leaving potentially serious consequences on the future of urban living. Smartening development in cities has reinvented hopes of melting down predicaments in the early 2000s'. However, perplexed by the intensifying complexities of smart cities, urban living in smart cities needs to be evaluated with multiple conflicting criteria. Multi-criteria-based evaluations have been an answer to this case when attempting to gauge the composite performance of multiple decision-making entities. Several multi-criteria assessment techniques exist when dealing with selection problems. Nonetheless, the vagueness associated with the methodologies accompanied by uncertainties and complexities is inevitable in multi-attribute assessments. Fuzzy-based multi-criteria models are often an answer to such uncertainties when modelling real-world problems. The study thus presents a novel fuzzy expert-based multi-criteria decision support model, where the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is combined with the Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) approach under a spherical fuzzy environment to create a composite index for comprehensive performance monitoring. The case of 35 high-tech European cities was used to empirically validate the proposed novel approach and thus construct a composite index. The composite index considers the intricate facet of integrating the concept of smart cities with sustainability, urban resilience, and livability under a unified framework. The fuzzy c-means partitioning technique was then used to segment smart cities into high, medium, and low-performing classes. A comparative analysis considering several distance-based approaches under a fuzzy environment with the SF-AHP and EDAS methodology is conducted to validate the robustness and stability of the proposed novel decision support model. The results revealed London as the top-ranked smart city that promotes sustainability, resilience, and livability in its current urban development model. Dusseldorf, Zurich, Munich, Oslo, Dublin, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rome, Moscow, and Stockholm were no exemption from addressing the tritactic goals of sustainability, urban resilience, and livability well into their urban development plan and were placed in the high-performance cluster. The proposed model is efficient to express decision makers' preferences in a larger space and modelling functional parameters including hesitancy independently in the 3-dimensional domain. The model supports decision-makers and relocation analysts to assess the performance of smart cities and set targets to improve performance to remodel urban development to a more sustainable, resilient, and livable pattern.}

Then, we adopt a contingency approach to unpack the factors that affect the intensity of collaboration between the stakeholders in the smart city ecosystem. To characterize the ecosystem, we use the quadruple-helix framework. Through the perspective of the local government, we derive hypotheses on whether certain factors lead to more intensive collaboration, which are tested on a sample of Belgian municipalities. Our findings reveal the importance of smart city strategies for intensifying collaboration between the local government and stakeholders in the ecosystem. Moreover, we also find that for large ecosystems, a smart city manager or department may facilitate collaboration amongst stakeholders. Taken together, our findings indicate that there are certain configurational approaches to increasing collaboration in smart cities, which will depend on the context of a city.}
