From the concepts of “Smart Ubiquitous Networks (SUN)” as a short-term realization of Future Networks in ITU-T, this article presents frameworks of the SUN with context awareness and smart resource management. As challenges, we propose methodologies and operational processes to support context awareness and new fine granularity of traffic for smart resource management. Finally we illustrate a use case of SUN considering a smart city to show how SUN capabilities contribute to build smart and ubiquitous communication environments.}

abstract = {The integrated renewable energy resources (RERs) based smart grid in the power distribution network (PDN) has financial and ecological benefits. However, the emergence of RER-based microgrids and substations without real-time monitoring of their power parameters leads to various challenges in the PDN, such as suboptimal resource allocation, poor load management, grid instability, and lack of real-time decision-making capabilities. To mitigate these challenges, increase the system's visibility, and make efficient decisions, intelligent monitoring and control system is required for both smart grid and power substation. This proposed study develops IoT-based monitoring and control of power substations and associated distributed smart grids to make effective decisions of integration/segregation into the PDN. The proposed IoT-based integration/segregation of smart grids and load management can mitigate the stated challenges effectively. Using the HOMER Grid®, the research also investigates the annualized power production pattern of smart grids and the power consumption pattern of integrated loads to enable proactive decisions about energy management. The proposed study implements IoT technology for power parameters monitoring of substations and smart grids for their effective use, as it considers four types of load management, including industrial, domestic, commercial, and electric vehicles, with the aid of IoT technology to avoid power fluctuations and contingencies. Effective load management has been adopted based on annualized energy consumption, load patterns and real-time monitoring, and active decisions making. The results highlight that the proposed IoT-based approach helps advance smart grid integration into the PDN and enhance energy load management, consequently reducing energy costs and suppressing carbon emissions. The validation of the proposed model is verified by the constructed prototype, where the achieved real-time monitoring and control of power substations and smart grids into PDN is performed to make effective decisions related to energy and load management. Moreover, it effectively allows power distribution companies to manage loads during high demand or crises and enhances grid stability and energy efficiency.}

Data privacy is safeguarded through access control, but existing models such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) rely on a centralized server. If this server is compromised, it poses significant risks to data security. To address this issue, there is a need for Distributed ABAC (DABAC) system for OpenStack services based on blockchain. The unique features of blockchain enables access control systems which ensures data integrity and privacy. Additionally, blockchain offers a level of transparency for both the resource owner and a user. In this work, we propose a smart contract based ABAC system. We implemented the proposed work using an Ethereum blockchain and OpenStack cloud. Furthermore, we evaluated two consensus algorithms for scalability analysis of DABC mechanism. The results demonstrate that DABAC performs better than ABAC in ensuring fine-grade access control with proof of stake consensus algorithm providing better scalability.}

abstract = {The deployment of pervasive information and communication technologies (ICTs) within smart city initiatives transforms cities into extraordinary apparatuses of data capture. ICTs such as smart cameras, sound sensors and lighting technology are trying to infer and affect persons’ interests, preferences, emotional states, and behaviour. It should be no surprise then that contemporary legal and policy debates on privacy in smart cities are dominated by a debate focused on data and, therefore, on data protection law. In other words, data protection law is the go-to legal framework to regulate data processing activities within smart cities and similar initiatives. While this may seem obvious, a number of important hurdles might prevent data protection law to be (successfully) applied to such initiatives. In this contribution, we examine one such hurdle: whether the data processed in the context of smart cities actually qualifies as personal data, thus falling within the scope of data protection law. This question is explored not only through a theoretical discussion but also by taking an illustrative example of a smart city-type initiative – the Stratumseind 2.0 project and its living lab in the Netherlands (the Stratumseind Living Lab; SLL). Our analysis shows that the requirement of ‘identifiability’ might be difficult to satisfy in the SLL and similar initiatives. This is so for two main reasons. First, a large amount of the data at stake do not qualify as personal data, at least at first blush. Most of it relates to the environment, such as, data about the weather, air quality, sound and crowding levels, rather than to identified or even likely identifiable individuals. This is connected to the second reason, according to which, the aim of many smart city initiatives (including the SLL) is not to identify and target specific individuals but to manage or nudge them as a multiplicity – a combination of the environment, persons and all of their interactions. This is done by trying to affect the ‘atmosphere’ on the street. We thus argue that a novel type of profiling operations is at stake; rather than relying on individual or group profiling, the SLL and similar initiatives rely upon what we have called ‘atmospheric profiling’. We conclude that it remains highly uncertain, whether smart city initiatives like the SLL actually process personal data. Yet, they still pose risks for a wide variety of rights and freedoms, which data protection law is meant to protect, and a need for regulation remains.}

Human mobility is subject to collective dynamics that are the outcome of numerous individual choices. Smart card data which originated as a means of facilitating automated fare collection has emerged as an invaluable source for analysing mobility patterns. A variety of clustering and segmentation techniques has been adopted and adapted for applications ranging from market segmentation to the analysis of urban activity locations. In this paper we provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art on clustering public transport users based on their temporal or spatial-temporal characteristics as well as studies that use the latter to characterise individual stations, lines or urban areas. Furthermore, a critical review of the literature reveals an important distinction between studies focusing on the intra-personal variability of travel patterns versus those concerned with the inter-personal variability of travel patterns. We synthesise the key analysis approaches as well as substantive findings and subsequently identify common trends and shortcomings and outline related directions for further research.}

We found that consumers were willing to pay an additional 3000 to 6000 KRW/month (2.65–5.29 USD/month) for a service that measured both physical movement and vital signs compared to either the former or the latter. It was also found that they were willing to pay about 3000 KRW/month (2.65 USD/month) more for a service that provides health condition predictions compared to one that provides only the current health condition. In addition, customers who were young, innovative, and favored the utility of healthcare services showed a lower sensitivity to service fees than those who were not. Thus, they were found to have a greater willingness to pay for advanced smart car healthcare services.}

It explores relevant stakeholders and their importance, and pinpoints digital nomad trends. Findings suggest that smart destinations cater for the work, travel, social, financial and basic-living needs of digital nomads. These are different from those of short-term leisure and business tourists. Destinations tend to portray digital nomads as a homogenous group, although different segments have been identified. The long-term impacts of digital nomads on local economies and societies have yet to be fully explored. The theoretical significance of this study lies in the provision of an agency-structural perspective of destination innovation and competitiveness.

abstract = {In several countries around the world, the ageing of their populations is accelerating. As middle-aged and elderly people get older, their physical functions gradually decline, and increasing problems with moving around become an important factor preventing them from leading active lives. The popularity of smart cars is going to play an important part in solving this problem. This makes it all the more important to have an accurate understanding of the attitude of middle-aged and elderly people via-à-vis smart cars, and to take those attitudes into consideration when designing, developing and promoting smart cars. Based on a large number of literature reviews and technology acceptance extension models like TAM and UTAUT, this study proposed and tested a model of the acceptance of smart cars amongst middle-aged and elderly people (MSCTAM) that includes external variables. Other factors that determined whether middle-aged and elderly people in China would accept smart cars were also taken into account. In terms of model verification, we used SEM of SPSS AMOS for fit indices and aggregation validity analysis. The hypothesis test part was based on model fit indices, discriminant validity and path analysis, while power analysis, using Python, was also conducted. The Wilcoxon's Sign Rank Test of SPPS was used for acceptance. For data collection, we mainly used a combination of online and offline questionnaire surveys, with subjects from various provinces and cities in China. A total of 293 questionnaires was collected, and 262 valid responses were obtained. The results showed that the attitudes towards use, perceived usefulness, enjoyment and social norms were significantly positively correlated with usage intention, while trust was positively correlated with usage intention. Affordability was negatively correlated with usage intention, perceived ease of use; reliability was significantly positively correlated with perceived usefulness; enjoyment was significantly positively correlated with perceived ease of use, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, personal innovation, and environment-friendliness. Symbolic value was significantly positively correlated with attitudes towards use, while safety risks and privacy risks were negatively correlated with attitudes towards use. Of the 16 hypotheses, 12 were supported, indicating that middle-aged and elderly people in China on the one hand have a positive and open attitude towards smart cars, but on the other, also have a number of concerns. The proposed model provides more refined survey models and data support for Chinese smart car developers and manufacturers, and furnishes them with references for the research field of technology acceptance models. The proposed model provides Chinese intelligent automobile development companies and distributors with a more refined survey model and data support, and offers references and guidance for further research of technology acceptance models.}

Finding a free parking lot plays a role in reducing traffic congestion, gas emissions, and increasing the quality of life of people living and working in it. Therein, the fundamental part of every smart parking system is the detection of vehicle presence, which is usually employed by devices comprised of power-hungry sensors. This paper gives an extension to state-of-the-art by a systematic in-depth overview of technologies used for the smart parking detection realization consuming mW of power. Deeper insights on the real-scenario performances and power consumption of most popular sensor devices and Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) radio technologies available today (LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT) are provided. The results show that based on the architectures of IoT system, lowest consumption is for LoRa devices. Further, analysis of power consumption of commercial LPWA-based Smart parking sensor device is provided along with battery estimation lifetime, which is especially important for the deployment of future smart parking solutions. Battery lifetime heavily depends on the number of parking lots exchanges and based on the less frequent changes, the estimated battery lifetime is approximately 7 years. Inspired by the limitations of power-hungry and relatively expensive smart parking sensor devices, two strategies for the optimization are proposed: first one is based on the premise where a drop in received signal strength of the LPWA device can serve as the presence of the vehicle in the parking lot, while the second one proposes a big picture on a novel architecture for harvesting the surrounding energy and using the same for circuitry wake-up therefore saving the energy.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet of things (IoTs), big data collection and analysis based on distributed sensing is particularly important. Here, we report a natural biodegradable wood-based triboelectric nanogenerator (W-TENG), which not only can produce high electric output to power microelectronic devices, but also can be used as a self-powered sensor. A pure natural biodegradable and pollution-free wood is used as the triboelectric material. The output voltage and current of the W-TENG (8 cm × 8 cm) is 220 ± 20 V and 5.8 ± 0.5 μA at a frequency of 2 Hz. The maximum output power density could be as high as 158.2 mW/m2 at a resistance of 50 MΩ. On this basis, The W-TENG can be widely used as self-powered light switch, self-powered doorbell which can realize the intelligent control of the lights and contribute to the energy conservation to a great extent. In addition, it can be designed as a smart floor and installed on the stage wooden floor to track and record the dancers' movements. Moreover, dancers can control the lights themselves through the floor under their feet. This W-TENG based self-powered system breaks new ground for wood-based electronics, which will have potential applications in big data analysis, smart home and smart city environments.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has led to rapid growth in smart cities. However, IoT botnet-based attacks against smart city systems are becoming more prevalent. Detection methods for IoT botnet-based attacks have been the subject of extensive research, but the identification of early-stage behaviour of the IoT botnet prior to any attack remains a largely unexplored area that could prevent any attack before it is launched. Few studies have addressed the early stages of IoT botnet detection using monolithic deep learning algorithms that could require more time for training and detection. We, however, propose an edge-based deep learning system for the detection of the early stages of IoT botnets in smart cities. The proposed system, which we call EDIT (Edge-based Detection of early-stage IoT Botnet), aims to detect abnormalities in network communication traffic caused by early-stage IoT botnets based on the modular neural network (MNN) method at multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers. MNN can improve detection accuracy and efficiency by leveraging parallel computing on MEC. According to the findings, EDIT has a lower false-negative rate compared to a monolithic approach and other studies. At the MEC server, EDIT takes as little as 16 ms for the detection of an IoT botnet.}

As rural areas face migration of younger people towards urban areas, the ageing of population is there even faster and presents more challenges. Older adults would prefer to stay in their home and social environment as long as possible, which also goes for older adults in rural areas. The European office of the World Health Organization (later on WHO) prepared the handbook with eight domains supporting the development of an age-friendly environment. This article reviewed how much literature covers smart villages and age-friendly environments in rural areas. We used the Web of Science search tool and several search strings to consider if there is sufficient research covering this topic. While there is much research covering the age-friendly environment in cities, few only are dedicated to rural areas. We concluded that there is a need for further research to support the development of smart silver villages as rural age-friendly environments and that eight WHO domains give us a suitable frame for community development in this direction. The literature review was performed to determine the conditions for the research framework on smart silver village. Subsequent research should focus on the smart village field, including care for older adults and developing social infrastructure for older adults in rural areas. Besides that, the literature review for age-friendly environment research considers the applicability of their results in rural areas and smart villages.}

Due to more waste varieties, there are urgent calls to implement waste classification worldwide, which promotes resource recycling to achieve sustainable development. In this paper, we present an ICT-based smart waste classification and collection system (SWCCS) that is abstracted as a bi-objective mathematical programming model to optimize the waste collection problem. To implement the proposed SWCCS effectively, we design a novel multi-objective hybrid algorithm based on the whale optimization and genetic algorithms (MOGWOA) with an improved convergence factor and a fast, non-dominated sorting method. A comparison of our algorithm with two classical multi-objective algorithms on generated test instances and on a real-world case shows that the proposed MOGWOA is more effective for optimizing the established model. This paper demonstrates how the ICT-based SWCCS works and how it can help sanitation companies improve waste collection both economically and environmentally.}

Smart cities must secure their critical infrastructures against cyberattacks. Water distribution is one of these infrastructures. In this paper, a bi-level optimization model is developed for cyberattacks that can result in physical consequence of multiple node failures in water networks. Unlike the existing research that considered random cyberattacks, the proposed cyber–physical attack model injects targeted false data into pumps’ measurements causing pressure head buildup in targeted nodes. In addition, the injected false data will ensure bypassing the existing water system’s state-estimation and bad data detection methods, a condition that was not considered in previously developed attacks. The findings indicate the minimum number of targeted pumps required to create the most severe cascading failures across the water network. The model will identify strategic pumps that are likely to be targeted by cyberattacks, and therefore should be given extra layers of protection by water authorities.}

abstract = {The smart grid system has addressed the problems of traditional power grid by not only meeting energy demand in real-time but also limiting its wastage. The two key objectives of a smart grid system are to ensure a higher Quality of Experience (QoE) for consumers and to reduce consumer costs using dynamically varying pricing concepts. However, these two objective parameters oppose each other as maximizing the consumer QoE requires the availability of sufficient electric power at any given time, which in turn increases power purchase cost. In this paper, we introduce an efficient power management system architecture of a smart grid and develop an Optimal Energy Allocation and Prediction system based on Deep Q-Leaning, namely OEAP-DQL, that brings a trade-off between the two. The developed OEAP-DQL system is a multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) problem that predicts consumer electricity demand by exploiting four different weighted and regressive moving average forecasting methods in the action space to accurately capture dynamically varying customer demand behaviors. Furthermore, iterative exploitation of multiple learning methods decreases forecasting error and intelligent stored power management helps the OEAP-DQL smart grid operator (SGO) to enhance its profit. The results of our simulation experiments show that the OEAP-DQL system outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of QoE and cost.}

However, few have investigated socio-spatial differentiation among mobility groups, considering their daily needs and activity spaces. To fill this research gap, we conducted a comparative analysis of socio-spatial differentiation, based on individual activity spaces. We used smart card data from Kunming, China, to identify selected individuals’ residential locations and travel patterns, and evaluate their accessed activity space. We performed a disaggregated analysis of the individual activity space, and then aggregated the activity counts on each grid. This study found that the residential locations of older metro travelers are significantly different from those of other metro travelers. In addition, socio-spatial differentiation was found to exist due to different daily requirements. The results were confirmed in three LASSO models with built environment variables. These findings are useful in urban and transportation planning to improve elder-friendly services.}

abstract = {The share of renewables in the energy mix of Pakistan has gradually been increasing over the past few years, and the generated electricity is sufficient to cater to consumer electricity demands. However, almost one-third of the population still lacks electricity because of inefficiencies in transmission and distribution systems. To address this, the government introduced smart grid projects that were ineffective. Therefore, for the successful implementation of the Smart grid technology in Pakistan, it is important to know the barriers to implementing the technology in Pakistan and determine their interrelationship with each other. This research aims to identify Pakistan-specific smart grid implementation barriers through a mixed-methods approach involving a literature review and expert surveys based on the Delphi method to identify barriers and determine their interlinkages. Nine barriers are identified: state monopoly, lack of public awareness, lack of relevant regulations and policies, organizational barriers, financial constraints, market uncertainty, a dearth of technical human resources, lack of modernized grid infrastructure, and data management issues. This is followed by developing a hierarchical model in consultation with Pakistan's Energy sector experts using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method. The driving and dependence powers of the identified barriers are determined by using MICMAC analysis. The result shows that the nine barriers are interlinked at five hierarchical levels. These are: ‘state monopoly’, and ‘lack of public awareness (level five)’, ‘lack of relevant regulations and policies (level four)’, ‘organizational barriers (level-three)’, ‘market uncertainty and financial barriers (level-two)’, and ‘lack of modernized grid infrastructure’, ‘a dearth of technical human resources’, and ‘data management issues (level-one)’. From this, we draw the conclusion that since the barriers with high driving power are influencing those with less driving power, the identified barriers may be addressed sequentially starting from level-five for the successful implementation of the Smart grid technology in Pakistan. The existing literature on the Smart Grid Implementation barriers in Pakistan lacks a determination of the interlinkages between barriers. Therefore, the findings of this research will help the energy sector stakeholders in Pakistan understand the nature of the barriers hindering smart grid technology implementation and enable them to devise effective energy policies while simultaneously adopting intelligent implementation and operational strategies. Insights reported in this study could also be useful for policymakers and stakeholders from other developing countries with socioeconomic and political contexts similar to Pakistan. Further investigations on the findings of this study may be performed using the Analytical Hierarchical Process method to quantify the weights of barriers identified in this research, and Structural Equation Modeling may be used to check the validity of the hierarchical model developed in this study.}

This allows us to achieve properties such as preventing the re-selling of data (e.g., partial data, combined data, and leaked data). We also design five algorithms to automatically guarantee data sharing fairness and proactively protect data copyright, by using smart contracts. In other words, several new security features are introduced to existing transaction schemes, while still achieving feasible performance.

Unlike conventional non-smart security devices, such as alarms and locks, performance standards for smart security devices, such as the British TS 621, are not easily understandable by end users due to the technical language employed. Users also have very few sources of unbiased information regarding product performance in real world conditions and protection against attacks from cyber attacker-burglars and, as a result, tend to take manufacturer claims at face value. This means that, as this work proves, users may be exposed to threats, such as theft, impersonation (should an attacker steal their credentials), and even physical injury, if the device fails and is used to prevent access to hazardous environments. As such, this paper deploys several attacks using popular wireless attack vectors (i.e., 433 MHz radio, Bluetooth, and RFID) against domestic smart security devices to assess the protection offered against a cyber attacker-burglar. Our results suggest that users are open to considerable cyber physical attacks, irrespective if they use lesser known (i.e., no name) or branded smart security devices, due to the poor security offered by these devices.}

The CBC introduced triboelectric nanogenerators, CBC-TENGs, are developed to demonstrate the harvesting various renewable energies, such as the wind, biomechanical, and blue energies, and the practical using of it. Moreover, the CBC-capacitor, which employs CBC as the core element of the capacitor, is fabricated to show the potential of CBC as a member in the structural capacitor. Given that cement is the most ordinary but indispensable one among the constructing materials, CBC has a great potential in the development of the NZES and in realizing the energy zero smart city based on the excellent functionalities of CBC.}

With the rapid adoption of smart farming technologies and infrastructure, the agricultural sector has become an attractive target for cyberattacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review that assesses the applicability of existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) techniques within smart farming infrastructures (SFIs). We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity. This is essential for protecting the agriculture sector in the era of digital transformation, ensuring the resilience and sustainability of the food supply chain against emerging cyber risks.}

This research aims to develop an indicators-based framework to evaluate the sustainability of smart and sustainable mobility and tourism in rural areas. Rural areas have often been neglected, or at least less prioritized, in the sustainability development of the mobility sector. The study also seeks to identify the overlap of KPIs between rural tourism and mobility, and how improved green mobility services can enhance sustainable rural tourism. Smart mobility and tourism indicators have a strong mutual relationship in rural communities, driving economic development, improving the quality of life for residents and visitors, and creating more sustainable and livable communities. Smart mobility and tourism indicators also play a crucial role in supporting the UN SDGs by providing data and insights that can inform policy and decision-making.

However, the traditional centralized authentication scheme has defects such as single point of failure, poor scalability, center dependence, vulnerability to attacks, etc., and is not suitable for the distributed and dynamically changing smart home environment. Thus, many researchers have proposed decentralized authentication schemes based on blockchain technology. Although many characteristics of blockchain technology such as decentralization, non-tampering, and solving single point of failure have good application scenarios in authentication, the mature integration of the two applications has to be further explored. For example, the introduction of blockchain also brings security issues; the balance between security and performance in most blockchain-based authentication schemes remains to be investigated; and resource-constrained IoT devices tend to perform a large number of intensive computations, which is clearly inappropriate. Consequently, this paper introduces fog computing in blockchain-based authentication schemes, proposes a network architecture in which cloud and fog computing work together, and investigates the security and performance issues of authentication schemes under this architecture. Finally, formal and informal security analysis show that our scheme has multiple security properties, and our scheme has better performance than existing solutions.}

Therefore, it is of practical significance to measure the success degree of smart growth plan. The current model is accompanied by some problems such as subjectivity, unable to prioritize each plan, and so on. In this paper, an evaluating model was established to scientifically measure and adjust the smart growth plan based on BP neural network and set pair analysis. In this model, an evaluating metric(I) was defined, which was obtained by multiplying the ability score(A) and the coordinative development index(C). Applied to city's current plan, the model can tell us how successful the current plan is for this city, thus on the basis of evaluating result, better new plans for the city in the future can be developed. Finally, the effects of the new plans for population, economy-environment- society were discussed based on Lokta-Volterra equations and the environmental Kuznets curve. A case study was presented in two cities, Karamay and Atlanta. The result showed that the current plan in Atlanta is more successful than that in Karamay, but both the two plans are moderately successful. According to the results, a series of new plans were proposed and their priorities were ranked, the result showed that Atlanta should give priority to urban greening while Karamay give priority to economic development, and the effect of the scientific intelligence growth plan is to expand city's environmental capacity, promote the fair competition between the foreign population and the local population, and improve the balanced node, making the environment damage smaller, society and economic grow better. The model provides powerful reference for cities in developed and developing countries to formulate smart growth plans, especially for developing countries.}

Public transport use can contribute to daily physical activity recommendations through its associated walking components. However, without using travel surveys, it is challenging to estimate walking associated with public transport use for the population of large cities.
Methods
Big data, in the form of smart card data, combined with a synthetic population, was used to estimate the access, transfer and egress distance of public transport commuter journeys in Sydney, Australia. A spatial network analysis of the access, transfer and egress segments of commuter journeys was performed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
Results
A mean step count of approximately 2400 steps (1915 m) weighted across modes was estimated for daily public transport commutes. The largest mean number of steps corresponds with ferry (3066 steps, 2436 m) and train use (2933 steps, 2340 m).
Conclusion
Walking to public transport is an important contributor to meeting physical activity recommendations. The findings of this study can aid planners and health practitioners to understand the pattern of physical activity associated with public transport commuter use and can influence future decision-making in land use planning and infrastructure provision, or for developing targeted interventions for the promotion of the benefits of physical activity and public transport use.}

abstract = {Smart Grids play a crucial role in managing electric power in a more efficient, secure, and sustainable manner. These grids rely on information and communication technologies to facilitate two-way communication between energy providers and consumers, enabling better coordination in the production and distribution of electricity. This article aims to compare the main technologies that can be used in Neighborhood Area Networks (NAN) for Smart Grid data communication networks. NANs are critical to Smart Grid infrastructure, providing advanced energy monitoring and control solutions like smart metering and demand management. The article surveys commonly used technologies such as IEEE 802.15.4 g, IEEE 802.11s, LoRa, and LTE, highlighting their pros and cons. Unlike many existing works in the literature, this article does not limit itself to a theoretical comparison but also conducts network simulations using widely-used scientific tools such as ns-3 and OMNeT++. The article evaluates the technologies in two scenarios, a grid-like scenario, and a real-world scenario using actual smart meter locations in Montreal. The simulations’ results are analyzed using widely-used metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), network transit time, and compliant factor, and offer insights into selecting the right technology for NANs in Smart Grids based on various network scenarios.}

These themes converge with the current trend of the city and the introduction of new technologies to make life easier for citizens. The smart cities offer strategic principles aligning to the three main dimensions integration of infrastructures and technology-mediated services, social learning for strengthening human infrastructure, and governance for institutional improvement and citizen engagement. A growing number of cities are implementing carsharing programs to increase this transportation model, and São Paulo (Brazil) is one of these cities around de world. That model provides the general public with affordable access to public car, and can promote the integration of public transport systems and carsharing programs to improve mobility, traffic and environment related problems. One of the key factors for the success of such programs is the location of car stations in relation to potential transport demand. This study proposes a GIS-based method to calculate the spatial distribution of the potential demand for trips, locate stations using location-allocation models, and determine the best location to settle car-sharing stations. The results obtained shows which are the best places for the implementation of carsharing and its possible partnerships with several types of commercial establishments in the city of São Paulo.}

However, areas such as service quality-based pricing strategies, supply–demand balancing in distribution system to attain enhanced reliability and consumption-oriented rewarding mechanisms need improving in order to achieve the full benefits of the envisaged grid architecture. In response, this study proposes a novel Blockchain-as-a-Service for Energy Trading (BaaSET) platform, which offers reputation-based services, executed through smart contracts for smart grid applications. Reputation-based grid operations are automatically executed through smart contracts deployed onto a blockchain. The reputation is estimated using power quality and reliability indices, obtained through grid measurements. Further, tests have been conducted to evaluate the associated latency and the implementation cost of the proposed blockchainized service architecture. Test results signify the performance to be comparatively better considering the state-of-the-art. The results further suggest alternatives to improve the scalability of the architecture, to cater the increasing number of stakeholders in the SG 2.0 environment.}

Whether digital transformation can improve resource sustainability, particularly energy sustainability, is an urgent problem for governments. We used panel data from 230 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006-2019 to assess the impact of urban digital transformation strategies represented by smart cities on urban resource sustainability using the difference-in-difference (DID) model. The results show that urban digital transformation significantly enhances urban resource sustainability, which still holds after passing robustness tests. The mechanism analyses indicate that urban digital transformation can promote resource sustainability through technological innovation, structural transformation, and capital reallocation. Further analysis reveals that implementing urban digital transformation in eastern, non-resource-based cities and cities with unreasonable industrial structures has a more favourable effect on resource sustainability. This paper provides an empirical basis for the urban digital transformation to empower green urban recovery and low-carbon development by promoting sustainable resources.}

A bibliometric analysis of the identified literature revealed that the past research predominantly focused on energy efficiency and occupant comfort while social and legal issues were underexplored. A further, qualitative review of the shortlisted literature unveiled the SR research gaps and six future research areas: (1) smart retrofit performance evaluation, (2) SR applications for building envelope optimization, (3) renewable energy integration through SR applications, (4) SR applications for demand side management, (5) stakeholder engagement in SR, and (6) planning for effective SR implementation. Outcomes synthesized from this study include a framework consolidating the review findings and a mapping exhibiting the nexus of future research directions, which serve to facilitate and catalyze expected efforts for realizing SBs.}

We conduct an empirical study analyzing data on 438 EVs over a period of 3,687 consecutive hours, collected by an energy aggregator which operates a digital platform. We first develop an optimization model to compute an optimal schedule of charging for all EVs in the dataset at minimum cost. Then, we compare the realizations against this optimal solution, distinguishing householders who use a smart charging functionality of the digital platform from those who do not use it. Our findings indicate that the smart charging behaviour conduces to better results, and close to the optimal solution. The non-users tend to start charging as soon as they plug-in their EVs, often at peak consumption times. In contrast, the smart charging strategy usually shifts the charging schedules towards times where the consumption is cheaper and the grid is less congested, facilitating a higher load factor and lower power losses. These results highlight the positive role of energy aggregators and digital platforms in coordinating users to lower the cost and enhance efficiency of energy consumption.}

One very important industry trend is the move to convert existing human dwellings to smart buildings, and to create new smart buildings. Smart buildings aim to mitigate climate change by reducing energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. To accomplish this, they leverage artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning algorithms to learn and optimize system performance. These fields of research are currently very rapidly evolving and advancing, but there has been very little guidance to help engineers and architects working on smart buildings apply artificial intelligence algorithms and technologies in a systematic and effective manner. In this paper we present B-SMART: the first reference architecture for autonomic smart buildings. B-SMART facilitates the application of artificial intelligence techniques and technologies to smart buildings by decoupling conceptually distinct layers of functionality and organizing them into an autonomic control loop. We also present a case study illustrating how B-SMART can be applied to accelerate the introduction of artificial intelligence into an existing smart building.}

abstract = {With the deep integration of Internet and ubiquitous computing, smart environment becomes familiar in several real time applications such as smart city, smart building, healthcare, transportation, etc. Despite the benefits of smart environment, security remains a challenging issue which needs to be resolved. Intrusion detection system (IDS) acts as a vital part in assuring data security and the main technology is to precisely detect distinct kinds of attacks in the network. Since the networking data comprises of huge number of features, feature selection techniques can be integrated into the IDS for enhanced security. In this view, this article introduces a novel metaheuristic with deep learning enabled intrusion detection system for secured smart environment, named MDLIDS-SSE technique. The major intention of the MDLIDS-SSE technique is to identify the existence of intrusions in the secured smart environment. The MDLIDS-SSE technique employs Z-score normalization approach as a data pre-processing step. In addition, the MDLIDS-SSE technique enables improved arithmetic optimization algorithm based feature selection (IAOA-FS) technique to elect an optimal subset of features. Moreover, quantum behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) with deep wavelet neural network (DWNN) model is employed for the detection and classification of intrusions in the secured smart environment. The utilization of the QPSO algorithm assists in the optimal choice of the variables involved in the DWNN model. For assessing the enhanced intrusion detection outcomes of the MDLIDS-SSE technique, a series of simulations were carried out and the results are examined under various aspects. The comparative result analysis reported the enhanced outcomes of the MDLIDS-SSE technique over the recent approaches.}

This investigation proposes a dynamic simulation of a novel intelligent building-integrated solar cogeneration system using TRNSYS software to provide the power demand of system equipment and the required electricity, heating, cooling, and freshwater of a typical residential building in Iran. This system is equipped with photovoltaic panels, evacuated tube collectors, a double-effect absorption chiller, a reverse osmosis water desalination unit, and a micro-gas turbine as a backup system. Using season-temperature sensors and differential controllers helps monitor and handle the energy rates in different parts of the system and building by comparing the outside temperature and relative humidity with comfort conditions in an intelligent method. The system performance is assessed and compared from energy, exergy, exergy-economic, and environmental impact points of view in four cities that cover Iran’s climate variety. EES software is employed to transfer the thermodynamic properties of air and water to the model in TRNSYS. Furthermore, the tri-objective optimization is conducted with a novel procedure through a combination of a machine learning method and genetic algorithm in MATLAB by considering the exergy efficiency, unit product cost, and CO2 emission as objective functions to find the best point of the system and present a 3D Pareto-Frontier. The results show that the system can satisfy all the building energy demands, and on average, the hourly cooling and heating energy production during a year in this system are 1.01 kWh and 1.37 kWh, respectively. Also, the excess produced power is sold to the grid to compensate for some of the system overheads. The tri-objective optimization upshot shows that the values of exergy efficiency, CO2 emission, and unit product cost of this system at the best point are 44.9%, 0.158 ton/MWh, and 12.26 €/MWh, respectively, in Tehran province. Based on the results, the system performance indexes are improved compared to similar technologies found in the literature.}

Whilst previous studies have predominantly investigated drivers for and barriers to individuals' intention to adopt smart energy technologies, the present study was carried out to investigate drivers and barriers that influence the individuals’ actual decision to adopt these technologies and explores the role of co-adoption of related technologies (renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles). Therefore, an extended version of Technology Acceptance model (i.e. encompassing the perceived risk and the adoption of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles) was included in an online survey with a national quota-representative sample (n = 521). A binary logistic regression analysis of data collected in this survey shows that the adoption of renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles, as well as perceived ease of use and attitude, encourage individuals to adopt smart energy technologies, whereby the adoption of electric vehicles has the strongest effect on their decision to adopt smart energy technologies. Our results indicate that the process of co-adopting energy-related technologies is ongoing, increasing the enabling potential to support an energy system transition.}

abstract = {Modernizing traditional power grids into smart grids represents a significant advancement in improving efficiency and sustainability within the energy sector. However, integrating renewable energy sources and the intricate network of interconnected devices has presented new challenges, especially in grid stability. Anticipating and maintaining grid stability ensures a continuous energy supply and prevents potential disruptions. This research paper explores the smart grid stability issue through machine learning. Two distinct scenarios are examined. In the first scenario, the problem is approached as a binary classification task, where grid states are categorized as stable or unstable, a well-established method for addressing grid stability. In the second scenario, an effort is made to predict continuous values that reflect the degree of grid stability. These continuous values are subsequently mapped to a conditional function, facilitating stability detection based on a predefined threshold. To address data imbalance, two balancing strategies, specifically the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and K-means SMOTE, are employed in each scenario. The analysis covers a range of regressors and classifiers, focusing on tree-based models, boosting algorithms, ensemble learners, and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). The investigation results demonstrate that combining the K-means SMOTE strategy with the CatBoost Classifier in the first scenario achieves the highest accuracy, reaching an impressive 99.6%, and an exceptional ability to detect grid instability, achieving 100% accuracy. Furthermore, the results of the second scenario are promising, with accuracy rates reaching 99.4%, thanks to the utilization of a stacking ensemble learner. Notably, this study introduces Explainable AI, a groundbreaking initiative in this field, to delve into the inner workings of the proposed models and enhance their transparency. This pioneering effort marks a significant step forward in understanding and optimizing the predictive capabilities of machine learning models applied to smart grid stability.}

This paper provides an overview of the pro-efficiency policy of households in Poland, affecting the residential sector, and assesses the regulations implemented so far. The evaluation of the policy uses an econometric approach (congruent modelling). The impact of energy policy was determined by giving weights to individual regulations taking into account their variability in time. The created models showed a significant impact of the introduced regulations on the reduction of energy consumption and confirmed their changeable influence over time. Their time-limited impact on reducing energy consumption forces taking further actions motivating consumers to electricity saving.

abstract = {Implementation of smart and sustainable energy projects in urban areas encounters different barriers. These barriers range from common financial shortage to specific constraints, which depend on local socio-economic, environmental and political characteristics of each city. In spite of various experiences of European cities in smart and sustainable energy projects, the transfer of lessons learnt on how to manage barriers in new projects is inefficient. The main aim of this paper is to apply a case-based learning methodology to predict barriers to a given smart and sustainable energy project. To achieve this aim, a learning methodology is proposed and applied to the case study of the city of Bolzano, within SINFONIA project. SINFONIA is a European Commission Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) project for integration of smart and sustainable energy solutions at urban district level. The proposed methodology operates in two main steps: first, identifying and selecting the most similar European smart and sustainable energy cases to the target-case (Bolzano within SINFONIA); second, investigating barriers to implementation of selected cases. The results show that the barriers fragmented ownership of properties, limited access to capital and cost disincentives, and perception of interventions as complicated and expensive, with negative social or environmental impacts are highly probable to occur in Bolzano within SINFONIA. The proposed methodology is applicable and replicable for urban planners and decision-makers in different territorial levels to facilitate and accelerate the implementation of smart and sustainable energy projects.}

Developing and implementing methods to reduce heating demand is therefore crucial for the UK in decarbonising its economy – and here smart windows provide a significant opportunity: the ability to alter a window’s optical properties provides control over the heating impact of the sun on a building. This report focuses on the gasochromic smart window: whereby introduction of hydrogen within the glazing gap tints the window and oxygen bleaches the window. Gasochromic windows have never been simulated in the UK, with the aim of this report to assess the potential for gasochromic windows in Birmingham, UK. This aim was assessed through three objectives: comparing performance against other glazing types, optimising switching criteria, and a comparison against location effects. The results showed that gasochromic windows were the most effective at reducing the heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) load, exhibiting a 20.2 % decrease in load compared to a standard double-glazed window. There was a 4.9 % benefit of optimising the switching criterion compared to having the window permanently in its bleached state. Over a full rotation of the building, there was a 5.4 % range in the HVAC load. Whilst the performance of the window is promising, the difficulty of retrofitting and the UK’s small hydrogen economy renders gasochromic windows unviable at present and in the near future. However, the technology could be viable in other countries more invested in the hydrogen economy and with higher housebuilding rates.}

It introduces some key elements of smart city infrastructure, which conclude by highlighting the requirement for an integrated approach in handling such infrastructure.

The light-dependent resistor sensor is used to indicate day/night time, and photoelectric sensors are utilized to detect movement on the street. This movement allows the vehicle to give an early warning by indicating before approaching the crossing. The air quality is also checked here. This proposed model will track air quality and show the results. This proposed model will monitor air quality and present the current level of pollution in real time. The parts per million values of the air will be separated into particular parameters threshold levels, which will allow the system to determine the air quality. The model also includes a live dashboard that allows users to check the state of air in the cloud. The live data is generated and sent to the Arduino.io cloud, where it is stored for later analysis. This model will aid in the preservation of the air quality in the area of the roadway. It also checks for faults in the street lights, which is displayed on the dashboard. The microcontroller serves as the brain of the street light system and the programming language utilized for development.

This study aims to conduct a systematic and comprehensive analysis to quantify the energy savings potential of the occupant-centric smart thermostat based on a large-scale nationwide simulation infrastructure. The single-family Residential Prototype Building Model was used to represent a typical single-family detached house in the U.S. A generalized random occupancy presence schedule was created based on an occupancy probability schedule and k-means clustering algorithm. A total of 16,000 simulations, which were composed of four building foundation types, four heating source types, 40 American cities, five building energy code versions, and five thermostat control strategies, were conducted to evaluate the performances of the smart home thermostat in terms of saving building energy usage and maintaining occupant thermal comfort. The nationwide simulation results suggested that the temperature setback control during the unoccupied period could achieve some energy savings in the U.S. households. However, only very few of the 40 cities could see an annual Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning energy savings ratio of over 30%. Besides, the implementation of the occupied standby temperature reset could greatly increase the peak load of the HVAC system and contribute to the grid load imbalance issue. It’s also worth noting that the smart recovery feature is proved to be able to bring additional benefits for a smart home thermostat. It could decrease the temperature setpoint not met time by about 30 min, and relieve the thermal discomfort due to the temperature setback control.}

Tests were performed in the northern outskirts of Rome between June and August 2021. The study showed that the median air temperature reduction between the misted zone and the undisturbed observation point was close to 3.5 °C in the reference scenario (misting + solar shading). The comfort-driven smart control realised a similar cooling profile with significantly attenuated humidification, narrower variability, and drastically reduced resource consumption (80 % reduction in pump activation). As the cross-ventilation was blocked along the longitudinal axis through the installation of a wind shield, the cooling rose dramatically, hitting a median of −7.5 °C and a maximum close to 10 °C, with strong local humidification and pronounced thermal gradients. It was further observed that the way environmental conditions outside the misted perimeter dictate the evaporative cooling potential varies for different configurational and operating settings.}

Understanding the ability of citizens to engage in decarbonization efforts is vital to address the sustainability challenge posed by climate problems. The potential for emissions reductions through changes in environmentally friendly behaviour is significant but often underestimated. Among many environmentally friendly behaviours, sustainable residential energy behaviours can have a direct impact, as a large share of total energy is consumed in the residential sector, and end-user practices can have a significant effect. As smart technology advances, various digital solutions have emerged for the end-users, significantly influencing their daily behaviour. Notably, smart energy applications have gained increased popularity among these solutions. This study aims to examine the potential and opportunities of smart energy apps to promote energy-related behaviour change and sustainable practices in the Norwegian context and to provide an overview of the relevant literature. Our findings suggest a significant lack of empirical research on the effectiveness of energy-related apps in promoting sustainable residential energy behaviour. Additionally, the limited empirical findings that do exist are mainly based on pilot-level projects, with little evidence from population-level adoption. Therefore, further research is needed to gain qualitative and quantitative insights into users' motivations and perceptions and investigate these apps' effectiveness in changing energy-related behaviours and sustaining behaviour change in the residential sector.}

Thermochromic and electrochromic smart windows are increasingly receiving attention for their specific ability to regulate the dynamics of light and heat. The goal of improving smart-window materials is chiefly to achieve building applications. This paper reviews the progress of existing material technologies and summarizes their experiments and simulations related to buildings. To facilitate the leap from material to building, the concept of performance regulation of ideal smart windows is proposed, and the applicability distribution of existing technologies is mapped. Based on the completely different core logic of thermochromic and electrochromic smart windows, the discrepancies and consistencies between the two are discussed. Performance requirements of smart windows in materials and buildings are proposed. Bridging the gap between materials and buildings for interdisciplinary promotion is the key to further exploration of the potential application of smart windows and accelerating their applications in the future.}

The main concept of the sustainable smart city is established for collecting and negotiation of the Internet of things (IoT) devices and smart applications to help and enhancement of human life. On the other hand, energy harvesting management as an important issue in sustainable urban computing has several challenges arising from the exponential growth of IoT devices, smart applications, and complex population to decrease the related factors on the energy consumption, power-saving, and environmental waste management. However, the notion of energy harvesting management for sustainable urban computing is still growing exponentially, and it should be attended to due to economic factors and governmental obstacles. This paper reviews different existing green energy harvesting strategies on the smart applications of sustainable and smart cities in edge-based intelligent urban computing. The existing energy harvesting strategies have been divided into five categories: smart home management, smart cities, smart grids, smart environmental systems, and smart transportation systems. This review aims to classify technical aspects of energy harvesting management methods in sustainable urban computing concerning applied algorithms, evaluation factors, and evaluation environments. As technical results, a general discussion is essential for the development of existing challenges and open research directions of energy harvesting and waste management for sustainable smart cities that contribute expressively to enhance the energy consumption of smart applications and human life in complex and metropolitan areas.}

Results show at which of the four steps of urban crowdsourcing they intervene. Furthermore, the findings reveal a dynamic learning environment composed of two knowledge flows (“learning with” and “learning from” stakeholders).}

abstract = {Wind and solar multi-energy complementation has become a key technology area in smart city energy system, but its inherent intermittency and random fluctuations have caused many negative effects on the stable operation of multi-energy system. Energy storage system has become a key link to solve the problem of stabilization and consumption of intermittent new energy in smart city. Based on the energy value tag and the optimization of equipment sequence, a comprehensive regulation model of wind–solar energy storage in smart city is established by using the spectrum analysis method. The output power curve of the system is divided into different frequency to optimize the energy storage configuration. And the appropriate equipment is selected in a specific scene of a smart park to verify, it shows the effectiveness of the model. Compared with the hierarchical multi-level control model, it can effectively suppress the long-term fluctuations of new energy sources such as wind and solar. It reduces the impact of peak–valley difference on the stability of grid operation and promotes the consumption of new energy. It selects the energy supply equipment of the system based on the energy value label and orders to participate in the scheduling, which can better meet the control needs of optimization goals in different control scenarios. According to energy demand, the park is divided into plot A and plot B. Plot A is dominated by high-tech office buildings and large shopping malls. Plot B is mostly residential quarters. It is calculated by Matlab calling the Cplex software, the economic cost of optimal dispatch in plot A is 3892.37 yuan, while the economic cost of optimal dispatch in plot B is 4316.75 yuan. The problem of integrated regulation of smart city energy is solved by the Cplex software, which uses the Matlab to read the excel file to get the basic matrix. Substituting the MOP (Multi-Objective Planning, MOP) model in the Cplex software into the matrix and adopting a hierarchical and multi-level control method has reduced the daily operating cost of the energy system by 15.91%. The results show that the hierarchical and multi-level regulation model has a certain positive effect on the level of new energy consumption in the smart city energy system. It also verifies the correctness and effectiveness of the comprehensive regulation model.}

However, a universal strategy for fabricating truly scalable and customizable MHC textiles is lacking. In this study, we introduce a scalable in situ grafting approach for the continuous fabrication of two series of smart textile yarns with opposite thermoresponsive wetting behaviors. In particular, the wetting transition temperature can be precisely programmed by adjusting the grafting formula, making the yarns highly customizable. The smart yarns demonstrated excellent mechanical strength, whiteness, weavability, biocompatibility, and washability (with more than 60 home washes), comparable to those of regular textile yarns. They can serve as building blocks independently or in combination to create smart textiles with adaptive sweat wicking and intelligent moisture/heat regulation capabilities. A proposed hybrid textile integrating both the two series of smart yarns can offer dry-contact and cooling/keep-warming effects of approximately 1.6/2.8 °C, respectively, in response to changes in ambient temperature. Our method provides a rich array of design options for nonpowered MHC textiles while maintaining a balance between traditional wearing conventions and large-scale production.}

Where genetic algorithms help link the properties of smart materials and external stimuli, which outperforms traditional simulation tools for energy analysis. A comparison between the analysis process in Dynamo and Green Building Studio (GBS) emphasizes Dynamo's efficiency in simulating energy performance within the BIM environment in a shorter process. The effectiveness of simulating smart materials in Dynamo was validated in a hot climate through two scenarios of Phase change materials (BioPCM 29) and thermochromic materials (TCM), that were used in a lecture hall in an educational building in the Faculty of Engineering at Port Said University. Through the heat transfer rate indicator, energy consumption reduction rates were calculated. Integrating (BioPCM 29) into walls, ceilings, and glazing demonstrated a notable reduction in energy consumption for cooling in the summer months by a rate ranging between 23.3% and 23.4%. While (TCM) helped reduce consumption by 19.3%–19.4% in the same period of months.

This work proposes an approach named Cognitive Assessment of Smart Home Resident (CA-SHR) to measure the ability of smart home residents in executing simple to complex activities of daily living using pre-defined scores assigned by a neuropsychologist. CA-SHR also measures the quality of tasks performed by the participants using supervised classification. Furthermore, CA-SHR provides a temporal feature analysis to estimate if the temporal features help to detect impaired individuals effectively. The goal of this study is to detect cognitively impaired individuals in their early stages. CA-SHR assess the health condition of individuals through significant features and improving the representation of dementia patients. For the classification of individuals into healthy, Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and dementia categories, we use ensemble AdaBoost. This results in improving the reliability of the CA-SHR through the correct assignment of labels to the smart home resident compared with existing techniques.}

abstract = {Sustainable cities have, since the early 1990s, been the leading global paradigm of urbanism thanks to the different models of sustainable urban form proposed as new frameworks for the redesigning and restructuring of urban places to make urban living more sustainable. The compact city is the most preferred model of sustainable urbanism for responding to the challenges of sustainable development. However, despite the benefits claimed by the advocates of this model, its critics highlight a number of conflicts and contentions. This is coupled with several problems, issues, and challenges considering the very fragmented picture that arises of change on the ground in the face of urbanization. In this context, it has been suggested that the compact city needs to embrace and leverage what advanced ICT has to offer so as to improve, advance, and maintain its contribution to sustainability. With the above in regard, this paper provides a comprehensive state–of–the–art review of compact urbanism as a set of planning and development practices and strategies, focusing on the three dimensions of sustainability and the significant, yet untapped, potential of big data technology for enhancing such practices and strategies under what is labelled ‘data–driven smart sustainable urbanism.’ This paper identifies compactness, density, diversity, mixed land use, sustainable transportation, and green space as the prevalent design strategies of the compact city. At the heart of this model is the clear synergy between the underlying strategies in terms of their cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects as regards the tripartite value of sustainability. Indeed, this paper corroborates that the compact city is justified by its ability to contribute to the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability. Nevertheless, the economic goals seem to dominate over the environmental and social goals, notwithstanding the general claim about the three sustainability dimensions being equally important and mutually dependent. Further, this paper reveals that big data technology holds great potential for enhancing compact urbanism with respect to sustainability. This thorough review of and critique on the existing work on the compact city provides a reference for researchers and practitioners in related communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the field of compact urbanism and its relation to data–driven smart urbanism. This work serves to inform various urban stakeholders about the benefits of data-driven smart solutions for advancing sustainability.}

The intricacy of detecting fraud within smart grids demands sophisticated techniques for scrutinizing vast volumes of time series data. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates time series aggregation functions, time series clustering using Spearman’s distance, and reservoir computing forecasting to effectively identify fraud within smart grid systems. Specifically, the proposed methodology employs a clustering approach based on Spearman’s rank distance to summarize time series data. This enables the aggregation of similar daily patterns, providing highly descriptive power and simplifying forecasting through Reservoir Computing. The subsequent step classifies each prosumer behavior as regular or potentially fraudulent. The SpeCluRC-NTL methodology, as proposed, is designed to detect fraud almost in real-time with low operational costs. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed through empirical findings gathered from the Parc Bit distribution grid. This grid is located near Palma (Balearic Islands), Spain. The results of our research highlight the demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed approach, revealing its promising potential as it undergoes testing at the ParcBit premises. In comparison to previous works, SpeCluRC-NTL showcases its ability to reduce the false positive rate while maintaining a high true positive ratio, resulting in an increased AUC score. This has substantial implications for mitigating financial losses and addressing the various impacts associated with fraudulent activities in smart grids.}

Smart user interfaces, smart homes, or smart buildings are becoming common examples in the new era of smart cities. Software architectures usually related to these domains need to be adapted and reconfigured at run-time, for example, to provide new services, react to user interaction, or due to changes decided from the business logic of the application. Component-based techniques are a suitable way to carry out this kind of adaptation, as dynamic reconfiguration operations can be applied to the architecture. In this paper, we address run-time generation of component-based applications, taking the abstract definitions of their architecture as a reference, in addition to a set of available components. The process calculates the best configuration of components from the abstract definition by applying a trading approach based on an adapted A* algorithm. This algorithm uses heuristics based on syntactic and semantic information obtained from the component definitions. A case study related to mashup user interfaces formed by coarse-grained components is also explained. In short, the results show the usefulness of heuristics and suitable execution times for building the best configurations.}

Therefore, there is a true need to develop methods to evaluate ecological functions provided by urban soils in order to promote smart urban planning. This work aims first at identifying relevant soil indicators based either on in situ description, in situ measurement or lab analysis. Then, 9 soil functions and sub-functions were selected to meet the main expectations regarding soil health in urban contexts. A crucial step of the present research was then to select adequate indicators for each soil function and then to create adapted reference frameworks; they were in the form of 4 classes with scores ranging from 0 to 3. All the reference frameworks were developed to evaluate soil indicators in order to score soil functions, either by using existing scientific or technical standards or references or based on the expertise of the co-authors. Our model was later tested on an original database of 109 different urban soils located in 7 cities of Western Europe and under various land uses. The scores calculated for 8 soil functions of 109 soils followed a Gaussian distribution. The scoring successfully expressed the strong contrasts between the various soils; the lowest scores were calculated for sealed soils and soils located in urban brownfields, whereas the highest were found for soils located in city parks or urban agriculture. Despite requiring a soil expertise, the proposed approach is easy to implement and could help reveal the true potential of urban soils in order to promote smart urban planning and enhance their contribution to global health.}

This paper examines a number of ecological scenarios that could create smart networks in different parts of the Canal with its overlapping industrial estates, farms, villages, business parks, and ports. Utilising a Delphi Technique, a series of cross-boundary multi-disciplinary meetings and workshops with key experts, partners from City Councils, key developers, industry partners and landowners were designed to identify consensus on potential future scenarios for the MSC.

Nonetheless, limited progress has been made to quantify the impact of prosumer and energy manager preferences and the integrated socio-economic-environmental dynamics on energy scheduling and stakeholder satisfaction within smart communities. This study aims to overcome this challenge by proposing a socio-economic-environmental optimization model based on a preference-oriented management approach, which quantifies the impact of energy scheduling on stakeholder satisfaction in smart communities. The model inputs include infrastructure configurations, energy consumption patterns, and weather data. The simulation method includes the application of deep learning and System Advisor Model software in predicting weather conditions and photovoltaic and wind turbine systems energy generation. The simulation results are then imported as parameters in GAMS software to optimize the stakeholder satisfaction using CPLEX solver. Quantitative results show that with the simultaneous use of electric vehicles and energy exchange between energy communities, the highest level of satisfaction of the stakeholders in the smart grid including energy communities has been achieved at hour 24 and at the rate of 0.99 per-unit. The model reveals notable enhancements in stakeholder satisfaction, particularly through the integration of electric vehicles and energy trading in smart grids. It underscores the critical impact of aligning renewable energy strategies with prosumer socio-economic-environmental preferences, offering valuable insights for energy managers, policymakers, and community planners in fostering efficient, community-oriented smart grid systems.}

Therefore, this study proposes a classification matrix based on the interaction between population and economic activity indicators to describe the characteristics of growing or shrinking cities adequately. The authors applied the matrix to categorize 228 administrative districts in South Korea, taking into account the distinct characteristics of the categorized growth and shrinkage patterns. The results show that these patterns can be subdivided into eight types of growing or shrinking cities, depending on which indicator between population or economic activity change is more predominant. The authors found that cities with declined population and increased economic activity could give rise to growth patterns. These findings suggest that the classification matrix can provide researchers and policymakers with a sophisticated analytical frame for diagnosing and classifying urban change, which can contribute to the enactment of appropriate urban and regional policies.}

abstract = {The concept of a smart city is emerging to address significant challenges arising from rapid urbanization, economic growth, and climate change. Innovative technologies can be used as a means to promote sustainable and inclusive urban development. These technolgies include the deployment of the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), energy management, and smart transportation. In a smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) play a vital role in efficient traffic management. This paper explores the use of hybrid artificial intelligence techniques for predicting short-term traffic flow data from M25 motorways in the UK. Since volume traffic flow data are non-stationary, wavelet transform (WT) as a powerful signal analyzer is applied for signal decomposition for the elimination of redundant data from input matrices. The feature selection method based on Gram-Schmidt (GS) is used for the selection of more valuable features. The elimination of redundant data can speed up the learning process and improve the generalisation capability of the prediction models. After a pre-processing stage, a wavelet neural network (WNN) with a simple structure is applied as a powerful prediction tool. Two separate structures are considered for the prediction of weekday and weekend traffic volume data. The experiments explore that the debauchies-4 (db4) wavelet function with 7 decomposition levels leads to the best detection accuracy. Moreover, the range of forecasting, the type of the day, the level of decomposition, and other factors all have an impact on prediction stability. Compared with existing prediction methods, the proposed approach produces lower values of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for all step-horizons analyzed. These findings provide valuable implications and insights into the development of an efficient and reliable road condition monitoring system for delivering secure and sustainable transportation services.}

abstract = {Electronic components are rapidly updated in the context of expanding application requirements, and communication protocols used in combination with various electronic devices are also emerging. On this basis, IoT technology has developed a variety of sensor devices and gateways, which are widely used in cities. In the field of wisdom, applying IoT technology to classrooms can effectively improve the deficiencies of traditional teaching models. Fuzzy control theory is usually based on fuzzy sets in mathematics, and is combined with neural network, genetic and probability algorithms to form a calculation method. Fuzzy calculation has the ability to simplify the system input of a variety of complex variables, and its applications in the field of education are mainly: provide evaluation of teachers' teaching effectiveness. The advancement of science and technology has promoted the change and updating of the teaching mode. With the continuous advancement of basic education curriculum reform and the continuous deepening of classroom teaching reform, classroom teaching is also in urgent need of reform, from traditional classrooms to smart classrooms. Smart classrooms combine advanced technology with teachers' teaching. Through the dynamic data, the analysis instantly understands the student's learning situation, and then integrates it into education and teaching in a targeted manner. This paper conducts a questionnaire survey on the current situation of smart classroom teaching, and summarizes the current teaching problems. Then, combining the Internet of Things, fuzzy control and deep learning technology, from the two aspects of school teachers and students, it is proposed for smart classroom to promote students' learning effect. With its novel and new-style teaching advantages, smart classroom has gradually entered the public's vision and gained the attention and support of the majority of educators. Taking Grand Wisdom Classroom as an example, it uses the “Internet +" way of thinking and the new generation of information technology such as big data and cloud computing to create intelligent and efficient classrooms, realizing the whole process of application before, during and after class, and promoting the development of students' wisdom. Under the mobile Internet model, students and teachers can communicate anytime and anywhere. Combined with the analysis and application of our big data technology, data-based precision teaching becomes possible. In a real sense, learning before teaching can be realized and teaching can be determined by learning.}

abstract = {A smart grid is a developing electrical network of transmission lines, switches, transformers, protection equipment, sensors, and information technologies working together and are the result of a dynamic co-evolution process that leverages the integration of technological advances. These are facing several challenges with renewable energy resources, has high consumption, and the ever-increasing demand for electricity at commercial, residential, and industrial levels. In recent decades, the main grid is facing several challenges related to the integration of renewable energy resources, deployment of grid-level energy storage devices, deployment of new usages such as the electric vehicle, massive usage of power electronic devices at different electric grid stages, and the inter-connection with microgrids and prosumers. This paper aims to identify the challenges, control these perspectives, for attaining the energy infrastructures, to achieve the directions of future research and development, with respect to power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption. In this study, future smart grids creation and dimensionality reduction with signal handling on the smart grid using, targeted projection pursuit for future smart grids signal analysis is proposed, in which the Signal handling on the smart grid uses Blind equalization and is imposed to transmit the signal which is inferred from the received signal. The smart grid is based on the Non-negative matrix factorization; the Sallen-key topology is implemented to reduce the noise in the signal. Moreover, in this paper, we perform the targeted projection pursuit, the Cognitive Dimensionality Reduction is used for the analysis of n-way arrays, nonlinear dimensionality reduction, and we use the Linear predictive coding, and Hilbert spectrum which represents the spectral envelope of a digital signal of speech in the compressed form. The experiments on the proposed method, show the effectiveness of our method is 92 % well organised with extensive results at Targeted projection pursuit for future smart grids. The signal analysis shows the execution between past research and the ongoing research has achieved an efficiency rate of 92.2 %, in which the current approach outperforms 94.87 % compared existing approach. The analysis of future smart grids creation, Signal Dimensionality Reduction is 75 % higher than the existing analysis. The proposed system flow is performed with more versatility, and energy efficiency is 75.65 % and 34.54 % efficiency than the existing system.}
