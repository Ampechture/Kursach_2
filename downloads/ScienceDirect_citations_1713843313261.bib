abstract = {Smart city analytics involves tracking, interpreting, and evaluating the sentiments and emotions that are shared via online social media channels. Sentiment analysis of social media posts has become increasingly prominent in recent years as a means of gaining insights into how members of the public perceive current affairs. The ongoing research in this domain has leveraged multiple types of sentiment analysis. However, although the existing approaches enable researchers to acquire retrospective insights into public opinion, they do not enable a real-time evaluation. In addition, they are not readily scalable and necessitate the analysis of a significant amount of posts (in the millions) to facilitate a more in-depth evaluation. The study outlined in this paper was designed to address these shortcomings by presenting a framework that facilitates a real-time evaluation of the evolution of opinions shared by prominent public features and their respective followers; that is, high-impact posts. The developed solution encompasses a sophisticated Bi-directional LSTM classifier that was implemented and tested using a dataset consisting of 278,000 tweets related to the topic of climate change. The outcomes reveal that the proposed classifier achieved the following accuracies: 88.41% for discrimination; 89.66% for anger; 87.01% for inspiration; and 87.52% for joy - with negative emotions being more accurately classified than positive emotions. Similarly, the sentiment classification performance yielded accuracies of 89.32% for support and 89.80% for strong support, as well as 88.14% for opposition and 87.52% for strong opposition. In addition, the findings of the study indicated that geographic location, chosen topic, cultural sensitivities, and posting frequency all play a critical role in public reactions to posts and the ensuing perspectives they adopt. The solution stands out from existing retrospective analysis methods because it does not rely on the analysis of vast quantities of data records; rather, it can perform real-time, high-impact content analysis in a resource-efficient and sustainable manner. This framework can be used to generate insights into how public opinion is developing on a real-time basis. As such, it can have meaningful application within social media analysis efforts.}

Cities are complex systems, making it extremely difficult to build and run cities in a way that all the elements of the system operate in harmony. Recently a concept of urbanome, the genome of the city was proposed to address this complexity. Here we first explore this concept and analogy, taking advantage of the potential of other ‘omics, modern data collection techniques, Big Data analysis methods and a transdisciplinary approach. Then, we propose a theoretical approach to build the urbanome as a means of quantifying and qualifying population outcomes, being a function of the form of an urban area including the built environment, the physical and social services it provides, and the population density.}

Increasing extreme weather leaves SMSC, having lower adaptive capacity, ill-equipped to respond. Literature, however, has focused mainly on major cities. Therefore, analysis of the level of scientific research in SMSC is necessary. A scoping review was conducted in this work utilizing three search engines (Web of Science, Academic Premier Search, and Google Scholar) to discover SMSC research on three primary topics: sustainability, climate-induced migration, and climate resiliency. Since 1901, 6493 SMSC papers were published. Of these, 25 sustainability, 61 migration, and 57 climate resiliency papers on SMSC were identified and reviewed. Sustainability literature is lacking globally, mainly being conducted in European countries. Climate migration literature shows a clear underrepresentation of the role of SMSC in the global migration system. The resilience literature review demonstrated locational gaps by research theme and a need for more specific climate related hazard research globally. A lack of research means a lack of understanding of what consequences SMSC may face under a changing climate. This paper provides suggestions on focus areas for future SMSC research.}

Energy consumption can be predicted quite accurately at a high level which enables to pre-scheduling of production by large power plants. Traditionally, only few actors are involved in the generation, trade, and transportation of electricity, but this is changing rapidly. The increasing share of decentralized renewable energy conversion in combination with new types of buyers and suppliers will drastically alter the operation of electricity infrastructure systems. It has to become smart: the Smart Grid or more general Smart Energy System. In order to minimize uncertainty in the balance between energy supply and demand it is necessary to develop realistic user demand, building and building services installations behavior and Smart Grid interaction. Monitoring the needs of individual users is necessary to predict future states of the demand for the SES (e.g. based on user behavior). The future consumer of energy can become a producer due to the decentralized renewable energy conversion. To control this dynamic and interactive prosumer process support is needed to optimize interaction between offices and Smart Grid. The article describes the first steps towards such system.}

abstract = {In the residential area, the cost of the electricity is at the maximum level during the peak demand periods. Regarding this, the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading strategy is a hopeful and practical solution to deal with this problem. Also, in the P2P home energy management system, the buildings have become more flexible by sharing their powers to meet their electricity demands. In this work, we have considered three buildings, in which two of them are equipped with solar panels, and in the third one, the hydrogen source is established. In the proposed residential zone, the considered buildings are connected in order to perform P2P transactions to reduce the energy billing. The operator of the system is wholly investigated under uncertain conditions based on the downside risk constraint (DRC) method in both risk-averse and risk-neutral models. With the help of a P2P energy trading strategy as well as renewable energy resources, we can provide electricity to customers in remote areas where it is not possible to supply electricity or is not economically beneficial. Based on the obtained results, the function of the proposed system has manifested in an acceptable manner. For instance, in the solar panel function in the second building, the amount of generated solar power is 30 kW in the risk-averse model, whereas, in the risk-neutral model, it is 18 kW. On the other hand, the level of consumed electricity by the electrolyzer system is generally lower in the risk-averse model than risk-neutral model in the second season.}

In this system, electricity generated from widely introduced solar photovoltaic panels (PVs) is stored in the “cars not in use” in a city. In Japan, almost half of the cars in the central Tokyo metropolitan area are used only on weekends and thus are kept parked during weekdays. These cars represent a huge new potential storage depot if they were replaced by electric vehicles (EVs), that is, they could be used as storage batteries in a V2G system to attain carbon neutral energy self-sufficient community. The results of our study showed that although the entire electricity surplus (PV supply minus demand) could be stored without waste if 12% of the EVs not in use were utilized as storage batteries at an aggregate (city) level in August (with maximum solar irradiance), there exist significant regional mismatches at the local district level. Hence, based on the geographical electricity surplus estimates, this paper develops a metaheuristic-based graph portioning spatial clustering algorithm to find optimal spatial clusters which minimizing local spatial discrepancies between electricity surplus and storage potential.}

Resumen
En este artículo se sostiene que es necesario aplicar modelos de impacto económico en las políticas de especialización inteligente a fin de obtener estimaciones fiables del impacto económico. Las soluciones sugeridas en la literatura sobre especialización inteligente (S3, por sus siglas en inglés) para las evaluaciones del impacto económico solo incluyen parcialmente los efectos económicos. Para estimar en su totalidad los impactos en las dimensiones industrial, regional y nacional se hace necesaria la aplicación de modelos económicos diseñados específicamente para ello. Se amplió el modelo de impacto de la política geográfica macro y regional (GMR) de Hungría con características adicionales para poder aplicar este modelo a las estimaciones de impacto económico de las soluciones para la especialización inteligente. En nuestras simulaciones de políticas se ilustra cómo ayuda la aplicación de este modelo a los responsables políticos en el proceso de asignación de prioridades.

This should be done by distributing intelligence over the entire grid, thereby, the intermittent production of renewable energy, customer consumption and electricity storage in electrical vehicles (EVs) could be managed in real time. In this paper, the Hierarchical and Distributed Cognitive Radio Architecture Management (HDCRAM), initially proposed to manage Cognitive Radio systems, is proposed for the management of the SG. This architecture can both be applied to the whole SG and to any sub-part (distribution network, production network, microgrid). In this paper we focus on the distribution network and the hierarchical position of each element is identified. As an example, HDCRAM is used for smart home management and multi-agent based modeling shows benefits of such an architecture. In the simulated scenario, without any management the peak power consumption is 5500 W and the hierarchical and distributed management allows to reduce it to 900 W. This diminution allows to reduce the pressure on the grid and can decrease the risk of failure.}

Our results show that state-of-the-art, schedule-based occupancy prediction algorithms achieve an overall prediction accuracy of over 80%. We also show that the performance of these algorithms is close to the theoretical upper bound expressed by the predictability of the input schedules. Building upon these results, we used ISO 13790-standard modelling techniques to analyse the energy savings that can be achieved by smart heating controllers that use occupancy predictors. Furthermore, we investigated the trade-off between achievable savings (typically 6–17% on average) and the risk of comfort loss for household residents.}

We propose an original architecture that regulates accesses to industrial systems’ resources through authorization delegation procedures. It guarantees several benefits that include the possibility of auditing authorizations released by delegated third parties, of detecting misconducts and possible attacks, and of assuring attribution of misconducts. The proposed solution is compatible with constraints characterizing industrial environments and with security and performance requirements of industrial architectures. The performance and latencies of the auditing mechanisms are evaluated through a prototype.}

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 1.35 million people are killed, and over 50 million are injured due to road accidents throughout the world. Unfortunately, as compared to other developing countries with the same ratio of vehicle possession, in Saudi Arabia, the fatalities and injuries are much higher. Every year around 7000–9000 people die, and over 39000 serious injuries occur in road accidents. There is at least one accident happens every minute in Saudi Arabia. To decrease the road traffic accidents, fatalities, and injuries caused by them, the Saudi Ministry of Interior came up with new rules, regulations, and hefty fines. Also, they introduced a new traffic system called the SAHER system. Still, due to the static nature and other limitations of the system, the drivers found loopholes and ways to deceive the system to avoid the fines and not being caught by the system. The most common violation includes excess speed, abrupt deceleration, and distracted driving. In this paper, we propose a smart traffic surveillance system based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 5G technology. This traffic monitoring system covers the existing limitations of the SAHER system deployed in KSA. By overcoming the existing limitations and loopholes of the SAHER system, it is observed that the number of accidents and fatalities can be decreased. The projected results show that those violations when to overcome, the number of accidents per year falls to 299,317 leading to 4,868 deaths and 33,199 injuries for 1st year, and in the next five years the number of deaths and will be decreased to 3,745 and injuries to 16,600 based on the current data available. We aim the system will further reduce the number of accidents and fatalities and injuries caused by it.}

abstract = {The major goal of this research is to identify optimal arrangement of forced cooling enhancements such as baffles and fins. This research focuses to determine the effect of the different configurations for achieving higher thermal efficiency of the 150 W solar photovoltaic thermal collectors (PV/T). The air-cooling enhancements evaluated in this PV/T system are free duct without fins, ducts with fully transverse fins, partially transverse fins, longitudinal fins with straight baffles and inclined baffles. The experiments are done on hot days of summer in May 2018, India and achieved diverse flow rates of air mass ranging from 0.012 to 0.016 kg/s. The Reynolds number obtained in the flow experiments are in the range of 900–1300 and Nusselt number 35–130.A Computational fluid dynamics study was established to achieve a parametric research to determine surface and outside profiles to study the cooling effectiveness. The impacts on flow rate of air mass on the outlet T, Reynolds Number, coefficient of heat transfer and Nusselt number were studied. The maximum irreversibility occurred at the free type fins whereas minimum irreversibility obtained at longitudinal type with inclined baffles and detected that PV/T system have a prodigious impact on the energy efficacy as well as energy losses increased with increasing surface T. This research displayed that the coefficient of heat transfer of solar panel upsurges by means of growing Reynolds number. Additionally, the PV module thermal efficacy by growing flow rate and reduced with increasing friction factor. An increase by 6–8% in exergy efficiency and 5% to 7% in energy efficiency was recorded while using these forced air-cooling enhancements. A reasonable agreement was reached between experimental and computational model. The exergy performance was increased from 20% to 28 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. The thermal energy performance was increased from 12 to 18 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. This is the maximum energy efficiency achieved in this PV/T system with the Nusselt number ranging from 30 to 130 and Reynolds number 900–1300. This study showed that Nusselt number of PV/T system upsurges with growing Reynolds number of air flow. The PV module thermal efficacy upsurges by means of growing flow rate as the friction factor increases. The longitudinal fins with inclined baffles provided higher friction factor, thereby ensured higher heat transfer rate. The fins and baffles employed in our research are economical and relaxed to manufacture and install. They bid a fairly lower friction lack in movement of air and henceforth do not necessitate higher fan power. This set up can be used for green and smart cities as it helped to reduce the energy consumption considerably.}

According to the trend of global warming, our society is suffering from serious damage from urban heat islands, especially negatively affecting human health and thermal comfort. Therefore, it is very important to develop and evaluate adaptive technology for providing pleasant thermal comfort to humans. This study select fog cooling as adaptive technology for human thermal comfort, and indoor and outdoor simulation were performed using STAR CCM+, a computational fluid dynamics(CFD) program. Moreover, transient analysis to validate the outdoor model of CFD and parametric study to identify the correlation between the environmental factors and fog cooling were performed. When initial temperature set as 45 °C at a relative humidity of 90% and wind speed of 1 m/s, a temperature reduction of 8.92% can be obtained. Regardless of the temperature and humidity conditions, the temperature reduction effect of fog cooling was ∼1% if the wind speed increased above 5 m/s.

The SRS addresses the limitations of the current systems with the potential for high performance and usage for a variety of applications. SRS nodes are mounted on the road surface along the lane separation lines instead of the intrusive middle of the lane detection sensors. The key innovation in SRS design is its ability to detect vehicles in two adjacent lanes in real time by employing a three-axis geomagnetic sensor mounting on the lane line, which is the basis of advanced applications such as traffic surveillance, driving guidance, and congestion monitoring. Multiple vehicles are recognized based on the superposition of the disturbance of the geomagnetic fields. Magnetic field changes along the axes are simulated and analyzed with vehicles modeled as magnet dipoles to determine the criteria for the detection of vehicles in adjacent lanes, which are verified by actual waveforms. Extended dual-window and two-lane vehicle detection algorithms are developed, enabling to distinguish five detection scenarios and count vehicles in two lanes. Field test results show that one SRS can detect traffic in adjacent lanes with a correct vehicle detection rate of over 98%, the same level achievable by intrusive middle of the lane detectors. Based on the enhanced features, high performance, cost-effectiveness, and value-added services, the SRS is a significant improvement on the conventional studs for intelligent transport system applications.}

Crowding in public transport can be of major influence on passengers’ travel experience and therefore affect route and mode choice. In this study, crowding valuation for urban tram and bus travelling is determined fully based on revealed preference data. Urban tram and bus crowding valuation is estimated in a European context based on a Dutch case study network. Based on the estimated discrete choice model, we conclude that crowding plays a significant role in passengers’ route choice in public transport. The average crowding multiplier of in-vehicle time equals 1.16 when all seats are occupied. For frequent travellers, this value is equal to 1.31. Our study results suggest that infrequent travellers do not incorporate expected crowding in their route choice. The insights gained from our study can support the decision-making process of policy-makers, by quantifying the benefits of measures aiming to reduce crowding levels for example in a cost–benefit analysis framework.}

Furthermore, solar-PV homes integrated with hybrid or electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as a paradigm for future homes. Given the fact that there exists a considerable price difference between grid electricity supply and FiTs, decision making of energy storage using batteries becomes an imperative topic. This research proposes an innovative and generic framework for the decision making of energy storage using batteries based on Smart Meter data, which incorporates the actual energy generation and consumption patterns of solar-PV homes. The proposed energy storage decision is based on a developed economic model, with the consideration of the electricity price from the grid, the FiTs, and the storage cost using batteries (i.e. the average price per kWh of battery capital cost and maintenance cost). Moreover, an intelligent algorithm is developed to calculate the electricity quantities, i.e. electricity supplied from the grid, fed into the grid and stored in a battery of a given capacity, based on the monitored data obtained from a Smart Meter over a year. The results reveal that at the present utility prices of $0.3/kWh and a feed-in-tariff of $0.10/kWh in the studied region, energy storage with a battery cost of $0.2/kWh or more is excessive and not economically feasible. However, with the increasing cost of electricity in recent years and constant changes in battery price, the outcomes could quickly reverse. This research contributes an innovative framework for battery storage decision-making of solar-PV homes, based on economic analysis and Smart Meter data.}

Although there are long payback times, our simulations demonstrate that the proposed all-PV blended system can meet the energy needs of modern buildings (up to 78%, location dependent) and can be scaled up for entire buildings. The simulated results indicate that Middle Eastern cities are particularly suitable for these hybrid systems, generating approximately 1.2 times more power compared to Toronto, Canada.

A discrete choice experiment was conducted with smallholder farmers in Ethiopia to elicit their willingness to participate in a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme that incentivizes integrating faidherbia albida (a fertilizer tree) in their mono-cropping farming system. Attributes evaluated are “number of planted trees”, “payment amount”, “payment type”, and “contract period”. The presence of heterogeneity in the choice behavior of farmers warrants the use of the generalized multinomial logit and latent class conditional logit models to allow for farmer- and class-specific preferences, respectively. The results show that farmers derive higher utility from up-front payments. Farmers also strongly prefer food as the mode of payment than cash. Moreover, low numbers of mandatory planted trees and short-term contracts are found to be essential attributes that positively affect farmers’ decisions to take-up a contractual arrangement to grow trees on their agricultural land. Our analysis also shows the presence of heterogeneity in preferences across segments of farmers in conjunction with differences in household characteristics. These findings shed light on the considerations that must be accounted for when designing and implementing environmental policies such as PES schemes that promote large-scale adoption of climate-smart agroforestry, which would transform smallholder agriculture into a sustainable farming system.}

abstract = {As energy transitions advance through the introduction of renewable energy production and new types of energy demands, expectations for more flexible electricity consumption has risen on agendas among system designers and scholars. Social scientists have followed this development through studies of technological visions and users of new flexibility techniques (e.g. demand-side management, pricing, storage). Based on interviews with electricity systems developers and householders in Norway this article complements this body of scholarship and relates it to emerging themes in sustainability transitions research. We focus on end-user flexibility and operationalize the new concept of flexibility capital, developed within energy justice literature, to examine different framings of flexibility. The research examines how some householders have more capability of being flexible than others. Furthermore, we show how consumer understandings of flexibility are embedded in everyday life, and differs from systems developers, who primarily understands flexibility as acting economically rational and making cost-conscious decisions.}

This study presents the outcome of a new system architecture and control algorithm that can use both battery storage and manage the temperature of thermal appliances. The proposed algorithm receives the price information from the utility company in advance and purchases the electricity at off-peak hours and utilizes the battery as well as manages the temperature of the thermal appliances during peak hours. The proposed algorithm assures that the power consumption of the electrical appliances is always less than certain level. The proposed house is supported by the battery system and Photovoltaic system as to increase the green index by utilizing alternative energy resource. The amount of the power that can be drained from the battery is limited by the algorithm to remain more during a day. The simulation results indicate that the proposed system is able to reduce the electricity price up to 20% a day without sacrificing the user’s comfort.}

Demand-side energy management is an imperative tool to avoid significant deficiency from the supply end and improve energy efficiency. The trend in energy management lays focus on reducing the overall cost of electricity without limiting the consumption counterpart by instead choosing to reduce the power consumption during peak hours. The above issue seeks for design and development of a flexible and portable system to cover a wide variety of consumers for balancing the overall system. The design of smart energy management system is intended to replace the scenario of a complete power outage in a region with partial load shedding in a controlled manner as per the consumer’s preference. Demonstration of experimental work is carried out assuming demand response event and also, considering the maximum demand limit constraint with different cases and changing the order of priority assigned to an appliance. Cost optimization algorithms based on time of usage and user comfort level with sensory information features are embedded within SEMS. Reliable ZigBee communication for home area network is established and also, an IoT environment is developed for data storage and analytics.}

One key component of the smart gird is an integrated communication network. To make the smart grid more dependable, it is extremely important to ensure that messages are exchanged over the communication network in a reliable and timely manner. A multiple path routing might be one way to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, the existing algorithms which compute multiple node-disjoint paths are not sufficient for this purpose since in a smart grid communication network, node failures can be co-related. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a new quality multiple routing path computation problem in a smart grid communication network, namely the min–max non-disrupting k path computation problem (M2NkPCP). We show this problem is NP-hard and propose two heuristic algorithms for it. In addition, we evaluate the average performance of the algorithms via simulation.}

The literature yet presents a limited number of references explicitly concerning the topic of qualified data acquisition. In this sense, the present literature review aims to update the joint subject of IoT and vital signs, seeking to understand the state-of-the-art and future directions. We have analyzed 78 articles and IoT manufacturer websites that address vital signs collection to answer a group of primary and specific questions. In particular, we revisited architectures, communication protocols, data acquisition mechanisms, evaluation metrics, and how to efficiently transfer data through the lens of sensors, actuators, and healthcare. Currently, two themes are considered as promising directions for studies in the joint area of IoT and vital sign-based healthcare monitoring. The first is the connection promotion between third-party applications and IoT devices to collect and process time-critical data with the support of edge, fog, and cloud infrastructures. The second theme again brings the focus to data compression methodologies since monitoring vital signs in a smart city geographical area naturally requires strategies to optimize network bandwidth consumption and data storage on computational resources. Moreover, both themes are directly linked to energy-saving approaches and quality of service (QoS) for efficient patient healthcare checking.}

These systems focus either on specific health-related conditions or on supporting the more general aims of comfort, well-being, and quality of life. However, there remain several technological (interoperability, expandability, etc.) and societal (cost, privacy, etc.) challenges to be addressed before smart biosensor systems are widely adopted.

The first concerns a smart living solution platform that integrates heterogeneous sensors and assistive medical and mobile devices, enabling continuous data collection from the everyday lives of the elderly and data analytics that support personalized interventions. The second presents an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem comprising sensors and smart wearables to improve occupational safety and workforce productivity through personalized recommendations.

In contrast, transport is one of the leading global sources of climate change and global warming; it is contributed to over 62% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The inefficiency of the transportation system will lead to serious environmental degradation, e.g., air pollution, and negative social and economic consequences, thereby transportation-related challenges such as congestion, road safety, vehicular emissions, etc., have been ranked as the major troubles of human societies. The current advancements in geo-sensing, smart algorithms, cloud computing, data science, and processing technologies could somehow and somewhat address some of those serious challenges. For example, the intelligent transportation systems could significantly enjoy intelligent geo-sensing technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms to optimize traffic management. These state-of-the-art packages could support new technologies and services such as the Internet of Things, eco-driving/routing, signalized intersections, etc., which can reduce to some extent fuel consumption and on-road emissions. This work provides a summary of the contribution of transportation to civilization, development, economy, and environmental degradation. It will then review the role of intelligent geo-sensing technologies in moving toward sustainable, active, and green transport. Finally, it has been argued that exiting or due geodata science/technologies could somehow address the environmental drawbacks of the transportations and can be considered as a promising solution for the challenges ahead.}

A three-phase smart composite constituted of CoFe2O4 piezomagnetic matrix embedded with carbon fibers in the piezoelectric shell is considered for evaluation. The coupling characteristics of the smart carbon/PZT-5A (PZT-7A)/CoFe2O4 composites significantly changes with the interphase thickness of piezoelectric interphase. Thereby the stiffness and the natural frequency of the structure composed of these three-phase MEE materials drastically changes. A finite element (FE) formulation has been derived incorporating Hamilton’s principle. The equations of motion are obtained through condensation technique. The results reveal a significant effect of interphase thickness on the natural frequency of the three-phase smart magneto-electro-elastic plate. Further, a special attention has been paid on evaluating the influence of carbon fiber/piezoelectric volume fraction on the free vibration behaviour of TPS-MEE plate.

Last-mile personalized fulfillment can have a catalyst role in the proliferation of the Industry 4.0.

However, the literature is not clear about the breakdown of the supply chain to enhance cities’ sustainability and reducing the number of transports and circulating vehicles. Stemming from an empirical study to simulate the existing gap in the market and the development of a case study through structured interviews with privileged interlocutors complemented by the document analysis, this paper highlights how the integration of local stakeholders can efficiently enhance a personalized service based on dynamic collaborations to set up the supply chain, by introducing the Last-Mile-as-a-Service (LMaaS) concept.

The full range of use for these observations by water suppliers is only beginning to be realized. Potential applications include leak detection, improved demand forecasting, variable water pricing, and improved network operations. Here we develop an approach for the classification of demand patterns and apply this approach to a set of demands collected from smart meters within a single District Metered Area (DMA) of a municipal network. The goal of this work is to develop a robust procedure for classification of demands derived from smart metering and test this procedure on observational data. A fundamental aspect of many feature classification tools is representation of what are often complex and noisy data in a low dimensional feature space that captures the important attributes of the signal. In this work, we employ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM's) as the basis set for representing demand patterns. GMM's provide a flexible approach to representing the temporal demand patterns with a relatively small number of parameters. The values of these parameters then serve as the feature set for multivariate classification. A data set of hourly demand readings spanning a six-month study period serve as the test case for analysis here. The smart meters record demands to both residential and commercial consumers. Results show that the GMM approach captures variations in the demand patterns between locations. To the first order, the identified patterns appear to be explained by the differences between residential and commercial consumers. The resulting groupings are compared to classifications made using total demand as the sole feature. The stability of the patterns over time is tested by independently clustering each month of data.}

abstract = {Background
Rapid urbanization is a major trend in global population migration. There is growing debate about whether this urban-rural disparity exacerbate depression at the individual level. This study aims to investigate how urban living has a beneficial impact on individual mental health.
Methods
Based on the data of 15,764 participants in the 2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we perform analysis of variance to identify the gap in depression levels between urban and rural areas. Extensive comparisons and detailed statistical analyses are carried out to demonstrate the differences in social participation between urban and rural residents. Finally, we conduct a series of mediation and moderation analyses to reveal the underlying mechanisms of depressive disorder benefits of cities.
Results
The results indicate that those who lived in urban areas were less likely to suffer from depression (β = −1.461, 95 % CI = [−1.691, −1.235], p < 0.001). Social engagement is found to mediate the relationship between residence type (β = 0.164, 95 % CI = [0.136, 0.193], p < 0.001) and individual depression (β = −0.462, 95 % CI = [−0.587, −0.337], p < 0.001). City size plays a moderating role in the association between urban living and social engagement.
Limitations
The mechanism is conducted through cross-sectional data. Self-reported depression status is accessed in this study, which could lead to measurement error.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the beneficial effects of urban living on individual depression, and reveals the mechanism by which urbanization at different scales affects the prevalence of depression.}

Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer’s performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.}

A natural question is then: to make the smart grid a reality will the distribution grid have to be upgraded? We assume a positive answer to the question and we consider the lower layers of medium and low voltage to be the most affected by the change. In our previous work, we analyzed samples of the Dutch distribution grid (Pagani and Aiello, 2011) and we considered possible evolutions of these using synthetic topologies modeled after studies of complex systems in other technological domains (Pagani and Aiello, 2014). In this paper, we take an extra important step by defining a methodology for evolving any existing physical power grid to a good smart grid model, thus laying the foundations for a decision support system for utilities and governmental organizations. In doing so, we consider several possible evolution strategies and apply them to the Dutch distribution grid. We show how increasing connectivity is beneficial in realizing more efficient and reliable networks. Our proposal is topological in nature, enhanced with economic considerations of the costs of such evolutions in terms of cabling expenses and economic benefits of evolving the grid.}

The present research combines two artificial intelligence fields the represented by multi-agent technologies and fuzzy logic inference systems in order to extract the needed smart data from big noisy ones. A multi-fuzzy agent-based large-scale wireless sensor network has been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Massive reforms to the Philippines' public transport system were rolled out in 2017 through its Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP) aimed at modernizing the country's jeepney industry. Consequently, there is a need to explore collaborative governance mechanisms to sustain the momentum of modernization reforms. A framework integrating crowdsourcing and digital co-production toward collaborative governance is explored through participatory action research based on the deployment of the SafeTravelPH public transport crowdsourcing platform in General Santos City, Philippines. The SafeTravelPH app was developed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform actively engages the government, transport industry providers, and passengers in sharing transformative information to improve public transport by collecting and analyzing real-time data on vehicle trajectory, boarding and alighting locations, occupancy and other public transport operational parameters. The study demonstrates the potential of digital technologies and collaborative governance approaches in modernizing local public transport services. The experiences of General Santos City can provide an exemplar for other cities in the Philippines and other developing countries.}

The increased frequency and intensity of such disruptive events is shifting priorities in electricity system planning around the world, including how multiple stakeholders consider linkages between climate vulnerability and energy. This research links smart grid development with adaptation to changing climates and explores how different stakeholders grapple with system vulnerabilities and climate disruptions. To illustrate this, the in-depth case study assesses post-Sandy discourse to compare how electricity sector stakeholder groups in New York, Massachusetts and Vermont associate energy, smart grid, and climate change. To explore how different energy system stakeholders frame the impacts of Superstorm Sandy on energy system planning, we conducted 22 focus groups with a broad range of organizations representing diverse aspects of the electricity system including utilities, regulatory authorities, research and development agencies, regional transmission organizations, academic research institutions, consumer advocacy and environmental organizations across the three states. We used these data to examine post-Sandy discourse about climate mitigation and climate adaptation, routine system management, and the potential value of “smart grid” for future energy system planning. We found that both New York and Massachusetts stakeholders focused more on climate adaptation than climate mitigation, while stakeholders in Vermont focused more on mitigation. In all three states stakeholder discussions of adaptation focused most heavily on system resilience and reliability, whereas discussions of mitigation focused on demand-side management and demand response followed by alternative energy strategies. These results suggest that extreme weather and climate disruptions will differentially shape discourse around smart grid and energy system change and shift the focus among energy system stakeholders on climate adaptation compared to climate mitigation. This research demonstrates variation between political jurisdictions (states) and energy system stakeholders in energy system planning in the face of new challenges related to an uncertain and rapidly changing world.}

abstract = {Purpose
While “Smart Growth”, Transit-Oriented-Development, and “Livability" have been around for years, little research has provided a framework to measure and understand their performance so we can realize key sustainability, livability, health, and equity outcomes.
Procedures
In response, this paper builds on literature and practice to evaluate over 350 light rail stations throughout the US, using smart growth, livability, and Transportation/Land-use Coordination (TLC) principles. Using recently developed Livability and Smart Growth Equity calculators (http://bit.ly/SmartGrowthEquity), and a smart growth/livability place-typology framework, this research assesses and grades “livability opportunity access” performance of these station areas along such key dimensions as regional/local access to jobs, services, transit, walkability. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods, we show the significant associations between this livability access and the potential for realizing key quality-of-life benefits important for both individuals and society. But are all people able to equitably access these livability opportunities around transit so they can work towards realizing their desired quality of life?
Findings
This study provides a unique evaluation of urban quality performance related to Transportation Land-use Coordination (TLC), “Smart Growth” and “New Urbanism. We find stations with higher levels of livability opportunity access to be significantly associated with key quality of life outcomes for individuals and society, such as lower rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, driving, carbon emissions, and even lower poverty and unemployment. These higher-performing stations also have higher rates of walking, bicycling, transit use associated with lower household transportation costs which offset higher housing costs. Unfortunately, these stations are not socio-economically inclusive – in sum, all stations are not equal, or equitable. Using livability-opportunity-access-assessments with livability ethics, we recommend transportation and land-use agencies coordinate policies to provide equitable access to opportunities so all people can pursue and realize sustainability, livability, health, and equity outcomes for themselves and society.}

In addition, the novel features and functionality of the toilet were assessed. Operational performance of the toilet was assessed based on data collected from nearly 700 users within a 7-weeks period. The eSOS Smart Toilet has been properly operating during the evaluation period. A methodology to distinguish defecation and urination activities was developed based on determining discharges to faeces and urine tank. The toilet achieved up to 97% savings on water consumption compared to conventional toilets. The application of sensors and ICT features, combined with manually obtained data informed comprehensive usages data e.g. 62% of identified users were female users, 40% children, and 60% of the visits were for urination and 40% and for defecation. The accumulation of urine, faeces and grey water was measured to allow for a responsive maintenance resulting in optimized operation and increased interest to use the toilet.

Eco-efficiency is a vital tool for evaluating and advancing regional sustainable development. This study presents an urban eco-efficiency (UEE) framework that deserves widespread application. By using the Super Slacks-Based Measure model, the research calculates the UEE of 284 prefecture-level cities in China from 2005 to 2022. The study employs the Standard Deviational Ellipse to illustrate the spatiotemporal pattern of UEE in China and examines its effects using non-parametric kernel density estimation, the coefficient of variation, and both global and local Moran’s I. The integration of UEE with urban development patterns, which is not immediately clear, is achieved through the entropy-based TOPSIS model. Additionally, the Malmquist index, the Two-way Fixed Effects (TWFE) model, and the Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) model reveal the dynamic changes and interactive driving mechanisms of UEE in China. The results indicate that: (1) UEE in China displays a consistent "core-periphery" pattern, exhibiting a notable hierarchical impact from regional, scale, and administrative perspectives. The complexity of UEE's spatiotemporal variations has increased due to the impact of COVID-19. (2) The UEE of Chinese cities shows a significant 'club' effect, with efficiency thresholds for high-high and low-low aggregations set at 0.8. (3) Only 25% of Chinese cities have achieved optimal UEE levels. Notably, cities in the west contribute most to national UEE growth, while midland cities contribute the least. The decreasing trend in UEE growth underscores the urgent need for a shift in China's urban development model. (4) UEE in China benefits from a resilient self-reinforcing mechanism, with urban development and economic growth significantly aiding UEE growth. Despite a non-significant negative impact from government intervention, the inhibitory effect of an intensive industrial structure on UEE turns into a promotional effect, especially following COVID-19.}

As a significant driver of digitalization, technological development has been found to have great potential as a mitigator of a wide range of issues that cities face. To ensure the available technologies are being correctly used, municipalities need to measure their degree of digitalization. This assessment is also important to improve city officials’ understanding of areas that need interventions so that cities can be managed better and provide their residents with a better quality of life. This study applies the baseline principles of the multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to develop a decision-support system that facilitates urban digitalization evaluations. The results rely on insights provided by a panel of experts in this area, who used cognitive mapping and the best worst method (BWM) to identify important evaluation criteria within urban digitalization and to analyze their cause-and-effect relationships.

abstract = {Over the past half-century, manufacturers have strived to achieve “Zero Inventory (ZI)” manufacturing, which puts the burden on suppliers to build their warehouses nearby production lines to meet the strict time delivery requirements of ZI production. Considerable improvements in manufacturing processes have been made. However, this practice in the meanwhile brings excessive warehousing operations along the supply chain. Recently, massive up-front investment has been made by some larger manufacturers for industrial 4.0 and warehouse automation to facilitate warehousing operations, such as put away and picking. However, warehouse operation activities enhanced by automation are still non-value-adding and current practice of redundant handling process implies continuous cost increase with the demand expanding. Therefore, it is of significance to simplify the corresponding operations as much as possible. This paper makes a comprehensive introduction to a new manufacturing paradigm named Zero-Warehousing Smart Manufacturing (ZWSM) from the concept, practices, principles, and core technologies. ZWSM basically aims to avoid traditional non-value-adding warehousing operations such as put away and order picking, as well as to reduce the warehousing space for operations to the minimum. First, prototype layout and basic practices under ZWSM are proposed. Second, synchronization, unitization and uncertainty hedging, which are the key principles to achieve the ZWSM, are explicitly introduced. Third, A Zero-Warehousing Smart Manufacturing Platform (ZWSMP) is developed with the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled infrastructures. Corresponding logistics services are presented to provide information visibility and achieve operations improvement. A case study of the Hong Kong prefabrication construction project is used to demonstrate the materials delivery process among different supply chain partners to provide a basis for zero-warehousing achievement.}

The findings demonstrate that the carbon emissions trading system can effectively decrease the total carbon emissions in pilot cities in China, and has a positive spatial spillover effect on neighboring cities of the pilot areas. The carbon emission trading system primarily reduces carbon emission by incentivizing businesses to implement eco-friendly practices and improve the industrial structure of pilot cities. Increased financial marketisation can promote the carbon emission reduction effects of the trading system.

abstract = {In this paper, we aim to understand what ICT-related automobility experiments are initiated in the Netherlands, who is involved and what promises they make, in order to get a better understanding of the magnitude and direction of change. We show an example of how to study a large variety of experiments to understand the emergence of niches before predetermining these as analytical constructs. By analyzing 118 experiments, we can identify the emergence of two niches: an automated mobility niche and a mobility services niche. The automated niche is characterized by large involvement of incumbents and a strong technological orientation. The services niche focuses more on organizational innovations and involves many new entrants. The involvement of a third actor category, ‘mature entrants’, applies to both niches and concern those actors that fall more or less in-between the common ‘incumbent-new entrant’ dichotomy. In general, experiments in the automated niche seem to strengthen the dominant role of the car in the automobility system, while services niche experiments mainly portray an altered role of the car in an alternative mobility system. We conclude that we gained a better understanding of the experiments and emerging niches, but at this stage, developments can still head in different directions. Nevertheless, the involvement of mature entrants in both niches, we argue, can be an important indication that more substantial change is likely to occur.}

Although there are several studies that report on consumer views on buildings with smart grid features, there is a gap in the literature about the views of the energy and buildings sectors, two important sectors for the development. This study fills this gap by presenting the views of key stakeholders from the Swedish energy and buildings sectors on the active building concept with the help of interviews and a web survey. The findings indicate that the active building concept is associated more with energy use flexibility than self-generation of electricity. The barriers to development were identified to be primarily financial due to the combination of the current low electricity prices and the high costs of technologies. Business models that reduce the financial burdens and risks related to investments can contribute to the development of smart grid technologies in buildings, which, according to the majority of respondents from the energy and buildings sectors, are to be financed by housing companies and building owners.}

The proposed architecture is based on a cloud solution, which allows the communication with the smart meters from one side and provides the needed interfaces to the distribution grid services on the other one. While a large number of applications can be designed on top of the cloud, in this paper the focus will be on a real-time distributed state estimation algorithm that enables the automatic reconfiguration of the grid.

abstract = {Background and aim
Spiral computed tomography (CT) scans, which are considered a high-contrast resolution, quick and cross-sectional imaging technique, have grown in popularity as a result of technological advancements. However, these advancements have brought with them the potential for significantly increased radiation doses to the patient. Consequently, many organizations recommended optimization and establishing diagnostic reference levels. The aim of the current study was to assess CT radiation dose and propose a local diagnostic reference level (LDRL) for the adult trunk [chest and abdomen] using CT dose parameters such as CT dose index volume (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) as well as to compare the practices for aforementioned examinations between two hospitals in Taif and Abha cities in Saudi Arabia.
Materials and methods
Data from 428 patients (216 for abdomen and 212 for chest) who were examined in two hospitals in Taif and Abha City in Saudi Arabia from December 2022 to March 2023, are used in this study. The data for hospitals in Taif and Abha are presented as ‘T’ and ‘A’ throughout this manuscript. The parameters of exposure and slice thickness were recorded in a specially designed data sheet together with the gender, age and patients morphometric. Microsoft Excel version 2010 was used to analyze results and plot the figures. The LDRL was achieved from the third quartile of CTDIvol and DLP for each hospital and examination.
Results
The average DLP (mGy-cm) and CTDIvol (mGy) for the chest and abdomen were 243 mGy cm, 5.8 mGy and 549 mGy cm, 8.6 mGy respectively. The average effective dose (ED) for chest and abdomen were 5.10 and 21.10 mSv, respectively. The proposed LDRL for the chest and abdomen were 6.9 mGy (CTDIvol), 375 mGy-cm (DLP), 7.8 mGy (CTDIvol), and 747 (DLP) mGy-cm, respectively.
Conclusion
Hospital ‘A’ irradiated patients with a higher dose for the abdomen exam than Hospital ‘T’, but both hospitals agreed on the amount of radiation dose received by patients for chest imaging. The proposed LDRL for two examinations was less than the DRL obtained from the literature.}

Selective laser melting (SLM) 3D printing has been used to make the inserts with conformal cooling channels inside. In the first phase of the development process, the research results show that conformal cooling channels reduce the cycle time approximately 30% compared to conventional cooling channels. To make the mold to be smart, the temperature of the mold will be monitored by sensor system.

Recognizing the remarkably rising deployment of EVs, there is great potential to coordinate EVs' charging in a charging station or a battery switching station for providing DR. However, the potential benefits of the battery-switching EVs for providing DR and their impacts on the aggregate load of the community have not been fully studied. In this regard, the present study proposes two novel aggregate community-level DR strategies, i.e., a strategy employing battery-charging EVs and a strategy employing battery-switching EVs. The proposed strategies are compared with the conventional strategy that only incorporates community battery energy storage for enabling peak shaving. The cost optimization is conducted with optimization parameters including demand limits during different periods and the power and energy capacity of the battery energy storage system. A stochastic bottom-up demand model for households, a probabilistic model for predicting loads of EVs, and a redistribution time-of-use tariff are implemented in the optimization. A group with 20 households and 20 EVs in New York, USA is used in the case study. The results in the case study show that the total annual costs (electricity tariff cost and battery energy storage cost if any) are reduced by 63.3 %, 54.0 %, and 14.7 % under the battery-switching EV strategy, the battery-charging EV strategy, and the battery energy storage strategy compared to the base case (i.e., DR-free strategy), respectively. Additionally, the battery-switching EV strategy enables DR throughout the day with the maximum temporal flexibility. Last, the developed two EV strategies can provide a good stability of the household loads on the grid and avoid the avalanche effect.}

On the other hand, the probability density function (PDF) of the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) for the active user connected in the HAN is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classical indoor Saleh–Valenzuela (S–V) channel. The numerical results show that WiFi Direct technique not only improves the power saving in the HAN for Smart Grid, but also enhances the reliability of HAN communications for Smart Grid.}

Energy management systems and smart appliances can facilitate this by supporting the user to shift electricity demand of appliances to moments in time when electricity is abundantly available. However, the benefits resulting from domestic demand response depend on household acceptance and behaviour change. This paper explores the real electricity demand shift of households in time and the role of smart appliances to bring about this shift. A longitudinal study was conducted among Dutch households over a period of one year. The households received a dynamic electricity tariff, an energy management system and a smart washing machine. Results show that households shift their usage of the smart washing machine mostly to the day when the sun is shining and electricity is produced by their own solar panels. Households who regularly used automation of the smart washing machine, which implicates that the use of the washing machine is automatically shifted to time periods where electricity supply is abundantly available, were more likely to shift their electricity usage. Furthermore, during the course of one year, the results remained stable, indicating a structural shift in demand.}

Presence of β-lactamase encoding genes was also evaluated.
Methods
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of GNB isolated from intra-abdominal (IAI), respiratory (RTI), and urinary tract infections (UTI) was performed according to ISO 227-1 guidelines and interpreted following CLSI and BrCAST/EUCAST guidelines. Qualifying Enterobacteriaceae isolates were screened for the presence of β-lactamase genes by PCR followed by DNA sequencing.
Results
1748 GNB collected from UTI (45.2%), IAI (25.7%) and RTI (29.1%) were evaluated. Ceftolozane-tazobactam remained highly active (94.7%) against E. coli isolates. Among K. pneumoniae, susceptibility rates were 85.9% and 85.4% for amikacin and colistin, whereas ceftolozane-tazobactam (44.1% susceptible) and carbapenems (55.2-62.2% susceptible) showed poor activity due to blaKPC-2. Against E. cloacae amikacin, imipenem, and meropenem retained good activity (>90%). Ceftolozane-tazobactam was the most potent β-lactam agent tested against P. aeruginosa (90.9% susceptible), including ceftazidime and imipenem resistant isolates. β-lactamase encoding genes testing was carried out in 433 isolates. blaCTX-M variants were predominant in E. coli, P. mirabilis and E. cloacae. Among the K. pneumoniae molecularly tested, most carried blaKPC (68.5%), with all harboring blaKPC-2, except two isolates carrying blaKPC-3 or blaKPC-30. ESBL encoding genes, mainly CTX-M family, were frequently detected in K. pneumoniae, plasmid-mediated AmpC were rare. A variety of PDC encoding genes were detected in P. aeruginosa isolates with five isolates harboring MBL and one KPC encoding genes.
Conclusion
Ceftolozane-tazobactam was very active against E. coli, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa isolates and could constitute an excellent therapeutic option including for those isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems but not producers of carbapenemases.}

To achieve this, we introduce a metric called Stickiness Index to quantify the range of preferences of users that always select to travel on the same route (high stickiness) to those with a more varied patterns of route selection (low stickiness). Adopting a visual analytic and modelling approach using a suite of regression models we find evidence to suggest that stickiness varies across the metropolitan area and over a 24-h period wherein higher stickiness is associated with high frequency users where there is substantial variability of route travel times across all alternatives. We argue that our findings are important in their capacity to contribute to a new evidence base with the potential to inform the (re)-design and scheduling of a public transit systems through unveiling the complexities of transit behaviour.}

Classification of customer based on the duration of energy usage is possible by smart meters. With the smart meter data, time of energy consumption, daily usage pattern and actual volume of energy usage offers better insight of customer consumption pattern. Clustering is the process forming groups( or cluster) based on the similarity among the data. By applying clustering methods various groups of customer can be formed based on their consumption pattern. So far clustering is based on amount of real power sanctioned for the customers but due to increased addition of renewable energy and non linear loads to the utility grid raises issues like voltage fluctuation, harmonic resonance and Total Harmonic Distortion(THD). In this paper, K-means method is used for the clustering the real power and THD load data of smart meter independently. Fuzzy logic technique is used to illustrate the combined effectiveness of real power and THD data for clustering customers and demonstrated with the real time smart grid project.}

Techniques that control indoor environments well under continuous wet weather are still lacking. A smart, indoor humidity and condensation control logic was proposed based on condensation prevention logic and the adaptations of local people in hot-humid areas. The smart control system was established, and the field test was conducted in an office building in Guangzhou, China, during typical continuous wet weather in 2017. The test confirmed that the expected targets were successfully achieved by the control system with a fault rate of 5%. Compared to the conventional control (dehumidifiers always running and windows freely opened), under the smart control, the indoor air temperature and MRT increased by 0.6–2.1 °C and 0.4–2.1 °C, respectively; the indoor relative humidity and CO2 concentration were similar; the occupants perceived the indoor environment as slightly cooler and wetter and as acceptable in terms of the thermal environment, humidity and air quality; and the daily mean energy consumption on regulating the environment decreased by 90%. The smart control shows great advantages for energy savings by proposing the control logic based on the adaptations of local people, integrating operable windows with dehumidifiers, and fully utilizing natural heat sources.}

Water end-use studies are available but none for India, which is gradually approaching a water-scarce condition from being a water-stressed country at present. This implies a need for incorporating water end-use understanding for augmenting urban recycling plans and strategies. To identify socio-demographic determinants of water end-use consumption for use in targeted urban water management, we focused on the indoor micro-components of bathing, dish-washing, laundering, and cleaning at households across the twin cities of Gujarat, a water-scarce province of India. A mixed-method approach was used for data collection in which questionnaire surveys (estimated or indirect measurements) were coupled with water meters (direct measurements) at households. The twin cities of Gujrat represent a spatial variation in greywater production at homes even at a distance of 30–40 km. Direct measurement showed less total average water consumption in Ahmedabad (83 L/HH/d) than Gandhinagar (105 L/HH/d), while indirect measurement showed indoor average consumption of 427 and 497 L/HH/d in the respective cities. Statistical significance of income, family size, and education was noticed on the water consumption pattern of a household. Besides, the study provides the attitude and practice of users towards water conservation behavior. We present new insights and recommendations for future urban water sustainability that are specific to India and applicable to several south-Asian countries.}

Furthermore, if water vapor is present in a processing unit, it can affect the final product, possibly causing changes in its material, biological, and physical properties. Measurement of humidity in the industry is challenging due to its high cost and fewer safety aspects, and thus humidity measurement is a significant research area. There are several humidity sensors available based on materials like ceramic, metals, polymers, and 2D materials. However, sensors based on these materials are very costly, have high recovery and response times, involve complex fabrication processes, and also are not environmentally friendly. On the other hand, humidity sensors fabricated from nanomaterials are very affordable, highly accurate, have high surface area, have long-lasting properties and nontoxic properties, as well as an easy manufacturing procedure. To increase the production rate in industry as well as accuracy and precision, smart manufacturing is needed. It is a manufacturing concept based on fully automatic machinery that reduces the human effort in industry and enables better controlled production. In this process the role of humidity sensors is vital, as humidity is a critical factor that needs to be measured in many applications related to smart manufacturing. This chapter reviews different types of humidity nanosensors, describing the state of the art, how they are used in smart manufacturing, fabrication methods, and important applications.}

The implementation of smart MV/LV substations can provide a significant improvement of continuity of supply. However, a large investment is required, so the optimal level of implementation must be found. This paper aims to provide a methodology to determine the optimal degree of automation comparing the costs of increasing automation to the benefits derived from the improvement of continuity of supply achieved. First, the impact of different degrees of implementation of smart MV/LV substations on continuity of supply is quantified using a reference network model (RNM). Then, an economic analysis is performed to assess automation costs and supply interruptions costs from two different perspectives, considering non supplied energy for network users and alternatively regulatory incentives for distribution companies. Finally, the optimal degree of automation is identified by comparing marginal costs. Furthermore, the methodology proposed is applied to two large scale test cases of an urban and a semi-urban network. The results obtained highlight the need to compare costs and benefits showing that there is indeed an optimal degree of automation different from the complete automation of the distribution system.}

However, multi-driver floods in coastal areas and their non-linearity in physical processes are hard to represent in physics-based numerical models (PBNMs). In this study, we investigated the performance of surrogate machine learning (ML) models and their flood prediction capability. Initially, we utilize the MIKE+ coupled 1D–2D model to simulate coastal urban flooding in one of the severely flood-affected areas of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. Then, nine ML models, including AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Process (GP), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed to surrogate the PBNM flood prediction performance and engaged to predict flood depths of the study area domain. 806 simulation scenarios of MIKE+ modeling having a spatial grid of 1107 ×1513, grid size = 2 m, extracting 270,000 inundation points to generate input data for nine ML models are used to simulate surface flood depths for the study area. Results show three ML models, GP, RF, and NN, outperform the remaining models, with R2 value of 0.997, 0.996, and 0.995, respectively. Thus, applying ML models can significantly reduce the simulation time by a PBNM, improve accuracy, and potentially be adopted for real-time forecasting and emergency management.}

A method based on the language as action principle is used to extract realistic behavior of people living in real-world smart environments.

Next, we introduced the Dagum Gini coefficient and K-means clustering to compare the city-level differences. The findings revealed the following: (1) Overall, the coordinated level of economic growth and carbon emissions in 178 cities showed a steady upward trend. (2) By decomposing inter-regional differences using the Dagum Gini coefficient, we find disparities are shrinking but remain driven primarily by between-region gaps. (3) Looking across city types, consumption-oriented cities like Beijing and Shanghai with strong service sectors lead in coordination. Among industry-oriented cities, those dependent on resources lag while equipment manufacturing-led and light industry cities fare better. Ecological priority cities show split patterns, with specialized industrial cities moderately coordinated but agriculture-and forestry-oriented cities struggling. Our findings suggested that the coordination level between carbon emissions and economic growth in most cities in China had scope for improvement. Targeted recommendations provide actionable next steps for policymakers in meeting China's “dual carbon” goals while maintaining economic stability.}

These advancements are expected to greatly enhance efficiency and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources, as well as distributed intelligence and demand response (DR) programs. As various national and international organizations have started to draw PLC regulations, standards and technologies for countries, these standards intend to determine important criteria such as bandwidth, modulation types, channel coding schemes, operating frequency and electromagnetic capability limits from fixed indoor/outdoor applications to smart grid (SG) applications. Depending on the worldwide PLC regulation, standardization and technological developments, security schemes built around them can become interoperable from a standard point of view, but still have incompatible configurations or different maturity levels, or include non-standardized PLC functions. Moreover, the PLC based systems/solutions for renewable energy integration, are also surveyed in terms of distributed-power system (DPS) and distributed energy resources (DERs) units monitoring/controlling and management purposes. Thus, a particular section is dedicated to PLC based systems/solutions utilization of renewable energy sources (RESs) in SG covering all aspects of a monotype and hybrid energy plants. Finally, the survey is carried on by reviewing the most recent and comprehensive articles to highlight the importance of PLC in a logical way in the smart grid for readers.}

Energy demand is rising around the world because of population growth and increased access to power through rapid urbanisation. These increases significantly impact the environment due to the processing of electricity from fossil fuels in heavy-duty power generation plants to cater for demand. A large amount of research has been undertaken in the recent past to mitigate energy usage via the internet of things and energy consumption prediction (IoT-ECP). However, systematic reviews of IoT-ECP applications remain scarce. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the existing literature to identify the latest trends and their technological advances, including the integration concept and solutions to problems encountered in IoT-ECP. It also highlights the advantages between cloud and edge computing in IoT-ECP integration for real-time data streaming. Additionally, IoT-ECP smart integration promotes close interaction and monitoring of energy usage. Battery storage is a major challenge to tackle energy losses along network bandwidth and live streaming data traffic. Finally, the studies indicates that many existing research in IoT-ECP are using short-term load predictions. These are domains where future research could further expand to cover medium- to long-term time frames, forecasting to better balance demand fluctuations, and provide operational reserves with renewable energies.}

As an important dimension of achieving sustainable transportation, increasing attention has been given to transport equity. However, most of the current urban transport equity research in China are empirical studies utilising definitions and measurements of equity largely originating from developed Western countries. Due to China's unique social institutions, conventions and development conditions, Western transport equity theories may not be fully applicable for guiding transport practices in China. This research, therefore, develops a conceptual framework of transport equity suitable for China's socio-economic conditions, grounded on a critical review of transport equity literature from both China and Western countries, and wider equity theories combined with literature on Chinese traditional culture and political institutions. A discourse analysis of transport planning and appraisal documents along with semi-structured interviews with Chinese transport practitioners are introduced to ensure the conceptual framework can be operationalised for guiding transport practices in different-sized Chinese cities. As well as identifying the range of benefits and burdens to be distributed, and clarifying which disadvantaged groups to focus on, we found the proper distributional principle for transport equity should be maximising the development prospects of disadvantaged groups, while for some cities with limited capability and resources, the principle of ensuring a baseline for every citizen to meet their basic needs is more practical.}

abstract = {Over the past decades there has been an increase in negative interactions between humans and bears. In response to these concerns a number of initiatives such as Bear Smart, Bear Aware and Bear Wise have evolved to help communities learn to deal with bears. All these programs share the goals of educating people about how to avoid attracting bears to their property or campsite, changing behaviors that serve to attract bears and what to do should a bear approach. This study examines the efficacy of the Bear Smart program in two cottage communities along the shores of Lake Winnipeg. Audits of bear attractants were conducted on cottage properties prior to and after the implementation of the Bear Smart awareness program. In addition, a population survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior was conducted in order to identify attitudes and intentions with respect to bear smart behavior. Results indicate that despite the educational programming conducted throughout the cottaging season and positive attitudes toward bear smart behavior, little had actually been done by cottagers to reduce their cottage properties' attractiveness to bears. The results of the property bear attractant audits showed minimal effect in terms of reduced attractants on cottage properties in either of the two communities. While on the surface this might suggest that the targeted multi channel educational programs were not effective in changing behavior, it is possible that the effect was masked by the normal seasonal increase in attractants as the cottage season progressed. In particular behaviors relating to the proper handling of food and garbage elicited very positive attitude scores. When considered in light of the evaluation of removing bird feeders (with and without food) where 16% and 24% respectively state removing feeders is quite to very unacceptable, the issue of communicating the role of bird feeders as an attraction is perhaps the most important message to convey successfully. The Theory of Planned Behavior allowed examination into the constituent components of these attitudes that were not positively evaluated by all cottagers and provides insight to direct future communication and awareness programs.}

Concretely, we propose a homomorphic outsourcing computing toolkit to protect the privacy of multiple users for predictive computation. It can meet the needs of large-scale users to securely outsource their data to cloud servers for storage, management and processing of their own data. This toolkit, using the Paillier encryption system and Lagrangian interpolation law, can implement most commonly basic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division etc. It can also implement secure comparison of user data in the encrypted domain. In addition, we discuss how to implement the derivative of polynomial functions using our homomorphic computing encryption tool. We also introduce its application in neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the security and efficiency of all our protocols through rigorous mathematical analysis and performance analysis. The results show that our toolkit is efficient and secure.}

Novel amplifiable SMART probes served as reporter molecules for RNA sequences that are captured and separated on a microfluidic platform under zero-flow conditions. Assays were performed both off chip and in a microchip reservoir using a modified version of real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, without the noncyclic phase, and 65°C preheat. A total of 6000 copies/mL of the synthetic sequences were detected within 180 minutes of amplification. Although the sensitivity of research platforms is higher, SMART has the potential to offer comparable sensitivity and speed to commercially available viral load and HIV detection kits. Furthermore, SMART uses an inexpensive, practical, and more accurate isothermal exponential amplification technique. The use of molecular beacons resulted in relatively fast real-time detection (<180 minutes); however, they were also shown to hinder the amplification process when compared with end point detection. Finally, SMART probes were used for modeling of K103N concentrations within an unknown sample. Only 1% of the SMART probes was detected within the wild-type population (6 × 108 copies/mL). These results establish the groundwork for point-of-care drug resistance and viral load monitoring in clinical samples, which can revolutionize HIV patient care globally.}

abstract = {Traditionally, models have been used by designers to represent abstract design ideas or to analyze and evaluate the refined design solutions. The digital model, in particular, represents the logics, process, and intended result of the design in the form of digital information and media. Innovations in Internet of Things (IoT) and 3D printing technologies now enable the various levels of real-world spatial interactions that were possible only when the user becomes an avatar in a cyberspace. This level of model virtualizes the design and the building itself, becoming an organism of information and materials whether it is being digital analogue. This phenomenon calls for the reorganization of the conceptual framework during the architectural design process where different kinds of models coexist and continuously evolve. Beyond the ad hoc communications between two modes of models, a symbiotic framework is proposed in this paper, where digital and analogue models interact in synergetic ways in the form of design versions and prototypes. This framework is especially appropriate for designing the smart space. It reflects the paradigm of form-finding and prototyping over the traditional counterpart of design process: form-making. The concept of Smart Analogue Model (SAM) is introduced as a main instrument to facilitate this process. The SAM refers to the prototyping of smart space by integrating ICT-embedded components like sensors and actuators. Through the co-evolving process, two models interact in various channels by utilizing techniques from parametric design, design-by-simulation, and physical computing. The impacts on the pedagogy of architectural design studios are discussed within the framework of the proposed symbiotic design process.}
