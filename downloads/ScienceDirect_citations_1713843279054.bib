abstract = {Reduction in the use of cooling systems can help in the reduction of CO2 emissions. Sunlight, particularly near-infrared light, entering through windows causes an increase in room temperature; therefore, a heat-shielding material that can automatically control the amount of sunlight without the use of electricity is required. Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), a temperature-responsive polymer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), changes its optical properties in response to external temperature. This study aimed to prepare hydrogels with acrylamide (AAm) and HPC (HPC/AAm gel) and investigate the effect of HPC with different molecular weights on light transmittance and the state of HPC aggregation in hydrogels. The scattering mechanisms were discussed further. The solar transmittance of HPC/AAm gels below LCST exceeded 80%. Above LCST, the solar transmittance of HPC/AAm gels with large molecular weights decreased to 25%, whereas that with small molecular weight decreased to approximately 20%. The surface of HPC/AAm gels comprising HPC with large molecular weight exhibited numerous large pores following freeze-drying because the skeleton of the AAm and BIS inhibited the shrinkage of HPC above the LCST. In contrast, HPC/AAm gels comprising HPC with small molecular weight have a small number of pores owing to the easy shrinkage of HPC; they scatter sunlight by increasing the frequency of light collisions. Thus, the light transmittance decreases when using the HPC/AAm gels with small molecular weight.}

abstract = {The concept of smart city is a multifarious of seven fundamental features: smart policies, smart governance, smart people, smart science and technology, smart environment, smart living, and smart built environment. Within the concepts of smart science and technology, smart environment, and smart built environment, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology can be categorized. Since these characteristics of a smart city include subcategories, which consider Sci-Tec research and development, sustainable and safe transport systems, inter/national connectivity infrastructure, sustainable resources management, sustainable/green energy resources, Hi-Tec construction technology, and advance building technology. The smart city, status, and goals depend on each particular case, and each particular city features. These goals are measured by means of indicators, which are based on existing urban and building infrastructure, resources, codes, standards, and regulations. The smart-city model, proposed in PAS 182:2014, is intended to create a data-driven city, integrating city systems, with operational independence and operational efficiency. The modern infrastructure should be versatile, diversified, normalized, and its physical components may vary. In such way, there should be a clear strategy of balancing the development of existing and emerging or planned infrastructure. In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the smart-city planning, multidisciplinary teams should work together (engineers, architects, politicians, planning authorities, etc.), which final outcome should be an integrated economics, urban planning, architectural design, and sustainable construction. The main focus of this chapter is to put in context the previous developments made in V2G technologies as well as their considerations, constrains, and advantages—to take them as a starting point for future research topics related to the methods, simulations, and analysis presented in this document.}

This paper proposes a two-level optimization algorithm for the energy management of residential appliances within a smart home, including interruptible, uninterruptible, thermostatically controlled, and non-schedulable loads, as well as the charging/discharging strategies of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in the presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). In the first level of optimization, to minimize the cost of electricity, the operating time of smart home components is determined by SHEMS, and active power is exchanged between equipment. At this level, the impact of demand response (DR) constraints on the cost and load factor (LF) of the smart home have also been investigated. In the second level, considering the optimal cost obtained in the first level, in addition to the active power, the reactive power required by loads is also provided by using the additional capacity of EV and ESS inverters and improves the power factor (PF) of the house at the connection point to the grid. Day-ahead electricity costs are calculated depending on different pricing signals (TOU, RTP) with the power exchange capacity (buying/ selling) with the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is examined on a typical smart home over a 24-h. By reviewing the numerical results obtained for the cost and the LF in different scenarios, and observing the increase of the PF of home from 0.65 to 0.94 and also examining the performance of the equipment during the planning time, the efficiency of the model is proved.}

abstract = {Purpose
The COVID-19 outbreak has substantially altered residents’ training activities. While several new virtual learning programs have been recently implemented, the perspective of urology trainees regarding their usefulness still needs to be investigated.
Methods
A cross-sectional, 30-item, web-based Survey was conducted through Twitter from April 4th, 2020 to April 18th, 2020, aiming to evaluate the urology residents’ perspective on smart learning (SL) modalities (pre-recorded videos, webinars, podcasts, and social media [SoMe]), and contents (frontal lessons, clinical case discussions, updates on Guidelines and on clinical trials, surgical videos, Journal Clubs, and seminars on leadership and non-technical skills).
Results
Overall, 501 urology residents from 58 countries completed the survey. Of these, 78.4, 78.2, 56.9 and 51.9% of them considered pre-recorded videos, interactive webinars, podcasts and SoMe highly useful modalities of smart learning, respectively. The contents considered as highly useful by the greatest proportion of residents were updates on guidelines (84.8%) and surgical videos (81.0%). In addition, 58.9 and 56.5% of responders deemed seminars on leadership and on non-technical skills highly useful smart learning contents. The three preferred combinations of smart learning modality and content were: pre-recorded surgical videos, interactive webinars on clinical cases, and pre-recorded videos on guidelines.
Conclusion
Our study provides the first global “big picture” of the smart learning modalities and contents that should be prioritized to optimize virtual Urology education. While this survey was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak, our findings might have even more impact in the future.

This paper explores whether atmospheric quality monitoring policy (AQMP) improves eco-efficiency by using AQMP as a natural experimental group. We assessed the eco-efficiency of 285 cities in China from 2009 to 2019 using the super-efficient SBM model and estimated the impact of AQMP using the propensity score method Difference-in-Difference (PSM-DID) model. The key findings of this paper are as follows: First, AQMP can enhance eco-efficiency, promoting sustainable urban development. Second, governmental and non-governmental organizations play contrasting roles in either fostering or reversing the positive effects of AQMP. Factors like innovation, clean energy adoption, and industrial structure have a positive mediating influence. Finally, the impact of AQMP on eco-efficiency varies across cities, displaying heterogeneity. Specifically, AQMP has a positive effect on eco-efficiency in resource-rich cities, small and medium-sized urban centers, smart cities, and coastal areas. These findings carry significant implications for the establishment of dynamic monitoring networks and the advancement of eco-efficiency in emerging countries, including China.}

This issue might provide a challenge for those who require the acquisition of vital items of value, such as beverages or medication, beyond the typical operating hours of businesses. In response to this issue, a novel automated vending machine has been devised, leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, enabling uninterrupted operation throughout the week, and encompassing all hours of the day. The machine is outfitted with a payment mechanism that accommodates the EVC-Plus mobile payment platform, which has extensive usage in Somalia. The machine has the potential to be used in a diverse range of public settings, including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, sports arenas, and various other communal spaces. The vending machine has the capacity to facilitate the sale of a diverse range of products, including beverages, snacks, writing implements, and pharmaceuticals. The machine operates on IoT technology, enabling it to establish connectivity with the Internet and facilitating remote monitoring and control capabilities. The machine is operated using a software program that enables users to engage with it using a touchscreen interface. Additionally, the application offers up-to-date information regarding the inventory and status of the machine.}

abstract = {The most amount of withdrawn freshwater in the world is used for agriculture activities to extract essential products for human survival. Smart Farming can manage and optimize the water amount given to crop fields in various crop development stages, weather, and soil condition. Sensors installed in several monitoring spots can gather soil moisture of the crop field to indicate the level of water retained in it. However, due to connectivity or sensor failure problems, the smart farming system can not receive the soil moisture data given by the irrigation management. Deep learning techniques can predict soil moisture data using other irrigation management types as data from weather, crop, and irrigation systems. The Fog Computing paradigm also tackles the connectivity problem in the farms since it extends the traditional cloud computing architecture to the edge of the network, providing edge nodes with computational resources to process and analyze sensor requests. In this context, we propose different deep neural network architectures to build prediction models of soil moisture. We also handle the problem of missing data for the dataset features. For this purpose, we use KNN data imputation, which requires filling the values of unknown (or missing) features with values that ensure a desired degree of reliability. Finally, we also embedded the prediction models on a small single-board computer, often used as a fog node, to evaluate the performance of the prediction models according to CPU and RAM usage. This evaluation showed a maximum consumption increase of 10% CPU and 1% RAM. Therefore, the models are viable to fog architectures in the Internet of Things context. Our results indicate that the predictive models achieve a satisfactory efficiency to improve irrigation water saving.}

Although, current edge devices such as smartphone and smartwatch are becoming increasingly more powerful and more affordable, there are certain tasks such as those involving machine learning that require higher computational resources, thereby resulting in higher energy consumption in the case of edge devices. Offloading tasks to co-located edge nodes such as fog (a cloud-like localized, smaller resource pool), or a femto-cloud (integration of multiple edge nodes) is one viable solution to address the issues such as performing compute-intensive tasks, and managing energy consumption. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and becoming a pandemic has also made a case for edge computing (involving smartphone, wearables, health sensors) for the detection of symptoms to quarantine potential carriers of the virus. We focus on how various forms of smart and opportunistic healthcare (oHealth) can be provided by leveraging edge computing that makes use of a machine learning-based approach. We apply k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector classification (SVC) algorithms on real data trace for the healthcare and safety-related scenarios we considered. The empirical results obtained provide useful insights into machine learning-based task offloading in edge computing.}

Participants were equipped with these sensors for two separate 1-week durations in 2019, specifically during a heating season and a non-heating season, as part of the ICARUS H2020 project. Throughout these periods, data was recorded at a 1-minute resolution. Additionally, based on the collected data, an inhalation rate was determined, and an inhalation adjusted exposure (or intake dose) was computed. The richness and granularity of this dataset not only offer insights into the direct health implications of air pollution exposure but also provide a valuable resource for urban planners, environmental scientists, and policymakers aiming to design healthier living environments and implement effective air quality regulations.}

This article tries to develop a new analytical reliability and adequacy model of smart grids, considering the precise model of PHEVs. Until now, no solution has been reported to determine the appropriate number of PHEVs’ states in the analytical reliability evaluation methods. In this paper, a novel framework is developed to determine the suitable number of PHEVs’ states that simultaneously guarantees the speed and accuracy of the reliability calculations. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used to validate the proposed reliability evaluation method of smart grids using the developed analytical model of PHEVs. In addition, the impacts of different stochastic parameters on the adequacy evaluation of PHEVs, such as distance driven, departure time, and arrival time are studied by performing a variety of sensitivity analyses under different charging scenarios. The proposed method is applied to an actual electric distribution network of Kashan, which is located in the Isfahan province distribution company. The comparative test results illustrate the advantages of the introduced analytical reliability evaluation framework. One point that claims attention is the importance of distance driven’s impact and its state reduction in comparison to the impact of arrival time or departure time. Test results imply that reliability calculations of smart grids could be accelerated significantly by investigating the suitable number of discretized states of PHEVs’ characteristics.}

However, the adoption of this paradigm shift, particularly in the field of smart factories and production, is still in its infancy, suffering from various issues, such as the lack of high-quality data, data with high-class imbalance, or poor diversity leading to inaccurate AI models. However, data is severely fragmented across different silos owned by several parties for a range of reasons, such as compliance and legal concerns, preventing discovery and insight-driven IIoT innovation. Notably, valuable and even vital information often remains unutilized as the rise and adoption of AI and IoT in parallel with the concerns and challenges associated with privacy and security. This adversely influences inter- and intra-organization collaborative use of IIoT data. To tackle these challenges, this article leverages emerging multi-party technologies, privacy-enhancing techniques (e.g., Federated Learning), and AI approaches to present a holistic, decentralized architecture to form a foundation and cradle for a cross-company collaboration platform and a federated data space to tackle the creeping fragmented data landscape. Moreover, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed reference model, a collaborative predictive diagnostics and maintenance case study is mapped to an edge-enabled IIoT architecture.

abstract = {Understanding past water management is crucial to address contemporary human-environmental challenges in sub-Saharan Africa, where urban growth is impacting upon water availability and supply. This study integrates soil profiles, high-resolution topographic data, historical sources, and socioecological memory to reconstruct how the ancient urban society at Great Zimbabwe negotiated water security. New evidence shows for the first time that closed depressions known as dhaka pits were used by the inhabitants of Great Zimbabwe for water storage and harvesting for a long time, possibly since the emergence of settlement in the mid-second millennium CE. These pits were part of a landscape-scale water management system that exploited catchment hydrology and groundwater by means of artificial dhaka reservoirs, wells, and springs to secure water for subsistence, farming, ritual and ceremony services. This study highlights the need for precise dating of the construction and functioning period of this water management system at Great Zimbabwe. Understanding past water management in such a water-scarce region is important for reconstructing how the ancient Great Zimbabwe urban society negotiated water security, but also for understanding contemporary human-environmental challenges.}

abstract = {The emergence of edge computing alleviates the network congestion, delay, and packet loss of cloud computing enabled smart grid architecture in big data scenarios, greatly improving the operation efficiency and communication quality of the smart grid. However, edge computing architecture also brings great security risks to the smart grid. This paper proposes a Polymorphic Heterogeneous Security Architecture (PHSA) for edge enabled smart grid, to assure the key services in the smart grid. Based on the dynamic heterogeneous redundancy architecture, the proposed architecture introduces intelligent scheduling of executors, intelligent arbitration of multi-state service response, cleaning and reconstruction of executors, and attack surface management. We establish a closed-loop core control process of decision and processing, adjustment and scheduling, cleaning reconstruction, migration, and recovery. Furthermore, a dynamic scheduling algorithm based on executor credit and heterogeneity is proposed. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional smart grid security architecture, the PHSA has better defense ability and system reliability, significantly improving the security of edge enabled smart grid system. Besides, compared with the random scheduling strategy, the proposed dynamic executor scheduling algorithm can further improve the security of the system.}

abstract = {With the growth of the industrial age, the need for energy is continuously increasing. To provide efficient power distribution, instill minimal losses, ensure high quality, and dependable supply security, the smart grid idea has cropped up in conversations that allows for the generation and sale of power on a small, individual scale. However, the strategy enhances existing system issues, such as how are transactions among both producers and users carried out, validated, and documented. For a start, smart grids use smart contracts to conduct transactions, with the network serving as a transaction verifier. The advantages of smart grids over traditional power distribution systems rest in its innovative offerings to customers who until then, for many years, had few options for choosing between generated energy, most of which are based on fossil fuels. Not only was the equipment used to create energy highly costly, making it unsuitable for small-scale applications or personal usage of the users but also customers who generated their own electricity had it distributed by the power grid and only paid for what they used. However, technological advancements have altered how humans create and distribute power. Automation results in mass manufacturing, which results in less expensive power generators. Inventions enabled energy to be generated from solar power, tidal waves, geothermal power, and other non-conventional sources. This created the opportunity for an area, household, or a single person to produce their own electricity. Whenever a person created more energy than they had use for, they could easily sell the extra electricity to others, therefore acting as alternative energy sources. In terms of power supply, the smart grid provides greater assurance. However, the idea of automating an electric grid complicates the already complex electrical system. On a transactional level, how can we ensure that generators supply electricity after the user has paid. Because the network has so many producers and consumers, it causes issues about who can truly authenticate the transaction and how the process will operate. Traditional energy trading strategies focus on a centralized approach or third-party companies, but that might be vulnerable from single-point failure. As a result, a secure and reliable trading strategy must be installed in the system to ensure the data security of customers. In this regard, a new technology known as a blockchain, which is a chain of decentralized and distributed transaction ledgers that each user retains and maintains, can address the issue outlined above. Many of the issues that inhibit the Energy Internet’s growth can be solved by applying the blockchain’s technical benefits to it. The use of blockchain technology in the energy sector is only getting started, but it has a lot of room for growth in the future. Enhanced security, better data protection, data transparency and integrity, elimination of third-party authority and trust, pervasive solutions, and higher data usability are just a few of the advantages. Restricted adaptability and speed, off-chain service demands, expensive building and maintenance costs, and the need for more experimental studies are among the still thorny issues.}

Wound dressing mats were fabricated by needleless electrospinning, and the resultant nanofiber mats were coated with a thermoresponsive eicosane/cellulose nanocrystals o/w system loaded with active α-aminophosphonate derivatives. Chemical, physical, thermal, and antimicrobial properties of the wound dressings were characterized wound dressings. Using SEM analysis, Nanofibers spun with 20 % w/v solutions were selected for drug-emulsion loading since they showed lower diameters with higher surface area. Furthermore, the drug-emulsion coating on the electrospun dressings improved the hydrophilicity of the wound dressings, and the thermoresponsive behavior of the mats was proved using differential scanning calorimetry data. Finally, the drug-loaded electrospun meshes were found active against tested microorganisms, and clear inhibition zones were observed. In conclusion, this novel approach of synthesizing a new family of antimicrobial molecules and their incorporation into nanofibers from renewable sources exhibits great potential for smart and innovative dressings.}

In this regard, the current research suggests a resilient smart hybrid renewable energy system to supply the electricity and heat demand of Eram Campus, Shiraz University. Pre-assessments are carried out to realize the energy demand, primary energy potentials, and geographical constraints of the Campus. In the present work, simulations, optimizations, and sensitivity analyses are performed to explore the feasibility of utilizing a unique integrated energy system to meet the load demand of the case study. The results indicate that the suggested energy system consists of a micro gas turbine with combined heat and power module, thermal boilers, converters, photovoltaic panels, pumped hydro storage units, and a predictive controller. To make use of the proposed power plant, $15 M is needed for initial capital cost. Levelized cost of electricity and net present cost of the system are 0.09$/kWh and $42.5 M, respectively. Based on the findings, using the suggested energy system reduces the annual carbon dioxide production of the Campus by 8000 megatonnes compared when using the national energy grid. Furthermore, the calculations reflected that the impacts of variations in financial parameters, carbon penalty, energy demand increase, and allowable capacity shortage on the characteristics of the energy system are considerable. In the most economical strategy, the capacities of the gas turbine, thermal boiler, photovoltaic panel, converter, and pumped hydro storage should be 2650 kW, 17 MW, 13754 kW, 4995 kW, and 70 units, respectively, to meet the increase of 50% in energy demand. By reducing the energy consumption in specific time steps by 1% of the total load, the net present cost and levelized cost of electricity significantly decline by 6% and 15%, respectively. The results of this study concern whatever the policymakers need to ensure the feasibility of implementing a smart integrated energy system to reach the first renewable-powered University Campus in Iran.}

As opposed to other services running on smart cities, a major challenge of eHealth services on the fog is that they typically span multiple computational activities performing big data processing over sensible information that must be protected. Using the capacities of current processors can improve the servicing of remote patient nodes. This paper presents the design and validation of a framework that improves the service time of selected activities at the fog servers; precisely, of those activities requested by remote patients. It exploits the capacities of current processors to parallelize specific activities that can be run on reserved cores, and it relies on the quality of service guarantees of data distribution platforms to improve communication and response times to mobile patients. The proposed approach is validated on a prototype implementation of simulated computationally-intensive eHealth interactions, decreasing the response time by 4x when core reservation is activated.}

However, less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern) using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land use map to identify job–housing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for jobs–housing identification and the other for commuting trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.}

In today’s “smart” cities, massive amounts of multiple forms of geolocated content is generated daily in social media, out of which knowledge for social interactions and urban dynamics can be derived. This work addresses the problem of detecting urban social activity patterns and interactions, by modeling cities into “dynamic areas”, i.e., coherent geographic areas shaped through social activities. Social media users provide the information on such social activities and interactions in cases when they are on the move around the city neighborhoods. The proposed approach models city places as feature vectors which represent users visiting patterns (social activity), the time of observed visits (temporal activity), and the context of functionality of visited places category. To uncover the dynamics of city areas, a clustering approach is proposed which considers the derived feature vectors to group people’s activities with respect to location, time, and context. The proposed methodology has been implemented on the DynamiCITY platform which demonstrates neighborhood analytics via a Web interface that allows end-users to explore neighborhoods dynamics and gain insights for city cross-neighborhood patterns and inter-relationships.}

Despite Saudi Arabia's high global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ranking, a comprehensive review of extant studies revealed insufficient tools enhancing the policymaking and comprehension of climate change and environmental performance. This paper developed a hybrid green city index (GCI) and grey relational analysis (GRA) composite index for appraising national environmental sustainability via a robust, efficient, effective, and replicable grading process. The index is designed based on two primary considerations. The first is the selection of quality underlying indicators/categories, while the second is the adoption of GRA for conducting the normalization, weighting and aggregation process. These two considerations influenced the proposed composite index, which was later applied to Saudi Arabia as a study area. The results revealed that the environmental sustainability of Saudi Arabia is not significant, with the most outstanding of 0.3127 for 2010. At the category level, the favourable environmental sustainability ranking is between the 2010 and 2012 assessment period, with a gradual decline till 2018. This study's findings are unique as no studies within the context of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region have utilized this study's research approach. Although not all indicators of the proposed index were used in the study area, this study's methodology and outcomes have the beneficial impact of assisting Saudi Arabia's decision-makers across the cities in monitoring the status and progress of implementing its net zero carbon emissions by 2060.}

The capability of TASS/SMR code is validated using the results of the experimental data. The code predicts conservatively the void distribution compared with the experimental data.

In such an intelligent environment, it is possible and imperative to consider the traffic flow guidance for electric and non-electric vehicles in the urban transportation network. However, this has not yet been considered in the challenges of planning multi-energy systems. Based on these considerations, a novel optimal planning framework is proposed in the present study, that takes into account the coupling of transportation, natural gas and active distribution networks. Firstly, a novel structure of integrated energy stations is proposed, which serves as coupling components where various sources of energy can be converted, distributed, and stored. The model optimizes the investment and operational strategies of renewable energy generation, energy converters, storage devices and charging facilities in a coordinated way. To capture the impact of traffic flow, a mixed user equilibrium state was established. Thus, the route selections for non-electric vehicles and the navigations of electric vehicles to charging facilities could both be incorporated into the model. Since the proposed planning model is a mixed-integer nonlinear program problem, convex relaxation was conducted to transform the model formulations into a mixed-integer second order cone program version. Finally, four cases were designed and tested in a practical urban area. The quantitative comparison revealed that unguided traffic flow will increase the traffic costs by more than 23%. Moreover, when both charging and routing guidance are considered the energy losses will decrease by at least 5.6%.}

Recent studies on IoTSP selection inferred that uncertainty and subjectivity during preference elicitation are not flexibly handled. Moreover, they mentioned hesitation and interrelationship are crucial behaviors to be modeled. Motivated by the inferences, this research aims to develop an integrated framework with q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) to evaluate IoTSPs. In this line, the CRITIC method is presented for experts’ importance determination under the q-ROF context. Later, Cronbach’s measure is used for criteria weight calculation with q-ROFSs. Also, an algorithm for prioritization is developed by extending the CRADIS formulation. Lastly, the proposed framework is testified through a case example of IoTSP selection for smart city utilities in India. Results infer that availability, total cost, and security/privacy are crucial criteria for evaluating IoTSPs. Sensitivity and comparison analysis is further conducted to determine the framework’s robustness. This study can assist urban planners, politicians, and other stakeholders in selecting proper IoTSPs when forming sustainable smart cities.}

Drivers spend more time in searching and wandering for vacant parking facilities which causes traffic congestion, additional fuel consumption, and pollution. To provide more robust parking solutions, we propose a novel cloud-based smart vehicle parking system (SVPS) over ubiquitous VANETs. The proposed SVPS architecture offers a unique algorithm that provides an appropriate vacant parking space information along with booking and recommendation options to facilitate vehicles in an effective, real-time and precise manner. For the best utilization of existing parking facilities, numerous factors such as drive time, distance to the recommended parking facility, parking fee, walking distance from the parking facility to destination and traffic congestion, are deliberated in the proposed SVPS algorithm. Moreover, Parking Side Units (PSUs) are installed along every parking facility for coordinated management between cloud infrastructure and Road Side Units (RSUs). Extensive simulations results reveal that the proposed cloud-based SVPS reduces the fuel consumption and hazard emissions by enabling the best utilization of existing parking resources. Furthermore, the proposed approach addresses the traffic congestion caused by both vehicles searching for parking spaces and congestion caused by traffic routing.}

Taking into account the baseload present in the power grid, a central agent creates forward-looking, coordinated charging schedules for an electric vehicle fleet of any size. In contrast to optimization-based charging strategies, system dynamics such as future arrivals, departures, and energy consumption do not have to be known beforehand. We implement and compare a range of parameter variants that differ in terms of the reward function and prioritized experience. Subsequently, we use a case study to compare our Reinforcement Learning algorithm with several other charging strategies. The Reinforcement Learning-based charging coordination system is shown to perform very well. All electric vehicles have enough energy for their next trip on departure and charging is carried out almost exclusively during the load valleys at night. Compared with an uncontrolled charging strategy, the Reinforcement Learning algorithm reduces the variance of the total load by 65%. The performance of our Reinforcement Learning concept comes close to that of an optimization-based charging strategy. However, an optimization algorithm needs to know certain information beforehand, such as the vehicle’s departure time and its energy requirement on arriving at the charging station. Our novel Reinforcement Learning-based charging coordination system therefore offers a flexible, easily adaptable, and scalable approach for an electric vehicle fleet under realistic operating conditions.}

abstract = {Smart renewable energy systems are designed as an alternative to conventional power generation methods that utilize natural resources. The development of automation and its allied technologies has improved the performance and operations of smart energy systems in recent years. In this article, automated control scheduling (ACS) for balancing power generation and deficiency in renewable energy systems is introduced. This scheduling control is supported by deep Q-learning to define the operation and shortage state of energy systems. Based on the definitive control schedule, the functions of the systems can be modeled without requiring additional time for power generation and dissemination. In addition, the power generation process relies on environmental conditions to gain maximum profitable power for the operating cost of the power systems. The energy generation system analyzes the environmental conditions suitable for achieving maximum profit, and power dissemination is also modeled. The performance of the proposed system was analyzed using the following metrics: operational profit, imbalance factor, successful prediction of operations, and time lag.}

It has always been the focus of research to improve the visible light transmittance (Tlum) and solar modulation ability (ΔTsol) while reducing the phase transition temperature (Tc) of VO2. To achieve this goal, tungsten-doped VO2 nanoparticles (W-VO2 NPs) with a Tc of 34 °C were used to form composite films with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) by a simple method. High ΔTsol of 14.2% was obtained at the optimized volumetric concentration of W-VO2 and film thickness. The W-VO2/SiO2/PVP composite films were proposed to further improve Tlum and ΔTsol. Compared with the W-VO2/PVP composite film with the same thickness and volumetric concentration of W-VO2, Tlum of the film is increased by 19.3% (from 54.5% to 65%) with the introduction of SiO2 microspheres, while the ΔTsol is maintained satisfactorily at 12.6%. This is mainly due to the monolayer dispersed SiO2 microspheres providing optical pathways in the film, which greatly improves Tlum with a slight sacrifice of ΔTsol. Indoor temperature of a scale-model room with W-VO2/SiO2/PVP film-coated glass was 9.1 °C lower than that with blank glass due to the isolation effect of metallic W-VO2 on near-infrared radiation. This work provides a new strategy for promoting the development of VO2 thermochromic smart windows.}

The broad and policy-oriented concepts of smart growth and smart development are part of the strategy introduced as a response to the observed low growth rates of innovation and productivity across European regions. In all its essence, the growth strategy states that smart growth supports sustainable development, which is achieved by promoting research, innovation, and knowledge in order to attain regional economic growth. What is made less clear is how the concept of smart growth can be translated to fit a diverse set of rural regions. Other outstanding issues discussed in this paper relate to the possibility to measure and empirically address the outcome of policies for smart rural development. Hence, in this paper we conceptually analyse and bring together the ideas that underlie the logic behind policies for smart growth by focusing on smart growth from the perspective of rural regions. The paper also presents indicators of smart rural development and analyses their relevance in future empirical studies.}

Indeed, SG cyber-physical connectivity is subject to several vulnerabilities that can damage or disrupt its process immunity via cyberthreats. Today's ICSs are experiencing highly complex data change and dynamism, increasing the complexity of detecting and mitigating cyberattacks. Subsequently, and since Machine Learning (ML) is widely studied in cybersecurity, the objectives of this paper are twofold. First, for algorithmic simplicity, a small-scale ML algorithm that attempts to reduce computational costs is proposed. The algorithm adopts a neural network with an augmented hidden layer (NAHL) to easily and efficiently accomplish the learning procedures. Second, to solve the data complexity problem regarding rapid change and dynamism, a label autoencoding approach is introduced for Embedding Labels in the NAHL (EL-NAHL) architecture to take advantage of labels propagation when separating data scatters. Furthermore, to provide a more realistic analysis by addressing real-world threat scenarios, a dataset of an electric traction substation used in the high-speed rail industry is adopted in this work. Compared to some existing algorithms and other previous works, the achieved results show that the proposed EL-NAHL architecture is effective even under massive dynamically changed and imbalanced data.}

In today's digitalized world, technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart connected objects (SCOs) are moving to the forefront and have given rise to fundamental changes in consumers’ daily lives. During the context of COVID-19, the IoT and SCOs enabled people to better deal with the pandemic situation (e.g., control their health or use fitness indicators) (Gupta et al., 2021). The purpose of this study is to explain the acceptance and usage of SCOs and therefore extend the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis, 1989) with other theories (i.e., uses and gratification, diffusion of innovation, privacy calculus), and thus new antecedents adapted to the SCO context. More specifically, in addition to the TAM's main variables (i.e., perceived usefulness, ease of use, intention to use, real use), we investigate the roles of concepts rarely investigated in innovation and new technology research, such as well-being, social image, privacy concerns, and innovativeness. We also study the differences in the adoption of SCOs between different user adoption stages, such as the early adopters, early majority, and late majority (Rogers, 1983). The data come from 702 respondents surveyed in a longitudinal study over three years of their acceptance and real usage. Structural equation modeling shows that the TAM variables remain relevant in the SCO context. The results show that utilitarian benefits are the main reasons leading to SCO technology acceptance, and well-being and social image lead to higher usage in the long term. However, privacy concerns are the main obstacles to the adoption of SCOs.}

As cities and municipalities grow, so do the corresponding networks. This growth of district heating networks introduces the possibility of interconnecting them with neighbouring networks. Interconnecting formerly separated DH networks can result in many advantages concerning flexibility, overall efficiency, the share of renewable sources, and security of supply. Apart from the problem of hydraulically connecting the networks, the main challenge of interconnected DH systems is the coordination of multiple feed-in points. It can be faced with control concepts for the overall DH system which define optimal operation strategies. This paper presents two control approaches for interconnected DH networks that optimize the supply as well as the demand side to reduce CO2 emissions. On the supply side, an optimization-based energy management system defines operation strategies based on demand forecasts. On the demand side, the operation of consumer substations is influenced in favour of the supply using demand side management. The proposed approaches were tested both in simulation and in a real implementation on the DH network of Leibnitz, Austria. First results show a promising reduction of CO2 emissions by 35% and a fuel cost reduction of 7% due to better utilization of the production capacities of the overall DH system.}

However, limited efforts have been made to reveal the spatial variations of multi-modal public ridership (such as buses, metro systems, and taxis) and the underlying controlling factors. This study explores multi-modal public ridership and compares the similarities and differences of the associated factors. Daily bus, metro, and taxi ridership patterns are first extracted from multiple sources of big transportation data, including vehicle (bus and taxi) GPS trajectories and smart card data. Multivariate regression analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis are used to reveal the associations between these data and demographic, land use, and transportation factors. An empirical study in Shenzhen, China, suggests that employment, mixed land use, and road density have significant effects on the ridership of each mode; however, some effects vary from negative to positive across the city. The results also indicate that road density, income, and metro accessibility do not have significant effects on metro, transit or bus ridership. These findings suggest that the effects of the associated factors vary depending on the mode of travel being considered and that the city should carefully consider which factors to emphasize in formulating future transport policy.}

abstract = {Over the next decades, solar energy power generation is anticipated to gain popularity because of the current energy and climate problems and ultimately become a crucial part of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the rapid deployment of solar production in sustainable cities, solar technologies must be digitalized and smart. This will increase their reliability and ensure their optimal performance. This work fits into this perspective and focuses on the effectiveness of processing data using the Digital Twin (DT) framework as a state-of-art information technology for urban distributed solar PV systems. Accordingly, the present paper deals with the DT of five Building-added Photovoltaic (BAPV) systems installed at the solar village in Benguerir city, Morocco. The 3D models were generated in the Rhinoceros platform, the solar AC electrical production of each photovoltaic system is calculated by the ladybug-plugin-integrated statistical model, within the grasshopper environment. Additionally, data assessment and visualization are processed through Python. Then, a hybrid model-based and data-driven fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) approach is proposed to identify and isolate anomalies for decentralized solar PV systems at the urban scale using monitoring and inspection techniques, namely Remote Sensors (RS) and real-time solar production monitoring system. The application of the DT concept for complex dynamic systems has shown its effectiveness in ensuring optimal operating conditions for the energy systems by measuring the spatiotemporal energy performance of distributed solar PV systems at an urban scale, evolving with the changing environment, and identifying degradation based on anomalies occurrence; Only then when the physical models need to be amended. Therefore, the main goal behind this work is to advance knowledge regarding research on condition monitoring of solar systems in cities while considering issues related to anomalies like the degradation phenomenon in PV modules over time. The findings of this study have proved that the state of health and monitoring of PV systems could be successfully detected and efficiently monitored using the combination of real time monitoring and remote aerial sensing.}

However, research challenges of re-identification remain especially in terms of recognizing the different appearances of the same person in a harsh real-world environment: (1) the adaptability of the selected features to the dynamic environment cannot be guaranteed, and (2) existing methods rooted from metric learning aim to find a single metric function, and they lack the ability to measure the different appearances of the same person. To address these problems, this study proposes a multiple deep metric learning method empowered by the functionality of person similarity probability measurement. The proposed method exploits multiple stacked auto-encoder networks and classification networks to quantify pedestrians’ similarity relations. The stacked auto-encoder networks directly recognize persons from surveillance images at the pixel level. The classification networks are equipped with the Softmax regression models and produce multiple similarity probabilities to characterize different appearances belonging to the same person. An Adaboost-like model is designed to fuse the probabilities corresponding to multiple metrics, which ensures a high accuracy of recognition. Experimental results on two public datasets (VIPeR and CUHK-01) indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing algorithms by 2%–10% at rank 1. Based on the similarity probabilities learned by the proposed model, the algorithm for matching the person pair can achieve a time complexity as low as O(n), which can be deployed at a large scale on the distributed intelligent surveillance network, with each node maintaining limited computing capabilities.}

These issues exist due to the congestion caused by vehicles while finding the parking slot especially in metropolitan cities. Even today, many of the existing parking systems provide a passive information to the drivers regarding the availability of parking slots. Currently, the sensors deployed for detecting the vehicle presence in parking facilities are not reliable and are expensive. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on crucial aspects for designing a smart parking system such as sensor selection and optimal position for sensor deployment for accurate detection. Initially, two most common sensor, Light Dependable Resistor (LDR) sensor that works on shadow detection principal and Infra-Red (IR) sensor which works on object detection mechanism are used. The performance analysis of the accuracy for detection of vacant parking slots and vehicle detection under different conditions is presented. It is concluded that IR sensor outperforms LDR sensor in terms of it's accuracy in detecting the vacant parking slots and vehicle detection in different environmental factors.}

Stress sensing enables weighing. Without the incorporation, the technology is applicable to existing and new pavements, and gives low cost, high durability, large sensing volume and maintained mechanical properties. Linearity of the capacitance with the normal compressive stress occurs for stress ranging from 2 Pa to 60 Pa. The ability to sense such low stress enables the sensing of even children. Nonlinearity at > 60 Pa involves the slope of the capacitance-stress curve decreasing. Monotonic and reversible capacitance increase with stress occurs for stress ≤ 600 Pa, with complete reversibility up to stress ≥ 2100 Pa. The electrodes are aluminum foil bonded to the asphalt with a thin bitumen interlayer. With coplanar electrodes (the stress not applied to the electrodes), the in-plane capacitance increases upon compression, presumably due to the compaction of the part of the asphalt near the plane of the coplanar electrodes. With sandwiching electrodes (the stress applied to the electrodes), the through-thickness capacitance increases reversibly upon compression, due to the decrease in the thickness of the bitumen interlayer. The coplanar electrodes enable self-sensing, and, compared to the sandwiching electrodes, they give much greater sensitivity and are more amenable to practical implementation. The sensing is based on the fractional change in capacitance, so the thickness of the asphalt or bitumen interlayer does not matter. The capacitance-based stress sensing is superior for asphalt than cement-based materials of prior work, due to the greater stiffness of the latter.}

In the integration model, CIM is used to extract the geometric and semantic data of the physical elements and geospatial information of built environment. Temporal variations in foreground elementary flows, background inventory datasets, characterization factors, and weighting factors were quantified and involved. A university campus was used to verify the CIM-DLCA integration model, and the impact results were visualized and analyzed from temporal and spatial dynamic perspectives. The influences and sensitivity of dynamic factors were quantified and compared. In addition, the uncertainty issues, data acquisition advantages, and CIM-DLCA integration strategies were discussed. Some valuable future research directions were proposed. This study takes an exploratory step and demonstrates that combining CIM with DLCA is both feasible and operable. This provides a theoretical foundation for intelligent assessment and can be used to promote low-carbon city management.}

A digital-enabled network and an IT strategy that combines land and sea traffic management help to maintain economic feasibility. City residents can move around easily and port operations become more efficient. In this article 3 big ports were observed: Shanghai, Rotterdam and Hamburg. There are many criteria by which to rate a big port. This is, in particular, the area it occupies, its cargo turnover. Transport planning allows to achieve coordinated development of all types of transport in conjunction with urban planning activities, as well as a reasonable choice of the most effective measures for the development of the transport system. The logistic control can increase the quality using IT technologies and in the paper major aspects are observed. The effective planning can be reached according to main strategic aspect of every particular port.}

In addition, the paper observed that at the macro level, the nature of the relationship between telecommunication and transport tends to support the complementary role of telecommunication rather than a substitution role. The paper concludes by recommending further studies at the micro level to untie the dilemma in the nexus between telecommunication and transport to inform public policy.}

The transition process starts with Ecuador’s change in the productive matrix with reforms from the legal and business strategies point of view to the year 2050. Advances in energy material are dependent on political uncertainty both at the country (Ecuador) and local (Cuenca) levels. It is possible to stop using fossil fuels due to the implementation of new renewable energy sources, potentially rich in the Ecuadorian Southwest and evidenced in the National Plan for a Lifetime. Currently, there is evidence of accelerated changes concerning legal regulations, including the construction of several electric power generation plants. This change in the national productive matrix implies, among others, the implementation of electric vehicles and the change of natural gas stoves for electric ones, and the implementation of the “4 Rios” tram that crosses the city from North-South and South-North, incorporating 100% renewable energy generation, which would provide heat in urban and marginal urban areas. All the systems created in Ecuador, such as heating, cooling, transportation, security etc., will allow an increasing penetration of renewable energy until it reaches 100%.}

Since water systems in the United States are largely run by public sector agencies, this study conducted a national survey with officials in water utilities and agencies to understand what kinds and capabilities of smart green infrastructure are desired for stormwater management. Analyzing the stated preferences of these users using a discrete choice model, our results indicate that these officials are willing to invest more upfront in smart technologies if they lower the costs associated over time with construction, maintenance, and labor. For example, in a typical rain garden, water agencies are willing to pay 12.1% more for construction to reduce maintenance costs by 20% and would pay 12.9% more to add self-irrigating capabilities. Preferences for smart green infrastructure among agencies are also affected by their characteristics. Agencies with large service areas or prior experience with green infrastructure are more likely to adopt smart green infrastructure. These results should assist in the further design and development of smart technologies and green infrastructure in stormwater management.}

This is already the case when discussing Smart Grid (SG). This enhancement can be applied to drive efficiency in energy management systems in electricity generation, transmission and distribution. As electricity has become the de facto main source of energy worldwide, it is to be expected that all nations, including developing nations such as Ghana, seeks to constantly improve their electrical energy capabilities through the integration of computing and network infrastructure. The integration of SG with cloud computing however presents some complexities which need to be addressed to ensure secure implementation of the SG in the cloud. This paper presents important issues which need to be addressed to ensure security in distributed cloud-based energy systems. The paper also discusses how cloud computing and blockchain could be leveraged to improve on Ghana's current inefficient distribution and transmission networks.

As a solution to convert to low carbon cities, a VESS is firstly modelled to store and release energy in response to regulation signals by coordinating the demand response (DR) from domestic refrigerators in London and the conventional flywheel energy storage systems (FESS). The coordination of DR and FESS mitigates the uncertainties of DR and reduces the capacity of costly FESS. The VESS is applied to provide ancillary services to the power system and contributes to the reduction of carbon emission through the replacement of spinning reserve capacity of fossil fuel generators. Case studies were carried out to validate and quantify the capability of the VESS to vary the stored energy in response to grid frequency. Economic benefits of using VESS for frequency response services were firstly estimated and a potential saving of £91m-£103m is expected.}

abstract = {An affordable yet highly promising device, friction-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has attracted tremendous attention for harvesting energy from ambient mechanical forces and converting to scalable electrical power. However, the output power from TENG often appears insufficient to run self-powered electronics for the long term. While most research on high-output hybrid TENGs focused on ferroelectric particle-based polymer composites, we propose a coupled 3D-printing and transfer-printing based fabrication method for hybrid barium titanate (BTO)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) bilayer film with adjustable piezoceramic layer thickness. An internally hybridized BTO/PDMS sensor (HTPENG) results in greater charge separation and more efficient impedance matching at the interface of BTO and PDMS elastomer, as opposed to composites. The higher reproducibility and scalable production method can also drive large-scale industrial production. The resulting power density of HTPENG appeared to be 2.20 mW/cm2, nearly twice that of non-hybrid PDMS (PTENG). For the application, the hybrid flexible sensor appears to be highly effective for tire tread wear monitoring systems (TWMS). The direct, onboard, self-powered HTPENG sensor can detect tire wear with very high precision and with detection accuracy of ≤ 1 mm. Moreover, HTPENG can additionally function as a force and pressure sensor with a wide detection range (500 N > F > 10 N). Advancing a step closer to smart tires, this proof-of-concept hybrid sensor is, therefore, expected to bring about a sustainable alternative for the manufacture of onboard TWMS devices and possible dashboard integration in the near future.}

To plan such reliable transfers from e.g. busses to trains, it is crucial to know the necessary walking times from stops to platforms. This paper presents an innovative approach for estimation of walking time distributions from bus stops to train platforms based on a matching of smart card data and automatic vehicle location data. The observed times from bus stop to rail platform turns out to have a large variance, due to two reasons: differences in passenger walking speeds, and passengers who are doing activities during the transfer. To account for these variations a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model is applied, where the time for passengers walking directly and passengers doing activities during the transfer follows separate distributions. The proposed methodology is applied to 129 stations in the Eastern part of Denmark, where the tap-in devices are located at the train platform. Results from two stations with different characteristics are presented in details along with justifications and analyses of model accuracy. The outcome of the model with distributions of the necessary walking times from bus stops to train platforms is important input for timetabling connections, and the data-driven methodology can easily be applied at scale.}

This study conducts an exploratory case study analysis of CAPs of four metropolitan cities in India, one of the world's worst climate-exposed cities. The objective is to highlight and compare key components and characteristics of these CAPs and showcase their key strengths, unique solutions, weaknesses, and areas of improvement that may offer opportunities for strengthening existing and future city CAPs leading to effective climate policy and urban governance at the national and global level. Characteristics of the CAPs are discussed under the purview of global best practices and frameworks, such as C40 cities. Analysis shows that city CAPs in India are at a nascent stage owing to the absence of climate policies resulting in experimentation and implementation, suiting stakeholder and local government needs.}

The development of appropriate design techniques for the surrounded built environment of TOD has become increasingly important as TOD concepts apply to urban development. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combined design strategies and TOD patterns planning approach that promotes the quality of urban built environment will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. This is an essential element of this research. The TOD design strategies can be proposed by utilizing the supply side prediction methodologies of planning. There has also been an increasing interest in the urban built environment design in the past decade. This interest is motivated by the possibility that design policies associated with the built environment can be used to control, manage, and shape individual activity and behavior. This paper first studies and classifies smart growth principles based on literature review. Then the individual expert's judgments are obtained and utilized to evaluate the relative importance of smart growth principles. Next, the site selection for a new metro transit station in Taipei (Taiwan) is conducted to show the application of our proposed methodological approach. A combined Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model with assurance region approach is applied to select the most suitable station from a given set of possible station sites.

In Europe, an alternative view sees depopulation as a process needing to be managed properly, by scaling down community services and infrastructure while maintaining social equity. Called smart shrinkage, this approach argues places can lose population yet still possess a high quality of life. We first clarify the concept by distinguishing the outputs of smartness from its inputs using the entrepreneurial social infrastructure framework. Second, we apply the smart shrinkage concept to n = 98 small towns in the Midwestern state of Iowa using longitudinal data collected in 1994 and 2014. Shrinkage is measured by faster than average population loss; and smart outcomes by faster than average quality of life gains. We then examine correlates of smart shrinkage using demographic, economic, social capital, and civic engagement indicators. Demographic and geographic factors have little impact on smart shrinkage. Smart towns have stronger local labor markets, lower poverty and inequality, and job opportunities in goods-producing sectors. Lastly, smart shrinking towns exhibit higher social infrastructure by possessing more bridging social capital across diverse groups, greater quantities of linking social capital such as memberships in local organizations, and frequent civic engagement by participation in local projects. These activities are supported by a community culture of openness, tolerance, and support.}

Traffic spatio-temporal data are often heterogeneous. Most existing traffic prediction models predominantly use separate components to extract the temporal and spatial features of traffic data. However, this overlooks the intrinsic connections between the spatio-temporal features of traffic data. To directly mine the spatio-temporal heterogeneity, this study constructs a global heterogeneous traffic spatio-temporal graph and proposes the Heterogeneous Traffic Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution (HTSTGC). To reduce the complexity of the model, Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) is used to extract semi-structured meta-graph information. The receptive fields that capture temporal and spatial features can be flexibly adjusted separately through clever design, which can balance the performance and efficiency of the model. Finally, the feature fusion module applies Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) to fuse temporal and spatial features. The results on the PEMS datasets reveal that jointly modeling different types of relationships can improve the traffic prediction performance of the model. The proposed HTSTGC has better performance than the baseline methods in most cases. The research results can support urban traffic control, traffic pollution reduction, and sustainable urban development.}

Several designs issues impact policy in several countries such as the UK, Europe and the USA. As e-bike usage continues to grow, so too will the need for further research, in order to provide the necessary data to inform industrialists what cycling features matters for a wider, diverse and sustainable adoption of this mode of transport. This investigation discusses results from a survey on end-user preferences for future e-Bikes that will be developed in the coming years. User preferences related to safety and convenience were defined using market reviews and responses gathered from 638 potential users mainly from Europe and North America. Data were analysed to rank the importance of desired functionality to improve the uptake of cycling within urban environments. In general, the results indicate that safety and convenience features were equally valued across the whole sample size. ‘Gradient Climb Assist’ and ‘Break Lights & Indicators’ were respectively the most preferred convenience and safety feature. This survey showed how respondents expressed a desire for a more intelligent, secure and adaptive e-Bikes.}

abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop one eco-friendly smart anti-corrosion coating with in situ pretreatment and self-healing characteristics to reduce the environmental pollution and simplify operations of traditional coating. Herein, porous carbon nanosheets (PCNS) derived from fallen leaves were prepared through exfoliating the biomass into nanosheets with acetic acid and drilling holes through carbonization and activation via ZnCl2. The as-fabricated PCNS contained meso- and micro-pores, ultra-thin layer structure (the thickness of around 5 nm) and rich oxygen-containing functional groups. Also, the specific surface area was 1262 m2 g−1. The smart coating was prepared through doping the functional PCNS (FPCNS) which prepared by loading pyhtic acid (PA) in the holes and grafting aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) onto the PCNS surface into the eco-friendly water-base epoxy resin. The pull-out tests demonstrated that adhesion between steel and coating was increased from 3.0 MPa to 6.4 MPa due to the addition of FPCNS into the coating. Results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the/Z/f=0.01Hz of smart coating maintained 1.30 × 107 Ω cm2 after 50 days immersion and/Z/f=0.01Hz of cracked smart coating was 15,000 Ω cm2 after 28 days of immersion. The reasons of the excellent adhesion and anti-corrosion performances of smart coating were: (1) the grafted APTES could adsorb on steel surface to form a pretreatment layer; (2) the loaded PA could chelate the corrosion products to repair the cracks. It is expected that the smart coating could find wide application in anti-corrosion coating field due to the in situ pretreatment and self-healing characteristics.}

In this research work, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things (IoTs) are integrated to provide a real-time crop monitoring system to farmers. Usually, battery-powered IoT devices equipped with sensors like temperature, humidity, motion sensors, etc. are placed across agriculture areas for real-time monitoring of crops and cattle. In improving energy efficiency and reducing delay clustering multi-hop routing has been used with good effect; However, the existing methods failed to enhance network lifetime and target coverage due to failure in addressing load-balancing and hotspot problems. In addressing research problems this paper presents an Energy and Delay Aware Routing (EDAR) scheme for heterogenous WSN-IoTs leveraging unequal grouping of networks and adoption of multipath routing for provisioning IoT applications. The simulation outcome shows the EDAR model achieves very good performance in terms of throughput and lifetime performance with minimal delay and communication overhead.}

This paper provides a first step in developing a novel multi-effect smart window system, which achieves enhanced energy efficiency and an improved indoor luminous environment by integrating a Transparent Insulation Material (TIM) structure incorporating a Thermotropic material. This system automatically regulates the admittance of solar heat and natural light into the building by responding to a changing environment while taking advantage of the increased thermal resistance and scattered daylight of window integrated TIM. A comprehensive workflow via EnergyPlus and RADIANCE was used to accurately predict the luminous and energy performance of applying the smart window system on a typical south-facing office under selected climates (London, Stockholm, Rome and Singapore). The effect of the optical properties and transition temperature of thermotropic material on building performance was explored in detail. Annual simulation results predict that, with a careful selection of the Thermotropic material properties, installing the TT PS-TIM window system is able to yield up to a 27.1% energy saving when compared with a conventional double glazed window, under the modelled Rome climate. TT PS-TIM windows also provide dynamic daylight control, resulting in increased daylight availability with the percentage of working hours that fall into the UDI500–2000 lx range increasing to 62.3%. The results of this research provide guidance for the next step of the material design and development that seek to balance energy efficiency and solar and daylight control through the use of thermotropic materials.}

This study analyzed charging data from a real-world pilot program, the largest household-based study to date to analyze the effectiveness of different smart charging use cases at reducing charging costs and increasing utilization of renewable energy. The study included six different use cases that featured varying optimization signals and driver incentives. Study results suggest that the optimizations are effective at shifting load from times of high grid costs and congestion, most notably during early evening hours, to times of lower grid costs in the early morning and midday. The study finds that 15–20% of charge was shifted out of any given hour and 20–30% of charge was shifted into a given hour in the most effective use cases. In addition to shifting charging across time periods, charging events were also effectively shifted to different locations during some use cases, such as from overnight at households to during the day at workplaces.}

abstract = {The demand for tall buildings has increased over the past decades for cultural, financial, and technological reasons. Such slender structures are more flexible and vulnerable to wind-induced vibrations. Additionally, wind speed exponentially increases with height, resulting in larger wind loading on higher levels and complex turbulent regimes. Such effects call for more innovative approaches to enhance the resilience of tall buildings while accounting for the sustainability implications. Current methodologies to control the vibrations using auxiliary dampers are typically limited in their applicable bandwidth. The aerodynamic modifications are specific to a particular wind direction and characteristics and cannot adapt to the changing climate or that of flow regimes due to the new construction in the proximity of the target building. There have been major advances in using secondary façades to achieve sustainability through ventilation and energy-saving applications around the world. These advances have resulted in the development of adaptive facades for architectural and energy applications. This review paper discusses the available approaches and potential opportunities to utilize the existing adaptive façade system capabilities (for energy applications) to alter building aerodynamics. For this purpose, the paper concisely discusses aerodynamic modification, surface roughness effects, available bio-inspired approaches, and potential morphing material capabilities to provide valuable insights into understanding the flow-control mechanism of such systems, potentially leading to innovative designs of façade systems. Opportunities have been identified to combine this concept with smart technologies to develop smart façades with the aerodynamic performance that leads to mitigating wind-induced vibration in tall buildings. The review of existing research on this topic opens up opportunities for enhancing the use of facades as active, dynamic, and smart systems that not only enhance the performance of the tall buildings under wind-induced vibrations but also can result in long term energy saving, leading to more resilient and sustainable communities.}

A fast, economical, and comparative methodology is presented for evaluating the heating values resulted from burning municipal solid waste (MSW) based on prior knowledge, specialist experience, and data-mining methods. Development of models for estimating higher heating values (HHVs) of 252 MSW samples based on the ultimate analysis is conducted by simultaneously utilising five nonlinear models including Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA), namely GA-RBF, genetic programming (GP), multivariate nonlinear regression (MNR), particle swarm optimisation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (PSO-ANFIS) and committee machine intelligent system (CMIS) models to increase the accuracy of each model. Eight different equations based on MNR are developed to estimate energy recovery capacity from different MSW groups (e.g., textiles, plastics, papers, rubbers, mixtures, woods, sewage sludge and other waste). A detailed investigation is conducted to analyse the accuracy of the models. It is indicated that the CMIS model has the best performance comparing the results obtained from different models. The R2 values of the test dataset for GA-RBF are 0.888, for GP 0.979, for MNR 0.978, for PSO-ANFIS 0.965, and for CMIS 0.985. The developed models with an acceptable accuracy would be followed by a better estimation of HHV and providing reliable heating value for an automatic combustion control system. The results obtained from this study are beneficial to design and optimise sustainable thermal waste-to-energy (WTF) processes to accelerate city transition into a circular economy.}

Therefore, some effective operational measures and waste management policies have been implemented. However, enormous waste remains a concern for stakeholders and exert pressure on the limited capacity of Hong Kong’s landfills. Though previous research discusses Building Information Modelling (BIM) application for construction waste management enhancement, the BIM model has not been widely implemented for building demolition with waste management. Hence, as a response to the aforementioned shortcomings, this paper develops a conceptual framework that allows collecting, maintaining, and analyzing comprehensive information through Smart BIM that uses advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and capable of reacting to user activities such as waste quantitative assessment, demolition process planning, optimal disposal route selection, and waste management strategy are executed. The advantages of the proposed framework are shown in a case study benefit-cost analysis based on three planned reuse and recycling-rate scenarios that explain on- and off-site recycling methods. The results show that the proposed framework will pave the way for generating sustainable waste disposal practices by providing technical and decision-making support functionalities to engineers and planners in the construction industry.}

In the present research, in the first step, all operational features in photovoltaic facilities are optimized by Central Composition Design (CCD) as a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) method. In the second step, harvested renewable energy values, carbon emission prevention, initial cost, and maintenance for each year are predicted as per operational factors of the photovoltaic system, which are utilized in the desalination process and with the application of Gaussian Processes, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine for Regression (SMOreg) and Polynomial Trees (M5P) algorithms. Finally, in the managerial insight section of the research, an integrated Reverse Osmosis-Photovoltaic system is presented as a green facility of water providing in arid and semi-arid climates. Based on RSM system the main effective factors for energy production, prevention carbon emission (25 year), initial and maintenance costs are Pitch degree (P) (P-value < 0.0001), Pitch degree (P-value < 0.0001), Cross Distance (CD) (P-value < 0.0001), and Panel Capacity (PC) (P-value = 0.0002), respectively. Finally, an SDGS assessment is performed in this investigation, and some managerial insights are proposed. In the different steps of this study, both carbon emission values and cost functions are optimized.

Everyday physical items such as lights, locks and industrial machineries can now be part of the IoT ecosystem. IoT has redefined the management of critical and non-critical systems with the aim of making our lives more safe, efficient and comfortable. As a result, IoT technology is having a huge positive impact on our lives. However, in addition to these positives, IoT systems have also attracted negative attention from malicious users who aim to infiltrate weaknesses within IoT systems for their own gain, referred to as cyber security attacks. By creating an introduction to IoT, this paper seeks to highlight IoT cyber security vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques to the reader. The paper is suitable for developers, practitioners, and academics, particularly from fields such as computer networking, information or communication technology or electronics. The paper begins by introducing IoT as the culmination of two hundred years of evolution within communication technologies. Around 2014, IoT reached consumers, early products were mostly small closed IoT networks, followed by large networks such as smart cities, and continuing to evolve into Next Generation Internet; internet systems which incorporate human values. Following this evolutionary introduction, IoT architectures are compared and some of the technologies that are part of each architectural layer are introduced. Security threats within each architectural layer and some mitigation strategies are discussed, finally, the paper concludes with some future developments.}

The second part of the paper offers a comparison of two virtue-oriented approaches, one by Dale Jamieson and the other by Michel Puech, for living well under such conditions. Part Three argues that, under such conditions, virtues of the kind they identify as important to cultivate under these conditions need to be supplemented with virtues of a different, disequilibrating, order, and suggests attuned spontaneity and informal generosity as two examples.

This detailed and accurate digital map is supposed to be used by Madiun City Development Planning Agency (Bappeda) and other units in Madiun City Government as their reference map. Several digital maps are being developed on top of this reference map, including the Madiun City Asset map which record all buildings and land areas owned by the Madiun City Government. To improve the usability and functionality of this asset map, an asset management system, based on WebGIS is proposed. In this WebGIS, city assets of land and buildings are coded and organized in a web-based application for a better management, and it can be accessed by public easily and quickly. The system development method is the Waterfall. ArcGIS Map is used as an online map platform for the visualization map of land and building asset in Madiun City. The current asset map contains more than 400 asset data with 17 categories. This WebGIS asset management system supports the smart governance in Madiun City toward the development of Madiun Smartcity.}

abstract = {Investing in smart grid infrastructure is a key enabler for the transition to low carbon energy systems. Recent work has characterised the costs and benefits of individual “smart” investments. The political economy of the UK electricity system, however, has co-evolved such that there is a mismatch between where benefits accrue and where costs are incurred, leading to a problem of value capture and redeployment. Further, some benefits of smart grids are less easy to price directly and can be classified as public goods, such as energy security and decarbonisation. This paper builds on systemic treatments of energy system transitions to characterise the co-evolution of value capture and structural incentives in the electricity distribution system, drawing on semi-structured interviews and focus groups undertaken with smart grid stakeholders in the UK. This leads to an identification of municipal scale values that may be important for business models for the delivery of smart infrastructure. Municipalities may thus pursue specific economic opportunities through smart grid investment. This supports recent practical interest in an expanded role for municipalities as partners and investors in smart grid infrastructures.}

The premise of blockchain is based on a unique technological offering of trust and transparency being offered in a decentralized environment. Since then, researchers and practitioners are thoughtful about multiple applications of blockchain around areas like human resource, marketing, finance, supply chain, and so on. Healthcare is no exception to this situation where a decentralized technology like blockchain acts as a positive catalyst to integrated healthcare by providing data integrity, actionable insights, and mitigating many challenges in the realm of healthcare. Blockchain is considered as a promising solution to resolve data safety and integrity issues while restoring stakeholder consensus. Another blockchain-based solution on similar lines is BlocHIE. Blockchain-based framework is also presented to gather insightful information through predictive techniques embedded in the framework. Ranging from Proof of Disease to Disease Surveillance are some applications presented around healthcare domain through utilization of blockchain technology. Monitoring of drug supply chain through blockchain technology has also been a key interest area especially from the patient point of view. An interesting perspective on cognitive healthcare blockchain demonstrates the usage of automated and intelligent blockchain for healthcare. However, these discrete applications around different arenas of healthcare need to be looked from a holistic point of view. This will help policy makers to shape a smart healthcare system especially in the context of smart cities. The capabilities of blockchain aided with technologies like analytics, Internet of things, artificial intelligence, and so on can help mitigate many challenges and issues with healthcare systems around the world. In this chapter, we present a conceptual model along with research-based implementation instances to define and illustrate a smart healthcare system powered with blockchain. This work provides a holistic perspective in terms of applicability and understanding of blockchain to healthcare and helps in planning and strategizing the usage of blockchain technology.}

The problem is enormously complex as it involves a variety of stakeholders, demands behavioral changes, and requires a complete rethinking of the current waste management systems and the dominant linear economic model. Smart enabling technologies can aid in a transformation of waste management toward a circular economy, but many barriers persist. This study first shortlists twelve important barriers to smart waste management in China based on interviews with experienced practitioners. It then prioritizes these barriers through a scientific prioritization technique, fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), based on the survey data from three representative stakeholders. It identified three key causal barriers: the lack of regulatory pressures, the lack of environmental education and culture of environmental protection, and the lack of market pressures and demands. Practical and theoretical implications were discussed based on the research results and findings.}

In this work, an efficient Object Recommendation based Friendship Selection (ORFS) model for network navigability and social relationship management among smarter objects in SIoT is proposed. The proposed ORFS model empowers to create, communicate and manage trust based social objects. A Grey Wolf Algorithm based User Object Affiliation (GWA-UOA) mechanism for the Smarter Object Recommendation (SOR) is proposed. Then Object Friendship Selection (OFS) through network navigability using Maximum Ranked Neighborhood (MRN) approach is proposed. Finally, desired service is navigated through the established friendship link. The proposed social-driven relationship approach is validated using two distinct real-world datasets. Experimental results proved that the proposed ORFS model well performed for navigating smarter social objects in SIoT. ORFS model achieved an improved performance with various factors like MAE, RMSE, computational time, average path length, recall, precision and F1 score.}

However, there are a number of challenges in this relationship, such as Korea's high level of reliance on a single ASEAN member (Vietnam), Korean businesses’ relatively short history in ASEAN, and inconsistencies and ambiguities in Korea's diplomatic approach towards ASEAN. In order to overcome these issues, Korean entities could consider seeking local partners in ASEAN, spotting economic and societal priorities in national and ASEAN development strategies, and taking advantage of ASEAN's intra-regional integration. There are two areas, namely Indonesia's electric vehicle value chain and smart city construction, in which Korea's public and private entities are attempting to gain a foothold by adopting these strategies.}

In this study, using data from the Energy Systems Catapult's Living Laboratory, we present a novel conceptual framework that ties together insights from “lived experiences” research with “narratives and energy biographies.” We synthesize from these approaches the notion of “energy phenomenology,” which holds that heating practices will be mediated by individual identity, experiential preferences and needs, socio-material attachment, and lifestyle changes. In other words, the energy phenomenology framework demands that we understand the lived experiences, practices, and identities that intercede and shape smart heat services and consumption. Then, we test this framework with three sets of primary data—undirected diary studies and blogging, directed diary studies and blogging, and household interviews—involving 100 homes using smart heating controls across Birmingham (West Midlands), Bridgend (Wales), Manchester (Greater Manchester), and Newcastle (Northumberland) in the United Kingdom. We identify seven different phenomenological uses of smart heat—parental care, alleviating pain, fresh air, personal care, zoophilism (caring for pets, animals, and plants), social signaling, and structural fortification. Rather than merely germinating from rational choices based on available information about the likely costs and benefits of their behavior, smart heating—an essential tool for the decarbonisation of buildings, fossil energy, and electricity—is a phenomenological process. Policy and research efforts that fail to appreciate these dynamics risk capturing only a partial and incomplete picture of how and why people heat homes and domestic spaces. The outcome could be that these policies will fail to meet their objective of decarbonizing domestic heating and averting climate change.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition, the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food, medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification, and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability, and security. In addition, new challenges regarding security and privacy have emerged in the system as the ever-growing smart connected IoT devices generate a significant amount of heterogeneous data. Given these challenges, in this paper, we propose PPFchain, a new federated learning-enabled blockchain-based framework to ensure the security and privacy of sensor-IoT-based architectures using sampled ECS data. PPFchain has a lightweight, low-cost, high-performance architecture in the IoT-based blockchain network. In the architecture, we used the federated model and cryptographic primitives for user and data privacy in off-chain fog nodes considering performance. Moreover, we compared with traditional blockchain models using various performance metrics for system performance in a distributed architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract. In addition, the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced security.}

While it is best known for its capability to allow end users to sell energy generated from renewable sources such as wind and sun back to the power company, it also has another component that deals with the capability to react automatically to disturbances that can cause large scale power outages. As part of our work at Los Alamos National Laboratory, intelligent control of flexible manufacturing systems research was applied to controlling an electric power grid model using the sensors and technology that is expected to be available with the introduction of the Smart Grid. The goal is to use the automated equipment that will eventually be in place for the implementation of the Smart Grid and build a controller that can avoid such catastrophic power outages such as the 2003 outage over the north east part of the country. The power system of the City of Los Alamos was modeled and used as a test system. The states of the models were initialized with data collected from their SCADA system. Then artificial disturbances were induced to test the system. The controller was able to react to the disturbances in real time with no human command. The controller was able to consider the financial consequences to its actions by optimizing for the least overall loss of revenue. This work is conceptual in nature with the goal of introducing research from the manufacturing control community to applications in the control of the electric power grid now possible with the introduction of the technology associated with the Smart Grid.}

One technology way for this strategy is the City Intelligent Energy Network (CIEN), supporting a green, ecological development of the Chinese cities. CIEN starts from the redistribute of city land-use, taking small gas turbine as the major power, combining with the new energy mode, such as solar energy, wind energy and low level energy (geothermal, ice cold storage, water cold storage). CIEN could supply relatively large network and grid with electricity, heat, and cold, realizing the efficient, integrate and gradable use of the energy network technology. As CIEN is on its starting point, so this kind of technology still need the combination work with the lab research and applicable field test. Considering the city unit scale, the transportation mode, energy resources, and the traditional mode to power grid and other factors, the key point is to balance the economical use and the resource capability and adaptability. This paper tries to use the 2007 statistical data including city economy, construction, population, and different energy parameter, to establish the comprehensive model. Combining the model results, the CIEN adaptability will be discussed, and meaningful policies will be proposed, with the focusing of how to build a Smart Low-carbon city.}

abstract = {This article presents an innovative and efficient way to address residential dwellings' substantial heating needs. The primary objective is to utilize the heat from wastewater to enhance energy efficiency through a control framework based on predetermined rules. This framework aims to increase the incoming air temperature at the air handling unit. A thorough evaluation is carried out to analyze all aspects of the proposed system compared to an identical system that does not incorporate the wastewater heat recovery process. The practicality of the concept is assessed for a residential building located in Beijing, China, employing the TRNSYS software. The most optimal operating condition is achieved via the grey wolf optimizer and TOPSIS decision-making approach equipped with the artificial neural network using MATLAB. Then, the proposed system's performance under optimal conditions is compared with similar works in the literature. According to the results, compared to the conventional system, a higher performance efficiency of 6 % and lower levelized cost of heating of 15.6 $/MWh is obtained by implementing the wastewater heat recovery process. The parametric study results also demonstrate a conflicting change in techno-economic and environmental indicators when altering the primary decision variables, highlighting the necessity for multi-criteria optimization. What stands out from the optimization outcomes is that the grey wolf method increases the efficiency and CO2 saving by around 5.2 and 531.2 kg/year while reducing the levelized cost of heating by about 13.6 $/MWh, respectively. The optimization results reveal that this condition is attained by raising the heat exchanger's effectiveness and the number of residences and decreasing the wastewater temperature. According to the scatter distribution of key parameters, the energy wheel effectiveness has low sensitivity, and the optimal points of tank volume are distributed within the range of 3 m3 and 4 m3.}

Smart multifunctional thermo-chemical energy networks represent an alternative energy network and storage system, a solution based on the distribution of energy via thermo-chemical material rather than thermal energy, gas, fuels or electricity– an option that has scope for integrated short- and long-term energy storage. This is the first research work to realise such a system and demonstrate how it might operate using smart control strategies and how thermo-chemical fluids (TCFs) can be used as a medium for timely energy storage and distribution. The experimental study also describes the effect of steady and variable heat sources on TCF regeneration performance and estimates the potential of thermo-chemical energy networks, which would be particularly beneficial in buildings with high energy consumption for humidity control. This research proves the practicality of the design idea for such a network, which would be governed by centralised control, regenerated by steady or transient heat loads and capable of supplying a variety of demands in an experimental setting. The energy and economic potential of the network were also assessed, identifying temperature and humidity control application scenarios with energy savings of more than 60% compared to conventional operation and payback periods of 6.6–9.7 years.}

To understand the mechanism of ATP regulating biological ion channels, developing an ATP-responsive artificial nanochannel is an appealing but challenging topic because KATP channel is a heteromultimer of two subunits (potassium channel subunit (Kir6.x) and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)) and exhibit dynamic functions with adjustability and reversibility. Inspired by the structure of KATP channels, we designed a smart copolymer modified nanochannel that may address the challenge. In the tricomponent poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm, PNI)-based copolymer system, phenylthiourea was used to bind the phosphate units of nucleotides and phenylboronic acid was introduced to combine the pentose ring of the nucleoside unit. Besides, a –COOH group with electron-withdrawing property was added into the phenylthiourea units, which may promote the hydrogen-bond-donating ability of thiourea. Specially, the smart copolymer not only provided static binding sites for recognition but also translated the recognition of ATP into their dynamic conformational transitions by changing the hydrogen-bonding environments surrounding PNIPAAm chains, thus achieving the gating function of nanochannel, which resembled the integration and coordination of Kir6.x and SUR units in active KATP. The ATP-regulated ion channel exhibited excellent stability and reversibility. This study is the first example showing how to learn from nature to assemble the ATP-responsive artificial nanochannel and demonstrate the possible mechanism of ATP gating.}

abstract = {With growing concerns related to attacks on the cyber and physical assets associated with the power grid along with the need to mitigate impact of natural disasters, resilience has become a critical and desirable characteristic. There have been numerous efforts to define, measure and analyse resilience of smart grids. In this paper, a detailed review and comparative analysis of qualitative frameworks as well as quantitative metrics for studying resilience are provided. The desirable properties of a resilience metric are highlighted and challenges associated with formulating, developing and calculating such a metric in practical scenarios are discussed. Future research avenues in the area of developing a holistic framework for quantifying resilience are summarized with a focus on challenges related to multi-modal cyber/physical attacks, big data related issues and interdependence of critical infrastructures.}

abstract = {Many studies were conducted to reduce energy demand and consumption in buildings related to HVAC systems, mainly in warm and hot climates, where heat gain from the envelope is relevant. In this context, the window is the component that demands more attention as it usually shows a low thermal performance and represents the weakest component in the building envelope. This work proposes a method to evaluate window performance considering operation strategies regarding dynamic solar control and passive cooling in commercial buildings in subtropical and tropical climates. Parametric simulations were run for three Brazilian cities testing three windows compositions – laminated, insulated, and electrochromic glazing – with hybrid ventilation. Personalized codes were developed to establish rules for window control and prioritize actions to meet energy-saving and thermal comfort for five electrochromic and five hybrid ventilation controls. It was proposed the Pareto-optimal frontier to obtain the optimal set of solutions. The results showed that electrochromic windows reached an energy saving of up to 6.1% to 8.6% in the studied cities. The most influential variables were solar radiation incidence, external illuminance level, and outdoor air temperature. The method is adequate to establish guidelines for window controlling in warm and hot climates, especially coupling different techniques.}

abstract = {This study developed a quantitative flooding adaptation model, the Hazard Capacity Factor Design (HCFD) model, to evaluate flooding risk and the effects of green–gray infrastructure interactions under severe flooding events. Modern society suffers great damage from natural disasters; however, no disaster adaptation model exists that can be easily used by decision makers. Therefore, we developed a model for comprehensive diagnosis of disasters in Suwon City using three key methods. First, a flood adaptation model was developed considering the pipeline network and an optimized arrangement of infrastructure was designed. Second, the framework of the HCFD model and the concept of the safety factor were developed. Finally, interactions between gray and green infrastructure were analyzed. Model evaluation demonstrated that gray and green infrastructure could reduce flooding by 20.04% and 6.55%, respectively, under 400 mm rainfall. The interaction between the gray infrastructure and the green infrastructure had an additional flood reduction effect of about 7%. The primary findings of this study were to develop the HCFD model as well as evaluate the interaction effects between gray and green infrastructure. The HCFD model could also be used in any disaster adaptation using different parameters and disasters.}

abstract = {Microtremor measurements are used for preliminary site effect of the Quaternary sediments of Varanasi in Indo-Gangatic plain, which is being planned as a Smart City of India. We evaluated site effects using single and arrays Microtremor measurements at various sites in the Varanasi City, Uttar Pradesh, India. At City, H/V spectral ratios using microtremor measurements indicate fundamental frequency range 0.37–0.63 Hz, corresponds amplification 5 to 14 times. This indicates that the deep thickness of the upper soft soil at about several hundreds of meters. Such huge amount of sediments deposition sources could be associated with fluvial rivers system in the area and sediment drain from Himalaya. The average peak frequency (~0.5) may reflect the Quaternary-Tertiary boundary. Microtremor array measurements at two sites were taken using circular arrays (30 and 60 m) which consists of three recording stations on the circumference of circle and one in the centre of circle. The Phase velocity dispersion of Rayleigh wave is calculated from array using SPAC method, and a 1-D shear wave velocity structure is determined by means of inversion processes. The top layers up to 50 m show shear velocities between 280 and 320 m/s and the velocities of underneath layer vary between 1500 and 1600 m/s till 100 m of depth. These results from the present study would be useful for future planning purposes as well as risk management and to reduce severity of earthquake effects in the study area.}
