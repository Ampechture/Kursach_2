abstract = {Thermochromic window technologies promise energy-saving capabilities through intelligent regulation of solar irradiation indoor penetration. Although improvements have been made, nanoparticle thermochromic coated glazing technology has not yet achieved optimal balance between luminous transmittance and solar modulating capability. While luminous transmittance can be increased, this generally comes at the cost of reduced solar modulation, and this trade-off requires exploration. Thermochromic glazing with varying luminous transmittance and corresponding solar modulation has hence been developed through coating VO2 nanoparticles directly onto glazing by adjusting thicknesses of the coatings. The advantages of this method are simplicity of process, high purity of starting materials, compatibility with a wide range of substrates, and reproducibility in switching properties. The effects of the thermochromic glazings on building performance were then explored using building simulation for desert, Mediterranean, and temperate climates. It was found that 7.1–46.4% annual energy-saving can be achieved in comparison to using an uncoated clear double-glazed window. Trade-off between energy-saving capability and UDI500-2000 lx within the space was also explored and results showed that the designed thermochromic glazing reduced visual discomfort 1.2–3.2 m into the space. Overall, responding to external conditions, thermochromic technological advancements can help make buildings more resilient to future weather changes.}

abstract = {Fault diagnosis techniques play an increasingly important role in the operation and maintenance of smart city systems. Artificial intelligence improves the efficiency of chiller system fault diagnosis, and greatly reduces the energy consumption of urban buildings. The existing intelligent fault diagnosis methods of chiller mostly rely on balanced training datasets; lacking fault samples makes these methods incompetent to extract reliable features to recognize abnormal machine conditions, resulting in the degraded performance. To overcome the deficiencies of reported studies, a new method, called end-to-end chiller fault diagnosis, is proposed using a fused attention mechanism and dynamic cross-entropy. Firstly, a one-dimensional convolution network (1D-CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) are combined to capture the spatial-temporal features from the original data directly. Afterwards, a fused attention mechanism is developed to further refine the extracted features to increase the contribution of crucial features and achieve high-quality diagnostic information mining. Finally, the dynamic cross-entropy (DCE) is designed for updating the imbalance factor in real-time, with more focus on the hard-classified types. The experimental analysis results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method in identifying chiller system faults with imbalanced datasets.}

Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to investigate the implications of upscaling NZEB and share best practices and future perspectives on the users’ grid interaction. In this chapter, we provide guidance to energy companies, consumers, energy service providers, and experts with a general interest on key factors that will lead to successful energy transition and widespread use of NZEB on urban, city, and national scales. There are the three key factors to a successful energy transition and widespread use NZEB: (1) Designing and operating NZEB as smart buildings, (2) transforming the current grid into smart interactive grids with connected and autonomous micro grids, and (3) decarbonizing the power grids. The chapter provides an overview on specifications and best practices to incorporate sensing technology to monitor the state of the grid, make use of distributed renewable energy generation, and use information technology for collaborative interactions between energy providers and energy consumers. We discuss the means of monitoring a reliable and flexible infrastructure that can meet future demand growth and achieve users’ economic and environmental benefits to help upscaling NZEB. Finally, we share some lessons learned to achieve smart and decarbonized grids by taking into account mobility, energy security, and spatial planning.}

However, climate change is predicted to alter the frequency and intensity of flooding events, stimulating the need to explore another more adaptive flooding solution like real-time control (RTC). This study assesses the performance of RTC to mitigate impacts of climate change on urban flooding resilience. A simulated, yet realistic, urban drainage system in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, shows that RTC improves the flooding resilience by up to 17% under climatic rainfall changes. Compared with green stormwater infrastructure (GSI), RTC exhibits a lower resistibility, lower flooding failure level, and higher recovery rate in system performance curves. Results articulate that keeping RTC's performance consistent under ‘back-to-back’ storms requires a tradeoff between upstream dynamical operation and downstream flooding functionality loss. This research suggests that RTC provides a path towards smart and resilient stormwater management strategy.}

Therefore, in 2009, a new Moroccan energy strategy has been adopted to respond to the sustainable development revolution. Its main objectives are to provide sufficient and reliable energy to the country with minimum costs and impacts on the environment. Smart Grid (SG) is one of the aspects that can ensure the success of such strategy. Its implementation helps ensuring more efficient energy and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by adapting production to demand while reducing consumption, integrating renewable energies (RE), and using advanced communication and control technologies. Through this article, we will study the existing state of the Moroccan network, along with its potential of RE, as well as the obstacles and barriers to smart grid development in Morocco. Finally, we will propose solutions and strategies for deploying smart grids in the Kingdom. In which it is necessary to introduce intelligent measurement and analysis systems, to reinforce the regional and international interconnections and promote energy storage. In the alternative, Morocco needs to complete the regulatory framework for open and transparent access to the low-voltage system, particularly by harmonizing authorizations and tariff structures.}

However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keyword frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.}

With this in mind, the objective of this work is to identify the most appropriate configuration for a smart household meter for electricity, water, and gas consumption, which adds value for a different household customer. Therefore, a market research based on Conjoint Analysis Based on Choice was carried out. The survey presents a sample of 202 respondents restricted to the metropolitan area of Florianópolis, in southern Brazil. The results indicate the relevance given by sample consumers to energy and water control, but no significant interest in controlling gas consumption. Consumers are also interested in using the mobile application to access information and tips on the consumption of monitored resources. Moreover, respondents in this region are less price sensitive. However, women and consumers of cheaper real estate are more willing to pay a higher price for a smart meter.}

In this paper, a novel performance indicator based on the concept of learning gain is developed to quantify the learning ability of buildings by way of a single, dimensionless number between zero and unity. The implementation of the new Learning Ability Index (LAI) is demonstrated by way of three different case studies chosen from the literature. It is concluded that LAI is an easy and illustrative tool to assess the learning ability of buildings. Particularly, it is useful for monitoring the performance of data-driven processes, when pursuing the preferred strategies to reach higher levels of building intelligence. The LAI considers the time invested in learning plus the quality and diversity of learning material. It is flexible with respect to system boundaries or the performance metrics, wherefore it can be implemented as a generic indicator of system evolution, as well.}

In this scenario, applications are usually decomposed for execution in sets of tasks, which are in turn encapsulated into virtual components such as containers. Containers are lightweight implementations of virtual machines, improving efficiency and portability in distributed applications. Traditional containers scheduling in cloud is a well-known problem, but when the environment is heterogeneous, as it is in the scope of edge computing and edge-cloud systems, the problem becomes more challenging. In this paper we present the Concurrent Container Clusters Scheduling problem (C3S) aimed at optimizing the problem of placing containers in clusters of heterogeneous nodes satisfying a set of resource requirements, quality of service limitations, and considering additional stringent constraints in terms of applications execution in isolation for security guaranteeing. The C3S problem has been formulated using Integer Linear Programming with the dual objective of minimizing the number of applications rejected while minimizing the number of nodes used for computation. We have evaluated the optimality of this approach, analyzed the performance in terms of solving time and, finally, created a heuristic approach to solve the problem in realistic high demanding scenarios.}

These include limited resources, a lack of field expertise, practicality, and a slew of other technological issues stand in the way of constructing AI. AI is being used in the area of human activity modeling. Artificial intelligence systems refer to a computer system's capacity to carry out activities that are essential to human intelligence, such as logical reasoning and task learning. An AI challenge is any job for which the solution method necessary to solve the problem is unknown in advance or for which the data are lacking. If the activity of a system or program carrying out activities to accomplish a problem is comparable to the outcome of a human completing the same task, it is characterized as AI. As a result, AI can refer to a variety of software tools, such as text recognition systems, automated design, self-training programs, etc., not just because of this, but also because they follow the same concepts and regulations as humans. In AI research, there are two primary potential paths. The first is to get AI systems closer to human thinking concepts. The second is to build AI, which entails combining previously created AI components into a single system that can solve human issues. Artificial intelligence research and development is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, and the findings are being used at scale in real-world applications. Automated technologies are increasingly being used in digital education or e-learning to provide additional help for decision makers in decision-making processes. Current research has greatly expanded our understanding of artificial intelligence, but less work has been done on how it may be used for online education. The number of applications in this sector remains small, but it is expected to grow in the coming years. Furthermore, significant research and many problems must be solved in order to bring the technological, social, educational, and ethical viewpoints of these intelligent systems together.}

This paper investigates the bidirectional interaction between human and buildings that leads to dramatic change of building performance data distributions post-pandemic, and evaluates the applicability of typical facility management and energy management applications against these changes. According to the evaluation, this paper recommends three mitigation measures to rescue the applications and embedded machine learning algorithms from the data inconsistency issue in the post-pandemic era. Among these measures, incorporating occupancy and behavioural parameters as independent variables in machine learning algorithms is highlighted. Taking a Bayesian perspective, the value of data is exploited, historical or recent, pre- and post-pandemic, under a people-focused view.}

Objective
Little is known about the use of Stress Management and Relaxation Techniques (SMART) in racially diverse inpatients. We hope to identify socioeconomic status (SES) factors, health behavior factors, and clinical factors associated with the use of SMART.
Design and main outcome measures
We conducted a secondary analysis of baseline data from 623 hospitalized patients enrolled in the Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) clinical trial. We assessed socio-demographic characteristics and use of SMART. We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to test the association of SMART with socio-demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and clinical factors.
Results
A total of 26.6% of participants reported using SMART and 23.6% used mind body techniques. Thirty six percent of work disabled patients, 39% of illicit drug users, and 38% of participants with depressive symptoms used SMART. Patients who both reported illicit drug use and screened positive for depression had significantly increased odds of using SMART [OR=4.94, 95% CI (1.59, 15.13)]. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks [0.55 (0.34–0.87)] and Hispanic/other race individuals [0.40 (0.20–0.76)] were less likely to use SMART.
Conclusions
We found greater utilization of SMART among all racial groups compared to previous national studies. In the inner city inpatient setting, patients with depression, illicit drug use, and work disability reported higher rates of using SMART.}

abstract = {This paper describes radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field (EMF) measurements in the vicinity of single and banks of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) smart meters. The measurements were performed in a meter testing and distribution facility as well as in-situ at five urban locations. The measurements consisted of gauging the RF environment at the place of assessment, evaluating the worst-case electric-field levels at various positions around the assessed AMI meter configuration (spatial assessment), which ranged from a single meter to a bank of 81 m, and calculating the duty cycle of the system, i.e. the fraction of time that the AMI meters were actually transmitting (12-h temporal assessment). Both in-situ and in the meter facility, the maximum field levels at 0.3 m from the meter configurations were 10–13 V/m for a single meter and 18–38 V/m for meter banks with 20–81 m. Furthermore, 6-min average duty cycles of 0.01% (1 m) up to 13% (81-m bank) were observed. Next, two general statistical models (one for a single meter and one for a meter bank) were constructed to predict the electric-field strength as a function of distance to any configuration of the assessed AMI meters. For all scenarios, the measured exposure levels (at a minimum distance of 0.3 m) were well below the maximum permissible exposure limits issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Indeed, the worst-case time-average exposure level at a distance of 0.3 m from an AMI installation was 5.39% of the FCC/IEEE and 9.43% of the ICNIRP reference levels.}

Town planners and administration bodies just need the right tools at their fingertips to consume all the data points that a town or city generates and then be able to turn that into actions that improve peoples’ lives. In this case, Big Data is definitely a phenomenon that has a direct impact on the quality of life for those of us that choose to live in a town or city. Smart Cities of tomorrow will rely not only on sensors within the city infrastructure, but also on a large number of devices that will willingly sense and integrate their data into technological platforms used for introspection into the habits and situations of individuals and city-large communities. Predictions say that cities will generate over 4.1 terabytes per day per square kilometer of urbanized land area by 2016. Handling efficiently such amounts of data is already a challenge. In this paper we present our solutions designed to support next-generation Big Data applications. We first present CAPIM, a platform designed to automate the process of collecting and aggregating context information on a large scale. It integrates services designed to collect context data (location, user’s profile and characteristics, as well as the environment). Later on, we present a concrete implementation of an Intelligent Transportation System designed on top of CAPIM. The application is designed to assist users and city officials better understand traffic problems in large cities. Finally, we present a solution to handle efficient storage of context data on a large scale. The combination of these services provides support for intelligent Smart City applications, for actively and autonomously adaptation and smart provision of services and content, using the advantages of contextual information.}

abstract = {The 15-minute city theory has recently become a popular paradigm in urban development. It claims that everyone should have access to the essential services, facilities and green spaces within a 15-minute walk. This article tests this concept in Oslo, Norway using a mixed-methods approach, based on a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) analysis of accessibility, review of relevant plans, interviews with planners and a case study of the Hovinbyen area. The objective was to find out to what extent Oslo is a 15-minute city, and discuss how this concept can be integrated in urban planning strategies more generally. The study shows that the central part of Oslo is already a 15-minute city, and that several areas are transforming in this direction. However, many suburban neighborhoods have low accessibility scores, and, according to the plans, will likely not change much in the future. This article argues that the 15-minute city concept cannot serve as the main development strategy, but such an analysis can be useful as a diagnostic study or to assist planning in rapidly changing areas or city extensions. The concept can therefore be considered as a flexible tool to support other planning strategies that share the same goals and ambitions. Any interventions that such accessibility analyses suggest should be contextualized and developed in combination with other qualitative assessments and in partnership with local communities.}

By implementing different renewable energy sources, like photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, RMGs can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance proficiency. The paper suggests a RMG energy management method based on machine learning, which considers a reconfigurable frame according to the remote link switching and segmentation. The proposed scheme investigates advanced support vector machines to model and estimates the charging demand (ChD) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). To reduce the load impact of HEV on the network, 2 various cases have been implemented; one is coordinated, and the other is smartly charged. Because of the complex construction of the problem statement, an improved optimization technique according to the gray wolf is proposed. The simulation outcomes of the IEEE microgrid (MG) trial system depict that it is of adequate and efficient quality in both cases. Based on the result of the forecast for the total charge demand of HEVs, the average absolute percentage error is 0.978 that is so small. Furthermore, the outcomes are shown that, compared to the coordination scheme, the total operating cost of the MG in smart load is reduced by 2.5%.}

abstract = {With the intermittency that comes with electricity generation from renewables, utilizing dynamic pricing will encourage the demand-side to respond in a smart way that would minimize the electricity costs and flatten the net electricity demand curve. Determining the optimal dynamic pricing profile that would leverage distributed storage to flatten the curve is a novel idea that needs to be studied. Moreover, the economic feasibility of utilizing distributed electrical energy storage is still not given in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, a novel way of solving a citywide dynamic model using a bilevel programming algorithm is introduced. The problem is developed as a novel non-cooperative Stackelberg game that utilizes air-conditioning systems and electrical storage through the end-users to determine the optimal dynamic pricing profile. The results show that the combined effect of utilizing demand-side air-conditioning systems and distributed storage together can flatten the curve while employing the optimal dynamic pricing profile. An economic study is performed to determine the economic feasibility of 20 different cases with different battery designs and the level of solar penetration. Three metrics were used to evaluate the economic performance of each case: the levelized cost of storage, the levelized cost of energy, and the simple payback period. Most cases had levelized cost of storage values lower than 0.457 $/kWh, which is the lower bound available in the literature. Seven out of 16 cases have a simple payback period shorter than the lifetime of the system (25 years). The case with a 100 MW PV power plant and a battery storage of size 597 MWh, was found to be the most promising case with a simple payback period of 12.71 years for the photovoltaic plant and 19.86 years for the demand-side investments.}

With the rapid advancements of intelligent systems, Smart Grid (SG) technologies have emerged to provide two-way communication infrastructures, enabling optimized electricity usage patterns and optimized load balancing mechanisms, to name a few. Of late, the Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) has been extensively used for advanced energy management solutions in smart homes. Moreover, numerous research works have been carried out to use energy management that deals with efficient energy consumption. Besides, research on SHEMS has emerged across several disciplines, especially for smart home energy usage. The prime objective of SHEMS is to ensure energy savings, minimized peak average ratio, low electricity consumption cost, peak supply and demand, and reduced energy wastage. Nowadays, energy management has become a significant concern and essential part of human lives. However, energy management in households and the public and private service sectors must be considered to reduce the environmental burden to enable socio-economic impact on future generations. In this chapter, we primarily focus on three aspects. First, we present systematic literature on SHEMS, roles and responsibilities of various components, and benefits of SHEMS driving through energy efficiency. Second, we emphasize major concepts, components, functional capabilities, architectures, infrastructures, and existing energy management solutions for SHEMS. Last, we provide a comprehensive review of various energy management solutions, technological aspects, issues and challenges, and recommendations to enhance the performance of SHEMS.}

Most smart-card-based researches are time-related, but smart card data time is not always reliable because smart card systems are usually off-line and lack of maintenance in China, and smart card data of different buses often shares different time references. This paper explores the application of dynamic time warping to unify time reference of smart card data. Based on the analysis of the relationship between boarding time in smart card data and arrival-departure time in automatic vehicle location (AVL) data, a smart card data time reference unification algorithm was proposed. The results indicate that the algorithm can work out reliable time offsets by numerical calculation and runs well with integral automatic vehicle location data. Due to the fact that the time reference of smart card data for each bus changes daily, the best way to put an end to smart card time reference problem is to make smart card systems online, such as combining smart card readers with automatic vehicle location systems.}

To fill this gap, the aim of this paper is to find out whether interactions with scaffolding-based SPA technology enable students to internalize and apply problem-solving steps on their own in a 10th grade high school and a vocational business school class. Students in the experiment classes completed their assignments using Smart Personal Assistants, whereas students in the control classes completed the same assignments using traditional methods. This study used a mixed-method approach consisting of two field quasi-experiments and one post-experiment focus group discussion. The empirical results revealed that students in the experiment classes acquired significantly more problem-solving skills than those in the control classes (Study 1: p = 0.0396, study 2: p < 0.001), and also uncovered several changes in students' learning processes. The findings provide first empirical evidence for the value of using SPA technology on skill development in general, and on problem-solving skill development in particular.}

DTs, representing virtual replicas of physical objects, products or processes established thanks to a bidirectional continuous flow of information between the physical and the virtual world, are currently adopted in multiple domains such as manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, energy, construction, smart cities and smart mobility, etc.. DTs live together with the physical system they replicate, receiving the same data and often triggering specific control actions that directly impact on the real system status. When dealing with DTs of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the data sources may be heterogeneous and untrustworthy, which requires the DT to be able to address security issues related to data in transit from/to the physical twin and data at rest. A possible way to address these data security issues consists in adopting Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) which provide several security guarantees on data through cryptographic hashing techniques. In this work, we present a three-fold contribution: (i) we discuss the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the state-of-the-art of the research related to the integration between DLT and Digital Twins, aimed at clarifying relevant aspects such as, among others, what is the favourite DLT choice in existing proposals or what is the type of DT-related information to store on-chain; (ii) leveraging the SLR results and other related research, we propose an architectural framework for the integration of DT and DLTs (more specifically, blockchains); (iii) we validate the proposed architecture by means of two proof-of-concept implementations leveraging different technological stacks and taking into account two different operational scenarios. Finally, we conduct a requirements coverage analysis and compare the PoCs through a coverage matrix.}

Affordable and clean energy is one of the sustainable development goals (SDG-7) of the UN. Solar energy is considered to be one of the world's most abundant renewable natural resources and can certainly contribute to meeting the SDGs. The photovoltaic (PV) panel converts solar energy into electrical energy without emitting greenhouse gases. PV panels generate power based on solar radiation received at a specific location over time. As a result, PV output power is difficult to forecast. Many public/private institutes generate green energy, and balancing demand and supply is vital. This research aims to forecast PV system output power based on weather and derived features using different machine learning (ML) models. A best-fitting model is developed based on the data to accurately predict output power. Moreover, different performance metrics are used to compare and evaluate the accuracy under different ML models such as Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Compared to the recent research, our results demonstrate that the obtained prediction accuracy is superior, with performance gains reaching up to 14% (R-squared) in the case of the RF model and 25% (MAPE) in the case of the SVR model. The comparison result inferred a similar performance when RF and XGBoost were applied. On the other hand, the ML models MLP, SVR, and KNN give a similar prediction pattern.}

abstract = {Power quality disturbance (PQD) is a major concern today in power system analysis and its detection with high classification accuracy is important for proper functioning of different industries, smart cities, smart grids and smart metering systems etc. Nowadays, various algorithms are available which use machine learning (ML) based techniques for PQD classification which gives good accuracy of classification. The classification accuracy could be further increased by taking into consideration the loss of data which occurs during the pre-processing of PQD signal by addition of fuzzification step (fuzzification of data) in pre-processing stage itself. This fuzzification of data in pre-processing stage gives fuzzified data rather than crisp data to the classifier. Fuzzification of data during pre-processing stage improves the classification accuracy as compared to other popular PQD classification methods which includes both fuzzy and non-fuzzy based classifiers.}

abstract = {A type of smart window using thermochromic glazing (TCG) is a promising technology for green buildings owing to the self-regulating feature and low-maintenance need. Its most important feature, thermo-optical properties that regulate the blockage of solar heat, is directly linked to the variation of surface temperatures. However, challenges from the inhomogeneity of thermo-optical properties, the coupled solar radiation and natural convection, and varying outdoor conditions all seriously hinder the understanding of its mechanism. In this paper, a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model achieves the simulation of inhomogeneous tinting of TCG by defining the thermo-optical properties of each finite volume according to the surface temperature. Solar radiation and natural convection at outdoor, indoor and the cavity are solved to reflect glazing temperature more accurately. The case studies compared six different switching temperatures in the range of 20 ∼ 42.5 °C with a transition gradient of 10 °C. Averaged meteorological data for both summer and winter, sunny days and cloudy days are selected to present realistic climate impacts. The result reveals the overall saving in transmitted solar radiation in summer and heating penalties in winter. It suggests the best switching temperatures for each climate condition. With the seasonal operation, the highest saving in solar heat gain is 20.9% when adopting a switching temperature of 25–35 °C, while the lowest saving can be negative, meaning TCG is not suitable for those climate zones. The proposed evaluation criteria help to quantify the applicability of TCG with the input of the summer/winter day ratio and sunny/cloudy ratio. The best region to apply TCG is where summer days are longer and winter solar radiation is significantly lower. The in-depth understanding of this temperature-sensitive process benefits the optimization of TCG in buildings, especially for its seasonal operation needs.}

This article presents an intelligent solution based on an ontology that presents knowledge about the internal and external environment of a residence, as well as the occupants’ behavior and activities. The system openness with the external environment, the knowledge presentation flexibility built on Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the possibility of intelligent reasoning using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) are the main reasons for choosing the ontological approach. The proposed ontology is applied to a real home located in the Adrar city, in the Algerian Sahara. A comparison between two scenarios (with and without the proposed system, Ontological Solution for Energy Intelligent Management (OSEIM) revealed the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The obtained results present a significant energy saving of 4.58%.}

abstract = {Double skin facades (DSFs) are known by their capacity to generate a natural heating energy during winter by increasing the greenhouse effect in the air cavity between the inner and the outer facade. However, this effect provides an undesirable overheating during summer. In this study, a smart DSF configuration able to control the greenhouse effect generation was numerically simulated using a two dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) method. The aim of these simulations is to investigate the thermal and the energetic behavior of a DSF integrating Tungsten (W) doped Vanadium dioxide (VO2) as an optically smart thin material and a high absorbing aluminum nitride (AlN) coating. A parametric study was carried out in order to analyze the impact of the air cavity thickness on the smart DSF behavior. Four thicknesses (10, 25, 50 and 75 mm) were inspected and compared with an uninsulated massive wall configuration. Results have shown that the smart configuration reduces significantly both heating and cooling loads. Indoor surface temperature has been decreased by around 2 °C during summer and increased by around 3 °C during a sunny winter day. The air velocity results have shown that the natural convection-radiation interaction during winter is higher than during summer. Thus, the new smart DSF configuration presented in this paper can effectively control the greenhouse effect depending on external climatic conditions.}

The adoption of blockchain technology allows the grid network to decentralize its operations. This means there is no need for a central authority in the smart grid to control, distribute, and manage the electricity. The decision making and transaction flow in the smart grid do not need to be transmitted through the centralized system. All the transactions and operations performed on the grid network are stored on the public ledgers of a blockchain. The buying and selling energy transactions across the network can be done through a computer program by validating and verifying the pre-determined clauses of the transaction. So, blockchain technology helps in setting up real-time energy markets and identity preserving transactions at much lower costs. In this chapter, we have described the role and benefits of blockchain technology in the smart grid in terms of energy management and demand–supply management.}

However, little is known about how consumers perceive, and how they might respond to the opportunities that smart grid technologies offer. This paper reports the results from a Hong Kong survey (n=505). It contributes to the literature by providing a better understanding of the perceptions and behaviour of electricity consumers about the possible deployment of smart grids. Our results indicate that Hong Kong consumers generally welcomed smart grid technologies and had a preference for energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energy while they showed a high level of opposition to nuclear power. They displayed an interest in playing a much more informed and active role in energy decision-making, but they were sensitive to tariff increases. Motivations and barriers for consumers to support smart grid developments are also discussed. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications for effective consumer engagement. More policy attention is needed on demand-side measures, introducing institutional and regulatory changes, and modifying relationships between consumers, the government and utilities.}

abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of smart city, prevalent pub/sub (publish/subscribe) streaming systems have been increasingly employed as upstream middleware layer in multi-tenant edge clouds, and feed large volume of data gathered from IoT devices of different tenants into downstream systems (e.g., data analytics and warehouse). A shared tenancy model where multiple untrusted applications or tenants utilize the same pub/sub system is generally exploited in edge cloud, which poses crucial challenges including privacy-sensitive data/metadata access threat and critical metadata modification by unauthorized tenants. A centralized monitoring node is invariably adopted in existing security strategies (such as ACL, TLS), which causes the pub/sub streaming model vulnerable to external malicious attacks and single point failure. In this paper, inspired by outstanding features of blockchain including tamper-resistance, decentralization, strong consistency, and traceability, we propose BPS, a general and decentralized Blockchain-enhanced Pub/Sub communication model for multi-tenant edge cloud, to redesign pub/sub system internal security mechanisms. Specifically, by exploiting blockchain technology, BPS can detect the illegal operations and behaviors from both malicious tenants and untrusted publishers or subscribers. BPS directly leverages Merkel Hash Tree (MHT) of blockchain to verify the integrity of critical and confidential metadata. Regarding authorization, BPS introduces smart-contract-enabled fine-grained control over partition topic-classified messages by storing access control list (ACL) into an append-only blockchain ledger. Additionally, an incentive mechanism is employed in BPS to reward honest publishers and subscribers. We implement BPS prototype based on Kafka and EoS blockchain. Our security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that BPS outperforms the state-of-the-art pub/sub streaming system Kafka in security with minimal performance overhead.}

The application of the framework is supported by a set of general guidelines to drive the analysis, the design and the implementation of smart environments.

However, prior research fails to examine the effects of teaching computational logic to kindergarten children. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influences of teaching approaches in guiding preschool children to learn computational logic and programming concepts to enhance their problem-solving skills as well as computational thinking abilities. A novel teaching framework is designed to develop the learner’s cognitive abilities, which adopts the smart toy game-based learning approach along with a tangible user interface (TUI) to enhance children’s learning performance and interests. The proposed teaching approach integrates the game-based learning concepts into the TUI system, where the learning processes allow the learners to effectively practice the conceptual knowledge and efficiently advance their problem-solving skills.

On 11 March 2011, the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan was hit by an earthquake and subsequent tsunami and had lost the external power source and almost all of the internal power supply. Therefore, the nuclear reactor and the spent fuel pool became unable to cool down which resulted in the release of significant amounts of radioactive material. Tens of thousands of people around the power plant were forced to evacuate. At the present time, the problems such as global environmental problems and major accidents like critical accidents in the nuclear power plants, we are entering a new phase and we are in the turning point of energy. In 1879, Thomas Edison invented incandescent light bulb and electricity rapidly spread as a light energy source.

This study presents a comprehensive discussion of this glazing's smart regulation capacity. It is observed that the VO2 glazing's smart regulation capacity is influenced by property variations in its solar absorptivity and transmittance after the transition process. Smart Index (SI) is proposed to evaluate the “smart level” of VO2 glazing, and a contour map of SI is plotted to provide a concise method of determining how “smart” VO2 glazing can be.}

abstract = {Background and Objective
Brain machine interface (BMI) is a system which communicates the brain with the external machines. In general, an electroencephalograph (EEG) machine has to be used to monitor multi-channel brain responses to improve the BMI performance. However, the bulky size of the EEG machine and applying conductive gels in EEG electrodes also cause the inconvenience of daily life applications. How to select the relevant EEG channel and remove irrelevant channels is important and useful for the development of BMIs.
Methods
In this research, a smart EEG cap was proposed to improve the above issues. Different from the conventional EEG machine, the proposed smart EEG cap contain a spatial filtering circuit to enhance EEG features in local area, and it could also select the relevant EEG channel automatically. Moreover, the novel dry active electrodes were also designed to acquire EEG without conductive gels in the hairy skin of the head, to improve the convenience in use.
Results
Finally, the proposed smart EEG cap was applied in motion imagery-based BMI and several experiments were tested to valid the system performance. The proposed smart EEG cap could effectively enhance EEG features and select relevant EEG channel, and the information transfer rate of BMI was about 6.06 bits/min.
Conclusions
The proposed smart EEG cap has advantages of measuring EEG without conductive gels and wireless transmission to effectively improve the convenience of use, and reduce the limitation of activity in daily life. In the future, it might be widely applied in other BMI applications.}

abstract = {Background
Physical inactivity is a leading cause of death and disease globally. Research suggests physical inactivity might be linked to community designs that discourage active living. A “smart growth” community contains features likely to promote active living (walkability, green space, mixed land use), but objective evidence on the potential benefits of smart growth communities is limited.
Purpose
To assess whether living in a smart growth community was associated with increased neighborhood-centered leisure-time physical activity in children aged 8–14 years, compared to residing in a conventional community (i.e., one not designed according to smart growth principles).
Methods
Participants were recruited from a smart growth community, “The Preserve,” located in Chino, California, and eight conventional communities within a 30-minute drive of The Preserve. The analytic sample included 147 children. During 2009–2010, each child carried an accelerometer and a GPS for 7 days to ascertain physical activity and location information. Negative binomial models were used to assess the association between residence in the smart growth community and physical activity. Analyses were conducted in 2012.
Results
Smart growth community residence was associated with a 46% increase in the proportion of neighborhood moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as compared to conventional community residence. This analysis included neighborhood activity data collected during the school season and outside of school hours and home. Counterfactual simulations with model parameters suggested that smart growth community residence could add 10 minutes per day of neighborhood MVPA.
Conclusions
Living in a smart growth community may increase local physical activity in children as compared to residence in conventionally designed communities.}

On the other hand, since smart meters are installed in customer’s homes and businesses without hardware protection mechanisms that could be susceptible to physical attacks, where a dishonest customer may attempt to temper the metering data in order to make differences in billing. In this paper, an efficient privacy-aware multi-factor authenticated key establishment scheme (PMAKE) is proposed. One of the notable properties of the proposed scheme is that it can ensure physical security of the smart meters. From the performance analyses, we can claim that our scheme is secure and suitable for the resource limited smart meters.}

It examines and critically discusses the current discursive framing of digitalization in current transport policy and planning, and considers perspectives and meanings related to “smart” mobility and accessibility that are being established in strategic plans and policies for the Swedish transport sector. The empirical focus is on transport strategies and official reports developed at national level. The main findings indicate that digitalization is being framed as a rapid, unstoppable transformation process, which will lead to a range of positive outcomes such as reduced climate emissions, less congestion, improved accessibility, and a smoother and more resource-efficient transport system. According to the ideas and assumptions promoted in the current discourse, this transformation can only occur through stronger involvement of business enterprises. This governing strategy, or lack of governing strategy, makes it unclear how transport policy objectives are balanced against market and innovation interests. It also risks delegating the transition to sustainable mobility to less formalized and less transparent policy arenas that operate in parallel to, and partly outside, established planning and strategy-making processes.}

abstract = {The supervision of energy consumption applied to a smart home, seems to be one of the main challenges for the future smart grid. The purpose of this study was to investigate a double layer supervision strategy in order to ensure a flattened power load curve in a residential application. This control is mainly divided into two levels. The first consists of a demand response algorithm, which plays an important role in scheduling the operation of home appliances by moving the shiftable appliances from peak hours, when electricity prices are high, to off-peak hours when prices are low and thus contributes to improving the daily load profile. The first strategy was coupled with the emergence of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV), which is a new electrical load that must be considered in a smart home. The second consists of a PEV power management, which aims to ensure the bi-directional power flow from the smart home to PEVs (H2V) and from the Vehicle to Home (V2H). This procedure results in monitoring the power of each PEV connected to the home to determine its power reference and thereby, enhance again the power load curve. Simulation results highlight the performance of the two-layer home energy supervision strategy to achieve the smoothness for the daily power demand curve.}

In that sense, new paradigms such as flexible demand and vehicle-to-home capabilities have appeared on pursuing a more efficient management of the different domestic assets such as smart appliances, small renewable generators and storage facilities. Consideration of such kind of management strategies plays a vital role on designing stages of electrifications systems for isolated homes. In this regard, a proper evaluation of possible demand-side capabilities enables a more accurate evaluation of the electrification project. This paper tackles this issue by developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for optimal planning of electrification systems for off-grid dwellings. The developed framework allows to incorporate and analyse advanced demand-side strategies such as deferrable loads and vehicle-to-home processes by evaluating different project costs over various time horizons. The proposed approach is applied to a benchmark off-grid residential case study and various results are provided and analysed. As the most relevant result, it is worth remarking that total project cost can be reduced by ~21.2% and ~25.73% by considering flexible demand and vehicle-to-home capabilities, respectively. Nevertheless, the highest monetary savings were achieved when both strategies are jointly adopted, reducing the total project cost up to ~41.5%. The reported results demonstrate the importance of considering the different demand-side strategies on planning stages of electrification systems for off-grid dwellings.}

However, it is not clear to what extent artificial intelligence can improve decision-making, and some policy domains have not been the focus of most recent studies, including the public budget process. More specifically, budget allocation is one of the areas in which AI may have greatest potential. Therefore, this study attempts to contribute to this gap in our existing knowledge by answering the following research question: To what extent can artificial intelligence techniques help distribute public spending to increase GDP, decrease inflation and reduce the Gini index? In order to respond to this question, this article proposes an algorithmic approach on how budget inputs (specific expenditures) are processed to generate certain outputs (economic, political, and social outcomes). The authors use the multilayer perceptron and a multiobjective genetic algorithm to analyze World Bank Open Data from 1960 to 2019, including 217 countries. The advantages of implementing this type of decision support system in public expenditures allocation arise from the ability to process large amounts of data and to find patterns that are not easy to detect, which include multiple non-linear relationships. Some technical aspects of the expenditure allocation process could be improved with the help of these kinds of techniques. In addition, the results of the AI-based approach are consistent with the findings of the scientific literature on public budgets, using traditional statistical techniques.}

However, they suffer from several problems, namely, low solar modulation ability, high transition temperature (i.e. 68 °C) and low luminous transmittance. In this study, we propose a perovskite thermochromic smart window towards achieving high solar modulation ability whilst maintaining a high luminous transmittance and a low transition temperature. Perovskite material shows a significant thermochromism in the visible and ultraviolet region. Since half of the photons lie in this spectral region, a high solar modulation can be achieved by perovskites. The material was optimized by varying the spin speed in the fabrication process as well as the mixing ratio between precursors. The optimized sample exhibits a solar modulation ability of 25.5% with luminous transmittance of 34.3% and higher than 85% in the hot (80 °C) and cold (25 °C) states, respectively, making this material suitable for practical device applications. The hysteresis loop, the transition temperature as well as transition time in relation to the relative humidity of a perovskite smart window during the heating and cooling process are investigated in this study. From field tests results, the perovskite smart window can help reduce the indoor air temperature by about 2.5 °C compared to a normal window. Overall, based on the results obtained in this study, the perovskite thermochromic smart window has potential to achieve excellent thermochromic properties, providing an alternative to alleviate the high energy consumed in buildings.}

A qualitative approach, based on 34 interviews, helped identify drivers and barriers to geofencing, with the focus on Sweden. The drivers and barriers were then analyzed at different institutional levels (macro, meso, and micro). Drivers could be identified for actors at all levels, indicating that geofencing can contribute to transport sustainability. However, there are also barriers at all levels that hinder implementation. Closer collaboration is necessary to reduce knowledge gaps, develop policies, and establish viable business models.}

This article analyses data security monitoring from the vehicle end to the TSP platform, as well as gathering and analysing the status and intelligence of linked vehicles, in order to develop a Telematics TSP server attack monitoring system. Experiments show that the error detection rate of the benchmark algorithms decreases significantly as the error rate of vehicle speed data increases, with the exponential smoothing algorithm showing the largest decrease in the error detection rate. However, the proposed combined model is very close to the error detection rate of the benchmark algorithm at the later stages when the error rate is high, with an error detection rate of more than 80%.It provides great assistance for anomaly detection and data recovery, especially in researching key technologies for remote information processing data security and reliability, greatly improving their performance.}

The development of LoRa and the deployment of LoRaWAN, however are not mature. This study will investigate LoRa and support the deployment of LoRaWAN in smart grids. Trial and error is not sufficient for deployment of LoRaWAN, and it should be planned using theoretical approaches, assisted by measurements. Therefore, this work uses theoretical considerations to develop a channel model of LoRa that considers propagation attenuation, shadowing effect, and multipath fading. The theoretical model is used to develop an APP that can estimate the transmission distance of LoRa. To verify the feasibility of this APP, experiments use different parameters for the environment and transmission. Each experiment gives a packet error rate for transmission between two nodes. The packet error rate is obtained by measurement, and the distance between nodes is estimated theoretically. Results show that the model and the APP are feasible. This study also finds that the effect of a spreading factor is not as great as proposed by theory. Three factors affect the performance of LoRa, where distance is the main factor and obstacles and noise produce randomness. The contribution of this work is twofold. One is the theoretical channel model and the other is the practical APP. The engineers who are in charge of planning LoRaWAN can use the feasible APP to accelerate the progress of deployment.}

These initiatives have been generally successful and have resulted in the commitment of an increasing number of European cities towards sustainable development goals. At the same time, however, it has been revealed that there is a critical need for improved comprehensive city planning driven by an integrated and strategic approach, focused on cost benefit assessment towards sustainable energy use. This paper presents an innovative city planning approach developed within the EU FP7 project InSMART. It brings together four European municipalities – Evora (Portugal), Nottingham (UK), Trikala (Greece) and Cesena (Italy) –, academics, industries and technical consultants in order to establish a common methodology for enhancing sustainable planning for both the current and future city needs through an integrative and multidisciplinary approach. The methodology develops and employs a number of tools to assess the optimum mix of medium term measures (up to 2030) for a sustainable energy future, addressing the efficiency of energy flows across various city sectors with regards to economic, environmental and social criteria and paving the way towards actual implementation of priority actions. This paper presents the key concepts around this methodology and some selected results of the project (still ongoing). The results refer to the four city partners, all actively involved in developing a more sustainable energy system. Further on, the proposed approach may be replicable to other cities.}

Recently, digital twins have received a lot of attention to support advanced experimentation, simulation and decision-making for on-demand logistics operations. Questions still remain on how to realize these for urban logistics management in a mixed public-private stakeholder context. We argue that this lack of a specific framework for city logistics with a model library for data mergers, linking physical and virtual data exchange, can compromise the timely adoption of digital twin technology. We contribute to filling this gap by presenting a systematic review of the literature, proposing a conceptual framework for digital twin applications in urban logistics, and providing use case scenarios for their demonstration. Together, these should advance the technical implementation of digital twins in a sustainable city logistics context.}

abstract = {Smart traffic or transportation, as a critical part of realizing the smart city, utilizes various smart product-service systems to support it. Among them, the augmented reality head-up display (AR-HUD) system is a typical smart driving solution, which projects vital information about driving situations with pre-defined AR graphics onto the windshield of vehicles. The AR-HUD service design attracts increasing concerns owing to its enhancement of drivers’ situational awareness without glancing down at the instrument cluster. Nevertheless, current in-car AR-HUDs only stack some simple driving information from sensors, such as the driving speed. It's difficult to meet the demand of drivers since they ignore a higher level of drivers’ situation awareness, i.e., driving situation prediction and recommendation of driving advice. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes a visual reasoning-based service design approach for advancing AR-HUDs’ digital servitization and better user experience. Additionally, drivers are involved in the service design development in a value co-creation manner through human-computer interaction design. With the combination of experiential driving knowledge and cognitive intelligence computing on the driving scene, the proposed novel service design approach enables AR-HUD to percept driving scenarios and infer good strategies accordingly. Finally, an illustrative example is carried out to validate the feasibility of the proposed AR-HUD service design approach.}

The integration of renewables such as solar energy into the electrical network is a challenge for grid operators because of its intermittency due to weather variations. Despite this, the installed capacity of solar PV globally continues to increase. Thus, forecasting is becoming an important tool for system grid operators to manage solar photovoltaic (PV) energy production and satisfy the demand of energy consumers. This work aims to develop a forecasting model for solar irradiance that can be used in calculating next-day energy generation of solar PV systems. Site-specific solar irradiance and meteorological parameters were used as inputs to a machine learning algorithm. It is shown that the prediction model fits the measured data with a value of R2 equal to 85.89%. This model was validated through the measured data of power generation from a hybrid connected solar PV system, installed in Quezon City, Philippines.}

abstract = {In recent years, urban planners have mentioned the importance of implementing alternative city models that encourage short trips and neighborhood-scale activities such as the 15-minute city model. Several studies show that improvements in the transportation networks encourage the citizens to move themselves into their neighborhoods’ borders. People seem to respond to these actions by increasing their visits to many local places such as restaurants, bars, sports centres etc. Even though during the post-covid era, people decreased significantly their movements, it is vital to encourage the creation of friendly for walking transportation networks inside the neighborhoods of the cities, based on the concept of the 15-minute city model. Large cities are becoming bigger and bigger as they offer many job opportunities. However, the massive peoples’ relocation in big cities has as a result the creation of huge transportation problems. Neighborhoods have been downgraded as they were not ready to offer several services in larger populations. The 15-minute city model is designed to ensure that each citizen has quick access (15 minutes on foot) to essential services of various types. Moreover, the implementation of the 15-minute city model demands the strengthening of transportation networks promoting sustainable solutions that can support the daily walking of the habitants. This paper focuses on a literature review of the implementation of the 15-minute city model in different big cities worldwide, starting from Paris where the model is indeed a well-suited concept and focuses to the need of a cultural change rather than urban planning. The research points out not only the fact that this model can help the neighborhoods to grow up socioeconomically but the fact that the citizens can cooperate with the local authorities and participate in the redesign of their neighborhood based on the 15-minute city model.}

These systems enable health risk warnings and regulatory plans when harmful pollutant levels are forecasted. However, with current frameworks, forecasting is only possible at locations with sufficient sensor data and cannot be predicted at new areas. Furthermore, long-term sensor failure also limits their real-time monitoring and forecasting applications. We propose a distance adaptive graph convolutional gated network that provides simultaneous forecasts of primary air pollutants at multiple temporal horizons and locations of a mega-city via spatio-temporal sensor fusion. The framework also solves critical problems of early warning systems related to long-term sensor failure and prediction at a new location of city. The results suggest that for 12 h ahead PM2.5 forecast, the proposed model reduces prediction errors by 43.89% and 52.59% compared to the timeseries-Transformer and convolutional long-short term memory network, respectively. For long-term sensor failure imputation, the mean absolute error for CO, NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 ranged between 0.081–0.160, 0.004–0.007, 0.005–0.0155, 9.41–13.5, and 5.75–8.12, respectively.

Based on measurements in paired pine and beech forests and the review of literature data, we analyse the biophysical consequences and the carbon cycle impact of large-scale Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations in northern Germany in the face of a warming and aridifying climate. We quantified canopy surface albedo and surface temperature, evapotranspiration and deep seepage, carbon (C) storage in biomass and soil and annual C sequestration, and soil acidification of pine plantations in comparison to beech forests (Fagus sylvatica L.), the natural forest vegetation. We find that near-infrared (NIR, 700–3000 mn) canopy surface albedo is higher by 5.2 percentage points during summer over beech as compared to pine forest, resulting in a 9 % higher net radiation and a 0.6 K higher surface temperature of the pine canopy. Deep seepage is on average by 68 mm yr−1 smaller under pine than beech forest (66 mm yr−1 vs. 134 mm yr−1) due to the higher evapotranspiration of pine. C storage in biomass and soil is by ∼ 48 Mg C ha−1 higher in beech than pine forests, reflecting the higher productivity of beech, demonstrating an unfavorably low C sequestration potential of Scots pine plantations. We conclude that the large-scale Scots pine plantations in northern Germany (>1.7 million ha) are neither environmental-friendly nor climate smart, given their enhancement of climate-warming, low climate change mitigation potential, and negative effect on groundwater recharge. Replacing pine plantations by beech (or other hardwood) forests in northern Germany and adjacent regions is urgently needed for achieving the goals of climate-smart forestry.}

This research presents a 2050 scenario planning with the support of specialized EnergyPLAN software for Heritage cities and presents the case study of the Galapagos Islands and the City of Cuenca. The optimal 100% Renewable Energy Mix is calculated and using the geographical analysis of both land use and energy potentials, the advisable sites to locate new wind and solar PV generation plants are studied. The results obtained for 2050 are that in Galapagos the energy mix is wind power 33.33%, Solar PV 41.66%, Geothermal, 5.55%, Biomass 8.33%, small hydro 5.55%, and others 5.55%. In the case of Cuenca, hydroelectric power would be maintained at 35.34%, wind power would increase to 25.3%, solar PV 28.91%, geothermal 6.42%, biomass 2% and others with 2%. The most significant sites to locate both wind and solar PV plants are proposed, resulting in 38 sites in Galapagos and 14 in Cuenca. Results prove the feasibility of using 100% Renewable Energy Systems in Heritage locations and that it is possible and feasible to convert the Galapagos Islands and the City of Cuenca into a sustainable energy system.

We focus on the efficiency and accuracy of using a phone to monitor the driver’s walking trajectory, applying a waist-mounted PDR method that can measure the driver’s moving distance with a high accuracy. In addition, we design a map matching algorithm to calibrate the direction errors when the driver is in an indoor environment, using widely-available building floor plans.

These hubs encompass diverse elements such as integrated heat, electricity, and cooling systems, renewable energy sources, batteries, and thermal energy storage units (TES). This study focuses on a residential EH model that receives inputs in the form of electricity, gas, and solar energy to satisfy the household's electricity, heat, and cooling requirements. To enhance the operational flexibility of this energy hub, the study employs a Demand Response Program (DRP), which facilitates load shifting, load curtailment, and the modeling of flexible heating loads. The primary objective is to develop an efficient heat and power management system that optimally schedules household devices, generation equipment, and storage units. In pursuit of this goal, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) techniques have been selected for renewable energy, market price, and load forecasting, enhancing the system's realism and predictive accuracy. The Wild Goats algorithm is employed to solve an optimization problem for three distinct scenarios, aiming to minimize overall power costs while maintaining user comfort levels with regard to temperature and hot water availability. Furthermore, this study incorporates an environmentally conscious approach by considering the reduction of CO2, SO2, and NO pollution originating from consumers in a multi-objective optimization framework. The findings reveal that the implementation of DRP, intelligent Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) management, TES technologies, and LSTM-based forecasting significantly contribute to reducing power costs within the proposed EH scheme. This research underscores the potential of data-driven strategies in advancing energy transition initiatives and fostering sustainable urban energy hubs while acknowledging the role of advanced forecasting techniques in enhancing system realism and efficiency.}

Vast amounts of water quality data, varying in quality, is available however the seemingly lack of integrative data management has led to reactive planning and questionable decisions. The paper highlights the necessity for making water smart through a case study of the Upper Vaal catchment. The quality of available government data is mostly of an acceptable standard according to the evaluated data dimensions and elements. The practical application of determining hydrological responses to predict possible water quality changes towards land cover change in the Vaal river catchment emphasises that there is suitable data available and highlights the value of Smart Water Management (SWM). SWM can enable improved integrated water resource management by increasing sharing and effective use of real-time data of acceptable quality to promote proactive unambiguous strategies and decisions focused on overall improved water management and the evasion of a future water predicament.}

This paper proposes a smart irrigation system that helps farmers water their agricultural fields using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). This system provides acknowledgement messages about the job’s statuses such as humidity level of soil, temperature of surrounding environment, and status of motor regarding main power supply or solar power. Fuzzy logic controller is used to compute input parameters (e.g. soil moisture, temperature and humidity) and to produce outputs of motor status. In addition, the system also switches off the motor to save the power when there is an availability of rain and also prevents the crop using panels from unconditional rain. The comparison is made between the proposed system, drip irrigation and manual flooding. The comparison results prove that water and power conservation are obtained through the proposed smart irrigation system.}

The collected information is expected to improve efficiency and coordination, already enhancing the delivery of services in sectors such as health care, environment or entertainment. While infrastructural elements, such as roads, street lighting or waste containers, have traditionally been non-informational, now these kinds of elements are being furnished with sensors as part of an effort to change how their respective sectors operate. Energy sector, with its shift to the ‘smart grid’ infrastructure, provides a case study of how efforts at reorganising the sector are impacted by the relationship households develop to large quantities of energy information. Based on findings from studying ‘smart grid’ development in Japan, I argue that, to enable a reorganisation of the energy sector, extensive tailoring of information is required in order to engage users to develop an active relationship with infrastructure.}

The increased pilot LCCs in several countries and focus on theoretical research suggest the need to explore the associated research topics and characteristics, trends, and challenges. An in-depth analysis of literature on LCCs was conducted using the three-phase research involving documents searching, quantitative analyses and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis revealed that nearly 70% of LCC research was conducted in three countries. The results of the quantitative analysis also generated a map of term clusters, which identified the 9 major areas. A qualitative analysis of the literature indicated that transition to low-carbon energy is the most intensively researched category, and LCC planning and design dominates the research field. Based on the results of the quantitative and qualitative analyses, this study reports knowledge gaps in the literature and proposes future directions for LCC research in the context of four major trends: LCC planning and design, low-carbon energy transition, low-carbon decision support, and low-carbon management and policy. This study improves the existing knowledge on LCC-related research and provides a future guidance for theoretical research and pilot practices related to LCC.}

abstract = {The construction industry is currently facing the great challenge of applying sustainable materials with suitable mechanical properties and durability performance. Among the different strategies used to meet technical and sustainable criteria, two interesting approaches can be highlighted: the reuse of materials to produce sustainable construction materials and the development of smart concretes for Structural Health Monitoring. The first strategy consists of using recycled materials, co-products, and by-products of industrial processes to replace primary raw materials used to produce blocks, ceramics, mortars, and concrete. The second strategy is associated with the development of multifunctional cementitious and alkali-activated concretes with strain and damage self-sensing properties in response to the growing concerns related to the increase in the durability of civil structures. This paper presents a critical review of previous studies that combine both strategies, i.e., research works investigating smart construction materials that incorporate recycled and waste materials and exhibit self-sensing properties. Sustainable self-sensing composites (SSCs) incorporating different types of recycled and waste materials were presented. These sustainable admixtures provided different benefits to self-sensing composites, such as improvements in the conductive path within the matrices and improvements in the dispersion of other conductive fillers. The effects of silica fume, fly ash, steel slag, red mud, and other recycled materials on the electrical resistivity, strain-sensing properties, and damage-detection properties of SSCs were discussed. Promising SSCs were identified based on comparisons between gauge factor, stress sensibility, linearity, strain amplitude, and stress amplitude of SSCs produced with one single type of waste or combination of various types of wastes. In this sense, SSCs were found to be a viable alternative for modernization and greater sustainability of the construction industry.}

Improving urban carbon emissions efficiency (UCEE) in the new-type urbanization (NTU) process is key to reducing urban carbon and enhancing sustainable urban development. However, the potential of NTU in facilitating improved UCEE remains unclear. Thus, we investigated the effect and transmission mechanisms of NTU on UCEE in China. A set of spatial econometric models was used, with panel data from 283 cities across China from 2006 to 2019. The results showed that NTU significantly promoted the improvement of UCEE, and UCEE improved strongly during the later stage of NTU construction. In China's central and western cities, large cities, and non-natural resource–based cities, the promotion effect of NTU on UCEE was more significant. Overall, the economic agglomeration effect had the most significant influence, followed by the government leading effect and resource allocation effect. Moreover, the NTU pilot policies of civilized city, low-carbon city, innovative city, smart city, and green finance city significantly promoted the improvement of UCEE. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence for the effective achievement of the “dual carbon” goal with respect to NTU in China.}

This study aims to contribute to smart grid acceptance research by examining dynamic characteristics related to the acceptance. As a result of this study, we found that it is important to manage the risk of smart grids and we should try to minimize the gap between expectation and satisfaction.

This concern, a result of the emergence of digital technologies and convergence of different scientific disciplines is based on the ability of design tools to support and reinforce the discussion on urban landscape as an open process for action. The term “smart city” has been linked with digital applications, sensors, and software to define the city of the future. However, the real challenge is to develop a “smart city” that is based on the city of today and enables the integration of smart practices that may reform the spatial structure of the city. To this end the research focuses on the ways in which specific key concepts present a dynamic intervention tool leading to an instrumental and performative construction of a “smarter city”. Our goal, in an effort to manage the cities anew, or better yet, the “smarter cities” is the introduction of an experimental tool, which participates and supports the urban metabolism. This particular dynamic tool can act, in our opinion, as a filter which not only receives information but also checks if this information can be modified, while producing connections supported by algorithmic programs. At this level, this paper presents a method for approaching 3D models for n-dimensional hypercubes through polar zonohedra. The paper then goes on to present certain sections of the solids in question and the creation of tessellations on the plane in order to contribute to urban metabolism. Thus, a key element is the production of an IT infrastructure, which, through distributed computing systems and networks, may gather information, while taking into account the temporality of change evolution, adapting this information to the passage of time.}

To harness its full potential, it must be based upon a resilient network architecture with strong support for security, privacy, and trust. Most of these issues still remain to be addressed carefully for the IoT systems. Blockchain technology has recently emerged as a breakthrough technology with the potential to deliver some valuable properties such as resiliency, support for integrity, anonymity, decentralization, and autonomous control. A number of blockchain platforms are proposed that may be suitable for different use-cases including IoT applications. In such, the possibility to integrate the IoT and blockchain technology is seen as a potential solution to address some crucial issues. However, to achieve this, there must be a clear understanding of the requirements of different IoT applications and the suitability of a blockchain platform for a particular application satisfying its underlying requirements. This chapter aims to achieve this goal by describing an evaluation framework which can be utilized to select a suitable blockchain platform for a given IoT application.}

In spite of the availability of authentic research studies of smart wearables, there is still a lack of systematic review on the different aspects of smart wearables concept to find the current state of research, particularly from the perspective of IS field. Therefore, the predominant aim of this research is to review smart wearables literature, recent advances, and future challenges. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was conducted to explore smart wearables by reviewing previous studies from 2010 to 2019. For covering all related papers during these years, an integrated review protocol consisting of automatic and manual stages was pursued. 244 papers were identified to address smart wearables issues and challenges. According to the findings, it is observed that smart wearable studies have increased dramatically during the last years. Moreover, the results show that current studies covered different research themes which are related to smart wearables area, particularly user behavior, technology-focused, security and privacy, design, and social acceptability. Furthermore, based on the results of the weight analysis technique, perceived usefulness, attitude toward technology, social influence, and privacy concerns are identified as the best predictors of smart wearables adoption. Additionally, the results show that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the most commonly adopted theory in the smart wearable studies. The findings of this review would assist academics to realize the existing limitations and gaps as well as the future works for smart wearables research studies.}

Such technique is essential when a log, the set of records indicating the actual arrival and departure time of each bus or train at each station and also a critical component in reliability analysis of a transportation system, is missing partially or entirely. The procedure reconstructs each train as a sequence of the earliest exit times, called S-epochs, among its alighting passengers at each stations. The procedure first constructs a set of passengers, also known as reference passengers, whose routing choices are easily identifiable. The procedure then computes, from the exit times of the reference passengers, a set of tentative S-epochs based on a detection measure whose validity relies on an extreme-value characteristic of the platform-to-gate movement of alighting passengers. The tentative S-epochs are then finalized to be a true one, or rejected, based on their consistencies with bounds and/or interpolation from prescribed S-epochs of adjacent trains and stations. Tested on 12 daily sets of trains, with varying degrees of missing logs, from three entire metro lines, the method restored the arrival times of 95% of trains within the error of 24s even when 100% of logs was missing. The mining procedure can also be applied to trains operating under special strategies such as short-turning and skip-stop. The recovered log seems precise enough for the current reliability analysis performed by the city of Seoul.}

More specifically, the authors describes the various characteristics of smart work users and analyzes the effects of antecedents on the intention to use, and the usage behavior of smart work using the first nation-wide survey of smart work in the public sector. The findings reveal that the level of diffusion of smart work appears to be low in terms of number of the users. However, younger workers who have lower positions and shorter job tenures and workers in quasi-governmental organizations show relatively high levels of intention, and actually use smart work more frequently than other employee groups. Structural equation modeling shows that the perceived costs of commuting and business trips, work productivity and efficiency, and institutional and technological support have positive effects on smart work adoption by public employees. In contrast, social isolation and lack of communication, and unfriendly leadership and management associated with smart work have negative effects. Moreover, the intention to use smart work has a mediating effect on the relationships between the drivers/constraints and the usage behavior of smart work. Based on these results, theoretical and policy implications for the promotion of smart work are presented.}

Given the growing concern about heat stress, a planning method for managing shrinking cities is increasingly linked with improvement of urban thermal comfort. The purpose of this study is to identify policy implications for developing so-called “decline-oriented strategies” that help to mitigate heat stress. The article assesses the effects of three strategies: 1) demolition strategy of abandoned houses, 2) demolition and greening the site strategy, and 3) small-scale urban renewal strategy. Using ENVI-met, we performed a comparative analysis of the differences in thermal comfort levels associated with each strategy. The results showed that the pre-post differences in thermal comfort were statistically significant for each strategy. Overall, the demolition strategy without greening elevated the surface temperature due to more extensive open areas without shade, forming a heat stress zone around vacant lots. The greening strategy partly offset the adverse effects of the demolition strategy by providing a thermally pleasant environment. Finally, the small-scale urban renewal strategy improved the thermal environment and provided a potential cooling zone, which pedestrians and residents could utilize.}
