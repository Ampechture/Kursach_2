abstract = {Despite the efficient removal of many contaminants including pathogens and trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR), fate and transport of TOrCs in the subsurface might not always occur under conditions that favor effective biotransformation resulting in a contamination risk where water is recovered for drinking water production. A promising technology that can lead to improved removal of TOrCs is the sequential MAR technology (SMART), which combines two infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration to establish more favorable oxic and carbon-limited conditions resulting in enhanced TOrCs transformation. The aim of this study was to test the performance of the SMART concept under field conditions in comparison to a conventional MAR using pond infiltration (cMAR) operated in Berlin, Germany. Although oxic conditions were obtained at both field sites considering infiltration depth to 200 cm, redox conditions were more stable at the SMART facility fed with bank filtrate. In addition, carbon-limited conditions were solely observed during SMART. Chemicals known to persist during MAR, including candesartan, carbamazepine, dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine, olmesartan, oxypurinol, phenylethylmalonamide, primidone, and tolyltriazole exhibited a refractory behavior at both field sites, whereas valsartan acid, metformin, and gabapentin-lactam were removed by more than 85% during 200 cm of infiltration. 4-Formylaminoantipyrine, acesulfame, benzotriazole, and gabapentin exhibited a significantly enhanced transformation during SMART compared to the cMAR site. These results confirm that SMART can result in controlled oxic and carbon-depleted subsurface conditions during MAR facilitating an improved transformation of moderately degradable TOrCs by natural treatment processes.}

abstract = {Households are heterogeneous customers that consume different amounts of electricity for different purposes at different hours of the day. Understanding how the level and timing of electricity consumption is related to household characteristics is important in planning production and grid capacities and in designing policies. Linking Danish smart-meter data for 2017 to detailed household characteristics derived from administrative registers, we analyse how the level and profile of hourly electricity consumption is related to these characteristics. In addition, we examine to what extent having a flat rate for electricity implies cross-subsidies between residential customers in Denmark. We find that both the level and timing of consumption vary significantly with household characteristics, mainly the type of dwelling, its heating technology, its use of electric vehicles, and the number and age of the adults and children who live there, all of which affect the level and timing of consumption. Assuming hourly pricing with constant consumption rates, the average price per kWh paid by different categories of household varies only marginally. That is, the flat rate presently seen by Danish households implies limited cross-subsidies between groups of residential customers. Consequently, introducing real-time pricing for Danish residential customers should not pose serious redistribution concerns and would improve economic efficiency.}

abstract = {Context:
The demand for protection and security of physical spaces and urban areas increased with the escalation of terroristic attacks in recent years. We envision with the proposed cyber–physical systems and spaces, a city that would indeed become a smarter urbanistic object, proactively providing alerts and being protective against any threat.
Objectives:
This survey intend to provide a systematic multivocal literature survey comprised of an updated, comprehensive and timely overview of state of the art in counter-terrorism cyber–physical systems, hence aimed at the protection of cyber–physical spaces. Hence, provide guidelines to law enforcement agencies and practitioners providing a description of technologies and best practices for the protection of public spaces.
Methods:
We analyzed 112 papers collected from different online sources, both from the academic field and from websites and blogs ranging from 2004 till mid-2022.
Results:
(a) There is no one single bullet-proof solution available for the protection of public spaces. (b) From our analysis we found three major active fields for the protection of public spaces: Information Technologies, Architectural approaches, Organizational field. (c) While the academic suggest best practices and methodologies for the protection of urban areas, the market did not provide any type of implementation of such suggested approaches, which shows a lack of fertilization between academia and industry.
Conclusion:
The overall analysis has led us to state that there is no one single solution available, conversely, multiple methods and techniques can be put in place to guarantee safety and security in public spaces. The techniques range from architectural design to rethink the design of public spaces keeping security into account in continuity, to emerging technologies such as AI and predictive surveillance.}

To understand the institutional advantages of informal environmental regulation in environmental governance, it will be helpful to investigate if the Pollution Information Transparency Index (PITI) released by ENGOs in China can enhance air quality. Using the difference-in-difference (DID) method, this paper investigates the impact, effect mechanism, spillover and synergistic effect of PITI on PM2.5 concentration using a panel dataset of 284 cities in China from 2003 to 2019. The study indicates that (1) PITI significantly reduced PM2.5 concentrations in Chinese cities by 1.84%, a valid finding after instrumental variables and robustness tests. (2) PITI reduces PM2.5 concentrations primarily through increased media environmental concerns, government environmental governance, and corporate green innovation. (3) The majority of PITI's effect on PM2.5 concentrations comes from medium-sized, non-resource-based, non-old industrial, and energy- and emission-saving cities. (4) The impact of PITI on PM2.5 has a spillover effect that dramatically lowers PM2.5 concentrations in cities within the surrounding [0,1000] kilometers. (5) PITI reduces emissions and saves energy while synergies with command environmental regulations rather than market-based regulations. Findings provide a rationale for the importance of informal environmental regulation in environmental governance.}

However, there is a lack of understanding of the competency requirements to foster leadership capacity for digital innovation with social coherence and responsibility. Based on a socio-technical perspective, this paper presents a multi- and inter-disciplinary framework to identify and evaluate the competencies necessary for leading digital innovation in the built environment. The framework incorporates three dimensions: digital and technical, governance and management, and ethical and responsible innovation. A review of existing competency frameworks for digitalisation in the urban built environment is presented to identify competency gaps across the three dimensions. The results show that existing frameworks rarely strive for comprehensiveness and are limited in their scope to certain competencies along a single dimension. In addition, studies addressing the need for multi- and inter-disciplinary competencies across the three dimensions are lacking. The paper thus demonstrates that our three-pronged framework is a useful and much needed tool to identify competency requirements for local public, private and community stakeholders to steer place-based digital innovation and ensure public value creation.}

They allow indeed to selectively filter out near-infrared solar radiation passing through the window, thus blocking solar heat gain during hot summer days and increasing it over sunny winter days, whilst regulating the amount of daylight in an independent manner. We herein present advancements in the manufacturing and the performance of screen-printed dual-band electrochromic devices (herein referred as “plasmochromic”) embodying stable gel electrolytes. Particularly three different sets of polymeric hosts, respectively based on PMMA/PEO-, PVB- and PVDF, are characterized for such integration. Most suitable formulations have been adopted to manufacture and test up to 30 x 30 cm2-large smart window prototypes. Based on the values of TLUM, TSOL, and total solar heat gain coefficient (g-value) calculated from the measured transmittance and reflectance spectra, a preliminary assessment of the device optical and thermal performances for architectural integration in insulated glazing units is carried out, compared with the performances of competing commercially available solar control and smart glazing IGU. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed “plasmochromic” technology in reducing the energy consumption and maximizing both visual and thermal comfort in architectural glazing systems.}

Through a comparative analysis of smart energy pilots in Norway, Austria, and Denmark, the study shows that economic incentives under certain conditions influence energy-consuming practices of households but not in ways anticipated by widespread rational conceptualisations within economic, engineering, and policy-making approaches. The paper elaborates the practice-theoretical understanding of financial structures in smart energy interventions and identifies the socio-material configurations causing price to play a role. This informs policymakers and developers of future smart energy interventions. The overall policy recommendation of the paper is that smart energy designers, planners, and policymakers need to consider the complexity of interrelated elements that co-determine the effectiveness of price incentives. Thus, a successful coupling between price incentives and demand response actions can best be realised via a productive mixture of mutually supporting elements (engagements, devices, and competences). In addition, the paper provides specific recommendations related to the design of effective and workable price schemes that fit into the everyday lives of households.}

As part of the IoT umbrella, Vehicular ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) offer new communication and computing opportunities that traditional paradigms, such as Cloud Computing, are unable to solve, e.g. location-awareness, latency and capacity of detecting and acting in real time to unforeseen events. As a natural computing extension, Fog Computing can be the next requirement of VANETs, enabling the deployment of mobility-related applications and services. In this work we propose a generic architecture for the deployment of Fog Computing applications and services in a VANET environment. Moreover, we provide a proof-of-concept system to perform data analytics in a hybrid VANET/Fog environment. Our system is used by two Fog applications, one for city traffic anomaly detection, and another to estimate the bus time of arrival to feed traveller information. The reliability of such applications are validated through real mobility information from a large vehicular testbed currently deployed. The results show that using Fog Computing with a small set of recent regional data is very suitable for this type of applications, since the estimations of traffic anomalies and bus arrival times are very similar to those provided by the Cloud. Additionally, network performance results show that Fog applications can provide reliable information in a considerable shorter period of time, while at the same time they reduce the amount of traffic over the VANET backhaul infrastructure.}

To maintain the reliability of such power systems, more dependence is placed on automating the process controlling the physical system. Such power systems are known as smart grids, where data is transmitted in real-time across the power grid facilitating automated actions. These smart systems have intrinsic vulnerabilities. A smarter power grid is more reliant on an ICT backbone. Such reliance renders the physical power system subjected to an ICT realm whose security depends on a set of metrics, and standards alien to those of classical power systems. The sustainability of a power system will depend on the secure and reliable operation of the new smart system. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to solve the challenges enumerated above. The proposed approach sets the ground for new metrics of overall system sustainability, by dissecting the overall smart grid into three layers: the physical system, the SCADA system, and the ICT infrastructure. The proposed methodology is tested on the case of electric vehicles, where cyber intrusion scenarios are studied in light of their effect on the physical layer.}

A crucial point in the modern paradigm of smart cities is quality of life. To achieve quality of life for its citizens a smart city should establish ways to reduce alienation among the different groups that constitute city’s palimpsest. A way to achieve this goal is the knowledge of the different identities each citizens’ group have. Collective memory understanding of the different people groups is one of the basic vehicles towards this goal. In this paper, we attempt to give a first answer to such problems proposing and implementing specific services in the context of a crowdsourcing system for collective memory management using interactive maps.

This paper considers the role of universities as localisation growth enablers through their involvement in City Deals, which is assessed through an initial review of stakeholder analysis and university civic engagement and by a qualitative case study of City Deals in Newcastle, Aberdeen, Belfast, and Stirling. This research concludes that while universities participate in town and gown civic engagement to varying degrees, the ‘third mission’ where universities engage with societal needs and market demands by linking the university’s activity with its own socio-economic context (Pinto et al. 2016) is not a priority for UK universities in comparison with their teaching and research roles. Overall, the evidence points to City Deals providing an opportunity for universities to enhance their town and gown relationships especially through their role in innovation, as a ‘local leader,’ and as an engine for local economic development. However, the degree to which this is being delivered is variable, constrained by the configuration of each deal, the input of the university, and the financial risk/value for money which the university is willing to take.}

abstract = {Investigating congestion in train rapid transit systems (RTS) in today's urban cities is a challenge compounded by limited data availability and difficulties in model validation. Here, we integrate information from travel smart card data, a mathematical model of route choice, and a full-scale agent-based model of the Singapore RTS to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the congestion dynamics than can be obtained through analytical modelling alone. Our model is empirically validated, and allows for close inspection of the dynamics including station crowdedness, average travel duration, and frequency of missed trains—all highly pertinent factors in service quality. Using current data, the crowdedness in all 121 stations appears to be distributed log-normally. In our preliminary scenarios, we investigate the effect of population growth on service quality. We find that the current population (2 million) lies below a critical point; and increasing it beyond a factor of approximately 10% leads to an exponential deterioration in service quality. We also predict that incentivizing commuters to avoid the most congested hours can bring modest improvements to the service quality provided the population remains under the critical point. Finally, our model can be used to generate simulated data for statistical analysis when such data are not empirically available, as is often the case.}

Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful method for revealing hidden patterns or deducing correlations for which traditional treatment approaches face limitations or challenges. However, deep learning concepts and practices have not been widely utilized by researches in municipal solid waste management (MSWM). Herein, this research provides a critical review for deep learning and its application in MSWM. The framework and algorithms of a variety of deep learning methods have been compared and assessed. A body of deep learning applications have been reviewed according to their engagement in waste collection, transportation, and final disposal. Application of deep learning in MSWM stays in its infancy and requires great efforts for further development. The challenges and futures opportunities in the application of deep learning in the MSWM have been discussed to highlight the potential of deep learning in this field.}

Such complexity is also amplified by the need for the real-time response on the unexpected situations detected during the transportation phase (e.g. weather conditions, strikes, accidents). In a very demanding market, request for on-time cargo delivery, transport efficiency is a critical issue, and the ability for real-time detection and resolving of all possible obstacles and exceptions becomes a core competency for logistics operators. The work presented here introduces the concept of Smart Cargo, able to autonomously react to its context, find and understand alternatives, compute adaptive behavior, optimizing its own decisions. The Smart Cargo concept, implements a paradigm shift requiring taking the control of computing applications, data, and services away from some central nodes (the “cloud”) to the other logical extreme (the “fog”) of the Internet. Fog provides an intelligent connection of people, processes, data, and things, enabling Smart Cargo to go beyond the existing Intelligent Cargo concept. Fog computing is described here, as a necessary paradigm shift on distributed freight intelligence, allowing multimodal freight transport to achieve real-time situation awareness and reaction, planning with predictions and learning from the environment.}

Energy intensive industries, such as steel, cement, paper, and power plants, have great capacities to accept waste plastics and paper to substitute their fossil resource consumption and to reduce carbon emissions. We propose a “smart recycling system” that utilizes existing industrial facilities that have high energy efficiency, for establishing a cost-effective and robust recycling system. The core of the smart recycling system is the smart recycling center (SRC) that establishes a new recycling pathway connecting spatially diffuse municipal sources to facilities in energy intensive industries. This paper discusses the design and function of an SRC and estimates the CO2 emissions and costs related to the operation and construction of the SRC. We also evaluated the cost effectiveness of the smart recycling system, taking into account sorted collection, incineration, processes in the SRC, and processes in industrial facilities. We estimated that the system could result in a reduction of approximately 100kg of CO2 emissions per capita per year without a significant increase in cost.}

The approach presented in this paper employs a powerful embedded system to process the video images in real-time, so that the communication traffic is limited to the transmission of retrieved statistics. In order to fit into the limited resources and still allow vehicle size and speed measurements, special data representations and processing pipeline has to be used.

Water distribution networks cover both the built and natural realms and are as such inherently vulnerable to accidental or deliberate physical, natural, chemical, or biological threats. An example of such threats include flooding. The damage to water networks from flooding at the building level can include disrupted supply, pipe damage, sink and sewer overflows, fittings and appliance malfunctions etc. as well as the consequential socio-economic loss and distress. It has also been highlighted that the cost of damage caused by disasters including flooding can be correlated to the warning-time given before it occurs. Therefore, contiguous and continuous preparedness is essential to sustain disaster resilience. This paper presents an early stage review to: 1. Understand the challenges and opportunities posed by disaster risks to critical infrastructure at the building level. 2. Examine the role and importance of early warnings within the smart systems context to promote anticipatory preparedness and reduce physical, economic, environmental and social vulnerability 3. Review the opportunities provided by smart water microgrid/net to deliver such an early warning system and 4. Define the basis for a socially-integrated framework for resilience in building water networks based on smart water micro grids and micronets. The objective is to establish the theoretical approach for smart system integration for risk mitigation in water networks at the building level. Also, to explore the importance and scope integration of other social-political dimensions within such framework and associated solutions. The findings will inform further studies to address the gaps in understanding the disaster risks in micro water infrastructure e.g. flooding, and; to develop strategies and systems to strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response and anticipatory action for such risks.}

In China, SDR programs are instrumental in peak shaving, renewables integration, emissions reduction and grid reliability improvement.

Our work is distinguished from prior work by (a) comprehensively identifying China-specific SDR challenges, by contrasting these with international experience, (b) identifying effective drivers to overcome new market challenges, and (c) recommending policies and providing insights into China's future SDR development. Our paper identifies three major challenges for SDR development and adoption in China, namely, financial and market, consumer, and infrastructural challenges. In parallel, we identify drivers to overcome these challenges, including electricity market reform, introduction of new market entrants, and development of decentralized electricity systems. Finally, we put forth China-specific policy recommendations, including, continuous market reform, performance-based regulations for national utilities, a level playing field for new market entrants, and investments on consumer-based technologies. These measures aim to create equitable compensations to SDR, align the interests of utilities with SDR initiatives, provide incentives for consumer outreach, and improve the responsiveness of consumers to SDR signals.}

To examine the long-run trend of China's energy efficiency, this paper employs a distribution dynamics approach to analyze the convergence of total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) across 286 Chinese cities between 2002 and 2014. The result suggests the existence of convergence, which comes more from the efficiency declines in the high TFEE cities rather than the efficiency gains in the low TFEE cities. Despite the fact that a few cities have performed well in energy efficiency, the majority of cities have converged to a low-efficiency point. Further analyses show that the inefficiency was attributed to inefficient energy use in small- and medium-sized cities. Our analysis provides strong scientific support for China's ongoing energy conservation and environmental protection policies.}

There are relatively many studies on methods, technologies and architectures of industrial big data from the perspective of data flow. However, from the specific implementation path, there are relatively few studies on the general model and implementation framework of the application of industrial big data. In particular, around the detailed application scenarios, there is no clear implementation framework for top-level design and planning of big data, which can be customized in different industries. Therefore, the system model for I-BA (Industrial Big data Application) was studied by using the method of system engineering analysis, and a general reference model of I-BA was put forward. Further, a general reference architecture of implementation path for I-BA was proposed. Then, a quantitative model and method based on fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) for influencing factors of I-BA were proposed. Finally, a case study for I-BA in marine engineering field was given. It can provide theoretical basis for industry and government to plan, formulate and implement big data.

Addressing such bottleneck situations and including the EV driver perspective, we introduce a power allocation mechanism that considers the total travel time of the upcoming trip, consisting of actual driving time and time required for charging externally (including the detour to public charging facilities). Assuming that travel time generally negatively correlates with EV driver utility, our optimization model maximizes the resulting utility of EV drivers. Avoiding unnecessary external charging stops due to an insufficient state of charge at the time of departure, our approach generates travel time savings that increase overall EV driver utility. We illustrate our approach using exemplary cases.}

Various other automated appliances are emerging and being adopted in pursuit of the ‘smart home’. Current discourses include assumptions and explicit claims that smart homes will be energy efficient and therefore more environmentally sustainable. However, smart home technologies are also presented as affording lifestyle enhancements in the areas of comfort, cleanliness, convenience, entertainment and security. Focusing specifically on one smart device – the robovac – this paper aims to demonstrate how visions of cleanliness in the smart home could be counterproductive to energy reductions and household wellbeing. We draw on a content analysis of smart home marketing and articles, and conversational interviews (involving home tours) with early adopters of robovacs and smart home technologies in Australia. We find that these devices may escalate conventions of cleanliness in the home and invite supplementary energy consumption. The paper concludes by providing suggestions for how energy stakeholders can respond.}

In order to get a better understanding of ambient environments, adding semantics to sensor data plays a significant role. Researchers are attempting to build semantic models in order to satisfy their own requirements, which leads to little reusability between different models. This paper aims to provide a novel ontology which follows publicly acknowledged standards for achieving sensor data semantization in smart homes, including modeling sensors, context and activities with semantics. For keeping consistent with current accepted standards, the proposed ontology is based on the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. In addition, we enrich the ontologies by incorporating spatiotemporal information and user profiles. The ontology is designed using Protégé and a use case is demonstrated to show the great potentiality in daily activity recognition in smart homes.}

However, while cities are also targeting consumption-based emissions, whether their plans are sufficient to become climate neutral from both a territorial and a consumption-based perspective remains unclear. We designed a conceptual framework based on a literature review of urban climate mitigation and reviewed mitigation–related documents from nine Swedish cities. We found a strong political will and solid targets but gaps in the plans and actions mostly related to transport, construction and food. Municipal governments use “soft” policy instruments to meet climate targets; at times, economic instruments contradict the vision. Our evaluation indicates a disconnect between intent and outcomes. More regulatory instruments must be deployed to become climate-neutral, and economic incentives must be aligned with the vision. Understanding how climate mitigation strategies affect resources within the city will be necessary to ensure the acceptance and uptake of climate action plans. Collaboration with superordinate governments, within and outside national borders, will be essential to align on policy and policy instruments.}

Thus, an accurate, objective gait classification system has the potential to facilitate earlier diagnosis and improved clinical decision-making. Systems using smart garments represent an emerging technology for physical activity assessment and that may be relevant for gait classification. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of one such system – comprised of commercial instrumented socks and a custom instrument shirt – for differentiating among normal gait and four distinct simulated gait abnormalities. Eleven participants completed an experiment in which they completed several gait trails on a single day. Gait types were classified using diverse modeling approaches (K-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analyses, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks). High classification accuracy could be obtained, both when classification models were developed and tested using data from each participant separately and grouped together, particularly using the k-nearest neighbor method (>98% accuracy). Some gaits were more often “confused” with other gaits, especially when they shared underlying kinematic aspects. These results support the potential of using “smart” garments for detecting and identifying abnormal gaits, and for future implementation in diagnosis and rehabilitation.}

However, the current cost of active thin film windows is approximately 10 times that of passive film windows. This paper proposes an inexpensive passive thin metal film for all-season energy savings. The proposed passive thin metal film allows heat to flow preferentially in one direction. Thin metal films attached to glass indoor can absorb solar heat and the solar can radiate the heat to a room and to the glass respectively until thermal equilibrium. Because of the heated metal film against the room, as long as the temperature of the film is higher than that of the room, there is no heat flux from the room to the thin metal film which is called perfect thermal insulation. The 960m2 film was installed in an actual hotel in Japan over 10 years and contributed to reducing the energy cost of air conditioning from 54 million yen to 43 million yen, demonstrating an annual energy savings of 11 million yen (US$0.1 million). This paper briefly describes how the proposed economical passive thin metal film will provide all-season energy savings.}

This paper draws attention toward how cities thrust on certain areas as unique selling points through place branding, destination marketing and management to mark their presence on the global map as well as hope to improve economic potentialities to steer urbanization. Such imaginations not only galvanize new areas of economic activities but also change social, economic and political geography of a city. Myopic planning propels immense construction, often ‘unauthorized’ and ‘illegal’ in the absence of adequate policy and estimation of required resources. On the other side, citizens aspire to enhance employment opportunities and create a business ecosystem. Such aspirations and projections knit and cast dual-interfaced tourism urbanization that co-produce space in cities. Amidst all these activities, the city acquires a form which is antithetical to the imaginations of a vibrant and sustainable tourist city.}

However, most BSP studies focus only on the socio-economic characteristics of the users, bike-sharing patterns, and impacts that influence bike-sharing demand. This study increases the knowledge on BSPs by presenting a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach that is based on multi-phase quality function deployment. This approach covers the performance evaluation of smart BSPs allowing for customer voices under uncertain conditions. This method combines the fuzzy best-worst method (BWM), fuzzy maximizing deviation method (MDM), and fuzzy multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA). It uses fuzzy BWM to determine priorities of customer requirements and company strategies and to obtain subjective importance coefficients of criteria. Fuzzy MDM is used to derive objective importance coefficients of criteria and fuzzy MULTIMOORA is used to rank alternatives in terms of each criterion. An empirical case in Changsha, which is one of the pilot areas for comprehensively supporting the reform for an environment-friendly and resource-conserving society ("two-oriented society") in China, is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed framework. Results can help enterprises and organizations improve their performance and provide high-quality products and services for customers.}

In this era of rapid technological advances, these applications have become one of the primary tools we use daily both in our personal and professional lives. The applications play key roles in facilitating many applications that are pivotal in our today's society including communication, education, business, entertainment, medical, finance, travel, utilities, social, and transportation. This paper reviewed the opportunities and challenges of the applications related to transportation. The opportunities revealed include route planning, ridesharing/carpooling, traffic safety, parking information, transportation data collection, fuel emissions and consumption, and travel information. The potential users of these applications in the field of transportation include (1) transportation agencies for travel data collection, travel information, ridesharing/carpooling, and traffic safety, (2) engineering students for field data collection such as travel speed, travel time, and vehicle count, and (3) general traveling public for route planning, ridesharing/carpooling, parking, traffic safety, and travel information. Significant usage of smart mobile applications can be potentially very beneficial, particularly in automobile travel mode to reduce travel time, cost, and vehicle emissions. In the end this would make travel safer and living environments greener and healthier. However, road users' interactions with these applications could manually, visually, and cognitively divert their attention from the primary task of driving or walking. Distracted road users expose themselves and others to unsafe behavior than undistracted. Road safety education and awareness programs are vital to discourage the use of applications that stimulate unsafe driving/walking behaviors. Educating the traveling public about the dangers of unsafe driving/walking behavior could have significant safety benefits to all road users. Future research needs to compare accuracies of the applications and provide guidelines for selecting them for certain transportation related applications.}

An advantage of this metric is its capacity to assist in this task. Its usefulness is also complemented with a planning tool that enables us to assess the effects of each technology under potential scenarios. This information is useful for planning projects, allowing us to make the most appropriate decisions each moment. Ultimately, this usefulness is clearly demonstrated through two case studies.}

Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has become popular in smart buildings because of its low cost and reasonable privacy. In this paper, a non-intrusive monitoring method for the cooling load of smart buildings is proposed based on random forest. The total building cooling load is disaggregated into four subloads, and two approaches are used to realize the NILM based on the direct or indirect cooling load using a Fourier transform. The proposed method is implemented in an office building, and results show the method can realize cooling load disaggregation accurately. The root-mean-square errors and mean relative errors of the four subloads between the NILM loads and reference loads are less than 51.9 kW and 19.1%. Among the four subloads, the equipment load can be disaggregated with the highest accuracy. Approach I is recommended because of its higher accuracy. The NILM method is optimized in terms of the estimator number, maximum depth, feature number, minimum samples for a split, minimum sample leaf, and size of training samples. The performance of the optimized NILM models is improved with RMSEs and MREs less than 48.3 kW and 6.4%.}

In our previous work (Wang et al., 2021), we designed and implemented a drone-based wake-up and data collection system for smart meters by using wake-up radios (WuR) and WiFi. Using this system, in this work we use the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to train and periodically re-train the drone agent so that it can optimally collect the data of smart meters deployed on a field. For a specific neighborhood, our method uses the results of many real-life wireless transmission measurements in the neighborhood as the initial input to the DRL method. As a result, the trained agent can direct the drone to finish the data collection task of the neighborhood more efficiently. We used the actions recommended by the trained agent to direct the drone to collect the data of ten smart meters deployed on our campus. Experimental results show that the trained agent enabled the drone to finish the data collection task with a much shorter flying distance, as compared with other methods that do not consider real-life neighborhood-specific geographic effects on wireless communication. For example, compared with a greedy method, our method without re-training the drone agent can reduce 19.7% of the flying distance. In each real-life data collection task, our method also records the actual wake-up and data collection success/failure results of all smart meters and periodically uses a batch of these data to re-train the drone agent. Experimental results show that such a periodic re-training design can continue to improve the performance of the drone agent for a specific neighborhood. For example, compared with our method without re-training the drone agent, our method with re-training the drone agent can further reduce 14.6% of the flying distance.}

The agenda of UN 2030 for the transport system will be accomplished with the assistance of digital technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). The implementation of these digital technologies on highways empowers to provide reliable, smarter, intelligent, and renewable energy sources experience to the users travelling along the highways. This study discusses the significance of the digitalization of highways that supporting and realizing a sustainable environment on the highways. To discuss the significance of digitalization, the study has categorized digitalization into five subcomponents namely smart highway lighting system, smart traffic and emergency management system, renewable energy sources on highways, smart display and AI in highways. An architecture-for smart highway lighting, smart traffic, and emergency management are proposed and discussed in the study. The significance of implementing smart display boards and renewable sources with real-time applications is also addressed in this study. Moreover, the integration of AI in highways is addressed with the perspective of enhancing road safety. The integration of deep learning (DL) in the edge-based vision node for predicting the patterns of traffic flow, highway road safety, and maintenance of quality roads have been addressed in the discussion section. Embedding the deep learning techniques in the vison node at the traffic junction and the highway lighting controller is able to deliver an intelligent system that provides sustained experience and management of the highways. Smart reflectors, adoption of renewable energy, developing vehicle-to-vehicle communication in vehicles, and smart lamppost are the few recommendations for the implementation of digitalizing highways.}

abstract = {Travel Diary Survey (TDS) collects comprehensive attributes such as sociodemographic attributes, trip purpose, and trip chain attributes of the trips taken by a small portion of the general population every few years. Meanwhile, smart cards (SC) gather all transit passenger time-space movements on a daily basis, which represent trip chain attributes. However, qualitative attributes such as sociodemographic attributes and trip purpose are unknown. This study proposed a novel method to estimate the trip purpose and sociodemographic attributes of SC data by using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). With an efficient network structure that considers the spatial and sequential dependencies of a trip chain, the proposed CGAN is able to impute the sociodemographic attributes and trip purpose of SC data by mimicking the TDS data using adversarial training. Also, unlike the other generative models, the proposed CGAN can fully leverage the large-scale SC data in training, which allow sidestepping overfit to the TDS data. Evaluation results show that CGAN outperforms other generative models, i.e., Bayesian networks, Gibbs sampler, conventional CGAN, and a conditional variational autoencoder. Considerable performance improvement was achieved by both network structure that can consider spatial and sequential dependencies, and modeling framework that utilize the large-scale SC data. Several metrics were employed to evaluate fidelity, diversity, and creativity, and these verified that the existing generative models tend to overfit the marginal or bivariate distributions of training data. The proposed method addresses the incompleteness of passively collected mobile data. The imputed SC data representing comprehensive travel attributes is valuable for an activity-based model and behavior analysis, because it provides travel information that is more dynamic, continuous, and extensive.}

Recommendations have long been a means of helping users select services. In a smart city environment, recommendation algorithms should take into account the user’s context in order to gain in accuracy. What is the context of a smart city user and how can it be captured? In this chapter, we answer these two questions. After specifying what we understand by context information, we show how the city’s mobility pattern can be used to infer rich contextual information. The main objective of our project will be finally to recommend services according to an estimated trajectory of a user in the smart city. For the application domains that we wish to consider in the future, we have emergency situation and crisis management which are among the most crucial dimensions of smart and future city design.}

The concept goal of the smart grid along with the future deployment of the EVs puts forward various challenges in terms of electric grid infrastructure, communication and control. Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the EVs into the electric grid is presented. Various EV smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of EVs in the energy market can compensate for the fluctuations of the electric grid. In this context, a literature review on the integration of the renewable energy and the latest feasible solution using EVs with the insight of the promising research gap to be covered up are investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of the smart V2G system is thoroughly discussed. In this paper, the EVs interactions with the smart grid as the future energy system model are extensively discussed and research gap is revealed for the possible solutions.}

Technology has been revolutionized over recent years and now, matured with mass production allowing wider uptake of methods and devices. The current situation in the water domain is characterized by a low level of maturity concerning standardization of ICT solutions and business processes. The massive and rapid spread of communicating devices within the Society and their application to the industrial sectors is not coordinated. The only relevant angle for the development of these technologies (M2M) within the water domain has to be based on the identification of the added value provided in each business process by the introduction of the new solutions. In order to identify which and how ICT solutions can be implemented, it is necessary to look at the water cycle through an approach based on functional domains and business processes. The water uses are associated to business processes and are linked to economical and social values. The final step of the approach is then to identify for each business process how ICT solutions can be implemented and provide added value. This diagnostic has to be shared by professionals and operators in order to ensure a coherent deployment. The motivation of the @qua entity (www.a-qua.org) which gathers major actors from water and ICT domains, is now to ensure this role at the interface with the different actors of the water domain and to elaborate a consistent vision for the future of ICT solutions within the water domain.}

Because of the complex dynamic response of the SmDs and the whole system, an exact estimation of the time-varying control signal is difficult. Especially, the reality has shown that i) the error of the inverse SmDs (I-SmDs) due to noise in the measurement database used to build them may fade the control efficiency, and ii) for many high nonlinear systems, fractional-order derivative (FD)-based mathematical description could reflect their characteristics, attributes, and dynamic behaviors better than that using the integer-order-derivative-based traditional way. From the above aspects, we present an FD-based new control system for the half-car semi-active suspension system with MRDs. The proposed control system named FD-SMC consists of I-SmDs which are relied on measured data processed by the new filter CoFilter presented in Part 1 and FD-based sliding mode control (SMC) technique. The FD-SMC determines the control force, and subsequently, I-SmDs estimates current intensity applied to MRDs to generate the desired control forces. Surveys including a real application using an experimental apparatus are carried out to verify the control effectiveness of the proposed method as well as the possibility of development of this orientation.}

There has been a structural change in mobility in major Spanish cities in recent decades, with a switch to the pattern followed in other countries in the area. A shift has taken place from a traditional Mediterranean model to a North American city stereotype, with uncontrolled motorization and major implications for public health. This article specifically analyzes negative road safety-related externalities that result from this process, given that the trend seems to show a steady decline in road safety accidents on urban roads in Spain, with major differences among NUTS-3 provinces. The objective is to evaluate the factors that empirically explain these differences for the 2003–2013 period using a panel data analysis. Results show that a key role is played by urban development variables, such as population density and improvements in health services, with advances linked to more accessible and sustainable urban transportation, such as the Smart City concept. Not only does this article close a gap in the literature, but the findings can also serve as a practical guide for the development and implementation of urban mobility and road safety plans, and reveals the special needs of the most vulnerable groups.}

The main innovation relies on a matrix-based control system where the strategy considers individual and community priorities simultaneously. Through the individual energy flexibility and the community energy pool, the aggregated network energy supply is controlled and shaped. The presented model presents a generalized structure based on control volumes, and it can be universally applied to energy communities of different sizes, number of participants, energy carriers, penetration of photovoltaics, and electric vehicles. The predictive system is conceived from a recurrent neural network, which performs a real-time prediction on energy demands in buildings. Suitable energy flows optimization is also presented with different implications for economic and energy savings. Finally, to show the potential of the developed model, a suitable case study analysis is presented. Important results include the achievement of a typical win-win condition, where both the distribution system operator and final customers benefit from this strategy. Specifically, a reduction of energy demand during demand response events of about 21% is achieved, whereas the interaction with the electricity network decreases of about 15%.}

Owing to the dynamics of travel demand in China, the spatial patterns of aviation emissions are difficult to foresee or simulate in scenario analysis. To address this issue, we predicted the spatial patterns of aviation carbon emissions in China at the city level using projected gridded population data and power law model. The results show that China's civil aviation sector will have a cumulative emission abatement potential of 7027 million tons from 2020 to 2060 if all abatement measures can be implemented. The contribution of individual cities was quantified based on expected changes in population, airport planning, and economic development. Megacities and metropolitan cities will contribute to 58.1 % and 26.2 % of the total emission abatement, respectively. The eastern, central, and western regions of China will contribute to 64.2 %, 15.8 %, and 20.0 % of the total abatement, respectively. The abatement potentials before and after 2040 are expected to account for 20.0 % and 80.0 % of the whole from 2020 to 2060. Therefore, some regions and cities can be regarded as key or pilot areas to implement abatement measures. Finally, policy implications of the results are presented.}

The potential of this technology is evident in different domains. In Cultural Heritage (CH), it may enhance access to CH collections, in order to ensure a more engaging visit experience and to increase the appropriation of CH content by visitors. So far, research on IoT has primarily focused on technical features of smart objects (e.g., how to program sensors and actuators), while there are very few approaches trying to facilitate the adoption of such a technology by end users. This lack limits the social and practical benefits of IoT; it creates barriers in all those usage scenarios where people would like to define the behavior of smart objects but they might not have the required programming skills. This is becoming evident in CH sites, where different stakeholders would benefit from managing ecosystems of interoperable smart objects to create enhanced visit experiences. This article presents a visual composition paradigm that allows non-programmers to synchronize the behavior of smart objects, thus determining more engaging user experiences. It discusses how the paradigm suites the need of curators and guides of CH sites to define smart visit experiences through which visitors can acquire CH content by interacting with the surrounding environment and the smart objects included in it. A serious game designed with professional guides of CH sites is used as a case study to show the potential of the presented approach.}

Smart healthcare is becoming a field of remarkable transformations and growth in the new era of smart cities and digitally interconnected societies. In smart healthcare systems, multiple sensors, devices, and sources are interconnected through networks and collect valuable data that gives insights about the patient’s health status and ongoing health trends. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept that represents the identifiable sensors, devices, and sources connected to the internet and that can be utilized in various automated patient monitoring applications to provide remote healthcare services. This article aims to provide an IoHT driven deep learning-based system for non-invasive patient discomfort detection. The developed system comprises of an RGB camera device to identify discomfort in a patient’s body instead of utilizing any wearable sensors or devices. In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient’s body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient’s body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient’s discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient’s body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished. Different video sequences are used for experimental evaluations; results reveal the effectiveness of the developed system by achieving a True Positive Rate of 95% with a 6% False Positive Rate.}

However, these benefits are unlikely to be realised if the social implications of these technological innovations are not adequately considered by those who promote them. Big Data applications are intrinsically socio-technical; their development and deployment are a product of social interactions between people, institutional and regulatory settings, as well as the technology itself. This paper explores the socio-technical factors and conditions that influence the development of Smart Farming and Big Data applications, using a multi-level perspective on transitions combined with social practice theory. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 Australian grain farmers and industry stakeholders to elicit their perspectives on benefits and risks of these changes. The analysis shows that issues related to trust are central concerns for many participants. These include procedural concerns about transparency and distributional concerns about who will benefit from access to and use of “farmers’ data”. These concerns create scepticism about the value of ‘smart’ technologies amongst some industry stakeholders, especially farmers. It also points to a divergence of expectations and norms between actors and institutions at the regime and niche levels in the emerging transition towards Smart Farming. Bridging this divide will require niche level interventions to enhance the agency of farmers and their local networks in these transactions, and, the cooperative design of new institutions at regime level to facilitate the fair and transparent allocation of risk and benefit in farming data information chains.}

While prior health crises, such as SARS, impacted the transportation sector, the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, resulting in exceptional impacts on this sector. Canadian Civil Aviation activities dropped by 71%, compared to business as usual, whereas military aviation activities declined by 27%. As of the end of June 2020, cities with higher than 50% mobility index include Brussels, Singapore, Stockholm, Lyon, Paris, Moscow, and Hong Kong with the highest mobility index of 76%. American cities have the lowest mobility indexes as of the end of June with mobility indexes lower than 20%. It is expected and reasonable to assume that the public’s response to COVID-19 will exceed that of SARS. While Britons and Canadians are the biggest supporters of keeping the economy and businesses shut until COVID-19 is fully contained, the Chinese, Russians, Indians, and Italians find it vital to restart the economy regardless. Results show that the majority of the world is in a state of mental distress and will face nervousness and anxiety issues post-COVID-19. This sentiment is strongest in India, Japan, China, the U.K., Brazil and Canada, ranging between 68% and 78%. The trucking industry is the main contributor to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the Canadian transportation sector, accounting for more than 62% of the total emissions in 2019. Given the impact of COVID-19, forecasted GHG emissions of the Canadian transportation sector for 2020is evaluated to be 93 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.}

abstract = {The growth of world population and tremendous urbanization initiatives has posed an important challenge to sustainable agriculture. To efficiently utilize the land to yield maximum produce, IoT based smart agriculture monitoring systems are an absolute necessity today. The sensing and actuator modules deployed as part of such systems are responsible for water management, soil quality monitoring and of course prediction of the safety and quality of the produce. Incorporating cloud servers and edge devices to such IoT based system through a three tier architecture can provide correct prediction performances and even real time monitoring with less Internet traffic. Vertical farming is another important direction where such monitoring systems can be highly beneficial. In this chapter, an overview of such smart agricultural systems is presented along with important research challenges, architectures and case studies. Open research problems in this field are also discussed to motivate researchers in this field.}

The vehicle data (set of images) is first collected, from which the noise (set of outlier images) is removed using the SIFT extractor. The region convolution neural network is then used to detect the vehicles. We propose a new hyper-parameters optimization model based on evolutionary computation that can be used to tune parameters of the deep learning framework. The proposed solution was tested using the well-known boxy vehicle detection data, which contains more than 200,000 vehicle images and 1,990,000 annotated vehicles. The results are very promising and show superiority over many current state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime and accuracy performances.}

Such decentralization has a great impact on the way personal information generated and consumed by smart objects should be protected, because, without centralized data management, it is more difficult to control how data are combined and used by smart objects. To cope with this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework where users of smart objects can specify their privacy preferences. Compliance check of user individual privacy preferences is performed directly by smart objects. Moreover, acknowledging that embedding the enforcement mechanism into smart objects implies some overhead, we have extensively tested the proposed framework on different scenarios, and the obtained results show the feasibility of our approach.}

This study identified the spatial differentiation of influencing factors of agricultural carbon productivity at the city level in Taihu lake basin, and formed differentiated agricultural management strategies. The results show that: (1) Spatial differentiation of agricultural carbon productivity is obvious at city level. It can be divided into three echelons: the first echelon is Shanghai and Hangzhou (agricultural carbon productivity≥10,000 Yuan/t in 2019 with a growth rate ≥ 600% compared with 1992), the second echelon is Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou (9000 Yuan/t ≤ agricultural carbon productivity<10,000 Yuan/t in 2019 with 381% ≤ growth rate < 600% compared with 1992), and the third echelon is Zhenjiang, Huzhou and Jiaxing (agricultural carbon productivity<9000 Yuan/t in 2019 or a growth rate < 381% compared with 1992). (2) There is a synergetic evolution law between agricultural carbon productivity and agricultural economy, that is, agricultural economic development level is the first factor affecting agricultural carbon productivity, whether in the whole basin or in the city level. (3) There are significant differences in the influencing factors of agricultural carbon productivity at the city level. Finally, according to the spatial differentiation characteristics of influencing factors of agricultural carbon productivity at the city level in Taihu lake basin, we put forward different emphases of agricultural development in different cities.}

Due to the increasingly serious aging problem around the world, smart homes for elder healthcare have become an important IoT-based application, which not only enables elders’ health to be properly monitored and taken care of, but also allows them to live more comfortably and independently in their houses. However, elders’ privacy might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network communication. To show that elders’ privacy could be substantially exposed, in this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders’ movement activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS in deducing and disclosing elders’ privacy, which might be maliciously exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.}

However, there is no relevant research based on the agricultural supply chain to explore the problems in the process of APM currently. There is also no literature to construct a problem identification model to provide guidance for corporate practice and provide suggestions for the government to issue encouraging policies. In order to fill the gaps, this paper adopts grounded theory method, interviews 24 business managers who carry out APM through a combination of personal in-depth interviews and focus group interviews, uses continuous comparative analysis ideas, and continuously refines and revises theories, and innovatively proposes an identification model of APM based on supply chain. It found that the four main categories of supply chain coordination, production resource support, scientific and technological equipment and structural system construction are the problems that hinder APM. Based on the problem identification model, this paper puts forward suggestions for the better development of APM from two aspects: corporate practice and government policy.}

Taking into account that cross-channel consumers are driven by different motivations, the influence of shopping motivations is controlled. The results of an experiment in the fashion industry show that webroomers have greater perceptions of time/effort savings and of making the right purchase, and greater smart shopping feelings, than showroomers. Furthermore, webrooming leads to higher personal attribution than showrooming, meaning that consumers feel responsible and in control of their purchase outcomes. Personal attribution then mediates the impact of webrooming on smart shopping feelings. Although companies may have difficulties in tracking consumers’ use of online and offline channels, their enhanced control over the process may improve their experience through smart shopping perceptions and feelings.}

The adoption of innovations is often conceptualized in terms of technology diffusion, the success or failure of the new technology depending on how it is able to move across a market. It is taken as given that novel technologies diffuse from innovators to the mass market – a transfer in which non-use is thought to disappear over time. The article challenges the received approach to non-use, building on a typology by Satchell and Dourish, who suggest that non-use is more than lagging adoption: it can also manifest as active resistance, disenchantment, disenfranchisement, disinterest and displacement. The article draws on a survey carried out in Finland in 2013. We proceed from examining the non-adoption of smart energy services to analysing the attitudes linked to the many types of non-use. Thereafter, we will consider forms of non-use that are closely linked to assets and housing. We find that in the case of smart energy services the most important dimensions of non-use are disinterest and disenchantment, alongside lagging adoption. Moreover, disenfranchisement also has a role in explaining non-use.}

Several electrical household devices with various performances work in smart homes. These variances are defined as the positions of the electrical devices. In the current study, a practical mixed method is suggested for load disaggregation of the electrical devices. A highly precise model of the Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) is applied for electrical device positions simulating. In the proposed method, the present position of every electrical device is obtained and available in the dataset. Then, the distinct suitable positions for the following instant are supplied. To obtain the best approximation of positions, it is reported to the Improved Prey–Predator Optimization Algorithm (IPPOA). Additionally, three restraints are applied in IPPOA for better adjusting the position matrix. The first one is that every electrical device must possess one position at any stage. Second, regarding the continuous active electrical household devices is necessary. Third, the FHMM should be implemented for load model generation. In terms of the third restraint, the assessed databanks and the computation period are notably decreased owing to the utilization of the FHMM. The quickness and precision of the answers for useful data of six smart homes are evaluated against other techniques to confirm the efficiency of the proposed technique.}

The warehouse processes affected and potential influences of the technologies on warehouse management and operations are described. This chapter focuses on one of the most important process steps in the smart warehouse, order-picking, which is currently subject to major developments and transformations. Using a technological grid, four types of order-picking system are derived, which systematize how technologies can support human operators in warehouses to reduce physical workload and/or improve cognitive ergonomics. The four system types are classified based on supportive (digital) and substitutive (automation) technologies. The impacts of increased digitalization in warehouses on the physical, cognitive, perceptual, and psychosocial human factors are examined from a sociotechnical perspective. These manifold influences are exemplified for the case of a collaborative order-picking system and broken down using an analysis framework that can be used for the systematic development of sociotechnical systems in the digitalization of the supply chain.}

In the UK, about 29% of the current train fleets are run solely on diesel fuel, and the UK Government has pledged to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040. One option to achieve this ambitious goal is replacing diesel trains with hybrid trains. However, little has been done to evaluate the operational performance of replacing diesel trains with hybrid trains on the same track. This paper develops a novel Hybrid Train Simulator which can analyse the driving performance and energy flow among multiple energy sources (diesel, hydrogen and battery). Several practical case studies are presented based on typical mainline railways in the UK. Operation performance using diesel trains and hybrid trains is compared. This paper also proposes automatic smart switching control between multiple power sources according to the altitude of the route for hybrid trains. The case studies indicate that hybrid trains increase the journey time due to their low power capacity but improve energy efficiency significantly. Besides, implementing auto-switching on hybrid trains can reduce energy consumption by 6% compared with benchmark hybrid trains.}

Large energy use places a burden on such centers. In this perspective, smart grids are a new technology and a new generation of traditional electric networks that provide increased efficiency, dependability, and energy management based on demand optimization. The importance of smart grids can also be seen in the possibility of integrating communication systems for energy demand forecasting, to provide an optimal management of the combination of renewable energies and production centers energy. The authors present a comparative analysis of several deep learning models, notably Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures such as basic RNN, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), in this paper. These architectures are trained and tested on the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project’s energy datasets (2010–2014) and assessed using a variety of indicators such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error MAE, and R2 scores in order to analyze, compare and ultimately choose the most efficient model. As expected from the literature of RNN architectures, with the lowest value of RMSE error and the highest value of R2 Score among the three architectures, GRU outperformed both of basic RNN and LSTM, this result can be explained by several reasons the most important one is the ability of the GRU model to deal with the vanishing gradient problem and the impact of the number of parameters, used in building such a model, on the same problem.}

However, the technology employed greatly increases the risks to children’s privacy, which does not seem to have become a real concern for toy makers. We investigated this issue through a study driven by two major research questions: which are the major smart toys-related children’s privacy risks and which are the major mitigation so to such risks. To answer these questions, we conducted a scoping review. As a result, we selected 26 primary studies and elaborated two classifications of risks and proposed solutions – technical and domain-specific. The most mentioned technical risk is data disclosure, while from a domain-specific perspective there is much concern on the children’s physical and psychological safety. From a mitigation standpoint, many recommendations and solutions have been proposed, but without a more common type of contribution. As a main conclusion, we observed that toy makers and privacy regulations are not yet ready regarding children’s privacy for a more active smart toys market.}

The proposed framework comprises a community-level power flow-based model to solve the energy procurement problem of the community and a building-level physics-aware simulation model to estimate a set of day-ahead aggregate load scenarios with potential joint-flexibilities. At the building-level, a least-cost multi-objective optimization provides a sequence of optimal temperature setpoints for all thermal zones that is fed into an accurate Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to estimate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load trajectories while considering human comfort, occupancy patterns, building thermal response, and intraday electricity prices. The community-level model co-optimizes day-ahead schedules of shared distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicle (EV) chargings while directing the building cluster to adapt the joint-flexibilities to balance the community network under different operation conditions. Finally, a test building cluster located in Qatar University is investigated through several case studies. The simulation results reveal the model’s practicality in fully capturing the joint-flexibilities of the building cluster for an adaptable community operation which cuts the operation cost by 21.04%.}

abstract = {Solar power forecast is a much needed means for grid operators, particularly in residential microgrids, to manage the produced energy in a dispatchable fashion. Deterministic methods are unable to accurately forecast the intermittent solar power generation since they depend on unique sets of inputs and outputs. Therefore, stochastic methods and artificially intelligent (AI) strategies are utilized for solar power forecast. In this work, a neural network (NN)-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) model is developed for a residential microgrid in San Diego, California considering all key weather parameters such as cloud coverage, dew point, solar zenith angle, precipitation, humidity, temperature, and pressure in the year 2016. The developed weather model is then used to predict the generated power in the residential smart microgrid. To validate the accuracy of the model, the solar irradiance and generated solar power in the residential microgrid are predicted for the year 2017 using the obtained NN-based model. The results are compared with the actual solar irradiance and power in 2017 to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the developed model. Furthermore, to showcase the effectiveness of neural networks in forecasting solar power and the accuracy of the NN-based model, the results are compared with those of two other methods including multi-variable regression (MVR) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean squared error (MSE) criteria.}

The important findings of this paper include: (1) The UGLUE of resource-based cities in China has experienced a trend of first fluctuating and then improving. However, there are obvious regional differences. The UGLUE in the eastern and western regions are higher than those in the central and northeastern regions. (2) Industrial upgrading, financial development and technological innovation are key factors affecting UGLUE in resource-based cities. (3) There is significant heterogeneity in the impact of different factors in different city types, different regions and different time periods.

These challenges are related to an increase in the energy demand of cities, which is still met by non-renewable energy sources that release CO2 into the atmosphere. A carbon-free economy should be planned in a sustainable way by utilizing renewable energy sources and sustainable technologies. In this context, planning and implementing a hydrogen economy can be one solution to prevent these problems; sustainable urban planning has become a more complex issue, considering all these problems together. The main objectives in doing the present study are twofold, namely: (i) to provide an overview of the current status of hydrogen city projects and (ii) a conceptual hydrogen city planning model is presented for policy and decision makers. In this study, the initial hydrogen city projects are reviewed and summarized. And a conceptual hydrogen city planning model is presented for minimizing the carbon footprint of the cities. As can be concluded based on the status of the initial hydrogen city projects, which have been investigated and presented, these projects need more time to complete by considering the energy efficient technology.}

abstract = {The collection of origin–destination data for a city is an important but often costly task. This way, there is a need to develop more efficient and inexpensive methods of collecting information about citizens’ travel patterns. In this line, this paper presents a generic methodology that allows to infer the origin and destination zones for an observed trip between two public transport stops (i.e., bus stops or metro stations) using socio-economic, land use, and network information. The proposed zonal inference model follows a disaggregated Logit approach including size variables. The model enables the estimation of a zonal origin–destination matrix for a city, if trip information passively collected by a smart-card payment system is available (in form of a stop-to-stop matrix). The methodology is applied to the Santiago de Chile’s morning peak period, with the purpose of serving as input for a public transport planning computational tool. To estimate the model, information was gathered from different sources and processed into a unified framework; data included a survey conducted at public transport stops, land use information, and a stop-to-stop trip matrix. Additionally, a zonal system with 1176 zones was constructed for the city, including the definition of its access links and associated distances. Our results shows that, ceteris paribus, zones with high numbers of housing units have higher probabilities of being the origin of a morning peak trip. Likewise, health facilities, educational, residential, commercial, and offices centres have significant attraction powers during this period. In this sense, our model manages to capture the expected effects of land use on trip generation and attraction. This study has numerous policy implications, as the information obtained can be used to predict the impacts of changes in the public transport network (such as extending routes, relocating their stops, designing new routes or changing the fare structure). Further research is needed to improve the zonal inference formulation and origin–destination matrix estimation, mainly by including better cost measures, and dealing with survey and data limitations.}

The work presented here considers the role of the user in such systems, and the contexts in which such roles might emerge. The data used is drawn from focus groups with 72 participants, using novel scenario techniques to contextualise smart grid technologies in domestic settings. Two contrasting visions of the smart grid are presented, a centralised system based on current institutional arrangements, and an alternative system in which decentralisation of generation and control is pursued. Using the concepts of ‘energy consumer’ and ‘energy citizen’, the paper considers what forms of engagement are likely to be generated by the two visions. We propose that smart grid designs must look beyond simply the technology and recognise that a smart user who is actively engaged with energy is critical to much of what is proposed by demand side management. We conclude that the energy citizen holds out most promise in this regard. The implications of this for policy makers are discussed.}

abstract = {In this paper, a concept of naval aeroponic and seafood facility is presented. Due to large world population growth and the future food demand, some sustainable and renewable energy-based food production concepts are required. This concept is based on the sun tracking, where a large sailing ship, equipped with aeroponic greenhouses slowly sails on the sea. During sailing, plants grow, mature and harvest. When ready for consumption, they are packed and delivered to the nearest markets. If plants demand fast growing, then the ship can sail in the Equatorial area, thus boosting sun energy into plants via photosynthesis process. The ship can also use solar and wind energy for powering, thus sailing with very low emission. Because of its mobility, the ship has the ability to avoid adverse weather and especially critical atmospheric phenomena (storms, tornadoes, hurricanes etc.). The first analysis indicates that also other food production can be applied, such as fish, shells and crabs inside the ship, either in internal pools or even ballast pools. The ship can sail near large coastal cities or harbors e.g. near large food markets to minimize transportation costs. Fixed costs were estimated at 33 MEUR and variable at 8.25 MEUR. Depending on the market, annual profit is calculated from 5.4 to 14.1 MEUR. The analysis shows that the concept is profitable on average for 6 years, as long as its pay-back period lasts if it is near the preferred market. Smart algorithms are required to match many different simultaneous fields of action: navigation safety, crop growth, energy consumption, and minimization of labor costs. Thus, the concept becomes an efficient and mobile hybrid food production factory, using renewable energy sources for sailing and production, as well as a smart low-emission facility.}

That is why the paper focuses on methodologies using physical models and optimization for smart design and smart supervision for valorizing those buildings energy properties and contribute thus to the emergence of the concept of smart buildings (SBs) integrated in smart grids (SGs): we will give an overview of the mathematical optimization method used and of the kind of physical models we have developed over 10 years of active research in order to propose by this way a smart software dedicated to those SBs integrated in SGs.

Résumé
L'enjeu du XXIe siècle est de faire décroître la consommation des énergies fossiles au profit des énergies renouvelables sous la pression climatique. Ce papier montre que les bâtiments intelligents (smart buildings), intégrés dans des réseaux intelligents (smart grids), peuvent significativement contribuer à cet objectif. En effet, les bâtiments sont, d'une part, les plus grands consommateurs d'énergie dans le réseau électrique et pourraient devenir l'un des plus grands producteurs d'énergie renouvelable, en particulier grâce au concept de bâtiment à énergie positive, et ceci en offrant dans le même temps un important gisement de « flexibilité » en demande énergétique. C'est pourquoi cet article se focalise sur des méthodologies utilisant des modèles physiques et l'optimisation pour une conception et une supervision « intelligentes », afin de valoriser les propriétés énergétiques de ces bâtiments et contribuer ainsi au concept de smart building intégré dans des smart grids : nous donnerons un aperçu des méthodes mathématiques d'optimisation utilisées et des types de modèles physiques que nous avons développés au cours d'une recherche qui s'est déroulée sur plus de dix ans, de manière à proposer ainsi des approches logicielles dédiées à ces smart buildings intégrés à des smart grids. Nous détaillerons aussi notre stratégie globale de recherche pour améliorer ce type de logiciel « intelligent », par une approche dite « humain dans la boucle » (human in the loop), dans laquelle nous considérons qu'il n'y aura pas de « bâtiments intelligents » sans « utilisateurs intelligents ». Ceci implique une recherche interdisciplinaire complexe, que nous développons dans un living lab dans lequel les usagers sont impliqués comme consom'acteurs (pro'sumers), c'est-à-dire comme concepteurs et usagers actifs.}

Collected by smart card systems, smart card data surpass traditional travel survey data in providing more comprehensive spatial–temporal information about urban public transport-based (UPT) trips. However, the utility of smart card data has arguably yet to be exploited fully in terms of extracting and exploring the spatial–temporal dynamics of UPT passenger travel behaviour. To advance previous work in this area, this paper demonstrates a multi-step methodology in order to render more insightful spatial–temporal patterns of UPT passenger travel behaviour. Drawing on the Brisbane, Australia, bus network as the case study, a smart card dataset was first processed in combination with General Transit Specification Feed (GTFS) data to reconstruct travel trajectories of bus passengers at bus stop level of spatial granularity. By applying geographical information system-based (GIS) techniques, this dataset was used to create flow-comaps to visualise the aggregate flow patterns at a network level. The flow-comaps uncovered the major pathways of bus passengers and its variations over a one-day period. The differences within the flow-comaps were also quantified to produce weighted flow-comaps that highlighted the major temporal changes of passenger flow patterns along a number of stop-to-stop linkages of the bus network. The proposed methodology visually unveiled the spatial–temporal travel behaviour dynamics of UPT passengers and, in doing so, showed the potential to contribute to a new evidence base with the capacity to inform local public transport policy.}

As shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleets roll out to the market, the electricity consumed by the fleet will have significant impacts on energy demand and, in turn, drive variation in energy cost and reliability, especially if the charging is unmanaged. This research proposes a smart charging (SC) framework to identify benefits of active SAEV charging management that strategically shifts electricity demand away from high-priced peak hours or towards renewable generation periods. Time of use (TOU), real time pricing (RTP), and solar generation electricity scenarios are tested using an agent-based simulation to study (1) the impact of battery capacity and charging infrastructure type on SAEV fleet performance and operational costs under SC management; (2) the cost reduction potential of SC considering energy price fluctuation, uncertainty, and seasonal variation; (3) the charging infrastructure requirements; and (4) the system efficiency of powering SAEVs with solar generation. A case study from the Puget Sound region demonstrates the proposed SC algorithm using trip patterns from the regional travel demand model and local energy prices. Results suggest that in the absence of electricity price signals, SAEV charging demand is likely to peak the evening, when regional electricity use patterns already indicate high demand. Under SC management, EVs with larger battery sizes are more responsive to low-electricity cost charging opportunities, and have greater potential to reduce total energy related costs (electricity plus charging infrastructure) for a SAEV fleet, especially under RTP structure.}

Relying on clean or renewable energies to power homes, institutions or even factories has become a reality and an inevitable future. However, the distribution of energy stored or obtained must be done in an intelligent way to best serve all the building entities taking into consideration several factors such as: their priorities, nature of activities, the energy required, the duration of daily activity. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the primary components for micro smart grids, indeed thanks to IoT we can not only do the tele-survey of the consumption, but especially back up the reports to a controller entity allowing adapt the energy policy of the entire building. As a result, when we talk about a smart building, we are talking about a distributed sensor architecture. The management of these sensors must be done centrally to facilitate: (1) the prediction of the energy to be demanded, (2) the application of new energy balancing policies, (3) and the promotion of a source of energy compared to another depending on the weather conditions. Software-Defined Network (SDN) is an approach to orchestrate from a central point called a controller a set of nodes or devices present in the network and can be perfectly matched to the points previously discussed. Our contribution is in the context of the micro-smart grid, our paper proposes a new architecture for the efficient management and intelligent distribution of electrical energy obtained from all sources of renewable energy by adopting an SDN approach and by exploiting IoT sensors. The architecture is called Micro Smart Grid by Software-Defined Network (MSGSDN). A new algorithm is modeled and developed allowing this intelligent sharing.}
