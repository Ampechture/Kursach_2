abstract = {Nanogenerators have attracted particular attention during the last decade. A nanogenerator harness mechanical or thermal energy to produce electricity without any need for battery. In this paper, general descriptions of different types of nanogenerators, including piezoelectric, triboelectric, and pyroelectric, are presented. Next, bibliometric analysis and unsupervised machine learning–based analysis (principle component analysis) are carried out to determine the trends in this field of science. The current developments and directions for technology commercialization are briefly discussed. Additionally, the output performance and environmental consequences of active materials used in nanogenerators are analyzed by principle component analysis. The analysis reveals China’s sensible investment in the nanogenerator field during the last five years. The number of articles published by Chinese scholars is over 1000 during 2015–2020 with a considerable distance from the USA. It is also deduced that European countries need to pay more attention to this field if they want to compete with the USA, China, and South Korea. Overall, due to the huge amount of waste thermal energy worldwide, more efforts and resources have to be focused and invested in developing pyroelectric nanogenerators. Moreover, there is a need to find low-cost materials having a favorable environmental profile to fabricate nanogenerators.}

abstract = {Metropolitan areas around the world are experiencing a surge in air pollution levels due to different anthropogenic causes, making accurate air quality prediction a critical task for public health. Although many prediction systems have been researched and modelled, many of them have neglected the different effects that air pollution has on each individual citizen. Hence, we present a novel context prediction model that includes context-aware computing concepts to merge an accurate air pollution prediction algorithm (using Long Short-Term Memory Deep Neural Network) with information from both surrounding pollution sources (e.g., bushfire incidents, traffic volumes) and user’s health profile. This model is then integrated into a tool called My Air Quality Index (MyAQI), which is further implemented and evaluated in a real-life use case set up in Melbourne Urban Area (Victoria, Australia). Results obtained with MyAQI show both that (i) high precision levels are reached (90–96%) when forecasting air quality situations in four air quality monitoring stations, and (ii) the proposed model is highly adaptable to users’ individual health condition effects under the same airborne pollutant levels.}

abstract = {Due to the acceleration of urbanization process in modern society, there are many metropolises throughout the world, such as New York, Tokyo, and Shanghai. Such large cities typically have a carefully designed space planning. For example, the residential area should be distant from the industrial area due to the potential environmental pollution issue. In order to cope with public health emergencies, the infrastructure needed for modern urban governance needs to be improved. Notably, establishing a quality visual model to exploit such sophisticated spatial configurations is an important but challenging task. Such a model can facilitate many applications such as urban planning, environmental evaluation, smart transportation, and urban governance. However, the flexible spatial interactions among multiple regions make it difficult to apply a traditional visual model to encode them. In this work, a quality-guided feature selection framework is proposed to obtain a set of high-quality topologies to model the discriminative structures from different land spatial city regions. Given a city region from a metropolitan area, the well-known super pixel algorithm SLIC is used to decompose each land spatial city region image into multiple atomic regions. Based on this, a binary graph is used to model the spatial interactions among these regions. Each binary graph is then decomposed into multiple subgraphs and a topology selection algorithm is proposed to discover subgraphs with highly discriminative topologies. By leveraging these high-quality subgraphs, the image kernel machine is used to convert the high quality subgraphs from each city region’s image into a feature vector. Afterward, a multi-category support vector machine (SVM) is learned to classify each city region’s image into one particular category. Comprehensive experimental results by comparing with many state-of-the-art have shown the competitiveness of this method. Furthermore, the selected high-quality topologies have demonstrated that highly representative spatial interactions are nicely encoded. The results are of great significance to the establishment of the land spatial database management system.}

The provision of health services is necessary and a civil right, being one of the dimensions proposed in Smart Cities, represented by Smart Healthcare. This model of cities, as well as its dimensions, have great appeal in the technological application, as the main means of promoting smart services. However, it appears that the approach to the role of the citizen in the promotion of intelligence is neglected, leaving questions about the role of the citizen in Smart Cities. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the technological structures applied in Smart Healthcare, allowing us to identify the role of the citizen in the promotion of smarter health services. A systematic literature review was carried out using the Methodi Ordinatio, resulting in a portfolio composed of 26 articles with scientific relevance. From the content analysis, four main approaches were identified, as well as technologies and methods to address one of the biggest challenges of health technologies: data security and privacy. From this, the role of the citizen in the Smart Healthcare was evidenced, aiming to contribute to the planning of projects and the development of future research to consider with more attention the participation of citizens.}

abstract = {The widespread penetration of smartphone has paved the way for a new paradigm of pervasive computing, known as the participatory sensing (PS). In PS, a human user explicitly performs the tasks of sensing and reporting, typically in lieu of incentives. One major limitation with PS is the sparsity of data owing to the lack of active participation, thus inhibiting large scale real-life experiments for the research community. In our preliminary work (Barnwal et al., 2018), we propose a spatio-temporal event occurrence and report generation based data simulation framework called PS-Sim. This paper extends the PS-Sim framework with a novel budget allocation mechanism for incentivizing participants. The allocation mechanism guarantees the presence of a threshold number of active participants and also ensures the reporting of the significant fraction of events for sustainability of PS applications. The simulation environment provided by the PS-Sim framework replicates real participation and event occurrence behaviors, which is expected to enable the domain experts to investigate and assess the requisites (benefits and challenges) of introducing smart city applications. As a part of the evaluation of the budget allocation mechanism, we study its performance under varying effects of reward and participation, and establish its fairness as far as the remuneration of active participants is concerned.}

Applications of vehicular networks vary from safety applications such as blind spot warning and traffic light violations to entertainment such as streaming media or convenience such as parking space identification. Recently established standards such as IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 help achieve effective communications between vehicles and the infrastructure. However, Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are still considered as one of the challenging forms of wireless communication technologies that complement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that aim to improve the transportation in cooperation with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). VANETs are specialized form of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) but protocols that perform well in MANETs may not be ideal for VANETs due to high mobility, intermittent connectivity and heterogeneity. Cloud computing offers the option to offload local resources to a shared pool and can be an ideal solution for compute-intensive and memory-intensive applications. Hence, the concept of vehicular clouds has been introduced to facilitate VANET applications in a resource efficient way with rapid elasticity and a pay-as-you go business model. This chapter presents a comprehensive survey of VANET applications in smart cities along with challenges, solutions and existing implementations. Furthermore, it introduces the state of the art in vehicular clouds for smart cities following an introduction of various vehicular cloud architectures. Moreover, open issues and future directions are presented to help stimulate future studies in this emerging research field.}

These connected devices generate and transmit a vast amount of data about the city’s environment, traffic, and any other aspects that define the interaction between the cities and their citizens. The appearance and rising penetration of new computing paradigms and low-power wireless area network technologies are turning traditional cloud architectures that gather data from Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or GSM/LTE connected devices into more distributed platforms with computation at different network layers. At the same time, low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology has opened a whole new world of opportunities in the IoT. More concretely, LPWAN solutions that operate on unlicensed radio bands have enabled low-power and long-distance communication to industry, researchers, public organizations, and individuals equally. Together with these, the increasing penetration of the edge and fog computing paradigms is allowing for smarter IoT solutions that do not necessarily rely on cloud servers. In this chapter, we present a hybrid edge-fog-cloud computing architecture for monitoring environment parameters and traffic flow in a city with a very small footprint in terms of installed infrastructure. In particular, we put an emphasis on traffic monitoring and propose a lightweight image processing algorithm that estimates traffic density.}

Waste management is one of the major challenges to every country because that affects the environment in a serious manner. Government and nongovernmental organizations are working toward solutions for better waste management. Unorganized management of waste such as domestic waste, e-waste, industrial waste, and plastic waste creates many human problems such as pollution, diseases, and also affects the hygiene of living being. When waste generation rate increases lead to issue of finding new disposal places, proper waste disposal, collection, and management methods are needed. Management of waste includes proper collection, segregation, and recycling of discarded wastes in an environment friendly manner. In order to overcome all these problems, we propose the idea of modern waste management system in smart cities which manage waste in order to clean environment without interaction of human by blockchaining technology. Blockchaining is a super secure digital decentralized ledger, where transactions records are kept chronologically and publicly. Blockchaining waste management platform can provide the stakeholders with traceable and transparent way to regulate waste management activities and also achieve sustainable sanitation in waste management. Waste tracking is always difficult but with blockchaining, it must be easier. In this method, also connecting internet of things sensors with the decentralized network can help to generate the data and offer real-time tracking facility to garbage trucks throughout their journey. By implementing blockchaining methodology in waste management system also helpful in charging the penalties or financial rewards to the waste management service providers if they fail to provide better time-based services. Blockchaining can provide the public and the waste collection service with real-time information on trash bags so that they can always know whether they are full or empty.}

To fully assess the market potential of e-bikes, further research is needed to understand users’ preferences and the range of factors that can contribute for people to shift from car use to low carbon vehicles such as e-bikes. This paper is built on the Be4Schools R&D project implemented in the city of Águeda which is considered the first smart city in Portugal. It comprised the former study in the country that examined the willingness of students (aged 15-21 years) to use e-bikes for daily trips to school and that gathered their preferences towards specific ICT related attributes. The methodology comprised a mobility survey and a stated-choice experiment (SC). The SC experiment gathered 2232 observations which were able to provide the relevant attribute trade-off information between car travel and e-bike (with or without specific ICT equipment). An extensive econometric analysis was performed to assess the nature and extent of students’ heterogeneity of preferences which also considered gender issues. The study aimed to contribute to the regional economic cluster on powered two-wheels’ industry & innovation. Research results are interesting for city mobility policies and the regional industry as the possible integration of ICT equipment in e-bikes may speed up the market uptake of this technology.}

Nevertheless, in the literature, there is still a lack of suitable solutions for door-to-door routing supporting users from their origins to destinations and including the suggestion on where to park. On the other hand, in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenario, a lot of novel information sources could be exploited to compute more efficient mobility solutions to be proposed to the user. As an example, parking availability data could be easily collected and exploited to provide multimodal routes (i.e. routes with at least two different means of transportation) that include suggestions on where to park and how to reach the final destination. In this paper, we describe a distributed IoT architecture towards the definition of a Mobility Recommender System. In particular, we focus on a car-based multimodality, where the user always starts a trip with his/her private vehicle, but he/she can also leave the car in Park-and-Ride infrastructures and reach the destination with public transportation. This type of routing on a wider search area will result to be more costly, and thus, it will particularly benefit from a parallel computational architectural solution.}

Sometimes these systems require a fast and short-term deployment of video cameras. In these cases, ad-hoc networks could be a low-cost and feasible option, but they have poor performance for video delivery. Thus, we propose a smart live video adaptive streaming technique in order to transport video streams from the cameras to the external road traffic monitoring servers. To achieve this goal, these networks need a thorough study in order to analyze video quality under their inherent constraints, given by their specific topologies (once deployed), video streaming protocol, nodes’ performance and routing protocols. From our results both in simulated and real scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal in these specific scenarios, validated with several performance metrics in terms of Quality of Service and video quality.}

Yet, even today, operators of infrastructure are struggling to keep up with the increasing data demand and infrastructure might not be available in more extreme conditions, such as natural or man-made disaster situations. We see a way out in the use of cars as a main Information and Communication Technology (ICT) resource of smart cities, in a technology agnostic architecture that we term Car4ICT. Cars can be envisioned to be available almost ubiquitously in future smart cities and are flexibly made use of to mediate between users offering and consuming services. We present a flexible and extensible scheme for service discovery, as well as how to set up and operate such an architecture. To illustrate the feasibility of the Car4ICT architecture, we conclude with an evaluation of the service discovery performance in our Car4ICT framework under progressively worsening conditions. This evaluation is based on a custom-built Open Source simulation framework for evaluating such complex systems using multiple communication technologies in a heterogeneous vehicular network. We show that even in such conditions simple tweaks to protocol parameters can deliver good user experience in terms of low service discovery latencies.}

However, Fog computing is still nascent and requires strong groundwork to adopt as practically feasible, cost-effective, efficient and easily deployable alternate to currently ubiquitous cloud. Fog computing promises to introduce cloud-like services on local network while reducing the cost. In this paper, we present a novel resource efficient framework for distributed video summarization over a multi-region fog computing paradigm. The nodes of the Fog network is based on resource constrained device Raspberry Pi. Surveillance videos are distributed on different nodes and a summary is generated over the Fog network, which is periodically pushed to the cloud to reduce bandwidth consumption. Different realistic workload in the form of a surveillance videos are used to evaluate the proposed system. Experimental results suggest that even by using an extremely limited resource, single board computer, the proposed framework has very little overhead with good scalability over off-the-shelf costly cloud solutions, validating its effectiveness for IoT-assisted smart cities.}

With Jakarta experiencing exponential urbanization, TOD is a pivotal strategy to amalgamate residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, seamlessly coupled with effective public transportation systems. However, achieving optimal urban living within TODs demands a deep understanding of Jakarta's citizens' diverse and nuanced preferences and needs. This study fills significant gaps in the existing literature by investigating citizen preferences' heterogeneity and willingness to pay (MWTP) for integrated environmental services in TODs. Employing advanced methodologies like the Random Parameter Logit (RPL) and the Latent Class Model (LCM), this research offers a granular insight into citizens' varied preferences and their financial commitments toward enhanced environmental services. The insights derived have been crucial in formulating pragmatic recommendations for refining TOD management strategies and policies in Jakarta, ultimately contributing to urban landscapes' equitable and sustainable development. Through a detailed exploration of preference heterogeneity and the integration of smart city concepts within TOD frameworks, this study paves the way for more inclusive, innovative, and citizen-centric urban development paradigms.}

Autonomous driving will play an import role in the future smart cities, reduce the time and economic cost of the whole society, and be helpful for the sustainability of the city and society. A significant task for autonomous driving is to detect surrounding objects accurately in real-time, including car, pedestrian, cyclist, etc. In this paper, we propose one end-to-end three dimensional (3D) object detection method based on voxelization, sparse convolution, and feature fusion. The proposed method exploits only point cloud as input, and it has two key components—small voxels and efficient feature fusion. Instead of utilizing extra networks to transform voxels, we directly average the points within each voxel as their feature representation. To enrich features for prediction, we have designed a two-step feature fusion method called fusion of fusion network that can combine information of multiple scales and 3D space. We have submitted to the official test server of the 3D detection benchmark—KITTI, and achieved state-of-the-art performance especially in the Cyclist class. Besides, detection speed of our method achieves 0.05 s/frame with a 2–4 fold runtime improvement against state-of-the-art methods due to its simple and compact architecture.}

Vision based sensors are commonly used for monitoring cities, which acquire a huge amount of diverse data and store them for further computer vision processing. In this article, we aim to explore whether and how to navigate a vehicle using cost effective means (vision based sensors) in smart cities without using the calibrated sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS). Vehicle localization and navigation require on-board calibrated sensors and reliable GPS link. In an urban environment, these sensors fail to perform well in: indoor environment (tunnels), crowded and congested areas, and severe weather conditions. The most effective technique used for vision based navigation depends on image registration. The challenges of a successful and effective registration are: sufficient illumination in the environment, dominance of static scene over moving objects, high textured ratio to allow apparent motion and necessary scene overlap between consecutive frames. We proposed a novel approach for vehicle navigation based on vision sensors using modified normalized phase correlation. In the proposed approach, the distinction between textured and texture less surface is based on the identification of corresponding features. In this regard, the Gram polynomial basis function is used to remove the Gibbs error problem generated due to peak in the registration process. Similarly, entropy based tensor approximation is used to remove outliers for robust image registration. Experiments performed in real time during test drives show excellent results with respect to estimated position accuracy in comparison with GPS calculated data.}

However, due to the limitation of energy storage both for sensing nodes and mobile chargers, not all the sensing nodes can be recharged in time by mobile chargers. Therefore, how to select appropriate sensing nodes and design the path for the mobile charger are the key to improve the system utility. This paper proposes an Intelligent Charging scheme Maximizing the Quality Utility (ICMQU) to design the charging path for the mobile charger. Comparing to the previous studies, we consider not only the utility of the data collected from the environment, but also the impact of sensing nodes with different quality. Quality Utility is proposed to optimize the charging path design. Besides, ICMQU designs the charging scheme for a single mobile charger and multiple mobile chargers simultaneously. For the charging scheme with multiple mobile chargers, the workload balance among different mobile chargers is also considered as well as the utility of the system. Extensive simulation results are provided, which demonstrates the proposed ICMQU scheme can significantly improve the utility of the system.}

Nevertheless, without denying the efforts to create a real environmental culture, the economic and social problems like production decline and growing unemployment made public concern shift away to more immediately stressful issues such as real wages or job insecurity. Later on, in the post-accession period the Cohesion Policy created a more stimulating framework for dealing with the sustainable development objectives. In the current programme period, 2014–2020, in accordance with the “Europe 2020” Strategy, the sustainable growth is closely related to smart and inclusive growth within the strategic objective of the Cohesion Policy, offering each member state multiple instruments and funding opportunities for complying with sustainability criteria. They are particularly supportive for CEE countries, whose internal resources are below the required levels in this respect. This paper proposes a spotlight on the sustainability issues in CEE cities, considered development vehicles for the regions they belong to, and thus major participants in the efforts to promote economic growth and diminish interregional disparities. An evolutionary perspective is applied, aiming to reveal how these cities responded to sustainability requirements in both pre- and post-accession periods. In addition, we test the variance of green performance between different groups of CEE cities (Baltic, Central or East European cities; large, medium and small cities; growing, stagnating and declining cities). In the final part of the paper, a special emphasis is placed on the policies able to create synergies between smart specialization and sustainable development approaches. To this end, the paper investigates how sustainable and smart growth policies complement each other in supporting eco-innovation, eco-system services and resource efficiency at the city level in CEE countries. Meanwhile, the paper looks for those smart policy mixes that rationally combine knowledge-based investments in areas with competitive advantages and coherent support measures for a greener economy, as a pre-requisite for territorial cohesion and competitiveness in Europe.}

In the selection process of relevant digital services to the active target user, recommender systems have proved its efficiency as a successful decision support tool. Among many successful techniques incorporated to generate recommendations, collaborative filtering has been widely used to make similarity-based predictions for the recommendation of the relevant list of items to the users. As an advancement, utilizing clustering mechanisms with collaborative filtering for grouping similar users as clusters can enhance the efficiency of the recommendation generated. Though many clustering mechanisms have been employed to group similar users in the existing works, incorporation of bio-inspired clustering has yet to be explored for the generation of optimal recommendations. In this paper, a novel user clustering approach based on Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) has been proposed for the collaborative filtering based recommender system. The proposed recommendation approach has been evaluated on real-world large-scale datasets of Yelp and TripAdvisor for hit-rate, precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy.

Fatigue, rutting, and moisture susceptibility are the main contributors towards the failure of the flexible pavements. To avoid this, waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) modified asphalt binder and aggregates containing different minerals composition have been utilized in this experimental work to make strong bond between asphalt binder and aggregate interface against water interaction. Tests on both loose and dense specimens were conducted in the laboratory to assess resistance against water interaction of asphalt mixture. All the laboratory test data showed that aggregate quarries containing higher amount of silica have poor bonding properties than aggregates containing (lesser silica minerals). This study recommends the use of waste PET with basic nature (relatively more hydrophobic) aggregate to make more smart asphalt pavements. Moreover, being an economical use of waste PET in flexible pavements, the savings from highway projects will uplift the other human life standards in natural disaster like COVID-19 specially in under-developed countries.}

abstract = {Smart Cities are examples of Cyber-Physical Systems whose goals include improvements in transportation, energy distribution, emergency response, and infrastructure maintenance, to name a few. When it comes to mobility, the availability of large amounts of data, ubiquitous wireless connectivity, and the critical need for scalability open the door for new control and optimization methods with the aim of automating all aspects of mobility, from interconnected self-driving vehicles to sharing transportation resources. We address two key questions: can control and optimization methods enable this automation and, if so, how can we quantify its benefits to justify the challenging technological, economic, and social transitions involved? An optimal control framework is presented to show how Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) can operate in a dynamic resource contention environment, primarily urban intersections without any traffic lights. We also describe how large amounts of actual traffic data can be harnessed and drive inverse optimization methods to quantify the value of CAVs in terms of eliminating the prevailing Price of Anarchy: the gap between current “selfish” user-centric and optimal “social” system-centric traffic equilibria which are achievable with automated mobility.}

Some numerical experiments are also conducted to compare the performance of the method of acquiring the simplest decision association rules with that of the existing one of acquiring the non-redundant decision rules. Moreover, the new three types of rules are employed to introduce three types of consistencies in multi-scale formal decision contexts. In addition, the notion of an optimal scale is defined by each type of consistency, and how to select an optimal scale is investigated as well. Finally, two applications in smart city for the proposed rule acquisition and optimal scale selection methods are applied to smart city.}

Cities will consequently be the locus of major challenges like air pollution, traffic congestion, water, and waste management. They will also have to offer economic activity and good well-being for these immigrants coming from the rural zones looking for job opportunities. In this chapter, we develop the five major challenges we believe cities will face as corroborated by other authors. These are short-term issues related to the environment, economic competitiveness, and the quality of life offered but also long-term issues covering resilience and sustainability problems. At present, we are living through an overwhelming sanitary and financial crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. This book is not aimed at just discussing and measuring specific effects on the global economy and people health conditions. We have indeed embraced a wider and larger objective of reflection.

In this work, we focus on modeling the privacy content of multiple sources through mapping them as resources of types of Data, Information and Knowledge in the well-known DIKW architecture. We propose to categorize content objects and relationships uniformly as typed resources of data, information, and knowledge, according to our formalized DIKW architecture composing a meta model of DIKW and extended Data Graph, Information Graph and Knowledge Graph. We further propose to categorize target privacy resources of data and information according to their presence in the modeled searching space in our DIKW architecture as explicit and implicit divisions. Thereafter we propose protection solutions according to explicit and implicit divisions for privacy target concerning typed data. The efficiency and performance potential of our processing solution originates in a multiple dimensional modeling strategy of typed data, which is modeled solely with various frequencies of various meta level dimensions.}

Due to high mobility of devices, establishing and ensuring the success of D2D transmission in an intermittently connected network is a major challenge. In this paper, we consider the challenging problem of synchronizing the content of a subset of nodes in D2D networks. We adopt the City Section mobility model to mimic node movement in a city area, and produce theoretical analysis to the properties of the model. Based on this model, we propose two content synchronization strategies called direct contact synchronization and relay-assisted synchronization. We provide theoretical analysis to the performance of the two strategies, which derives the theoretical upper bound of their synchronization delay. We further conduct simulations to compare the proposed algorithms, which confirms the theoretical conclusion that relay-assisted synchronization substantially outperforms direct contact synchronization in terms of success rate and delay with a slight increase in the cost.}

The irrigation scheduling is made by the park manager, using the plant water requirements based on the reference evapotranspiration retrieved from a nearby weather station, and a plant coefficient KC. In this study, plant water requirements were estimated using the Water Use Classification of Landscape Species (WUCOLS) III method, in which plant water requirements are based on the composite of plant species and not on a single species, as in the case for classical crop coefficients. Water use efficiency is assessed by the relative water supply and the relative rainfall supply indicators. The results showed that the irrigation was better managed using the estimations of the park manager compared to the WUCOLS method although the irrigation scheduling is based only on the climatic information and does not consider other variables such as the soil water content.}

To ensure the robustness and security of digital image watermarking, we propose a novel algorithm using synergetic neural networks. The algorithm first processes a meaningful gray watermark image, then embeds it as a watermark signal into the block Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) component. The companion algorithm for detection and extraction of the watermark uses a cooperative neural network, where the suspected watermark signal is used as the input while the output consists in the result of the recognition process. The simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete certain image processing operations with improved performance, not only simultaneously completing watermark detection and extraction, but also efficiently determining the watermark attribution. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, the proposed model obtains an optimal Peak Signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).}

Several implications related to energy profiling in buildings, including tariff design, demand side management and advanced energy diagnosis are discussed. Moreover, a robust methodology to mine typical energy patterns to support advanced energy diagnosis in buildings is introduced by analysing the monitored energy consumption of a cooling/heating mechanical room.}

Efficiency improvements and advanced control strategies have a significant impact in the reduction of energy costs and CO2 emissions. Building energy simulation is widely used to help planners, contractors, and building owners analyse diverse options regarding the planning and management of energy consumption in buildings. Furthermore, recent advances in data processing and computing have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can learn from large datasets, e.g., sensor data from buildings, and use them to develop building-specific adaptive and automatic energy controllers. Control algorithms, such as deep reinforcement learning can tune themselves, are model-free, and economical to implement. In this paper, we introduce an integrated simulation environment that combines CitySim, a fast building energy simulator, and TensorFlow, a platform for efficient implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is achieved via Keras—an API for TensorFlow—and a set of text and csv files for data transfer between the applications. This new environment will allow researchers to investigate novel learning control algorithms, and demonstrate their robustness and potential for diverse applications in the built environment. We present two case studies for energy savings and demand response, respectively.}

IoT is of little worth without the ability to process, manage, and control a large amount of heterogeneous data in a timely and efficient manner. The concept of Data Fusion (DF) is based on combining heterogeneous multi-source data in order to produce high quality information, and reduce network traffic. On the other hand, the highly dynamic and heterogeneous nature of IoT requires very flexible and efficient management. The recent software defined systems paradigm is an appealing solution to reduce complexity and overhead in managing complex systems such as IoT by separating the control plane from the data plane. In this work, we present a novel experimental framework for IoT based environmental monitoring applications using concepts from DF and software defined systems (SDS). It is built on top of the software defined networking platform where the core components (the host, switch and the controller) are expanded to support other software defined systems components (such as software defined storage and security) and enable the applications of different DF techniques in IoT environments. We conduct several experiments to highlight features of the presented framework.}

From monitoring underground infrastructure such as pollution in water pipes, to exploration of natural resources such as oil and gas. These smart agents will not only detect anomalies, they are expected to provide sufficient data to facilitate mapping the detected anomalies, while—cleverly—adopting their behavior based on the changes presented in the environment. However, given these objectives and due to MASA’s miniaturization, conventional designing methods are not suitable to design MASA. On one hand, it is not possible to use the widely adopted simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) schemes, because of the hardware limitations on-board of MASA. Furthermore, the targeted environments for MASA in a smart city are typically GPS-denied, hardly accessible, and either completely or partially unknown. Furthermore, designing MASA’s hardware and their autonomous on-line behavior presents an additional challenge. In this chapter, we present a framework dubbed as evolutionary localization and mapping (EVOLAM), which uses multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to tackle the design and algorithmic challenges in using MASAs in monitoring infrastructure. This framework facilitates offline localization and mapping, while adaptively tuning offline hardware constraints and online behavior. In addition, we present different types of MOEAs that can be used within the framework. Finally, we project EVOLAM on a case-study, thus highlighting MOEA effectiveness in solving different complex localization and mapping problems.}

All these people have to deal with many things of daily life including food, water, energy, communication, and entertainment. Also, the disposal of garbage, sewage, or the growing traffic must be managed and organized while minimizing energy consumption and protect the environment. These activities require in the future a new kind of Internet of things sensor concepts and a stronger use of modern IT and communication technologies. This should lead to smart cities with innovative types of sensor data collection and processing systems which are able to make intelligent real-time decisions to manage assets and resources efficiently. There are many new tasks for state-of-the-art embedded systems within future sensors and measuring technology. Furthermore, we need a more and more obvious paradigm shift from centralized to decentralized, autonomous control with the goal of highly flexible environments and localized artificial intelligence.}

abstract = {In our previous work, a request-transmission splitting slotted ALOHA-based (RTS-SA) scheme was proposed to improve access capacity of vehicles with a single infrastructure coordination. However, in a smart city with widely deployed micro base stations (mBSs) scenario, the implementation of the RTS-SA scheme suffers from some new inter-microcell interference problems. To address these problems, an enhanced RTS-SA (eRTS-SA) scheme is proposed, in which each vehicle reports both its request and location information to the mBS with the help of the global positioning system (GPS) and the mobile edge computing (MEC) in the contention access phase (CAP). To reduce the overhead, the road between two mBSs is divided into segments, and each vehicle utilizes the segment number (8 bits are good enough) to replace its location information. Aware of the locations of the detected vehicles, each mBS conducts the allocation by sorting these vehicles in ascending order in terms of the segment number and then allocates the time slots sequentially. This strategy ensures that the same time slot would be assigned to vehicles that are geographically far apart, thus minimizing the mutual interference between signals transmitted in the contention-free transmission phase (CTP). Finally, the duration of the broadcast feedback phase (BFP) is doubled and divided into two equal parts, which are assigned to two adjacent mBSs respectively to prevent interference. In the simulation, the throughput of eRTS-SA is verified to be only 4.8% lower than the theoretical maximum throughput. Compare to the RTS-SA and VeMAC schemes, eRTS-SA can also achieve about 44% and 154% throughput improvement.}

Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, smart payment, transportation management, and high internet bandwidth helps to provide smart city infrastructure. To build smart cities, security, integrity, and flexibility are still some of the challenges in many countries. Several researchers are working to provide a better solution to the aforementioned challenges, and in addition, several steps have been adopted, developing different methods and algorithms for better comfort. Blockchain technology can be used for building of smart cities because of its high security and simplicity of working design. Blockchain is emerging as a solution in the real world because it eases the need for jobs and rectifies more complex issues. Today, many companies are involved in this blockchain research to build high security. The main aim of designing a blockchain cryptographic system is to provide security and transparency to every individual. In past years, many land registration has been done with forged documents with the support of brokers and a complete loss of record-keeping, where tracking is nearly impossible. One of the major challenges facing India is illegal land possession, where illegal land occupants generate fake documents to occupy land. Due to this, legal owners are suffering. Land registration can be done in using digitization, which consumes less time, but still many problems are associated in terms of tenuous land titles. In this chapter, we are trying to detect fake documents related to land registry and other revenue departments by using blockchain technology. Blockchain helps trace the property changes in different hands. For detecting the fake documents, first we analyze the details of property. It is very essential to know which documents are needed to consider. Here, three parties are taken into consideration: buyers, sellers, and land inspector. For implementation, we are using the Hyperledger fabric blockchain platform to develop the project. Finally, the main objective of this paper is to detect the fake documents, which are related to the land registry and maintain only the legal documents in land records and record all original documents for future use.}

The Proposed SCSWMS involves three main subsystems: Smart Garbage Bins (SGBs), Smart Garbage dump Trucks and urban Routes Selection (SGTRS), and Real-Time Users (drivers, dispatchers, citizens) Information and Decision Support (RTUIDS). The SGBs use IoT devices to monitor and collect the status of solid garbage bins and disseminate accurate information to SGTRS and RTUIDS subsystems using LoRaWAN technology. The SGTRS integrates a Geographic Position System (GPS) to optimize route selection, fuel and time consumption, and waste disposal. The RTUIDS informs users about the SGBs levels and estimated waste removal schedule and helps drivers and dispatchers to make more informed decisions. A proof of concept prototype implementation of the proposed SCSWMS was created and validated with both real and formal usability tests. Obtained results show improved bins monitoring accuracy, waste collection efficiency, and cost reduction, mainly than existing curbside collection methods.}

By using SWT (Semantic Web Technologies) and Linked data, we plan to interconnect various data sources, in order to provide homogeneous way for connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) to access relevant information. Such information is currently contained in three distinctive type of sources. These are: Geo-stationary Static data sources (Maps, City models), Geostationary Dynamic data sources (IoT devices) and Non-geostationary Dynamic sources (Vehicles).

This poses a challenge, as extremely resource-constrained devices such as ubiquitous sensors and actuators need to communicate with more powerful devices, such as smartphones and servers. Users move through this infrastructure, and their devices need to find and use services based on their current location. In this chapter, we focus on these interoperability issues on the service discovery (SD) layer. We examine requirements for a Smart City context and we analyze the standardized Multicast Domain Name System with DNS-Based SD (mDNS/DNS-SD) protocol as a potential SD protocol for Smart Cities. We show that mDNS/DNS-SD requires devices to be always online, which is inappropriate for battery-powered devices, and its discovery features are not discriminative enough to be used in large networks. As a solution, we propose a proxy scheme, where resource-constrained devices delegate their SD responsibilities to proxy servers. Then, we describe a new naming scheme, which enables devices to be looked up based on their physical properties, such as location, available sensors, and other criteria. Both extensions are backward-compatible with the mDNS/DNS-SD standard, making them favorable for use in smart cities.}

A large number of application areas and technologies are utilized in smart cities to achieve complex interactions between citizens, city departments, and third parties. This great complexity is one reason why privacy protection only seldom comes into the picture. A violation of privacy can result in discrimination and social sorting. Moreover, recent advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) have demanded much of cloud services in respect to sharing users’ private data. Data from various organizations are the vital information source for analysis and research. Generally, this sensitive or private data involves information related to medical records, census data, voter registration, social networks, and customer services. A primary concern of cloud service providers in data publishing is to hide the sensitive information of individuals. One of the cloud services that fulfils these confidentiality concerns is privacy preserving data mining (PPDM). The PPDM service in cloud computing (CC) enables data publishing with minimized distortion and absolute privacy. In this method, datasets are anonymized via generalization to meet privacy requirements. However, the well-known privacy-preserving data mining technique called K-anonymity suffers from several limitations. To surmount those shortcomings, we propose a new heuristic anonymization framework for preserving the privacy of sensitive datasets when publishing in the cloud for smart cities. The advantages of K-anonymity, L-diversity, and (α, k)-anonymity methods for efficient information utilization and privacy protection are emphasized. Experimental results have revealed the superior performance of these techniques.}

In an edge computing environment, users can offload their computationally expensive tasks to offloading points, which may reduce the energy consumption or communication delay. There are a large number of offloading points and users in a system, and their tasks are structured. However, resources of offloading points are limited, and users have different preferences for energy consumption and communication delays. In this paper, we first establish a system model for the environment with multiple users, multiple offloading points, and structured tasks. Then, we formalize an offloading decision problem in such an environment as a cost-minimization problem, which is a NP-hard problem. Thus, we design a method based on backtracking to obtain its exact solution; the method’s time complexity is, unfortunately, exponential with the number of offloading points. To reduce the complexity, a method based on an improved genetic algorithm and a method based on a greedy strategy are designed. Finally, we validate and compare three methods in terms of the total cost of all users, resource utilization of offloading points and execution time. The simulation results show that the last method performs the best.}

However, these applications require “always best and seamless connectivity”, which constitutes a key challenge in the context of available radio access and core network technologies. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) in multi-radio access technologies can be an emerging solution to meet the requirements of TCP-based services. Since MPTCP enables a vehicle to use multiple network interfaces and IP paths simultaneously, MPTCP seems a better option than legacy TCP in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Software Defined Networking (SDN) with its unique features such as its centralized control, programmability, and flexibility, can be beneficial for mobility management and performance requirements for vehicular communication. Although studies exist, that explore the performance of MPTCP and SDN separately for V2I context, a combination of these two are unexplored. In this article, we evaluate the performance of MPTCP for V2I connectivity in SDN controlled small cells of DSRC and Wi-Fi using the Mininet-WiFi emulator. Our experimental study reveals that issues related to Layer-2 handover in Wi-Fi and flow installation by the SDN controller play a key role. If these two issues can be handled wisely in SDN, MPTCP can offer benefits to V2I connectivity in small cells, such as Wi-Fi and DSRC. We also propose an approach for rule installation to V2I connectivity in the software-defined vehicular network.}

BLE beacons are small, low cost, and with minimum energy requirements. However, they do pose security and privacy challenges due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications. In this chapter, an introduction to BLE beacons is presented, along with their design approaches and limitations. Three smart city applications that can take advantage of BLE beacons are also discussed.

However, due to the complexity and diversity of the IoT data, it is difficult to build an efficient energy prediction system that reflects the dynamics of the IoT environment. To address this problem, a short-term energy prediction system based on edge computing architecture is proposed, in which data acquisition, data processing and regression prediction are distributed in sensing nodes, routing nodes and central server respectively. Semantics and stream processing techniques are utilized to support efficient IoT data acquisition and processing. In addition, an online deep neural network model adapted to the characteristics of IoT data is implemented for energy prediction. A real-world case study of energy prediction in a regional energy system is given to verify the feasibility and efficiency of our system.

Since the late 19th century, city planners have struggled to cope with new types of urban transport and mobility that threatened the existing system, or even rendered it obsolete.
Purpose
As city planners confront the range of disruptive urban mobilities currently on the horizon, this paper explores how we can draw on a vast body of evidence to anticipate and avoid unintended consequences to people's health and wellbeing.
Methods
This commentary involved a rapid review of the literature on transport disruption.
Results
We found that to avoid the unintended consequences of disruption, research, policy and practice must think beyond single issues (such as the risk of chronic disease, injury, or traffic management) and consider the broader consequences of interventions. For example, although autonomous vehicles will probably reduce road trauma, what will be the negative consequences for physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, chronic disease, land use, traffic congestion and commuting patterns? Research is needed that considers and informs how to mitigate the range of potential harms caused by disruptive mobilities.
Conclusion
In the face of new disruptive mobilities, we must: (a) draw on existing evidence to shape new regulations that address the ‘who, when and where’ rules of introducing new mobilities (such as electric assisted bicycles (e-bikes) and scooters (e-scooters)) of which the health repercussions can be easily anticipated; (b) monitor and evaluate the implementation of any interventions through natural experiment studies; and (c) use innovative research methods (such as agent-based simulation and health-impact-assessment modelling) to assess the likely effects of emerging disruptive mobilities (e.g., autonomous vehicles) on health and wellbeing and on the environment.}

abstract = {A city may become smart and green through strategic deployment of Information and Communication Technology infrastructure and services to achieve sustainability policy objectives in which trees have to be involved. Plants not only constitute green space useful to contrast urban pollution effects or provide ecosystemic benefits to residents but they can also be used as bioindicators and their involvement in communication networks can represent a significant contribution to build a smart, green city. The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) envisages that objects that surround us will be connected and there are no reasons to exclude urban trees from among the “wired object”. Radio frequency identification devices (RFID) may represent a prerequisite of IoT application and they can be used for tree protection and management, thanks to tagging experience carried out on various plant species. RFID tags can be easily associated with plants, externally or internally. This latter approach is particularly indicated if the identification of trees needs to be secured since its production, eliminating the risk of tag losses or removal. Interesting applications may be derived by implementing RFID tags in biomonitoring systems in order to guarantee a real-time data communication in which tags may act as antennas for multifunctional green spaces. Moreover, the virtualization of green areas using sensors and mobile devices can lead to the desktop management of the urban green with the possibility of implementing a real-time navigation throughout the areas. A complex relational network in which data can be collected thanks to geospatial methods can be integrated by an IoT approach in which RFID-plants can play a significant role.}

Privacy-preserving authentication (PPA) protocols for mobile services is a promising cryptographic approach to provide authentication and privacy preservation features, despite the limitations in a number of existing PPA protocols (e.g. higher computation overhead, and security weaknesses). Thus, in this paper, we present a PPA protocol for mobile services and demonstrate that the proposed protocol supports the level of security and privacy required in the typical mobile service application. We prove the security of the protocol in the random oracle model. We also present a comparative summary of the efficiency of the proposed protocol and three other competing protocols, which demonstrates that the proposed PPA protocol has less computation and communication overheads. This also suggests the potential for the proposed protocol to be deployed in mobile service applications for smart cities.}

Smart mobility can improve citizens’ well-being and reach sustainability objectives by establishing an appropriate mobility system. However, despite the availability of research about practical smart mobility cases, the required smart mobility building blocks, and the technical requirements of smart mobility systems, a formal policy-making lifecycle to guide the execution of smart mobility projects is missing. The goal of this paper is to distill a policy-making lifecycle of smart mobility projects by investigating how these are commonly executed. To reach this goal, sixteen interviews with stakeholders from diverse Belgian and Dutch cities are conducted and eight documents related to smart mobility are analyzed. These data sources allowed to design and validate a holistic smart mobility framework. The framework includes seven phases (idea, analysis, agenda-setting, preparation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation) and links each phase with the stakeholders involved (public agents, citizen, companies, and researchers) and related challenges. The key challenging aspect in the execution of smart mobility projects relates to the need for balancing many factors such as capacity or procedures. This paper is relevant to local governments of medium and large cities to help them approach smart mobility projects in a more holistic manner. Furthermore, this paper is relevant for researchers as it provides an analytical lens to examine smart mobility projects in smart cities.}

The state information on technological, economic, and social factors forms the basis for such management, which is normally tracked by sensors. It is expected that billions of sensors and controllers will be connected and share knowledge. The proliferation of sensor networks and their different characteristics pose new challenges in relation to resource management in the context of smart cities but also lead to the rise of a new type of data on social networks—location-based social network (LBSN). To tackle these challenges, this chapter proposes a cognitive architecture to enable big data applications to largely manage themselves and to deal with organization, configuration, security, and optimization. Specially, this architecture work supports anomaly detection, which is essential to ensure quality of service and reduce cost of smart city services. Meanwhile, to harness the power of LBSN, this chapter presents solutions to identify functional regions of modern cities and discovery urban patterns, which enable us to better understand complex cities and activity behaviors.}

The improvement includes two parts. Firstly, the backbone of SSD is replaced with MobileNetV3. Then, a feature fusion module is added to enhance the information of low-level feature maps to improve detection accuracy. The experimental results of our welding behavior detector show that, the mAP is 87.45%, detection speed is 25FPS, and parameter memory is 87.5 MB, which has a relatively excellent performance considering speed, accuracy and memory.}

Possible solutions, such as fixed installations of parking guidance systems or smartphone applications, can help to alleviate these problems. However, accurate real-time information on the parking lot occupancy status is required as a basis for these types of systems. Several types of sensors are available on the market; however, they either require high installation efforts, exhibit privacy issues, or do not integrate well into the cityscape. Smart City applications target a tight city integration of such solutions. In our chapter, we show how the joint application of sensor signal processing algorithms, machine learning approaches, and distributed embedded systems can enable these types of applications. Based on an intelligent smart street lamp platform, an ultrasonic sensing system is presented, which realizes a city-integrated solution for parking lot occupancy sensing.}

Previously, a large amount of machine vision-based algorithms has been presented to address this problem. However, accurate detection of various tiny integrated circuits remains an unresolved issue. To bridged this gap, a novel deep learning-based approach was proposed for instance segmentation in printed circuit board images. By adding the geometric attention-guided mask branch into the fully convolutional one-stage object detector under the framework of Mask R-CNN, it can produce a segmentation mask for each bounding box to enhance the identification accuracy. To evaluate the ability of the proposed approach, the comparison experiments were conducted between state-of-the-art techniques and ours. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented algorithm outperformed the state-of-the-art both in precision, sensitivity, and accuracy for both small devices like resistors and capacitors as well as integrated circuits.}

As the traditional binary division between oikos (οίκος) and agora (αγορά) in city space has been challenged by the emergence of parallel channels of communication and consolidation of “virtual” public and private space, several foundational questions emerge.

This necessitates the need for proper RF network planning to ensure optimal coverage of the network in such areas with the ability to remotely manage the infrastructure equipment to make deployment and network management hassle-free. On a city scale, there is a need for an interoperable middleware that provides a single point of contact for a developer to operate devices on various network protocols such as LoRa and Zigbee.

Public transportation is considered an essential piece in sustainable urban developments, since it allows the achievement of more efficient movements and flows within a city, thus significantly decreasing the use of cars and reducing environmental pollution. However, making the right decisions to establish efficient urban transportation routes is becoming more complex, thus it is necessary to have innovative and useful methods that consider urban growth among other factors to solve transport problems. Through the suitable design of a transportation system and the location of its stops, it is possible to reduce travel times and timeouts and increase user satisfaction. There are several restrictions to consider, such as the number of passengers that can travel in a bus, passenger demand, the size of the bus fleet, and more. These restrictions must be taken into consideration when determining optimal routes, number of stops, waiting times, and so on. In this chapter, we use Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) to plan a public transportation route in an urban municipality in Mexico.}

Metropolitan development policy is organized around growth management and transport principles that seek to ameliorate the ecological, economic, and social effects of both suburban sprawl and economic segregation. In addition to regionally-coordinated urban growth boundaries, which implode new growth back to already serviced lands, planning for regional sustainability therefore also includes strategic efforts to improve extant jobs-housing imbalances through major transit investments in key urban centers. This paper considers Greater Seattle’s recent policy experiences with planning transit communities from the perspectives of the regional labor market and state policies organized around sustainability. The paper explores the critical concern that while agglomeration economies continue to produce a variety of employment centers across metropolitan space, relatively scarce public transit investments might be directed invariably to edifying economic centers populated by social elites who already enjoy multiple mobility choices.}

abstract = {Research in smart cities is characterised by different needs: decrease of polluting emissions, improvement of energy efficiency, optimization of production and consumption of energy are the main action required. According to the last European directives, alternative fuels can play a fundamental role in the future of transportation [1]. In the framework of an Italian research project, called i-NEXT (innovation for greeN Energy and eXchange in Trasportation), CNR-ITAE has developed a microgrid able to receive, as input, the solar energy and to deliver, as output, hydrogen and electricity for electric and hydrogen vehicles [2-6]. A 100 kW photovoltaic plant, installed on the roof of a shed for vehicles recovering, represents the energy source. An electrochemical energy storage of 100 kW and 300 kWh, equipped with 16 sodium nickel chloride high temperature batteries, balances the energy production from PV plant in order to guarantee the energy self-sufficiency of the whole system. Electricity produced supplies both an on-site hydrogen production (by electrolysis), compression and distribution system and an electric charging station needed for Electric Vehicles (EV), Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) and Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV). The hydrogen produced supplies two FCE bikes and a FCHE minibus developed in the framework of the project while a last mile delivery van (EV) is fed through a fast charging station. An ICT platform allows to monitor, control and connect plants and vehicles in order to manage energy flows, fault and warning events. The paper reports the results of the research activities regarding both infrastructures and vehicles development.}

abstract = {The current economic system is highly unsustainable. It has created an economic crisis and an ecological crisis, which seriously threaten the future of our planet and societies. Both crises could be overcome by transitioning to a green economy. The green economy concept is based on the idea that the conventional model of economic development is socially and environmentally unsustainable, and argues that we should move toward a new economy, which respects natural boundaries and ecological limits, and responds to the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged. Cities are in a position to facilitate the transition to a greener economy. This is not only because cities today are home for majority of the world's population and economic activities but also because cities are centers of knowledge and innovation that are crucial for green economy transition. On the other hand, cities, especially the ones in the developing world, are characterized by significant economic, social, and environmental challenges that prevent governments from taking the necessary steps to move the world toward a green economy. Therefore, green economy transition requires another transition pathway that applies to the production and use of urban space. Given the role that innovation and technology have to play in green economy transition, the conceptual foundation of the city of the green economy can be based on the idea of smart city. In the light of this background, this chapter aims to discuss the roles that the four key urban sectors, namely land use, buildings, transportation, and waste, can play in transitioning to a green economy and a smart city. Based on the previous research in academic literature, the green economy potential in these sectors and the intrinsic barriers that have to be eliminated for a better transition are highlighted.}

abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to analyse the effectiveness of a solution known as road condition tool (RCT) based on data crowdsourcing from smartphones users in the transport system. The tool developed by the author of the paper, enabling identification and assessment of road pavement defects by analysing the dynamics of vehicle motion in the road network. Transport system users equipped with a smartphone with the RCT mobile application on board record data of linear accelerations, speed, and vehicle location, and then, without any intervention, send them to the RCT server database in an aggregated form. The aggregated data are processed in the combined time and location criterion, and the road pavement condition assessment index is estimated for fixed 10 m long measuring sections. The measuring sections correspond to the sections of roads defined in the pavement management systems (PMS) used by municipal road infrastructure administration bodies. Both the research in question and the results obtained by the method proposed for purposes of the road pavement condition assessment were compared with a set of reference data of the road infrastructure administration body which conducted surveys using highly specialised measuring equipment. The results of this comparison, performed using binary classifiers, confirm the potential RCT solution proposed by the author. This solution makes it possible to global monitor the road infrastructure condition on a continuous basis via numerous users of the transport system, which guarantees that such an assessment is kept up to date.}

abstract = {Sustainable Integrated Waste Management System (IWMS) is one of the big challenges of modern society. The topic is nowadays a priority since it contributes to the goals set by “EU 2020 Strategy”. New web-based technologies are now available to monitor, manage and elaborate information concerning spatially decentralized systems interacting each other by cloud computing. A growing interest is paid to potential applications of these technologies to manufacturing systems and to municipal services ensuring both flexibility and efficiency. The authors propose a Decision Support Systems (DSS) for a Social - Cyber - Physical framework suitable for the strategic planning and operational phases, by supporting public administrators at municipal level in design and plan an IWMS. The main goal of the DSS is minimize the net carbon emissions of the IWMS. The model has been applied to a middle size city located in Southern Italy. A comparative analysis is carried out investigating the optimization of the stand-alone collecting phase and of the overall IWMS. Results in both cases suggest the adoption of multi stream grouping systems for dry recycled fraction and of single stream grouping system for organic and glass fraction. At the same time a different mix of waste collection modalities is found in the two reference cases.}

This requires a robust and easy-to-manage information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure that is generally comprises sensors, protocols, networks, and steps. Smart adoption of such systems could influence, manage, direct, and protect human beings and property. Nevertheless, it may create problems of government support, data quality, privacy, and security. Today's computational world allows implementation of artificial intelligence models for big data analytics to bring cities smart (with intelligence and optimal improvement). This chapter will discuss the applications of urban space monitoring and surveillance systems via ICT. The typical limitations of the current research are discussed in detail.}

abstract = {The emergence of modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) based on vehicular networks (VNs) has diversified the range of applications provided to drivers and passengers during their road trips. To fully benefit from these services, vehicles need however to share their geolocation data making location privacy a critical issue. Hence, to mitigate these threats and promote VNs use in developing Smart Cities, it is vital to guarantee conditional anonymity to vehicular users. In this paper, we propose an efficient pseudonym changing strategy for privacy-preserving in VNs. The proposed approach uses threshold cryptography properties to provide moving vehicles with pseudonyms, allowing them to communicate anonymously during their journey. These vehicles though can be traced back by trusted authorities in case of misbehavior actions. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach by comparison with concurrent solutions, where it demonstrates the best results in both congested road traffic and dense infrastructure deployment scenarios.}
