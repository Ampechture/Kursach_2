abstract = {The paper provides a systematic evaluation of the optimal optical characteristics of smart windows to maximize their energy efficiency benefits when deployed for residential buildings. The evaluation accounts for a wide range of design specifications and operation conditions of housing units including building orientation, window sizes, and climatic zones. Using integrated analysis aimed to minimize energy use required to heat and cool housing units, the optimal design and control settings are determined for two types of smart windows including those that can switch between only clear and dark tint states and those that can transition to multiple intermediate tint levels. The results from a series of sensitivity analyses show that the required design optical specifications for the smart windows could depend on several variables including primarily climate characteristics and window features including size, orientation, and U-value. Significant energy savings can be achieved by smart windows relative to the code-compliant static fenestration systems ranging from 21% in cold climates to 5% in warm climates. These energy savings can be achieved using stepped controls to set the tint levels of the smart windows. Additional albeit slight savings can be obtained through gradual controls for those smart glazing that have the capabilities to transition to intermediate tint levels.}

abstract = {Exosomes continue to attract interest as a promising nanocarrier drug delivery technology. They are naturally derived nanoscale extracellular vesicles with innate properties well suited to shuttle proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells. Nonetheless, their clinical utility is currently limited by several major challenges, such as their inability to target tumor cells and a high proportion of clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) of the liver and spleen. To overcome these limitations, we developed “Smart Exosomes” that co-display RGD and CD47p110–130 through CD9 engineering (ExoSmart). The resultant ExoSmart demonstrates enhanced binding capacity to αvβ3 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, resulting in amplified cellular uptake in in vitro and in vivo models and increased chemotherapeutic efficacies. Simultaneously, ExoSmart significantly reduced liver and spleen clearance of exosomes by inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis via CD47p110–130 interaction with signal regulatory proteins (SIRPα) on macrophages. These studies demonstrate that an engineered exosome drug delivery system increases PDAC therapeutic efficacy by enhancing active PDAC targeting and prolonging circulation times, and their findings hold tremendous translational potential for cancer therapy while providing a concrete foundation for future work utilizing novel peptide-engineered exosome strategies.}

However, achieving thermochromic smart window with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), high solar modulation (ΔTsol), and excellent visible light transmittance (Tlum) remains a great challenge. Here, a novel composite hydrogel based on polydiisopropylacrylamide (PNIPAm) doped with carrageenan (KCA) and Na2SiO3 was developed for high-performance smart window. The lower LCST of PNIPAm was precisely tuned in a range from 25 °C to 28 °C by controlling the content of added Na2SiO3. The inclusion of KCA diminishes agglomeration within the gel system and enhances both Tlum and ΔTsol. As a result, the KCA/Na2SiO3/PNIPAm exhibits a high Tlum (87.37 %), ΔTsol (69.65 %), a lower LCST (27.2 °C), and a high atmospheric window emissivity (0.962). The smart window achieves temperature drop of 12.3 °C under direct sunlight, and keeps highly stable even after 100 cycle tests high and low-temperature durability due to its robust solar modulation capability. This work offers valuable insights for developing high-performance and robust thermochromic smart windows and holds promising applications in building energy conservation.}

Insights include their level of preparedness, ambition, capacity and the risks envisaged in the pursuit of zero-emission and greener futures. This study focuses in particular on the role of renewable energy across high greenhouse gas emitting sectors in cities (e.g. buildings, mobility, waste and industry). It analyses i) the status quo for renewable energy generation, consumption, and policymaking, ii) the key measures to enhance and upscale renewable energy deployment in the near future, and iii) how policies and relevant instruments will evolve to curb emissions and accelerate the energy transition. The insights that emerge from the analysis are discussed in relation to existing evidence, to inform future research strands and forms of assistance for cities. Overall, for cities to deliver on large renewable projects, efforts need to be intensified, barriers need to be lifted and multi-governance approaches must be operationalised.}

Based on the PWM dimming principle, we present a low computation cost and partial-feedback closed loop control scheme for LEDs, which only measures and feedbacks the contribution of daylight, not that of both light levels, to determine the output of the electric light. Using the photo sensor TEMT6000, a prototype is presented to verify the partial feedback scheme.

It attempts to present the politics of urban design, rejecting an urban-technological determinism that refers to a specific technical environment as the only one possible. If technology is an open process with social implications and consequences, the same holds for urban technologies and designs. This approach argues that contemporary cities are formed within a specific socio-technical context which is seemingly the most functional for the current social, political and economic world, but since environmental and urban crises rise, there seems to be a need for rethinking over the form of current cities. Thus, this article attempts to offer a theoretical contribution to the debate over alternative urban designs through Andrew Feenberg's insights. Drawing upon some of his most crucial notions, like the “technical code”, the “interpretative flexibility” and the “operational autonomy” and presenting their role in a philosophy of the city, I attempt to highlight that current urban forms could be replaced by other functional alternatives. The choice over one or another urban design is political hence the need for the relation between the philosophy of the city and technical politics.}

This study proposes a virtual predicted mean vote (PMV) sensor for smart thermostats for indoor thermal comfort and energy-efficient building operation and control. The proposed virtual sensor can observe the representative PMV for the occupied zone, considering the systematic errors caused by the spatial difference between the wall-mounted thermostat and the occupied zone. Virtual PMV sensor-based smart thermostat has the potential to improve energy efficiency and thermal comfort by observing unmeasured thermal comfort within the occupied zone based on variables obtained from an existing wall-installed thermostat. To cover systematic errors for general applications, intrusive measurements using a commissioning period are necessary, even in the short term. Thus, conventional modeling approaches can be used with limited intrusive data to develop an accurate in-situ virtual PMV sensor during operation. In the application into a small-sized office building, the real systematic errors showed up to −2.4 °C among ten different thermostat locations in the target office zone. The in-situ virtual sensor could accurately observe the PMV for an occupied zone for different air-conditioning periods (air-conditioned working hours, non-air-conditioned working hours, and closing hours) with the best accuracy of 0.05 mean absolute error (MAE) using one-day intrusive dataset. Based on comparing white-box, black-box, and gray-box virtual sensors in the application, this study recommends using the gray-box modeling approach to leverage the synergetic effect between data and knowledge for better in-situ virtual sensor modeling under a limited intrusive dataset.}

A dependency on smart applications implies that any misbehavior may impact our society with varying criticality levels, from simple inconveniences to life-threatening dangers. One critical challenge in this area is to overcome the side effects caused by data loss due to failures in software, hardware, and communication systems, which may also affect data logging systems. Event traceability and auditing may be impaired when an application makes automated decisions and the operating log is incomplete. In an environment where many events happen automatically, an audit system must understand, validate, and find the root causes of eventual failures. This paper presents a probabilistic approach to track sequences of events even in the face of logging data loss using Bayesian networks. The results of the performance analysis with three smart application scenarios show that this approach is valid to track events in the face of incomplete data. Also, scenarios modeled with Bayesian subnets highlight a decreasing complexity due to this divide and conquer strategy that reduces the number of elements involved. Consequently, the results improve and also reveal the potential for further advancement.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Radiation dose escalation may improve local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) in select pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of ablative stereotactic magnetic resonance (MR)-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) for borderline resectable (BRPC) and locally advanced pancreas cancer (LAPC). The primary endpoint of acute grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity definitely related to SMART was previously published with median follow-up (FU) 8.8 months from SMART. We now present more mature outcomes including OS and late toxicity.
Materials and methods
This prospective, multi-center, single-arm open-label phase 2 trial (NCT03621644) enrolled 136 patients (LAPC 56.6 %; BRPC 43.4 %) after ≥ 3 months of any chemotherapy without distant progression and CA19-9 ≤ 500 U/mL. SMART was delivered on a 0.35 T MR-guided system prescribed to 50 Gy in 5 fractions (biologically effective dose10 [BED10] = 100 Gy). Elective coverage was optional. Surgery and chemotherapy were permitted after SMART.
Results
Mean age was 65.7 years (range, 36–85), induction FOLFIRINOX was common (81.7 %), most received elective coverage (57.4 %), and 34.6 % had surgery after SMART. Median FU was 22.9 months from diagnosis and 14.2 months from SMART, respectively. 2-year OS from diagnosis and SMART were 53.6 % and 40.5 %, respectively. Late grade ≥ 3 toxicity definitely, probably, or possibly attributed to SMART were observed in 0 %, 4.6 %, and 11.5 % patients, respectively.
Conclusions
Long-term outcomes from the phase 2 SMART trial demonstrate encouraging OS and limited severe toxicity. Additional prospective evaluation of this novel strategy is warranted.}

Thus, this study develops an effective framework to determine the required platform toward establishing a u-city by explores the main components of a smart city, such as citizens, environments, and key infrastructures, and the criteria to measure each component. The interaction between the components and their criteria, are specified using the Analytical Network Process (ANP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods Finally, according to the weights obtained, a ubiquitous coefficient for a city is proposed.

We identify the HVR changes in response to HSR operation by employing smart meter data of approximately 10 million households in more than 80 counties in the middle and lower regions of the Yangtze River Basin. We find that HSR opening could reduce the urban HVR by 1.64% and its reducing effect is stronger in district-urban than in county-urban areas. The decreasing effect of HSR operation on urban HVR is more noticeable in areas with better air quality, lower living costs, and more service industries. The opposite effects are observed in rural areas, where the HSR operation has increased the rural HVR by 1.16%. Our findings indicate that the siphoning effect of HSR exists on HVR as the rural population along the HSR is attracted to central cities, and positive HSR promotion strategies contribute to reducing urban HVR. With the development of transportation infrastructure, the difference in HVR due to urban and rural population mobility should be taken into account.}

We identify potential impacts of deep black box attacks on Smart Power Grids as implemented by the Department of Energy in 1996, we evaluate existing protection methods, and we find out the pitfalls thereof. With the aim of overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks, we initiate a study on deep black box adversarial attacks against Smart Power Grids showing that statistically significant effects against a national Smart Power Grid are achievable with absolute security. We also probe detection of cyber security attacks on Smart Power Grids. We illustrate landscape of smart grids with numerous cyber threats and demonstrate the limitations of traditional security practices. We show the importance of machine learning to detect attacks and the unlikelihood of identification of dependable and efficient detection schemes. We describe quantum voting ensemble models as one of the most powerful techniques in the detection of cyber security attacks. Finally, we propose an experimental setup and evaluation criteria to detect cyber security attacks in smart grids using quantum voting ensemble models. Then, we talk about private data storage in blockchain based smart grid infrastructure. We give an introduction of block chain and its essentiality in smart grids. We discuss privacy issues in block chain based smart grids. We acknowledge the strength of privacy safeguards, but on the same wavelength, we realize their weaknesses. Next, we propose a quantum resistant encryption technique that enhances the privacy of smart grids. We propose quantum voting ensemble models as one of the most promising techniques to address the issue of private data storage in block chains. As a result, we provide a comparison between the proposed models and traditional approaches to privacy protection in smart grids based on an experimental performance review. Then, we propose a unified strategy to improve smart grid cyber security by incorporating deep black box attacks with quantum voting ensemble models. Finally, we disclose several benefits of such integration and perform an experimental evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of the unified approach. The results of our study identify security gaps in smart grids and propose state-of-the-art mechanisms to address them. The challenges of smart grids system require the amalgamation of blockchain, quantum voting ensemble models and deep black box adversarial attacks. We achieve this objective proposing a unified strategy. The results of this study will equally be helpful for future research and smart grid cyber security implementations.}

abstract = {The increasing number of visually impaired individuals due to global population growth and aging poses a significant societal challenge, leading to a substantial demand for devices that can assist the visually impaired. The emergence of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has provided a novel approach to achieve self-powered sensing, making them ideal candidates for addressing this issue. In this study, a TENG-based smart cane and related sensor system with a super-easy structure and extremely low cost were developed to assist the visually impaired. The proposed smart cane is based on a single-electrode-mode TENG attached to the bottom of the cane to detect potential dangers. The electrical outputs between the bottom friction layers and common road materials were systematically investigated, and the most appropriate sensing material was selected. Furthermore, a four-wall square cage structure and related wireless sensor system were designed for fall-down detection. The as-designed system can collect fall-down signals and transmit them through Bluetooth, which can automatically place emergency phone calls to caregivers or hospitals when the detected signals exceed the threshold. Additionally, the proposed smart cane can achieve long-term durability and function under water-spraying conditions, which shows possible applicability in wetting environment. This study demonstrated a novel approach for blind navigation, danger detection, and fall-down detection, achieving high sensitivity and accuracy at an extremely low cost. Thus, the proposed system has remarkable real-life applicability.}

The paper uses a large sample qualitative survey data (n = 548) on the perceptions and experiences of users and non-users of internet-based ride-hailing services in Ghana. Through an inductive analysis, seven factors are identified that reflect heterogeneous safety and security perceptions and experiences in ride-hailing. Some individuals perceived a high sense of security and safety from ride-hailing platforms’ inbuilt features, including ‘driver and vehicle identification’ and real-time journey ‘trackability and traceability’. Additionally, they derived a sense of safety and security from the ‘privacy and lone travel’ in ride-hailing, as well as ride-hailing use in ‘emergency’ situations when other emergency services are not readily available. Others, however, expressed ‘distrust’ in the platforms’ inbuilt security features and believed that they enable exposure to ‘malicious and criminal activities’ that compromise their safety when using ride-hailing services. Moreover, safety risks were experienced through ‘driver behaviours’, such as reckless driving, distractions by smartphone usage while driving as well as fare pricing practices that are considered intransparent by passengers, leading to clashes between them and ride-hailing drivers. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of their fundamental conceptual and empirical value to research on smart mobility, transport safety and travel-related well-being, as well as practical relevance for transport policy and governance in the age of smart mobility transitions.}

For this purpose, this chapter discusses the social and spatial production of informal settlements—how these areas show high degrees of self-organization based on everyday actions and interactions. In line with Rauws (2016), observers can see smart cities as networks of knowledge, actions, and selection of choices; yet this view also aligns with the actions informal settlers in Latin America take to produce their own living environments via self-organization and everyday practices. The chapter suggests how smart technologies can utilize computational logics to help measure and interpret these self-organized systems, as well as help decipher everyday creativity, based on uncertainty, autonomy, and freedom. An urban area may possess no formal planning processes, yet residents’ bottom-up social and spatial initiatives give shape to their settlements and to the city. In this sense the use of smart technologies can bring heightened understandings to informality; therefore not only the smart but also the informal can undergo reconceptualizing. We suggest viewing the smart and the informal as collective and adaptive self-organized systems fuelled by everyday practices where the social emerges as everyday creativity.}

Next, the SRI is calculated after applying a retrofitting scenario that includes market available technologies towards Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. Last, a more comprehensive retrofitting scenario of integrated technologies towards Positive Energy Buildings is assessed. Results indicate that buildings, constructed after the implementation of the EPBD, can increase smartness with a relatively low cost than older buildings, although their initial overall SRI score generally leads to an SRI Class G (0–20%), with buildings performing better in “Health, well-being and accessibility” and “Comfort” impact categories. Smart-orientated retrofitting scenarios focusing on building automation and control measures can increase such buildings class up to “C” (65–80%), performing better in optimizing energy efficiency when applying retrofits towards NZEB. Applying retrofitting scenarios that could potentially lead to energy positiveness mainly supports building interaction with the grid.}

Smart societies require next generation mobility platforms and applications to enable the needed quality and pace of life.

The system includes a mobile application, a backend cloud-based big data analysis system, and a middleware platform based on fog computing. The system architecture and its component technologies are described in addition to a mobile application use case. The technologies used in this paper have been used in the literature in the past. However, we have not found any work where all these technologies have been brought together to develop a mobile application that provides uniquely focused information on user mobility. Google Maps notifications could provide information about nearby road closure or other events where relevant. However, we propose to pull in and provide information to the users about their travel locally, nationally, and internationally. More importantly, relevant information is pulled in from multiple news media and other sources and provided to the user in multimedia formats including text, voice and video.}

The need for sustainable technologies and solutions for energy-saving dramatically increased in residential buildings due to population growth, quality of indoor environment, and climate change. Recently, IoT based applications have been developed in smart homes, smart cities, smart hospitals, and other smart environments. The goals of sustainable technologies in residential buildings incorporate maximization of thermal comfort and minimizing energy consumption. The challenges and problems of residential buildings can be solved using consumer behavior models and integrating their inference into residential problem solutions. This paper proposes an IoT task management mechanism based on predictive optimization for energy consumption minimization in smart residential buildings. The proposed task management mechanism has a predictive optimization module based on prediction and an optimization module for solving energy consumption minimization problems. The energy data is obtained from different appliances to evaluate the proposed predictive optimization approach. The proposed approach results are compared with prediction and optimization modules. The performance is evaluated in terms of regression performance metrics. The case study results show that the predictive optimization mechanism based on task management performs better than standalone prediction and optimization-based energy consumption mechanisms in residential buildings.}

The PE showed pH sensitivity, implying unique color shifts at different pH. The film colors altered from red through purple-brown to colorless with increasing pH. The smart packaging films were prepared by casting method composed of gelatin (GE), sodium alginate (SA), and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). The films were coded as GE/SA (control), GE/SA/PE, and GE/SA/CNF/PE. The thickness of the films ranged from 0.24 ± 0.02 mm to 0.33 ± 0.01 mm. The mechanical properties tensile strength (TS) (12.24 ± 0.30 MPa to 17.65 ± 0.33 MPa) and elongation at break (EAB) (79.34% ± 1.02% to 93.36% ± 0.69%) significantly increased after addition of CNF. The synthesized films showed water contact angle ranged from 84.55 ± 2.12 to 69.41 ± 1.21, suggesting that films were hydrophobic. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated strong interaction among PE, CNF, and biopolymers. The film with GE/SA/CNF/PE exhibited higher thermal stability compared with control film. Then, the films were applied for checking real time application for the freshness of salmon fish. The significant color change of the film occurred and the number of bacterial colony and TVB-N were increased from 3.81 Log CFU/g to 6.94 Log CFU/g and from 4.78 mg/100 g to 32.27 mg/100 g after incubation for 48 hours. Therefore, the film with PE and CNF was intended as an excellent candidate for smart packaging film.}

IoT makes it possible to convert our homes to smart environments in which sensors are responsible for handling inhabitants’ behaviours and monitor their daily activities. Activity Recognition (AR) is a new service within smart homes. It has been introduced as a solution to improve the quality of life of people such as elderly and children. AR is concerned with the assignment of an activity label to a sequence of sensors’ events that are generated from the smart infrastructure. To help in effectively recognizing home activities, classification algorithms are applied on segmented sequences that are extracted automatically. Segments are subject to error due to the existence of irrelevant data and difficulties in how segmentation is applied. This negatively affects the accuracy on the classification task. In addition, the data generated from the network is streamed in nature, and big data techniques need to be utilized. In this paper, we propose a model to improve Activity Recognition in smart homes. The proposed technique is based on defining a profile for each activity from training datasets. The profile will be used to induce extra features and will help in distinguishing residents’ activities (fingerprinting). To validate our model, real datasets have been used for the experiments, and results show a significant enhancement in accuracy, compared with traditional techniques.}

abstract = {Security in smart cities is a challenging issue in urban environments as they depend upon interconnected technologies and data for effective services. To address security challenges, smart cities implement robust cybersecurity measures, including network monitoring, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. Detecting and mitigating possible security risks in drone network B5G is a crucial aspect of ensuring reliable and safe drone operation. It is necessary to establish sophisticated and robust attack detection techniques to defend against security threats as the use of drones becomes increasingly widespread and their applications diversify. This is due to the lack of privacy and security consideration in the drone’s system, including an inadequate computation capability and unsecured wireless channels to perform advanced cryptographic algorithms. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detection systems can identify suspicious activities and monitor network traffic, such as anomalous communication patterns or unauthorized access attempts. Therefore, the study presents an enhanced dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm with deep learning-based attack detection (EDMOA-DLAD) in Networks B5G for the purpose of Drones technique. The presented EDMOA-DLAD technique aims to recognize the attacks and classifies them on the drone network B5G. Primarily, the EDMOA-DLAD technique designs a feature selection (FS) approach using EDMOA. To detect attacks, the EDMOA-DLAD technique uses a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) classifier. Finally, the EDMOA-DLAD technique applies the beetle antenna search (BAS) technique for the optimum hyperparameter part of DVAE model. The outcome of EDMOA-DLAD approach can be verified on benchmark datasets. A wide range of simulations inferred that the EDMOA-DLAD method obtains enhanced performance of 99.79% over other classification techniques.}

By adequately scheduling appliances, residential consumers can reduce their electricity expenses while increasing their comfort. Electricity cost and user comfort being conflicting in nature, can be formulated as a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem with varying user priority to use different home appliances at different times. Further to solve this problem, a Fuzzy Adaptive Dynamic SPEA2 with Borda Ranking Method (FDSPEA2-BR) is proposed based on the dynamic modification of popular SPEA2 algorithm. The algorithm includes an improved Borda count method along with Mamdani fuzzy rules to select the best solutions. The changes in crossover and mutation rate in the SPEA2 algorithm is now being controlled with fuzzy rules. Proposed FDSPEA2-BR is validated on fourteen benchmark dynamic multi-objective functions taken from the FDA, JY, dMOP, and DF test suites, results have validated the optimization model’s efficacy. Simulation study is performed on the scheduling of 11 smart home appliances varying over 10 time slots. The results in the form of time varying Pareto Fronts is demonstrated and the schedules corresponding to 5 diversified points on each Pareto Front are reported. The end user can make use of the optimized schedules that were thus obtained to modify his or her patterns of demand and energy use.}

The multitude and spatial diversity of processes occurring in their internal and external environment challenges the creation of a uniform and comprehensive approach to planning their development. The smart village concept, which has been gaining popularity in recent years, is supposed to answer the needs of contemporary rural areas. Essentially, it uses the area’s potential, considers its specificity, involvement of the local community in the process of change, and the rational use of new and existing technologies. Despite its growing popularity, the concept is in the early formulation stage. This article determines the current state-of-the-art of the smart village concept based on a bibliometric analysis of scientific articles collected from the Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases and on a qualitative document analysis of the major smart village initiatives. The bibliometric analysis included 351 articles published until the end of 2021. Qualitative document analysis was performed on nine initiatives implemented in different world regions. As a result, detailed bibliometric metrics of the global smart village publication output were presented, characterizing the development and current state of the smart village concept. The authors point out the multidimensionality of the concept, propose its contemporary definition, and identify its basic dimensions: people, economy, living, energy, environment, mobility, and governance, thus creating a methodological basis for the planning, design and implementation of smart village projects.}

abstract = {A smart city provides a high quality of life to its inhabitants through optimal management of its resources. By definition a smart city is equipped with smart infrastructure that provides improved quality of life with sustainable environment through smart built solutions. In their operation, smart cities would entail a highly reliable, energy efficient, and high-quality power; smart grid becomes obviously imperative. Energy management is demanded within such urban centers due to the complexity of the energy systems and their important role. Mathematical simulation and predictions are the major tools commonly used to assess the technological and policy impacts of smart solutions. Distributed energy systems can be represented in the form of microgrids and combined heat and power. As cities are developed to become smarter, energy form and access to it become consequently even more integral part of modern living forms. Newer energy systems must also be transformed to become increasingly more reliable and resilient. Solar cells and wind energy technologies remain the best candidates in terms of new major energy sources in smart cities even with their dependence on natural processes. These energy sources should remain the future backbone of smart energy systems. In fact, solar panels for practical applications in buildings have made such substantial jumps since their inception a few years ago that prices have remarkably dropped worldwide. However, the transition to a fuller solar-wind energy economy arrives with a drastic set of challenges, including inherent inefficiencies in current energy battery storage capabilities. This is particularly apparent in the transport sector, which has the most trouble when anticipating its energy transition. Considering the unavoidable intermittent nature of wind and solar energy supply within a day, week, month, traditional centralized power production, and distribution are questionable. If unchanged, it will be more difficult to maintain a robust energy provision. The integration of wind and solar into practical energy system in cities demands significant investment.}

abstract = {Equity and inclusion continue to pose significant challenges for many cities. Disparities in access to resources and facilities among the residents of these areas are often influenced by factors such as geographical location and income level, among others. Therefore, creating a quantitative basis to detect spatial and socio-economic inequities in residents' access to vital infrastructures is crucial for advancing smart cities. This paper introduces a novel measure of Spatial Inequity that is based on 1) computing building-level scores for each building in terms of access to facilities, and 2) comparing the distribution of the scores of these facilities using the Gini coefficient. The proposed building-level scores will enable the identification of GIS hotspots at a high resolution. Then, the Gini-based measure will facilitate a comparison of the distribution of the scores, and determine if they are evenly distributed and equitably accessible. The Gini coefficient was highest (0.89) for waste management and elderly care, and lowest (0.56) for hospitals, reflecting varying levels of inequality. This study applies this Spatial Ineqity methodological framework to Hong Kong, a representative of Highly Dense Cities. The framework benchmarks urban infrastructure, identifies hotspots, and selects interventions for equitable urban development.}

abstract = {Background
Some individuals seeking recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD) attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) while others choose newer alternatives such as Self-Management and Recovery Training (“SMART” Recovery). Some even attend both, while some choose not to attend either. Little is known about why people choose which pathway(s), and what they like, dislike, and find helpful. Greater knowledge could provide insights into the phenomenology of recovery experiences and enhance the efficiency of clinical linkage to these resources.
Methods
Cross-sectional, qualitative, investigation (N = 80; n = 20 per condition; 50%female) of individuals attending either AA-only, SMART-only, both, or neither. Participants were asked why they initially chose that pathway, what they like and dislike, and what helps. Responses were coded using an inductive grounded theory approach with utterances recorded and categorized into superordinate domains and rank-ordered in terms of frequency across each question and recovery pathway.
Results
AA participants reported attending due to, as well as liking and finding most helpful, the common socio-community aspects, whereas SMART attendees went initially due to, as well as found most helpful, the different format as well as the CBT/science-based approach. Similar to AA, however, SMART participants liked the socio-community aspects most. “Both” participants reported liking and finding helpful these perceived relative strengths of each organization. “Neither” participants reported reasons for non-attendance related to lower problem severity – perceiving no need to attend, and anxiety about privacy, but reported using recovery-related change strategies similar to those prescribed by AA, SMART and treatment (e.g., stimulus control, competing behaviors). Common dislikes for AA and SMART centered around irritation due to other members behaviors, a need for more SMART meetings, and negative experiences with SMART facilitators.
Conclusion
Common impressions exist among individuals selecting different recovery pathway choices, but also some differences in keeping with the group dynamics and distinct approaches inherent in AA and SMART. AA attendees appear to go initially for the recovery buoyancy derived from the social ethos and camaraderie of lived experience and may end up staying for the same reason; those choosing SMART, in contrast, appear to attend initially for the CBT/science-based content and different approach but, like AA participants, may end up staying due to the same camaraderie of lived experience. Those participating in both AA and SMART appear to capitalize on the strengths of each organization, suggesting that some can psychologically accommodate and make use of theoretically distinct, and sometimes opposing, philosophies and practices.}

However, complex functions such as matrix operations are difficult to implement on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based smart contract platforms due to their distributed security environment limitations. Existing off-chain methods often result in a significant reduction in contract execution efficiency, thus a platform software development kit interface implementation method has become a feasible way to reduce overheads, but this method cannot verify operation correctness and may leak sensitive user data. To solve the above problems, we propose a verifiable EVM-based smart contract cross-language implementation scheme for complex operations, especially matrix operations, which can guarantee operation correctness and user privacy while ensuring computational efficiency. In this scheme, a verifiable interaction process is designed to verify the computation process and results, and a matrix blinding technology is introduced to protect sensitive user data in the calculation process. The security analysis and performance tests show that the proposed scheme can satisfy the correctness and privacy of the cross-language implementation of smart contracts at a small additional efficiency cost.}

This paper used the binary choice model to investigate the main factors influencing the establishment of Smart Logistics in Chinese cities, and whether carbon emissions are the cause of the establishment of Smart Logistics. Secondly, it analyzed the effect of SLP on carbon emissions using a difference-in-differences (DID) model. The results reveal that freight volume, logistics employment, and total social retail are important factors determining whether a city should establish Smart Logistics or not. Additionally, the decision whether to establish Smart Logistics is an exogenous policy variable to carbon emissions. The implementation of SLP can restrain carbon emissions significantly, with a continuous impact in the second year. Based on the findings of this paper, a series of policy implications with respect to promote the development of Smart Logistics were proposed.}

We developed a binary discrete choice model to assess the factors affecting the changes of the bus line, including the time of day, peak periods, day of the week, number of trips taken by users, type of user, and destination of the trip. We address some research gaps identified in the recent literature by examining factors that influence user behaviour in addition to uncovering urban mobility patterns. The results of a Logit choice model are discussed considering the attributes of the service and of the journey to support evidence-based policy making for adapting bus service design, drawing insights from extensive smart card dataset analysis. Our findings indicate that users are generally inclined to bus line shifts than using the same lines, with such changes occurring more frequently during late hours and inter-peak periods compared to the morning and afternoon peak hours. Additionally, regular users are more likely to change lines than occasional users, and trips with discounts and smart card usage for transfers on trips home tend to involve different lines. Several policy measures can be considered to mitigate passenger discomfort associated with changing bus lines and to reduce operational costs arising from multiple lines serving the same locations. These include investing in promotional efforts to enhance the image of specific bus lines, prioritising certain lines during the day to minimise travel times and retain passengers on the same bus, adjusting line frequencies to reduce the need for transfers, and offering additional incentives to frequent users. Implementing discounts in corridors with shorter travel times can also encourage passengers to remain on the same buses.}

A qualitative approach, based on semi-structured interviews was undertaken. The findings revealed that involvement in smart destination development is based on relational influences that were based on existing collaborative relationships. Organisational factors influenced supplier engagement prior to and during collaboration. Engagement influences are also specific to the destination context, which were related to historical cultural norms. These further facilitated or hindered suppliers' involvement.

Our main findings are as follows: (1) The primary finding provides solid evidence of the positive impact of smart transportation technology on green total factor productivity, which means smart transportation technology effectively and efficiently accelerates the green development process. (2) The asymmetric nexus between smart transportation technology and green total factor productivity indicates that smart transportation technology plays a more powerful role in areas with lower levels of green total factor productivity despite the fact that a positive relationship exists across all quantiles. (3) The increasing green total factor productivity effect caused by smart transportation technology development is realized through enhanced energy consumption efficiency and industrial structure transition.

abstract = {Contributing to the broader concept of a sociable smart city enabling a transforming society into a more participative domain where innovation takes place, the chapter addresses the economic revitalization of Middellandstraat, a multicultural shopping street in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Through a growing influx of immigrants, Middellandstraat has evolved into a unique multicultural neighborhood with a similar mix of shops. This chapter aims to push the current envelope of the smart city debate by adding a culture-sensitive design perspective on placemaking. This elaborates upon learnings from a local contextually grounded design project in the context smart city revitalization challenge and promotes design as a means to improve and revitalize the street. After presenting the rich insights of the contextual study, the chapter describes the findings of the culture-sensitive design approach following its four stages and the resulting concept, called SmaakReis. Next, barriers and enablers of culture-sensitive design are discussed along five themes that are found key in designing for the revitalization of the shopping street and reflect on the value of design and cocreation. Based on the lessons learned, the chapter concludes with ten guidelines for smart urban design and implementation. It can be concluded that SmaakReis was helpful in codesigning futures with the local stakeholders and enabled them to act on the designed smart city vision in aligning their strategic activities. Interestingly the implementation of the SmaakReis concept in one of the local restaurants stresses the importance of capacity building and the relevance of the guidelines for cultural and local embedment.}

abstract = {Since smart city initiatives were first launched in the late 20th century, the conversations and discussions that fuel their continued research have evolved very little. Their primary ambitions remain fixed on an interrelated set of pragmatic goals: the optimization of infrastructural functionality, the efficient use and distribution of resources, and the pursuit of a perfect model for an ideal city enabled by state-of-the-art sensory technologies and artificial intelligence. As many of our daily interactions, behaviors, social relationships, and personal information can be measured by advanced sensory technologies to achieve these goals, Smart Cities often risk reducing an immense amount of data to fundamental, fixed, or absolute truths. Echoing the CIAM congress’ post-war functionalist visions, “Smart” Cities may become complicit in a past ideology of Modernity rather than a model for the future as they overlook the significance of infrastructures that support unpredictable human behavior such as creativity, and experimental learning in a healthy society. Therefore it is the imperative of this paper to assert the value of play spaces as social activators within the network of the city and to address the activity of play more seriously as we explore future possibilities of healthy, resilient, and responsive cities that grow and evolve over time. As an essential function of society and for cultural production at large, play provides the environment for free experimentation, abstraction, concept generation, and learning. We argue that it is the role of architecture and the city to facilitate, support, and scaffold the participatory engagement of people—of all ages—in producing new knowledge, schema, and perceptions about the world. In the projects shown in this chapter, this scaffolding is materialized into architecture that guides a participating audience into various play-based learning environments—some more physical, some more digital, and some in between.}

We use the concept of sociotechnical imaginary and thematic analysis of AR-related media content to explore main narrations in the current discourse on AR and smart urban spaces. We identify two dominant themes: “smart information in place” and “subversion of meaning” that combine two ways of thinking about relation between place and AR. In the first one, AR acts not as an augmentation of place, but as a reducer of the experience of place down to seeing the world as information and data for the achievement of efficiencies in late capitalism. In the second one, AR can be seen as transcending the traditional constellations of power relations that shape places and spaces of modern cities, skewing them toward nonhuman actors, of which AR may be the most visible and influential. Through the visible differentiation of users, alteration of perception and the forcing of presence and behavior, AR is a technology that makes visible the systems and processes of control and mediation of space and place. As such, the smart space itself will become visible through the presence, use, and functioning of AR in a manner that has not been the case previously. We posit, therefore, that AR can be seen as a physical manifestation of the agency of place. This position can have consequences for the practical development of smart spaces and for theoretical consideration of the human-technology interaction in urban space in its material and digital dimensions.}

In this study, a novel methodology that leverages artificial intelligence and computer science techniques is proposed to solve the problem of cooperative energy demand planning. Specifically, Constraint programming (CP) is used to minimize the Peak-to-Average ratio (PAR), optimize cost savings, and ensure secure energy trading within a community of heterogeneous smart homes. To guarantee the integrity of information exchanges during energy trading, a blockchain structure is employed. The efficiency and computing performance of the CP method are compared with Mixed integer programming (MIP) solutions for a range of load profiles. Simulations demonstrate that both techniques effectively handle the proposed scheduling of collective smart buildings in a community of up to 100 smart homes. In particular, both approaches can effectively reduce the cost of electricity by 10% and 7% respectively, and lower PAR by 25%. However, the CP algorithm outperforms the MIP-based solutions in terms of efficiency and speed in dealing with large-scale optimization issues.}

Urban settlements in such terrain are exposed to widespread destruction due to these sudden slope movements. Predicting slope failures using Newmark algorithm has been a traditional way of estimating landslide distribution in the aftermath of a strong shallow focus earthquake. Mobility of the slope as represented by the equivalent coefficient of friction is a strong indicator of the destruction caused by the landslides. In this work we evaluate the vulnerability of urban settlements to earthquake induced landslides using a relation developed for mobility of rock slides caused by earthquakes. Seven landslide sites that were identified by field survey after the devastating earthquake of magnitude Mw 6.9 in the Indian state of Sikkim, were used as a case study to assess the mobility and predicted displacement. Results suggest that larger landslides have a higher mobility and are more destructive than smaller rockslides. Landslide with a friction coefficient value of 0.8403 was responsible for severely damaging and blocking the highway. A preliminary model that correlated volume and Newmark’s displacement is obtained from the data in this study however, this model needs to be validated with a larger dataset for better accuracy. We propose that the mobility of landslides can be used to assess the vulnerability of urban settlements to earthquake induced landslides in steep terrain. Software that predicts the ground motion and generate reliable strong motion data can be integrated with automated disaster warning system in smart cities.}

The ontology associates ‘smartness’ to different building operation domains and assigns their functionalities to agents involved in the flow of data and decision making. It enables control paths to be traced back to specific people, machines, and companies behind smart operations – including those that appear to be ‘external’ to a smart building. Based on Actor-Network Theory (ANT), the ontology connects knowledge from the social sciences to technical knowledge from building design, construction, operation and controls. The need in developing this ontology originates from the limits of conventional design and engineering ontologies, particularly with respect to their unproblematic take on the interplay between different social and technical systems and their neglect to model the varied abilities of stakeholders to exert control over, and benefit from, the technical systems and operations. The proposed ontology addresses these gaps by offering a more realistic and versatile model of inter-agents relationships. It can also highlight points of consented and unconsented data leakage and associated security issues. This knowledge becomes critical for designing and managing increasingly more complex smart building systems.}

This paper is along this line of thought. In particular, we try to present a method to model the cognitive state of human interest. This is done to take one more step towards the realization of a smart cognitive city. An approach which is Subjective–Objective in nature is presented to model the computation of activity inspired by interest. Based on activity, human latent state values are indirectly deduced. Inspiration is drawn from Physics and interest is modeled upon the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Concepts of Adaptive filtering are used to formulate an evolving transformation function that automatically and adaptively models the conversion of interest into activity. Particle filter is employed to provide an elucidation which is computationally feasible. To validate the viability of the method, experimentation is performed with real datasets.}

abstract = {The increased adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the daily life of consumers have led towards the emergence of greener smart cities. However, the problem of energy stability, i.e., balancing the demand and supply, remains persistent in the context of charging stations (CSs). To solve this problem, a unique conceptual solution using EVs has been presented in this paper. The proposed solution deals with the problem of managing the miscellaneous power or power deficit at the CSs by utilizing EVs-as-a-service (EVaaS). On one hand, EVaaS provides opportunities to the owner of EVs to earn profit and on the other hand, it helps to balance the demand and supply at the CSs. This concept works in two steps; (1) EV-as-a-buyer: EVs act as energy buyers and CSs act as energy sellers, and (2) EV-as-a-seller: EVs act as energy sellers and CSs act as energy buyers. In EVaaS paradigm, the CSs are placed in residential, commercial, and industrial areas which broadcast their price for buying (or selling) the deficit (or excess) power from (or to) the EVs. The EVs would then decide whether to charge (or discharge) their battery power from (or at) which CSs based on the factors such as–price and distance. If both the parties come to an agreement, then the EVs would travel to the specified location and exchange the energy with CSs. For the smooth movement of EVs in the smart city, a mobility model is also designed. In addition, this approach also utilizes the software defined networking (SDN) paradigm for enabling faster communication between the entities involved. For this purpose, a flow management scheme is designed for efficient data transfer between EVs and CSs. Through this study, it has been shown that such a strategy for energy trading would help the CSs to balance their load requirements as well as provide profit to the EV owners. The results prove that SDN improves the communication in terms of delay, throughput and network utilization over the conventional networks; while EVs can be successfully utilized to manage the load requirements of various CSs to gain a significant amount of profit.}

The paper dwelt largely on a review of literature on the subject, which was accessed from a wide range of databases using online search engines and by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results indicate that smart homes enhance the comfort of the dwellers, ensure the diversification of energy sources and use, promote inclusiveness in the provision of housing and present an avenue for environmental cleanliness. Based on these benefits, and in an era of sustainable cities, the authorities of the cities in North America and Europe are encouraging the adoption of smart homes by urbanites. However, there is insufficient data to assess the level of adoption of smart housing in SSA although anecdotally the rate of adoption may be low. This is partly attributed to the region’s low levels of literacy, income and technological penetration. The paper recommends the strengthening of local economies, creating awareness about the value of smart homes, creating smart home incentives and adapting the design of affordable housing schemes to assume the nature of smart homes as good strategies to foster a sustainable adoption of smart housing in the sub-region.}

abstract = {Electricity is one of the mandatory commodities for mankind today. To address challenges and issues in the transmission of electricity through the traditional grid, the concepts of smart grids and demand response have been developed. In such systems, a large amount of data is generated daily from various sources such as power generation (e.g., wind turbines), transmission and distribution (microgrids and fault detectors), load management (smart meters and smart electric appliances). Thanks to recent advancements in big data and computing technologies, Deep Learning (DL) can be leveraged to learn the patterns from the generated data and predict the demand for electricity and peak hours. Motivated by the advantages of deep learning in smart grids, this paper sets to provide a comprehensive survey on the application of DL for intelligent smart grids and demand response. Firstly, we present the fundamental of DL, smart grids, demand response, and the motivation behind the use of DL. Secondly, we review the state-of-the-art applications of DL in smart grids and demand response, including electric load forecasting, state estimation, energy theft detection, energy sharing and trading. Furthermore, we illustrate the practicality of DL via various use cases and projects. Finally, we highlight the challenges presented in existing research works and highlight important issues and potential directions in the use of DL for smart grids and demand response.}

abstract = {A decrease in population is an emerging challenge in China's urbanization trajectory. This study utilizes data from the Sixth and Seventh Population Censuses to identify Chinese cities experiencing population decline, focusing on prefecture-level cities. It employs 30 indicators relevant to nine Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) concerning urban areas and populations to evaluate the progress of these shrinking cities in 2010 and 2020. A novel metric, "SDG population elasticity", is introduced to quantify the association between population reduction and SDG indexes. The study employs K-means++ clustering for 130 shrinking cities. The findings reveal that out of the 130 cities, 63 exhibit a downward trend in SDG index scores, predominantly in China's northeast and western regions. The Northeast region has negative SDG population elasticity, indicating a lag in sustainable development compared to that in other areas. Additionally, the research categorizes China's shrinking cities into four groups: cities with strong population elasticity feedback-significantly declining SDGs, cities with weak population elasticity feedback-slightly regressing SDGs, cities with high population loss-negative SDGs in decline, and cities with smart population decline-steady SDGs growth. These findings offer a foundation for crafting bespoke policies in shrinking cities to ensure a balanced approach to sustainable development and monitor advancement toward achieving the SDGs.}

MMT addition enhanced the film's mechanical, barrier, thermal, and water resistance properties. Incorporating ANT extracted from roselle calyx into the optimal nanocomposite film (MMT/PVA-HAS II) increased the films' antioxidant, pH-response, and antibacterial properties. FTIR, XRD, and SEM confirmed the intermolecular interactions and even distribution of ANT and MMT in the film matrix. Release rate of ANT was dependent on type of simulant, with higher rate in aqueous solutions compared to alcoholic/fatty food simulants, and cytotoxicity evaluation proved safety of films for food packaging applications.

abstract = {Shale gas and oil, as unconventional clean energy sources, has shown growing importance to addressing increasingly serious energy crisis. The bottleneck limiting widespread shale development and utilization is the large amounts of water consumptions during well drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. However, little attention has been paid to water use policies when multiple resources can be concurrently available; moreover, previous studies using mathematical models can only depend on clear understanding of stringent physical law, implied mechanisms, and quantitative data. Focusing on twelve shale regions in Southwest China, we construct the first knowledge graph (KG) in the world and then use a RippleNet algorithm (RNA) to fulfill smart recommendation of water use policies base on the KG. By comparing results under four scenarios, we find that the identified policies vary with accessible cities and water resources, depending on the priority experience (i.e., historical records) input to RNA. Three mathematically based programming models are parallelly developed to generate optimal water use policies for comparing with those from smart recommendation. Similarities are found among the policies though discrepancies occur in part of scenarios. Despite the difficulty in evaluating the priority of each policy, the most remarkable advantage in this smart recommendation lie in the 1) independence on quantitative data (from monitoring or statistics) and mechanism modeling, and 2) capability of using a preference probability to suggest the likelihood or preference of each policy to be recommended. Outputs from this research provides new technical implication on developing conjunctive water-use and energy-extraction policies.}

On the other hand, there is an urgent need to address the security concerns related to smart grids. Recently, the PALK scheme was designed, which its designers claimed to be a secure protocol and work efficiently. Our revision proved that it contains two security vulnerabilities; user anonymity and guessing password attacks. So, in this paper, we designed a lightweight and robust authentication and key agreement protocol LSPA based on ECC for smart grid. The LSPA takes into consideration the flaws in the PALK scheme. It was verified formally by the Scyther tool to show that it withstands many attacks. Moreover, the informal proof shows that the LSPA scheme is secure and resistant to many attacks. Finally, the performance analysis for PALK and LSPA shows that LSPA is better in terms of communications and computations costs than the PALK scheme.}

abstract = {Smart window controls the visible light transmittance and solar heat gain coefficient through the transition to a clear or tint state. When applied in buildings, it can be an effective solution in terms of visual and thermal environment by controlling solar radiation. Various previous studies have provided smart windows’ effective performance results related to the visual or thermal environment, however, these studies were mostly based on numerical simulations or small-scale test cells. Few studies have comprehensively analyzed smart windows’ performance when applied to real buildings. Accordingly, this study aimed to analyze and evaluate the performance of smart windows applied in residential buildings related to the visual and thermal environments from various perspectives. For this purpose, we installed suspended particle device smart windows in an apartment building, i.e., a typical residential building type in South Korea, set up related sensors and equipment and collected data from July to September 2022. Based on this campaign, we evaluated visual and thermal comfort and lighting and cooling energy performance according to the sky condition (cloudy, partly cloudy, and clear days) and smart window tinting control method (always tinting, automatic control to maintain the indoor daylight illuminance at 200 lx, and automatic control to maintain the illuminance at 400 lx). In terms of glare, on partly cloudy and clear days, smart windows effectively controlled glare regardless of the tinting control method. In terms of the indoor daylight illuminance, automated control was more effective than always tinting in terms of providing useful daylight under all sky conditions. In terms of thermal comfort, tinting at all times was the most effective on partly cloudy and clear days. The lighting energy consumption increased by 3.9–17.9% when smart windows were used, while the cooling energy consumption was reduced by 0.0–20.5%. Overall, this study revealed that the appropriate smart window operation method varied depending on the sky condition. On cloudy day, maintenance of the indoor daylight illuminance at 200 lx using automated control was efficient. On partly cloudy and clear day, the automated control (200 lx or 400 lx) was efficient in terms of visual comfort, however, in terms of thermal comfort and energy consumption, tinting at all times was effective. This suggested that completely tinting smart window in conjunction with automatic artificial lighting control to ensure proper indoor illuminance could be the most effective on a partly cloudy day and a clear day. Based on this study, it is necessary to derive more detailed optimal smart window operation strategies in terms of glare, indoor daylight illuminance, thermal comfort, and energy consumption for all seasons.}

However, they are also associated with risks such as increased congestion and inequality. This paper argues that state intervention is essential in order to mitigate such risks, and steer smart mobility in a way that contributes to the delivery of sustainable transport. We use London and Seattle as case studies to explore whether the regulation they have introduced can hold smart mobility providers accountable for their impacts on the urban environment, and if the accountability arrangements that are in place in each city can help local governments achieve their strategic goals for smart mobility. Our original finding is that there are three key features of regulations that are essential for shaping and steering smart mobility: regulations should be directed to specific types of smart mobility; should clearly set out providers' responsibilities and what happens if they fail to fulfill them; and should seek to clearly align the smart mobility offer with the cities' long-term strategies. We conclude that Seattle's regulatory approach is more likely to help the city achieve its ambitions for smart mobility, but we also highlight that regulation is only one element of smart mobility governance and careful consideration needs to be given to the role, if any, smart mobility will play in delivering a sustainable transport future.}

Results indicate that cities with larger and more interconnected innovation networks, exhibiting balanced participation from diverse stakeholders, and predominantly led by the private sector and research institutions, are more likely to be successfully chosen for the Cities European Mission. This research provides a novel insight into the role of urban innovation systems in the journey towards decarbonization, accentuating the significant influence of European institutional structures in moulding these networks. By focusing on urban networks as a metric for assessing the progress towards climate neutrality, this study offers a fresh perspective that diverges from traditional regional or transnational analyses. The findings have substantial implications for policymakers and urban planners, underscoring the need for fostering robust innovation networks as a strategy to achieve climate neutrality. Additionally, the results pave the way for future research on optimizing resource allocation within urban innovation systems, ultimately contributing to the broader objectives of the European Green Deal.}

Employing a case study analysis, we illustrate the phenomenon of symbolic compliance, where sub-national public and private actors comply with state-level mandates but while being aware that their actions will fall short of achieving the desired improvements. This behavior, hitherto undocumented in the literature, contributes to the implementation of data-driven public service management solutions that inadequately address local governmental issues. Our findings prompt a re-evaluation of multi-level governance theory and practice in new authoritarian settings and underscore the need for a more pragmatic approach to smart government transitions in such contexts.}

It’s imperative for smart cities to have smart disaster response systems so they can easily manage natural disasters efficiently such as tsunamis, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Lately, the Internet of Things (IoT) provided several solutions to confront the disaster concerns such as early cautions, remote controlling, data analysis and knowledge building. To evaluate the performance of the smart disaster response systems, there are a group of criteria that need to be measured. This study proposed an integrated framework to evaluate the performance of smart disaster response systems under uncertainty. Due to ensure a more accurate evaluation process, the proposed framework is based on plithogenic set theory that handles ambiguity and uncertainty in evaluation by considering the contradiction degree between the evaluation criteria. The problem of performance evaluation of the smart disaster response systems is formulated as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The proposed framework is constructed using three common MCDM methods which is AHP, TOSIS, and VIKOR. Five smart disaster response systems will be evaluated in order to improve the reliability of the proposed framework.}

Motivated by applications such as renewables integration and electrification of transportation, the paradigm shift towards smart-cities naturally inspires information systems design for energy storages. The goal of this paper is to understand the economic value of future market information to increase the efficiency of the energy market. From storages’ perspective, we investigate energy storages’ optimal decentralized buying and selling decisions under market uncertainty. Different potential policy interventions are discussed: (1) providing a publicly available market forecasting channel; (2) encouraging decentralized storages to share their private forecasts with each other; (3) releasing additional market information to a targeted subset of storages exclusively. Through these system level discussions, we evaluate different information management policies to coordinate storages’ actions and improve their profitability. The key findings of this work include (1) a storage's payoff first increases then decreases in its private information precision. The over-precision in forecasts can lead to even lower payoffs; (2) communication among the storages could fail to achieve a coordinated effort to increase market efficiency; (3) it is optimal to release additional information to a subset of energy storages exclusively by targeted information release.}

EVs, being shiftable loads can provide system flexibility. This work investigates the potential role of smart charging of EVs in mitigating the impact of the integration of a mix of residential and public EV charging infrastructure on power networks. Furthermore, the impact of integrating solar photo-voltaic (PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) has been explored where BESS improves PV self-consumption and helps in peak shaving during peak load hours. Annual losses, transformer congestion, and cost of electricity import assessment are detailed by considering the power network of Stockholm as a case study. Smart charging with loss-optimal and cost-optimal charging strategies are compared to uncoordinated charging. The cost-optimal charging strategy is more favorable as compared to the loss-optimal charging strategy as it provides more incentives to the DSOs. The loss-optimal charging strategy reduces 35.5 % of losses in the network can be reduced while the cost-optimal solution provides a 4.3 % reduction in the electricity cost. The combined implementation of smart charging, PV, and BESS considerably improves energy and economic performance and is more effective than EV smart charging alone.}

Within this environment, flexible home energy management policies that minimize household energy costs can be adopted. This paper considers a smart home with a renewable energy source that favors satisfying its energy needs at minimum cost. This is achievable by smartly scheduling the use of its domestic appliances to match a given energy grid tariff. Focusing on the case of Egypt in which an inclining block rate (IBR) tariff is imposed, this paper fills a gap in the literature regarding the load scheduling models aiming to minimize energy cost at the household level whenever such a tariff exists. A new mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) model is formulated for this scheduling problem, considering the adopted net metering system with installed domestic photovoltaic (PV) systems in Egypt. The model generates the optimal household load schedule and the optimal amounts of energy to exchange with the grid while considering all the system and consumer utility constraints. To assess the applicability of the proposed model, a survey is conducted to identify the diversity and characteristics of using the electrical appliances by the Egyptian households. Based on the collected survey results, the effectiveness of the proposed MIQP model is investigated. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model to minimize energy cost for different categories of the Egyptian households.}

General assessment of the level of city security in the world has been carried out by a leading company in Japan, NEC. In the security campaign conducted by NEC in 2017 [2], Indonesia has a relatively low-security value compared to other countries. The researchers assessed that the low value of city security in Indonesia is less relevant when viewed from the current state of the city. For this reason, the researchers collect other values that are owned by Indonesia and not owned by other countries to be used as an assessment material that Indonesia has a safe city. In the preparation of the literature review, this will produce a conceptual safe city model to provide a measure of city security assessment by the characteristics of cities in Indonesia.}

abstract = {Edge sensing data in smart grid provides vast valuable information, which promotes further innovated smart power applications in Internet of things (IoT) oriented smart cities and society. While in power load prediction, the potential relationships between the time series of power load data and the characteristics of temperature, weather and date, have not been explored comprehensively, which degrades the accuracy of load prediction in smart grid. In order to extract the generalized features and latent relationships in power load related edge sensing data, a power load prediction scheme based on edge sensing data-imaging conversion (DIC) is proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy in smart cites and society. DIC employs empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for power load time series data and combines it with characteristic time series including temperature, weather and date to form an image-like structure. And a DIC-based convolutional neural network (DI-CNN) is presented to implement convolution. Experimental results show that, compared with long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and CNN, the proposed DIC scheme improves the training speed by 61.7 %, reduces root mean square error (RMSE) by 32.9 % at least, and enhances the prediction accuracy by 1.4 %.}

This paper argues that current debates around 4IR are centred on the urban core, with rural areas being relegated to the peripherality and the remainder. The paper therefore examines these technologies from a rural perspective and considers what impact they could have in rural areas, both positive and negative. The analysis shows that the impacts of 4IR technologies could be just as important in rural as in urban places. Drawing on extant theories of rural development, the paper examines the physical and cultural barriers facing rural areas when attempting to engage with 4IR. The paper concludes by proposing that rural theorists engage with smart urban theoretical debates. New research should seek to understand the multi-faceted aspects of 4IR in rural regions, and to support the transition to smart rural futures.}

abstract = {Data-driven urbanism is often entangled with the smart city and practiced in a way that prioritizes control over physical objects and downplays the human and political aspects of data. We label this approach ‘hard city sensing’ (HCS) and we argue that the rise of the ‘digital city’ offers the empirical foundation for more humanistic approaches. Driven by the ambition to untangle data-driven urbanism from HCS, this paper reviews two decades of scholarship that has used digital traces as an empirical ground for understanding urban phenomena. The review identifies four distinct ways of working with digital traces of which three pave the way for new ways of problematizing the city. Instead of abandoning the idea of data-driven urbanism, we propose the framework of 'soft city sensing' (SCS) as way to re-engage with it with inspiration from these pioneering works. However, this requires a willingness to revisit central epistemological commitments that currently serve as standards for how to “properly” do data projects. We therefore urge qualitative urban scholars to ponder the possibilities of furthering their urban interest by ‘thinking with algorithms’ while retaining their interpretative ambitions just as we identify a need for urban decion-makers to expand their criteria for what serves as valid data inputs to urban planning.}

This research analyzes the feasibility of modernizing the system using 304 mini photovoltaic generation plants, implementing a novel lighting system control process that indirectly uses sky brightness measurements based on current research at the Catholic University of Cuenca. As a case study, the Historic Center of the City of Cuenca-Ecuador, a World Heritage Site, whose system is made up of 1,252 luminaires, is analyzed. The results conclude that it is feasible to modernize the lighting service with the adoption of the proposed technologies and for control, a novel system based on indirect measurement of sky clarity has been developed. Finally, the political implications are analyzed in the framework of energy efficiency and modernization of the systems, as well as the recommendation to the political decision-makers. The study can be replicated in other cities of the world with similar characteristics.}

One such application of these technologies is the reduction of the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) energy needs and GHG emissions using smart control systems. The environmental benefits of smart control systems during building operation have been explored in many studies, however, their embodied effects, associated with the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing and replacement are often overlooked. Accordingly, this study quantifies the life cycle energy needs and GHG emissions of a smart HVAC control system and assesses its potential for reducing the HVAC operational energy and GHG emissions in an Australian office building. A comparative assessment is performed, considering a traditional HVAC control system and an equivalent smart HVAC control system. The components of both the traditional and smart control systems are specified based on the characteristics of these systems as well as the layout of the serviced spaces in the reference building. The embodied energy and GHG emissions of both the traditional and smart control systems are quantified through a hybrid life cycle inventory (LCI) approach. To evaluate the effects of these control systems on the building HVAC operational energy, a building energy simulation is performed by applying the control logics of both systems. The results show that energy and GHG emissions savings in the HVAC operational offset the additional energy needs and GHG emissions of deploying the smart HVAC control system.}

Smart technologies have the potential to transform cities, but the idiosyncrasies of counties pose some specific challenges in relation to geography, distance, remote populations, isolated communities, obligations to the state, and necessary relations and collaboration with neighboring municipalities. Some smart technologies, such as in utilities, will be best implemented when planned and organized by a regional organization that spans across cities and counties. Other technologies can be planned and implemented internally to serve the county residents, while some will require complicated agreements with neighboring municipalities and participating private entities and corporations. In all cases, the triad of major participants in this transformation are corporations, government, and citizens with all the inner power dynamics such coexistence creates. The smartification process spans a wide spectrum of county departments, and each one has the potential to address county challenges, be involved, and benefit accordingly. When implementing smart technologies, however, it is important to keep in mind general considerations of economy, society, environment, quality of life, and “place” as general guides in policy creation and understand that the goal is not to simply implement technology and acquire the label “smart city” and “smart county,” but instead, to benefit the community, improve quality of life, and create “place.” This presents a juxtaposition of instrumental versus value-based approaches to smart technologies, which is a major philosophical issue at the base of the theoretical implications of smartification. An instrumental approach has the potential of deducing inadequate conclusions by focusing solely on sensor inputs and ignoring the multilayered experience of the human milieu, while a value-based approach will always keep in mind the values of the community to guide policymaking. Finally, it is paramount not to forget that Smart Growth is an entirely different phenomenon than smart technologies, which, contrary to smart growth, have limitations in creating architectural and urban spaces. Both approach quality of life from a very different perspective, can both contribute positive results, but smart technologies lack the ability to create a foundation of good urbanism.}

The solution is solved for as a predictive optimization problem that determines the height of the UAV to dynamically change it to ensure the optimal communication coverage of vehicular nodes. Moreover, the solution considers UAV energy consumption constraints when setting the optimal height of the UAV. Additionally, the optimal distance between every two adjacent UAVs is also considered to avoid any coverage overlapping while protecting their connectivity. Extensive evaluations were considered in terms of both implementation and simulation to test the proposed model. Evaluation results show that the proposed solution can predict vehicle traffic patterns accurately to ensure proper adjustments of the UAV height. Moreover, network coverage is ensured for areas with and without fixed BS availability with the support of the self-positioning UAVs while adhering to QoS requirements.}

Today, the relationship between various urban systems, such as transportation, communication and business networks, is very complicated. These complexities have greatly enhanced the importance of intelligent and quick coordination of cities with modern technologies. Internet of Things (IoT) one of the new technologies in the present era, and its application in cities can be considered as a major innovation for sustainable urban development. A smart city is a city that has the ability to effectively provide and present data in a meaningful way. On the other hand, today, with the expansion of the influence of Electric Vehicles (EV) in the transportation industry and the need for these EV to charge their battery, it is impossible to ignore the impact of these EV on the smart grid. In this thesis, the presence of EV in the context of urban and IoT is examined. As we use the intelligent city and the IoT, the historical data can be collected from the behavior of the owners of EV and the Deep learning method, one of the methods of machine learning; can be used to predict the level of charging of EV when entering the parking lot, EV location and parking lot connection periods. This will make us more successful in optimizing energy management, which is designed to minimize operational costs. The proposed model has been implemented on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization method for scheduling of distribution network in the presence of EV in the GAMS software environment. The results showed that the net profit is increased under the proposed plan.}

Recent attention to the developments focusing on the educational services has been noteworthy, with the educational environment specifically the smart campus emerging both as a domain and as an opportunity. As a domain worthy of exploration, a number of research efforts are being conceptualized around smart campus initiatives. The existing bouquet of research publications on smart campus provides a testimony of the enthusiasm and also exposes the heterogeneous attempts the domain has witnessed to date. The available evidence is still inadequate to provide clarity on the thrust areas of research around smart campus.
Design/methodology/approach
Given the understanding, this study intends to decode the domain to get an early impression of the focus of the research concentration around smart campus. Thereby the study resorts to an automated text-mining approach using Python on contents shortlisted systematically, and published between the period 2010 and May 2022, from select databases.
Findings
Based on the analysis it was possible to identify eight themes (i.e. smart campus characteristics, smart campus stakeholders, smart campus frameworks, smart campus technologies, smart campus infrastructure, smart campus evaluation, smart learning environment and smart campus applications) characterizing research efforts within the smart campus literature.
Originality/value
The themes around the smart campus showcase the thrust areas receiving attention. These characterize extant research endeavours in the smart campus domain and can offer useful pointers to researchers going forward. This awareness can also be beneficial to institutional leadership and technology providers intending to implement smart campus initiatives, contributing to the development of the educational environment.}

Recently, the daylighting control characteristic of optical concentrators have drawn considerable research attentions owing to their variable transmittance in response to sun motion. In this research, we aim to propose and validate a novel way to smartly regulate the indoor daylighting environment while generating renewable electricity generation at the same time through the concentrating photovoltaic/Daylighting (TLWCPC-PV/D) skylight. This research particularly focuses on the evaluation of smart daylighting control (SDC) performance of it. The optical model of the TLWCPC-PV/D skylight was built with using ray-tracing simulation technique, which is also validated by experiment results. Because of the variable optical concentration process, the TLWCPC shows obvious SDC characteristic: when –32°＜θ＜32°, average daylighting efficiency is 11.15% while when −43°≤θ ≤ –32° and 32°≤θ ≤ 43°, average daylighting efficiency is 58.89%. Five cities with different latitudes are selected to perform the yearly daylighting control analysis. The comparative results indicated that orientation direction has an essential impact on SDC characteristic of the TLWCPC-PV/D skylight and the system in the North-South orientation shows excellent SDC ability i.e. it shows larger daylighting efficiency during the early morning and later afternoon periods while maintains lower daylighting efficiency during the noon period. Compared with other complex and expensive energy-saving glasses, the TLWCPC-PV/D skylight smartly adjusts the solar transmission through the optical concentration process according to sun motion and offers a new strategy of easy fabrication and multi-energy use that opens avenues for both static solar concentrator design and SDC mechanism in energy-saving buildings.}

In this paper, to solve this problem, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is introduced as the core algorithm to reconstruct the transaction model. Specifically, we build a general model for distributed transactions called PP-BCETS (Privacy-preserving Blockchain Energy Trading Scheme). It can achieve fine-grained access control through transaction arbitration in the ciphertext form. This design can maximize the protection of privacy information, and considerably improve the security and reliability of the transaction model. Additionally, a credibility-based equity proof consensus mechanism is proposed in PP-BCETS, which can greatly increase the operation efficiency. The security analysis and experimental evaluations are conducted to prove the validity and practicability of our proposed scheme.}

Nevertheless, because of the lack of literature on the smart IPO framework, we refer to smart government and smart city framework. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for smart IPO in developing countries in the context of smart city framework. The study found that smart IPO composed of several components such as 1) Smart IPO Model; 2) Smart IPO Enterprise Architecture; 3) Smart IPO Collaboration Model; 4) Smart IPO Development Model; 5) Smart IPO Measurement Model; 6) Smart IPO Standard; and 7) Smart IPO Services. It also found that there are four models of IP office as follows: Model 1 (basic web-based, public services); Model 2 (advanced internal administration); Model 3 (full process automation); and Model 4 (knowledge-based IP services). Moreover, we found also three stages of IP development model: Stage 1 (automation of internal processes); Stage 2 (web-based e-services); Stage 3 (e-dossier, e-filing, e-payment).}

abstract = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has experienced a notable impact as a result of population growth. Consequently, there is a heightened concern regarding urban air pollution and its effects on both individuals and society. This issue is of great importance in the development and expansion of cities within the region. The presence of air pollutants has been linked to various negative health outcomes, including the development of diseases, allergic reactions, and even fatalities in humans. Additionally, air pollution can have detrimental effects on other living organisms, such as animals and food crops, and can also cause harm to the natural environment, including contributing to climate change, ozone depletion, and land degradation in urban areas. The present study employs statistical analysis to regulate spatial theory to examine air pollution in the urban areas of Bisha and Abha in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The results showed that carbon emissions are lower in Abha than Bisha. The spatial theory shows that there are no carbon emissions from the factories in Abha and Bisha as the factories are located outside of the urban reach of both cities. The research findings indicate significant differences at a significance level of 0.05 in terms of the mean responses of the study participants from Abha and Bisha cities. The results favored Abha, with a study concerning carbon emissions was 0.005. In addition to the aforementioned results, various conclusions and recommendations were derived from the present investigation.}

Purpose
This study aims to explore the expectations and acceptability of a smart nursing home model among Chinese older adults and their family members based on a scoping review that defines the concept of smart nursing homes.
Methods
A qualitative case study was employed for this research. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted on WeChat. Participants were purposively sampled through snowball sampling in Hainan and Dalian, China. A total of 28 older adults aged 60–75 and six adult children were interviewed until data saturation was achieved, followed by a thematic analysis.
Results
The expectations of smart nursing homes include: 1) quality of care supported by governments and societies; 2) smart technology applications; 3) the presence of a skilled healthcare professional team; 4) access to and scope of basic medical services; and 5) integration of medical services. The acceptability of smart nursing homes included factors such as stakeholders’ perceived efficaciousness, usability, and collateral damages of using smart technologies, and the coping process of adoption was influenced by factors such as age, economic status, health status, education, and openness to smart technologies among older adults.
Conclusions
Chinese older adults and their family members have a positive perception of the smart nursing home model. The qualitative evidence regarding their expectations and acceptability of smart nursing homes contributes valuable insights for a wide range of stakeholders involved in the planning and implementation of smart nursing homes.}

abstract = {The phenomenon of carbon inequality may endanger equal and sustainable social development, which deserves our full attention. This study empirically investigates whether and how smart transportation affect carbon inequality based on a balanced penal dataset of China's 30 provinces from 2002 to 2017. We first examine the impact of smart transportation on carbon inequality using the system-generalized method of moments, and then explore their heterogeneous nexus. We also investigate the direct and indirect impacts of smart transition on carbon inequality. The main findings show that: (1) The development of smart transportation effectively mitigates carbon inequality; an increase in smart transportation by 1% can trigger a decrease in carbon inequality by 0.0119%. (2) Smart transportation has a greater inhibitory effect on carbon inequality in provinces where there are comparatively lower levels of industrial structure and residential consumption. (3) The influence of transportation technology on carbon inequality outweighs that of other sub-indicators of smart transportation; nonetheless, the transportation infrastructure aggregates carbon inequality. (4) The channels through which smart transportation works on carbon inequality include energy consumption and carbon emissions efficiency. We put forward practical policy implications for the eradication of carbon inequality and the development of smart transportation.}
