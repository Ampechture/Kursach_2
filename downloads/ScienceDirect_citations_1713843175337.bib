abstract = {Smart cities are a way for China to construct an innovative and environmentally conscious nation. The paper examines the impact of smart cities on corporate green governance and provides a theoretical foundation for formulating and executing smart city policy in China. Based on panel data from Chinese A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2008 to 2020, this study constructs a multiperiod double-difference model to examine the influence of smart cities on corporate green governance. Additionally, it uses a spatial double-difference model to investigate the spatial spillover effect of smart cities on neighboring areas. The findings indicate that smart cities effectively enhance corporate green governance. Analyzing the influencing mechanisms reveals that resource allocation efficiency, technological innovation, management environmental awareness, and regional environmental enforcement efforts act as mediators. Furthermore, the study reveals that the impact of smart cities on promoting corporate green governance is more pronounced in regions with lower levels of marketization and resource-based cities. Moreover, the research explores the spatial spillover effects of smart cities, with an effective radius of approximately 350 km. The optimal spatial correlation zone for green governance of businesses in neighboring areas in relation to smart cities is within a range of 250–350 km. This is manifested by the significant promotion of green governance in neighboring area businesses facilitated by smart cities.}

Orchestrated by electricity utilities, these smart grids offer innovative applications and services, generating substantial data earmarked for cloud-based processing. To reinforce sustainability in financing mechanisms, this research strategically incorporates digital twin technology, optimizing smart grid operations. Employing a fog computing approach, we focus on enhancing cloud data center efficiency at the cloud's edge. A comprehensive four-tiered framework is introduced to mitigate power shortages affecting utility companies and end-users within the context of net-zero energy integration. The cluster layer forms the foundation, interconnecting structures with the smart grid layer, acting as a vital link between the fog and cloud layers and the underlying infrastructure. A comparative analysis of load balancing algorithms, including the Artificial Bee Colony Optimizer (ABCO), Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), and Time-Varying ABCO (TVABCO), reveals TVABCO's superior response and processing times. These findings, aligned with green bonds and public–private partnerships, signify a crucial step towards sustainable energy integration in future smart cities.

Using the smart city pilot as a quasi-natural experiment in government digital governance, the progressive difference-in-differences method was used to investigate whether the government's digital governance capacity promotes green and sustainable development. The main findings are as follows: the improvement of the government's digital governance capacity significantly contributes to green and sustainable development. After a series of placebo tests and robustness tests, the results of this paper still hold. Government digital governance promotes natural resource management mainly through two mechanisms: green technology innovation and intellectual property protection, and the quality of green technology innovation plays a more critical role than quantity. The impact of improved government digital governance on natural resource management varies significantly across different types of cities, cities with different political levels, and cities with different urban locations and human capital levels.}

To address this issue, we propose AMI-Chain, a cost-effective blockchain solution that leverages the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) for off-chain storage, data aggregation, and compression at the smart meter level. This approach significantly boosts blockchain transaction rates and scalability. However, employing IPFS introduces its unique challenges, particularly in having nodes that stop participating at any given time. Therefore, we also present effective strategies for managing a large number of consumers and introduce a model for optimizing IPFS storage while ensuring data durability. Estimations with our model reveal that AMI-Chain can support over 7.7 million smart meters with a 24-h data compression rate while providing eleven nines for one-year data durability.}

This study focuses on the impact on urban greenness of smart city construction in megacities, using the difference-in-differences regression model to evaluate the impact based on urban development conditions in various aspects from 2010 to 2021 in 10 megacities in China. The results of panel data of different indicator samples show unique conclusions. First, smart city pilot policy in megacities has significant impact on urban greenness, primarily due to demographic and economic developments. Second, the impact is different between the megacity and national level, and different factors of urban greenness have different effects on smart city construction. Third, the effects are time-lagged and lasted for years, and regional heterogeneity divided by building climate zones is existed, where the effect is more obvious in city agglomeration. These findings of smart city construction reveal the unique influences on megacity greenness, and can be generalized to cities with similar characteristics accordingly.}

This paper endeavours to assess the evolution of smart cities in relation to neighbourhoods, elucidating dimensions and sectors while concentrating on comprehending project applications and their outcomes. This study employs a systematic literature review to ascertain the role of neighbourhoods within smart cities. Using content analysis, this methodology facilitates the accumulation of insights into smart city research and practice at the neighbourhood level. The paper empirically addresses these findings, identifying dimensions and pertinent sectors concerning residential neighbourhoods. Furthermore, it delves into projects and applications, elaborating on their implementation across diverse sectors. The analysis discerns gaps in technology-driven development planning for varying neighbourhood types within smart cities. Introducing technology-driven advancements into existing urban settings presents substantial challenges, particularly for developing nations, primarily due to limitations and constraints imposed by their current built environments. The study further underscores the perils tied to implementing city-level policies at the neighbourhood scale, prompting a query about their inclusivity. The findings imply the imperative of integrating physical planning and technology-driven solutions within smart city development, with a keen focus on neighbourhoods' social and physical characteristics. This approach becomes particularly significant when considering the inherent risks and constraints that accompany technology-based urban enhancements in the context of neighbourhoods.}

abstract = {This paper addresses a secured co-dynamic model for the energy management of Electrical Vehicles (EVs) within the real community transportation system (RCTS). The proposed model aims to facilitate interoperability among mobile energy resources within the smart city, enabling the RCTS to model the co-dynamic-static transportation systems (TSs) simultaneously. The energy management model within the traffic flow system focuses on dynamic assignment, considering the power consumption associated with the density of moving vehicles. EVs play a key role in economically managing energy in both static and dynamic behaviors within charging stations while aligning with the current traffic flow. To enhance data security within the smart city ecosystem, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based decentralized cyber security approach is recommended. This approach ensures that data transactions involving mobile energy resources are secured against cyber-attacks through the use of public, private, and transaction blocks. Additionally, an uncertainty-based copula function is presented to create a precise management environment within the smart city. The results indicate that the proposed model for transportation energy resources tends to reduce energy costs by optimally controlling energy consumption within traffic flow, compared to normal conditions.}

abstract = {As a locus of technological innovation, a smart city (SC) is a prototypical city of the future. Moreover, according to scholars, a smart city is also sustainable city. Nonetheless, the environmental aspects of urban sustainability are often de-emphasized in favor of discourses around the technical characteristics of SC technologies. In order to integrate the two, the article introduces the notion of a smart green city (SGC) in which technological means and environmental outcomes are in sustainable balance. SGC is presented here as a unifying concept integrating smart city and green city concepts through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework. To illustrate the positive synergy between a city's greenness and smartness, we derive operational definitions of both based on the online media's attention to the related technology and sustainability initiatives. After calculating the two indices for all the cities worldwide with over one million inhabitants (498 cities), regression analysis is performed to determine the strength and direction of the relationships between a city's greenness and smartness. We find that a city's greenness is positively related to its smartness. Principal component analysis reveals a potential relationship between a city's population and the two indices. In particular, a large city's population negatively affects its greenness but positively affects its smartness. A joint index of smartness and greenness is negatively related to a city's population. Hence, the containment of uncontrolled urban growth is critical for successfully implementing SGC initiatives. The analysis results are of use to policy-makers, city managers, and planners intending to integrate the ESG framework into their future urban development strategies. Moreover, to our knowledge, a joint evaluation of a city's greenness and smartness has never been performed before on the inter-regional level of analysis. Accordingly, such a holistic assessment can be of methodological interest to scholars of smart and sustainable cities.}

The labor allocation effect of smart cities plays an important role in promoting the transformation to high-quality development in China, but there is still a lack of empirical research testing this effect. Based on panel data of 151 cities at the prefecture level and above for the period 2006–2018, this paper uses a DID model to evaluate the impact of smart city pilot projects on labor misallocation. The results show that, first, smart cities can significantly reduce labor misallocation, and this finding holds under a series of robustness tests. Second, smart cities can reduce labor misallocation through the formation of industrial agglomeration and the upgrading of the industrial structure. Third, the effect of smart cities was more significant in central and eastern cities and large-scale cities than in western cities and small and medium-scale cities. Fourth, smart cities have a significant spatial spillover effect on the reduction of labor misallocation.}

Relying on theoretical guidance provided by Ostrom's (2005) ‘Institutional Analysis and Development’ (IAD) framework and González-Arellano's (2022) and Scott's (2008) formulation of ‘Institutional Construction of Futures of Cities’, we analyse a corpus of empirical data to suggest that SC has historical precedents in the way it is institutionalized. Further, to substantiate our findings, a structured literature review of empirical contributions (34 nos.) within the SCOPUS database is undertaken. In conceptual terms, the anticipatory praxis of Smart City Mission leverages the institutional structure of doing flagship programmes and a cultural-cognitive affirmation of neutrality in data-driven governance. The initiative blurs the political city as the action arenas of structuring SC initiatives at the local levels lack operational rules to construct desired outcomes. The paper argues for a need to make the action-to-outcome linkage legible and endow agency to participants to act and control the outcomes by framing collective choice rules. Strengthening action arenas at the city level emboldens the capacity to envision collaborative futures and bridge the gap between anticipation and experience.}

The results provide deep insights into how smart city managers express their roles and responsibilities in smart city transformation.

Based on smart cities policy in China, a quasi-natural experiment is conducted by using the Heterogeneity - Robust estimator in differences-in-differences model. According to detailed theoretical analysis and rigorous empirical research, and main conclusions are as follows. First, the construction of smart cities can directly expand the green space due to the land resource allocation. The above basic conclusion remains reliable after a series of robustness tests. Second, the effect of construction of smart cities on the green space is heterogenous. The construction of smart city in the three batches has a positive impact on expending green space and the strongest positive effect on green space is seen in the smart cities established in 2012. The high-level economic scale and high-level science and technology are vital premises for smart cities to expand green space. Third, the construction of smart cities can indirectly expand the green space by promoting online work and services and increasing disposable income. Last, the “Broadband China” Strategy has a positively moderate effect on the construction of smart cities in expanding green space.}

Moreover, these applications act as the building blocks of IoT-enabled smart cities. The high volume and high velocity of data generated by various smart city applications are sent to flexible and efficient cloud computing resources for processing. However, there is a high computation latency due to the presence of a remote cloud server. Edge computing, which brings the computation close to the data source is introduced to overcome this problem. In an IoT-enabled smart city environment, one of the main concerns is to consume the least amount of energy while executing tasks that satisfy the delay constraint. An efficient resource allocation at the edge is helpful to address this issue. In this paper, an energy and delay minimization problem in a smart city environment is formulated as a bi-objective edge resource allocation problem. First, we presented a three-layer network architecture for IoT-enabled smart cities. Then, we designed a learning automata-based edge resource allocation approach considering the three-layer network architecture to solve the said bi-objective minimization problem. Learning Automata (LA) is a reinforcement-based adaptive decision-maker that helps to find the best task and edge resource mapping. An extensive set of simulations is performed to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the LA-based approach in the IoT-enabled smart city environment.}

This aligns with the visionary concept of smarter eco-cities, an emerging paradigm of urbanism characterized by the seamless integration of advanced technologies and environmental strategies. However, there remains a significant gap in thoroughly understanding this new paradigm and the intricate spectrum of its multifaceted underlying dimensions. To bridge this gap, this study provides a comprehensive systematic review of the burgeoning landscape of smarter eco-cities and their leading-edge AI and AIoT solutions for environmental sustainability. To ensure thoroughness, the study employs a unified evidence synthesis framework integrating aggregative, configurative, and narrative synthesis approaches. At the core of this study lie these subsequent research inquiries: What are the foundational underpinnings of emerging smarter eco-cities, and how do they intricately interrelate, particularly urbanism paradigms, environmental solutions, and data-driven technologies? What are the key drivers and enablers propelling the materialization of smarter eco-cities? What are the primary AI and AIoT solutions that can be harnessed in the development of smarter eco-cities? In what ways do AI and AIoT technologies contribute to fostering environmental sustainability practices, and what potential benefits and opportunities do they offer for smarter eco-cities? What challenges and barriers arise in the implementation of AI and AIoT solutions for the development of smarter eco-cities? The findings significantly deepen and broaden our understanding of both the significant potential of AI and AIoT technologies to enhance sustainable urban development practices, as well as the formidable nature of the challenges they pose. Beyond theoretical enrichment, these findings offer invaluable insights and new perspectives poised to empower policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI- and AIoT-driven urbanism. Through an insightful exploration of the contemporary urban landscape and the identification of successfully applied AI and AIoT solutions, stakeholders gain the necessary groundwork for making well-informed decisions, implementing effective strategies, and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being.}

To delve deeper into this subject, we employed a mixed methods approach to classify 49 Chinese smart cities and subsequently developed a typology for Chinese smart cities in this study. Our methodology involved three steps. Initially, we devised a classification framework based on the input-throughput-output model and conducted content analysis to identify the characteristics of the 49 cities. Subsequently, we utilized a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering analysis to categorize these cases. Finally, we formulated a typology consisting of five types of Chinese smart cities: knowledge-technocratic smart cities, holistic smart cities, green smart cities, equipment-technocratic smart cities, and emerging smart cities. The findings reveal that different smart city types are characterized by distinct features and priorities in input, throughput, and output. The development of smart cities should comprehensively consider and respect the local urban contexts and the challenges they present. The insights from this study hold relevance for both policymakers and academic researchers.}

In the context of smart city wastewater optimization, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that considers both surface water and groundwater dynamics. Existing methods often fall short in addressing groundwater-related concerns, with limitations in accounting for potential contamination and aquifer vulnerability. The proposed method integrates a nuanced understanding of groundwater aspects, providing a more robust and sustainable solution for urban water resource management. This research introduces a new approach that harnesses the power of Divide-And-Conquer (DAC) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) to optimize wastewater collection systems in smart cities. The DAC strategy divides the city into manageable zones, simplifying the optimization problem for parallel processing in large-scale urban environments. VNS fine-tunes wastewater collection networks within each zone by exploring diverse neighborhood solutions. The DAC and VNS offers several benefits, including improved efficiency in wastewater transport, reduced energy consumption, and minimized environmental impact. Zoning the urban landscape is a strategic approach to optimize wastewater collection in smart cities. It involves dividing the city into manageable zones based on specific criteria such as geographical features, population density, and infrastructure layout. Each zone is treated as an independent unit for focused analysis and optimization. The optimization process employs a scoring function that combines weighted criteria, yielding a composite score for each geographical location. Applying a threshold or clustering algorithm group's locations into zones, facilitating tailored wastewater management strategies. By optimizing collection routes and infrastructure design, this approach assists smart cities in achieving sustainability goals while efficiently managing wastewater. The study showcases the potential of DAC and VNS as a robust and adaptable solution for wastewater collection in smart cities, contributing to the development of greener, more resource-efficient urban areas.}

The detection of such hotspots can serve as a valuable organizational technique for framing detailed information about a metropolitan area, providing high-level spatial knowledge for planners, scientists, and policymakers. From the algorithmic viewpoint, classic density-based clustering algorithms are very effective in discovering hotspots characterized by homogeneous density; however, their application on multi-density data can produce inaccurate results. For such a reason, since metropolitan cities are characterized by areas with significantly variable densities, multi-density clustering approaches are more effective in discovering city hotspots. Moreover, the growing volumes of data collected in urban environments require the development of parallel approaches, in order to take advantage of scalable executions offered by Edge and Cloud environments. This paper describes the design and implementation of a parallel multi-density clustering algorithm aimed at analyzing high volumes of urban data in an efficient way. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed parallel clustering approach takes out encouraging advantages in terms of execution time, speedup, and efficiency.}

The results show that at the very beginning of the life cycle, monetary, epistemic, and social investments are required. The earliest values captured are epistemic, social, and functional. Prominent financial value is seen as a potential value, but to achieve it, the ecosystem should have a common purpose, successful external communication, low entry barriers, seamless internal information sharing, and plenty of co-operation between the ecosystem actors.}

In addressing this challenge, smart city enterprises are strategically deploying smart grids to implement innovative Demand Response (DR) programs. These initiatives aim to optimize energy consumption by incentivizing citizens through public–private partnerships and exploring financing avenues like green bonds, thereby fostering sustainable and resilient urban energy ecosystems. The initial contribution of this paper introduces an energy management (EM) approach. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) procedure is implemented to address the comprehensive planning problem across three researches: one without SOLAR batteries, one with SOLAR systems, and one incorporating SOLAR batteries. The model aims to decrease energy prices, mitigate peak-load, reduce carbon dioxide discharges, and prevent rebound peaks, ultimately enhancing user comfort. Simulations are conducted to match the efficacy of this proposed approach with obtainable ways. The results demonstrate that the recommended ACO procedure effectively reduces energy prices, carbon dioxide discharges, and peak loads across various researches. Consequently, this ACO procedure-based EM routine outperforms existing benchmark approaches. Meanwhile, digital twin (DT) technology is reshaping the renewable energy sector by offering virtual replicas of physical systems. This article delves into the applications, advantages, and challenges associated with digital twin modeling in renewable energy. The technology entails the creation of virtual replicas for renewable energy systems, integrating real-time data to facilitate precise simulation. Key advantages encompass accurate prediction, dynamic monitoring, and the optimization of energy production. The synergy between digital twin modeling and smart grids enhances flexibility and bolsters grid reliability. Nevertheless, challenges include ensuring data security, managing system interconnectivity, and addressing computational demands. In essence, digital twin modeling presents a pathway for realistic representation and efficient management of renewable energy, although challenges must be navigated to unleash its full potential.}

Many individuals are doubtful about smart city projects because of the security issues that arise in such environments. In essence, internet of things gadgets are security flaws. Concerns about the proliferation of IoT sensors and the tighter coupling of infrastructure silos in cities are well-founded. The major objective of the study is to identify the influencing factors of smart cities on e-government in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, this research explores the definition of e-government, and its supporting technologies like smart cities, IoT, big data, cloud computing and other digital government platforms. After exploring the detailed definitions, the study identifies the challenging scenarios of e-government in Saudi Arabia, and discusses the different opportunities. This study also concentrates on the good practices to be followed to overcome the challenges. Furthermore, this study can be used in future research for solving real time challenges of e-government.}

The study uses mixed methods to examine democratic participation in governance and the emerging notion of Smart City Citizenship in the context of India. Benchmarking and assessment of 21 smart cities reveals the existing participatory processes being “tokenistic” and a substantial deficit in democratic stakeholder participation mechanisms. A deeper assessment in Kochi and Nagpur exposes the existing barriers to citizen participation and reveals that the capacities of capable stakeholders and citizen groups can be channelised more effectively. This study promotes advancing the notion of ‘citizenship’ beyond the market to the commons. It suggests transforming urban governance into a more accountable and collaborative governance model with a stronger role and power to local government, residents, and democratic stakeholders.}

A positive and significant relationship with a weak inverted U-shaped trend was found between smart city construction and green innovation. Besides the direct channel, labor factor allocation, venture capital attractiveness, and market accessibility are essential indirect channels between the two concepts. Furthermore, the effects of smart city construction on green innovation varied depending on the marketization level, administrative rank, population size, and geographic location of the city. In addition, the interaction of the two constructs negatively affected industrial emissions, which helped optimize the environment. These findings suggest that smart city construction offers a digital dividend for developing green innovation and creating an efficient, sustainable environment.}

Researchers of stakeholder engagement have investigated various aspects of the engagement process from different theoretical perspectives, yet the complexity and dynamism of inclusion, especially at the societal level and in the context of smart city development, continue to inspire more research. Drawing from the intersection of open strategy (OS) and SE, we seek to enhance understanding of the open strategizing process by elucidating stakeholder inclusion practices in a smart city initiative, focusing on food systems in Da Nang, Vietnam. Our participatory action research draws on 114 semi-structured interviews and four stakeholder workshops to analyze the way stakeholder inclusion practices unfold in the strategic decision-making process of a smart city initiative. Our analysis reveals that stakeholder inclusion is complex and involves four interdependent practices at different stages of the strategizing process. These practices are trust formation, common language creation, role transformation, and expectation alignment. Together, they culminate in the creation of an interactive social space for the strategy-making process. The proposed analytical framework highlights the interdependencies among practices and their outcomes at different stages of the open strategizing process and could serve as a guideline in a context in which stakeholder inclusion at the planning phase is necessary to achieve systemic change.}

The results indicate that (1) SCP significantly improves urban GTFEE, a finding that remains valid after the instrumental variables approach and robustness tests. (2) In east-central cities, economically developed cities, medium-sized cities, and non-resource-based cities, SCP significantly affects GTFEE. (3) The SCP considerably raises the local GTFEE but also the GTFEE of the 900-kilometer radius around cities. (4) SCP can improve GTFEE by clean energy development, optimizing industrial structure, promoting green innovation, and resource allocation. In addition, energy saving, emission reduction, and production increase are also important impact channels.

The research covers the examples of three Polish cities: Gdansk, Warsaw and Wroclaw. We checked how this concept is explained and narrowed down to the framework of the city's strategy and legitimized by city makers. Each of the stories expounds the vision of the city, ways of achieving goals and the approach to residents as users. That might give weight to the nuanced idea and translate into the real urban policy. The conclusions of the study suggest that the smart city concept does not fundamentally change urban policies, but is rather inscribed in the adopted directions and vision, e.g. the city which was wanted to be perceived as academic, identifies “smart” with cooperation with the science sector etc. The results also show that smaller cities that use new technologies more modestly must look for other ways to refer to smart cities for strategic purposes. The empirical basis was the implementation of individual in-depth interviews with city officials, which was supplemented by an analysis of planning, strategic and reporting documents.}

Their sensors capture detailed information about an object’s functionality through their use of various sensors. It is possible to gain a deep understanding of the object’s performance and potential areas for improvement by collecting data, which includes metrics such as energy output, temperature, and weather conditions. Digital twins are becoming important in a variety of research and industrial application sectors as production lines and processes become more digitalized and as improved data analysis techniques such as machine learning and enhanced visualization techniques are used. There is no unified definition of the digital twin concept in scientific literature, which results in imprecise applications and the weakening of its terminology. However, this study demonstrates how digital twin models can be applied to urban drainage systems. As a result, this highlights the relatively novel use of digital twins within the field of urban water system engineering. Our review of the language, practices, and directions in smart stormwater management provides a framework to organize and comprehend the current research landscape while highlighting crucial areas for future research. Our results demonstrate that there is near-unanimous agreement within the literature that smart technology has been, or will be, advantageous for stormwater management. However, while some progress has been made in terms of quantity management, maturity in water quality management has not yet been achieved. This study examines the scientific literature on digital twins in the application of artificial intelligence for smart city stormwater infrastructure systems, specifically focusing on urban drainage systems. A demonstration of the workflow and features of current digital twin applications in urban drainage systems is also presented, providing valuable insights and guidance for future research and development in this field.}

abstract = {Globally, smart cities attract billions of dollars in investment annually, with related market opportunities forecast to grow year-on-year. The enormous resources poured into their development consist of financial capital, but also natural, human and social resources converted into infrastructure and real estate. The latter act as physical capital storage and sites for the creation of digital products and services expected to generate the highest value added. Smart cities serve as temporary spatial fixes until new and better investments opportunities emerge. Drawing from a comprehensive range of publications on capitalism, this article analyzes smart city developments as typifier of 21st century capital accumulation where the financialization of various capitals is the overarching driver and ecological overshoot and socio-economic undershoot are the main negative consequences. It closely examines six spatial manifestations of the smart city – science parks and smart campuses; innovation districts; smart neighborhoods; city-wide and city-regional smart initiatives; urban platforms; and alternative smart city spaces – as receptacles for the conversion of various capitals. It also considers the influence of different national regimes and institutional contexts on smart city developments. This is used, in the final part, to open a discussion about opportunities to temper the excesses of 21st century capitalism.}

abstract = {Nepal is the least urbanized country in South Asia with approximately 28% of Nepalese living in urban areas, while it is also the fastest urbanizing country in with an annual urban population growth of 6%. Urban areas suffer from municipal physical and information infrastructure deficits and are at high risk from earthquakes, floods, fires, and landslides. Development and transformation into Smart Cities would be a new avenue in Nepali development trend. However, this is relatively new and is still in its early stages of development. The objective of this research is to assess the evolution, the emerging trends and future prospects of Smart City in Nepal. A literature review with qualitative method along with structured key informant interviews were conducted to obtain data. This study revealed that the concept of Smart Cities in Nepal is centered around the integration of technology and innovative solutions to address the challenges facing urban areas and improve the quality of life for citizens. The concept is driven by the rapid pace of urbanization, the increasing need for sustainable and resilient cities, and the growing recognition of the role that technology can play in addressing these challenges. Nepal has emphasized on sustainability, the integration of Smart City initiatives, and the use of smart technologies with the country's broader development goals. Smart City indicators have been developed to track the progress, yet they are not flexible. This study recommends that i) the indicators need to be kept flexible with adequate room for revision of resilience-related indicators, ii) appropriate focus should be given to interconnected components of Smart Cities and iii) development of a more transparent and accountable approach to Smart City thereby providing better opportunities to enhance quality of life and unlock economic growth potential.}

abstract = {Cities play a vital role in tackling sustainability challenges. Smart cities have emerged as solutions to urban sustainability. However, whether smart city practices lead to environmental, economic, and social sustainability outcomes is still not clear. This is due to a lack of thorough knowledge of how local governments have deployed the smart city notion, as well as a lack of holistic evaluation of sustainability outcomes achieved by smart cities. To fill in this gap, this research evaluates whether local implementation of smart cities is associated with sustainability outcomes at the city level. We studied 103 US cities by integrating a sustainability assessment conducted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and text mining of city official websites. Our analysis shows that more than 80% of the 103 cities have smart city statements on their websites. In addition, smart cities generally score higher on sustainability outcomes than non-smart cities. Furthermore, when controlling for population size and geographic region, smart city mentions are positively associated with economic sustainability outcomes. However, the relationship between smart city mentions and environmental and social sustainability is not statistically significant. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the prevalence of local governments’ deployment of smart cities, which is scarce at present, and gives novel insight into the relationship between the use of technologies and urban sustainability.}

Therefore, the establishment of a scientific and comprehensive evaluation index system is crucial to the sustainable construction of smart cities. Based on existing research, this study innovatively uses multivariate data to construct an evaluation index system for the construction level of smart cities, and then systematically evaluates the smart city construction efficiency of 37 cities from 2016 to 2021 using the Super-efficiency slack-based model considering undesired output and the Malmquist index. Finally, measures are proposed to promote the orderly and healthy development of smart cities by combining domestic and international experience in smart city construction and policy recommendations. Results show the following: (1) Overall, the imbalance in the efficiency of China’s smart city construction between regions has improved, but a gap remains in the central and western regions in comparison with the east. (2) The improvement in smart city construction efficiency correlates with regional economic development, showing a gradual decrease from east to west. (3) The evaluation results can provide theoretical support and a decision-making basis for relevant government departments to optimize smart city development planning and scientifically formulate smart city development policies.}

First, a pioneering data architecture design leveraging CycleGAN is proposed to counteract False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA). By cyclically transforming data distributions, CycleGAN ensures the integrity and reliability of smart city information, fortifying against malicious manipulations. Second, an innovative Internet of Things (IoT) concept is introduced, aiming to enhance real-time monitoring and context-aware threat detection within Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Harnessing the wealth of data generated by IoT devices, this concept provides a comprehensive understanding of network activities, fostering adaptive responses to emerging threats. Lastly, the research delves into the development of a novel IDS hyperparameter adjusting system. This system integrates the strengths of Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to fine-tune IDS configuration parameters. Drawing inspiration from biogeographical principles and collaborative whale behavior, the hybrid optimization system balances exploration and exploitation, adapting the IDS to diverse network environments. Together, these initiatives represent a holistic approach to fortifying smart cities through cutting-edge data architecture, IoT-driven threat detection, and optimized IDS configurations, contributing to the resilience and cybersecurity of modern urban landscapes.}

Knowledge and insight into these developmental processes and core scenarios are scarce and necessary, as they can contribute to a possible acceleration and increase in the effectiveness of smart city transformation strategies. As a result of a systematic literature review, this study develops a theoretical framework that describes five stages of smart city transformation as a generic developmental and iterative process with feedback. These stages are (1) smart city goal definition, (2) smart city technology innovation, (3) smart city strategy development, (4) smart city plan implementation, and (5) smart city plan evaluation. Different developments and outcomes of these five stages result in four alternative scenarios for smart city development: (a) spiralling up, (b) downward repetition, (c) corrective feedback, and (d) upward feedback. Academics can use the insights in the five developmental processes and four core scenarios as a general framework to interpret, position, and analyse specific smart city projects and processes. Practitioners can use the insights into these developmental processes and core scenarios to inform their management, steering and governance activities in the smart city processes in which they participate.}

As a first challenge, the previous studies have developed the concept of a smart city as a creative answer, following that, several scientists proposed the floating city concept in the literature as a solution to the increased sea levels. Moreover, engineers, architects, and designers deal with city planning, for smart and floating settlements as a difficult design challenge, and evolutionary algorithms could be employed to address this complex problem by optimizing residents' needs. As a continuation of our previous studies on this topic, this time, we develop a multi-objective continuous genetic algorithm with differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy (MO_CGADE) and a multi-objective ensemble differential evolution algorithm (MO_EDE) to solve the problem on hand. Then, we compare the performance of the MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms with the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) to maximize two conflicted objective functions, namely, scenery, and walkability in the proposed smart floating city model created in the Grasshopper Algorithmic Modeling Environment. The parametric model that we create in the Grasshopper software includes 64 decision variables, area constraints and objective functions to be optimized by MO_CGADE, MO_EDE, and NSGAII algorithms. Computational results show that MO_CGADE and MO_EDE algorithms generate better Pareto ranking results than the traditional NSGAII algorithm in terms of cardinality, distribution spacing, and coverage metrics.}

While such applications provide enormous benefits in improving transportation systems operation and environmental sustainability, they also introduce new risks to smart cities. These systems provide wider access to adversaries and increase the attack surface to compromise the operation of smart cities. This study develops a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) based cooperative driving automation platform to understand and analyze the cyber risks in these systems from a V2I perspective in a representative traffic environment. Three cyberattacks (Fake BSMs, replay and denial of service) were emulated as a cooperative game to assess the impact on volatility, energy efficiency and traffic flow stability. The critical nature of cooperative driving automation is revealed by this research and flow stability, and energy efficiency of cooperative driving automation are severely impacted by the three categories of cyberattacks. Further, a 35 %-40 % increase in volatility in acceleration-deceleration regimes along with 20 % increase in emission is observed as opposed to the baseline case with no cyberattacks. The proposed long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM) showed an average detection accuracy of around 98 % for the analyzed cyberattacks. The research findings would foster the development of algorithms to continuously monitor the state of cooperative automated driving environment for anomalous behavior and promote resilient and environmentally sustainable cities in the future.}

Exact results show that urban energy execution of common capital in China has been expanding. The potential for energy-saving in Chinese common capital is also very high. When evaluating urban energy execution, it was critical to include the energy contribution as an appraisal pointer. Although there was a negative relationship between population thickness and urban energy execution, the temperature record, urbanization rate, and family vehicle possession were all extremely associated with urban energy execution. Chinese common capitals gradually lost their ability to execute urban energy from east to west.

This study explores the multifaceted aspects of cross-sectoral data sharing within smart cities. It investigates its significance, identifies barriers, and outlines prerequisites while navigating data protection regulations. The findings highlight a critical gap in the existing literature, emphasising the need for a comprehensive framework. Guided by a thematic analysis of insights from 14 interviews with expertise in smart cities, emphasising data-sharing and data protection legislation, this framework provides a systematic approach to enable cross-sectoral data-sharing in smart cities. It serves as a guide for urban planners and stakeholders. Following its initial development, the framework undergoes validation through interviews with six smart city experts. Their insights confirm the framework's robustness and efficacy in addressing the research question. Hence, this research advances the discourse on smart city development and offers a blueprint for balancing cross-sectoral data-sharing with data protection regulations, bridging the gap between innovation and compliance.}

IoT (Internet of Things) systems are at the centre of smart city applications, as traditional cloud computing is insufficient for satisfying the critical requirements of smart IoT systems. Due to the nature of smart city applications, massive IoT data may contain sensitive information; hence, various privacy-preserving methods, such as anonymity, federated learning, and homomorphic encryption, have been utilised over the years. Furthermore, limited concern has been given to the resource consumption for data privacy-preserving in edge computing environments, which are resource-constrained when compared with cloud data centres. In particular, differential privacy (DP) has been an effective privacy-preserving method in the edge computing environment. However, there is no dedicated study on DP technology with a focus on smart city applications in the edge computing environment. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive study on DP in edge computing-based smart city applications, covering various aspects, such as privacy models, research methods, mechanisms, and applications. Our study focuses on five areas of data privacy, including data transmitting privacy, data processing privacy, data model training privacy, data publishing privacy, and location privacy.

By adopting the cross-methodology borrowed from the macroeconomics domain, we illustrate how a maturity model can be actionable in the sense that it can reveal the equilibria of supply and demand of a given smart city dimension or parameter. To evaluate this methodology, we study a well-known use case in cybersecurity, specifically incident response, against crowdsourcing, a key enabler of a data-driven circular economy. Our findings confirm that when crowdsourcing is injected into smart city infrastructure, the city's maturity is expected to increase as the additional capabilities can contribute to addressing cybersecurity incidents.}

The study evaluates the challenges of green space data analysis such as cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise, and reveals that Western and Eastern cities take different approaches to green space data analysis, focusing on environmental/social and urban planning benefits respectively. The importance of technologies and policies aimed at addressing environmental issues in disadvantaged communities, including air pollution, is emphasized. Effective strategies such as the deployment of air quality sensors, green infrastructure, and transit-oriented development can improve air quality and health, though success depends on policy design, resources, and infrastructure. Furthermore, the study explores the potential of advanced technologies and strategies to manage sustainable energy resources in smart cities, including smart grids, renewable energy, and energy-efficient buildings. The study also discusses the potential of smart technologies such as precision irrigation, smart metering, and waste management initiatives to reduce water usage and waste. The study concludes that technology and policy innovation can converge to yield environmental wellbeing through efficiency and reduced harm. By embracing sustainability, communities can lead in creating livable smart cities. The findings offer insights for policymakers, planners, and researchers on managing natural resources and promoting sustainable development in smart cities.}

To deal with the ethical implications of smart cities, the Netherlands face a proliferation of ethical guidelines, principles, and manifests. However: To what extent are Dutch citizens' interests protected by ethical guidelines? This study answers that question using a critical discourse analysis. This exploratory analysis uncovers unnoticed themes in the ethical discourse on smart cities and offers recommendations to strengthen the protection of citizens. Together, the ethical guidelines that are selected represent at least five major cities in the Netherlands. This study finds that the ethical guidelines support the Smart City discourse in which: data is seen as a promise for the future, citizens' interests are not central and public-private governance is pre-supposed in the digital public space. Indeed, the ethical guidelines overlook how Big Data analytics transforms ways of governing, which is described as ‘algorithmic governmentality’. Therefore, if guidelines want to commit to the protection of citizens' interests, this study encourages them to review their guidelines in a Big Data context. However, as ultimately only laws and regulations can ensure the protection of citizens' interests and rights, future research is encouraged to look into the restructuring of the legal system.}

The findings reveal the following. (1) SCPP significantly enhances EEP in cities of China. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that SCPP primarily improves EEP by promoting economic agglomeration and driving innovation development. (3) The enhancement effect of SCPP on EEP exhibits a time lag and tends to decay in later stages, without exerting a notable spillover effect on EEP of neighboring cities. (4) The EEP of cities with lower administrative levels and insufficient resource endowments has experienced more substantial improvements under SCPP. This study offers valuable insights for developing countries with backgrounds similar to China for improving urban ecological environments and achieving sustainable development.}

The results show that the efficiency value of green energy fluctuates in Chinese cities. Different test results show that smart city policies can effectively improve urban green energy efficiency, but mainly from the time effect rather than the individual effect. It means the improvement in urban green energy efficiency comes more from the fast-growing of the Chinese economy and urban construction in this period than from the country's smart city pilot policy. In addition, from the spatial spillover effect result, China needs to design a better urban spatial development plan to improve the capacity of smart city energy services and vigorously develop intelligent technology represented by information and communication science.}

Additionally, the paper examines the privacy risks associated with the collection and use of personal data in smart cities. Effective security measures and privacy protection policies are crucial in ensuring the safety and security of smart cities. Cooperation between governments, private companies and citizens is essential to implement such measures and policies, allowing smart cities to continue developing while guaranteeing the security and privacy of their citizens. Likewise, smart city public safety systems that utilize AI-powered surveillance technologies may be predisposed to hacking, leading to privacy breaches and data misuse. Moreover, smart city energy systems, which rely on IoT devices to regulate power grids, are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can result in power outages or significant damage to vital infrastructure. The adoption of information and communication technology for smart city development has increased the risk of cyber threats, emphasizing the need for a review cybersecurity governance model. In addition, smart city water systems that rely on AI-powered sensors to monitor water quality may also be at risk of hacking, which could result in the contamination of the water supply.

The prominence of smart cities in power systems has grown recently, offering comprehensive monitoring and accessibility. However, this advancement also brings about increased susceptibility to cyber-attacks. To address this concern, we present an integrated smart city encompassing the smart grid (SG), transportation comprising subway and vehicles, microgrid (MG), and energy hub (EH). Within this proposed model, we employ an enhanced intrusion detection system (IDS) utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) through deep learning to fortify the safety of information transactions inside the smart city. This involves incorporating a security layer into the smart city design, effectively thwarting cyber hackers' attempts to access system information. This paper develops an efficient energy management schedule. To achieve this, we introduce a novel optimization method deploying the honey bee mating optimization technique for the optimum allocation of charging stations. The grid randomness is addressed using the point estimate method (PEM) with a 2 m-scheme. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework are proved, showcasing its ability to enhance the security and efficiency of smart city operations. This research advocates for the application of a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin to explore optimal energy management within a Smart City while ensuring a safe and secure framework. The proposed methodology involves the creation of a comprehensive digital replica incorporating real-time data, cybersecurity measures, optimization algorithms, and machine learning. This digital twin serves as a dynamic simulation environment, enabling stakeholders to analyze, simulate, and refine energy management strategies in a risk-free setting. The study emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement, iterative testing, and adaptability to real-world data for ensuring the relevance and effectiveness of the digital twin in guiding Smart Cities toward efficient, secure, and resilient energy management.}

On the one hand, urban quantum technologies hold managerial relevance for future smart cities. On the other hand, they are often overlooked by smart city researchers. Accordingly, their value as a breakthrough technological paradigm is still largely unexplored. In this article, we look at how quantum technologies may contribute to existing smart city solutions, including the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data, ICT, smart transportation, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. First, through a semi-systematic review of eighty articles on quantum computing within the social science domain, we identify two relevant classes of urban quantum technologies: quantum communication and quantum computing. Second, we establish a comprehensive taxonomy of conventional smart city solutions based on the automated content analysis of 567 abstracts of articles on the technological aspects of smart cities. Third, we investigate potential associations between two classes of technologies (conventional smart city solutions and urban quantum technologies) by analyzing the semantic relationships between eighty articles on quantum technologies according to the frequency of keywords denoting different types of conventional smart city solutions. Finally, we triangulate our findings through a thematic analysis of potential uses of quantum technologies within identified categories of smart city solutions.}

The paper explores each lens through a critical review of recent literature in digital geographies and related fields. It weaves this review through a speculative reading of the Eco Delta Smart City, an experimental development building the smart city from the home up in Busan, South Korea. We show how each lens calls attention to distinct sets of questions, actors, agendas, and relations–thus refusing any single reading of the project or of the broader trends around digitalization of which it is a part. In the process, we trace how digitalization does not simply trouble existing spatial categories, but rather makes them manifest in new ways for differently situated subjects.}

These challenges have yet to be comprehensively understood thus far. In this study, we focus on the Circum-Bohai-Sea area in China (CBS) to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of MSW generation under the population shrinking and aging. Results showed that the MSW growth rate reduced from 3.2% (2011–2015) to 1.6% (2016–2020) with population shrinking and aging. Geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) revealed that disposable personal income and total population are the predominant drivers of MSW growth. In contrast, the population change rate and the proportion of elderly were the key factors for MSW reduction. Urban MSW reduction exhibited higher sensitivity to population shrinking, resulting in a 141.6% greater reduction compared to rural MSW for every 1% population shrinking. Conversely, rural MSW reduction displayed a greater response to population aging, with a 19.7% reduction more than urban MSW for every 1% increase in the proportion of the elderly. Based on scenario analysis, the smart city development will curb population shrinking (7.6%), while increasing the well-being, life expectancy, and population share of the elderly (3.4%). Future population shrinking and aging is expected to contribute to the growth of MSW, and this trend is further amplified by the development of smart city. However, smart city development led to MSW reduction overall with an MSW amount of 76.8 Mt (7.5% lower than in the business-as-usual scenario) by 2040, mainly attributed to smart sanitation technology. This study offers valuable insights for decision-makers in MSW management, not only in China but also for other countries grappling with population regression challenges.}

Citizens populate the smart city and are the ones who are supposed to use the services provided by the government. In this article we explore and analyze digital and analogue services in smart homes developed in a new city district. We have conducted observational studies in 53 apartments during an urban living expo which we analyze by applying a set of socio-technical design principles. The research question that guides the analysis is: “What tensions between values in digital and analogue services for a smart living can be revealed by a socio-technical perspective?”. We identify five tensions between: 1) being in control and being controlled, 2) intended and undesirable use of personal data, 3) digital and analogue smartness, 4) smart home visions and practices, and 5) environmental and social sustainability. By revealing these tensions, we contribute to an understanding of the complexity of smart living. We also contribute by highlighting the importance of applying a perspective that captures both technology and citizen and user issues (i.e., social aspects) when developing services in the smart home context.}

However, the existing evaluation research on smart cities is still limited to a single objective or subjective perspective, and the CSG level that can reflect the sustainability of smart cities is not clear. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive method for evaluating CSG in smart cities. The proposed method combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy weight method (EWM) and ideal solution similarity ranking preference method (TOPSIS) to evaluate the CSG in 19 pilot smart cities in China. The empirical findings explore the CSG level in China’s pilot smart cities, revealing that Shanghai, Beijing, and Nanjing exhibit the highest level of CSG, and a significant correlation is observed between smartness and CSG. The CSG also show variety in different smart cities (i.e. urbanization rate and region) and among heterogeneous citizens (i.e. age, education background, and cognition of smart city). At the same time, this study provides support for each pilot city’s CSG enhancement strategy. In general, this study addresses the existing gap in evaluating CSG in smart cities, and provides valuable implications for policymakers to ensure the sustainability of smart cities in China.}

abstract = {Despite the wealth of research on smart cities, there is a lack of studies examining interlinkages between smart cities and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.}

This study aimed to find starting points for such integration by unraveling the ‘guiding visions’ of corporate technological innovators in the smart mobility and transport sector around Amsterdam. We conducted and analyzed interviews with innovators from 12 smart city start-ups and scale-ups based on three elements of guiding visions: (1) the desired future city, (2) the purposes of technologies they expect to fulfill, and (3) how technologies are thought to relate to their wider societal context. The interviewed innovators appeared to envision a clean, frictionless future city, whereby smart city technologies fulfilled four purposes: catalyzing efficiency, nudging citizens, customizing user experiences, and connecting places and people. Innovators’ ambitions for societal participation were modest and mainly aimed at end-users to optimize design features. Overall, the innovators’ guiding visions highlight the need for participatory futuring approaches that appeal to innovators’ motivation to make a social contribution, but also help them to widen and deepen their understanding of the public values that citizens perceive to be at stake in the smart city.}

The estimated results explore that China's smart city pilot policies (SCPP) encourage green innovation at the firm level, a finding that still holds after a sequence of robustness tests. Furthermore, the empirical evidence indicates that the influence of green innovations on the SCPP was more important for firms in non-state-owned enterprises, heavily polluting industries and non-resource-based cities relative to state-owned firms, firms in lightly-polluting industries and firms in non-resource-based cities. In addition, this study finds that the smart city pilot policy can provide a new incentive for the green innovation behaviour of enterprises via policy and agglomeration effects. Overall, the estimated findings suggest that the government should continue to play a positive role in constructing smart cities for enterprises' green innovation and implement smart city construction programmes following local conditions to help China's high-quality economic development.}

While many aspects of smart cities have been explored, there has been a disproportionate focus on physical and technological elements at the expense of social justice and democratic values. Although there have been attempts to advance the ideas of human-centric or people-centric approaches, a comprehensive perspective encompassing social rights, democratic values, and social justice is still missing. To fill this gap, this study introduces the concept of 'societal smart city', discusses its dimensions, and clarifies aspects of social justice as one of the main dimensions of a societal smart city. In addition to theoretical elaborations, we offer a case study of Tehran, the capital city of Iran, which has recently invested significantly in its technological infrastructure. For this purpose, we conducted a questionnaire survey. Results of the Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) indicate that four key factors, namely citizen-centric governance (α: 0.92, loading 15 variables), inclusive services (α: 0.91, loading 11 variables), resilient infrastructure (α: 0.9, loading 8 variables), and information literacy (α: 0.91, loading 6 variables) are the main underlying factors of social justice in Tehran. The study highlights the importance of social justice as a major dimension of the societal smart city and provides new insights for urban planners and policymakers on how to realize a societal smart city that offers benefits beyond physical and technological advances.}

There are three findings in this paper. First, we find that smart city pilots drive clean energy development. Second, we find that digital technologies can reinforce the positive impact of smart city pilots and that innovation and financial inclusion have a positive mediating role. Third, we find that the impact of smart city pilots has a heterogeneous impact. Namely, pilots in coastal, large, and resource-based cities have a more positive impact on clean energy development. Existing smart city pilots significantly impact energy security and sustainable development. Our study provides a new perspective on urban planning and clean energy development in emerging countries such as China.}

This has been done by a network of new technologies hosted in real time to track the activities and provide smart solutions for the incoming requests or problems of the citizens. One of the most often used methodologies for creating a smart city is the Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, the IoT-enabled smart city research topic, which consists of many different domains such as transportation, healthcare, and agriculture, has recently attracted increasing attention in the research community. Further, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) significantly contribute to the growth of IoT. In this paper, we first present the smart city concept, the background of smart city development and the components of the IoT-based smart city. This is followed up by a literature review of the research literature on the most recent IoT-enabled smart cities developments and breakthroughs empowered by AI techniques to highlight the current stage, major trends and unsolved challenges of adopting AI-driven IoT technologies for the establishment of desirable smart cities.

In this paper we examine this question using data from a unique survey of residents in three large Canadian cities: Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. The survey includes perceptions of both the importance and maturity of 23 policy or service areas, grouped along four dimensions (Services, Governance, Social and Economic). The results indicate that there is a misalignment in certain service and policy areas between the types of projects that cities are pursuing and the preferences of residents, indicating the need for broader and deeper engagement with the community in the design and implementation of smart city plans.}

These scenarios can be an obstacle to sustainable or smart city developments. In a building which consists of various components, windows are the most influential to contribute to this energy consumption. To abate the excessive amount of building energy consumption, an alternative glazing system is paramount. Among the other available energy-efficient glazing, an active smart switchable is promising as it can be altered based on occupant choice. In this work, four active smart switchable glazings have been studied (electrochromic, suspended particle device, liquid crystal and gasochromic) based on their operating principle, glazing factors and energetic application. It is evident that EC has more material aspect investigation and overall energetic application for PLDC, SPD and EC needs more study. Gasochromic which can be a potential in future is not explored in higher order. However, these types of windows integration in buildings and how they will have an impact on urban heat islands, part of smart buildings, smart cities and digital twins have also been discussed.}

A smart grid achieves such aforementioned power supply by ensuring resilient energy delivery, which presents opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of power supply and minimize environmental impacts. A systematic evaluation of the comprehensive benefits brought by smart grid to smart cities can provide necessary theoretical fundamentals for urban planning and construction towards a sustainable energy future. However, most of the present methods of assessing smart cities do not fully take into account the benefits expected from the smart grid. To comprehensively evaluate the development levels of smart cities while revealing the supporting roles of smart grids, this article proposes a model of smart city development needs from the perspective of residents’ needs based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs theory, which serves the primary purpose of building a smart city. By classifying and reintegrating the needs, an evaluation index system of smart grids supporting smart cities was further constructed. A case analysis concluded that smart grids, as an essential foundation and objective requirement for smart cities, are important in promoting scientific urban management, intelligent infrastructure, refined public services, efficient energy utilization, and industrial development and modernization. Further optimization suggestions were given to the city analyzed in the case include strengthening urban management and infrastructure constructions, such as electric vehicle charging facilities and wireless coverage.}

In this context, the notion of localizing the SDGs is highlighted as essential. Simultaneously, the smart city concept is promoted to address local sustainability challenges, and smart city strategies are used to support urban sustainability transitions. Despite the extensive literature on smart city transitions, no work was found that studies how such strategies may concretely support the localization of the SDGs. In response, we analyze 57 smart city strategies across 29 countries using the SDG framework to pinpoint which SDGs and accompanying Targets are localized through smart city initiatives. The results indicate that strategies strongly support the localization of four Goals (SDGs 7, 8, 9, and 11) along with several individual Targets. While the SDGs treated by the strategies depend on the local context, smart city strategy documents promote sustainable development initiatives across a spectrum of themes. However, for cities that use smart city strategies to encourage a fundamental shift towards a more sustainable urban model, careful attention must be paid to include initiatives on often untreated topics (SDGs 2, 5, and 15).}

Smart City Impact Index is developed with indicators in four pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, social, and governance) and technological dimension as technology is main driver of smart cities. The index was applied to South Korean cities, which are categorized as 1) first-wave smart cities that focus on transportation and security infrastructure, 2) second-wave smart cities that emphasize comprehensive urban management, and 3) non-smart cities. The index score was calculated for the years 2008 and 2018 to compare the before and after of smart city development. The results showed that the second-wave smart cities scored highest in both 2008 and 2018. However, the second-wave smart city had a lower score in both the environment and social dimensions. Smart city development in South Korea has had positive impacts on facilitating equality and citizen participation but negative impacts on people's perceptions of transparency and privacy.}

Sustainable energy systems in smart cities are systems can be evaluated by using multiple criteria decision making methods or methodologies based on several vague/imprecise evaluation criteria. In this paper, sustainable energy systems in smart cities are evaluated by interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets with an integrated optimization based multi-expert fuzzy Best Worst Method (BWM) and TOPSIS methodology that can better handle uncertainty and vagueness in experts’ linguistic assessments than existing methodologies. The considered criteria are weighted by multi-expert IVPF Best Worst Method, which has become a popular weighting method in recent years. Later, the energy alternatives for a real case study are prioritized by multi-expert IVPF TOPSIS method. In the analysis, the most important criterion is found as Environmental sustainability (C1) with the defuzzified weight of 0.218 while the other weights are as initial investment (C2) with 0.196, operating expenses (C3) with 0.163, technical feasibility (C4) with 0.154, social acceptability (C5) with 0.140, and scalability (C6) with 0.129. The obtained results indicate that “Investing in advanced technologies” in a smart city with relative degree of closeness (RDC) value of 0.798, has been determined as the best alternative among the considered five alternatives. It is closely followed by “Developing a transportation system” with the RDC value of 0.681. Sensitivity analysis shows that the ranking results are quite robust and reliable. The comparative analysis with crisp BWM and TOPSIS methodology is applied to check the validity of the proposed methodology.}
