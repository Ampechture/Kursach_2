abstract = {The electric vehicle (EV) market has witnessed a continuous and steady increase in the past few years. The benefits of lower energy costs and less greenhouse gas (GHG) emission have been widely recognized by customers. In addition to these benefits for the transportation sector, EVs are also considered a critical supplementary resource for building a sustainable energy system in a smart grid environment. The applications of EVs in a smart grid have attracted wide attention in recent years. One appealing application is to use aggregated EVs as either energy sources or sinks to provide a service of frequency regulation for the request signals from the grid. A real-time decision-making model is proposed in this paper for the EV aggregator to dynamically control the energy flow between the grid and each individual EV in the aggregated group as an effective response to the signals of frequency regulation issued by the grid using Markov Decision Process. The aggregator’s benefit is maximized through the identification of a set of optimal charging/discharging decisions for the aggregated EVs. A semi-online solution strategy is also proposed to find the near-optimal decisions on a real-time basis. A numerical case study is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

abstract = {The new energy demonstration city (NEDC) policy is an important strategic initiative for China to promote the priority development of renewable energy and build an ecological civilization system. Objectively evaluating its impact on carbon emissions is crucial for promoting urban energy transition and low-carbon governance. This study utilized nighttime light remote sensing data fitting to obtain city-level carbon emission data from 2006 to 2019. A spatial difference-in-difference model and a mechanism analysis model were constructed to analyze the spatial spillover effect and driving mechanism of NEDC policy on urban carbon emissions. The results indicate that NEDC policy not only effectively reduces local carbon emissions but also exhibits notable spatial spillover effects, promoting carbon reduction in surrounding cities. The boundary of spatial effect decay is 1000 km. Reducing energy consumption, improving energy efficiency, and promoting technological innovation are effective mechanisms for NEDC policy to reduce urban carbon emissions. Furthermore, NEDC policy also has a significant spatial spillover effect under the urban agglomeration association network, but exhibits heterogeneity across different types of urban agglomerations. Grounded in the context of China's reality, this study provides valuable insights for further advancing the strategic construction of NEDCs and formulating effective urban energy-saving and emission reduction policies.}

We analyse the interaction between the disclosure of information on property conditions and the disparity between home sellers' willingness to accept (WTA) and home buyers' willingness to pay (WTP). Three hypotheses are derived and validated through field experimental investigation within the property market. We find that a WTA–WTP disparity exists. The identified policy instrument for information disclosure appears to function as expected. The WTA–WTP disparity is considerably reduced after information disclosure, and market liquidity and efficiency are improved. This study is an important complement to prior research on how information changes the behaviour of consumers in housing markets. Findings can inform central governments about the wider benefits of smart disclosure in the future, as well as the scope, format and structure of information supplied to general housing consumers to promote efficiency.}

Therefore, web technologies provide a way towards integrating and sharing a common communication medium. However, for integrating Cyber–Physical System (CPS) and WoT, a comprehensive architecture and platform is still missing. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of Smart Cyber Society; propelling the concept of smart home. We then propose the virtual communication platform that is composed of six functional communication layers, which provides a common medium for communication, i.e., same communication language. In addition, a system architecture for smart cyber society is also proposed, which consists of three networked domains, such as cyber home domain (networked-home), cyber society domain (networked of various societies, i.e., hospitals, police station, and fire brigade), and cyber mobile domain (networked of vehicles). Furthermore, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS coreTMi5 machine with 3.2 GHz processor and 4 GB memory. Sample medical, sensory datasets and fire detection datasets are tested on the proposed system. Finally, the results show that the proposed system architecture efficiently processes, analyzes, and integrates different datasets efficiently and triggers actions to provide safety measurements for elderly age people, vehicles and others.}

This study investigates the integration between shared e-scooters and public transit by conducting a comparative analysis in 124 European cities based on vehicle availability data. Results suggest that the integration ratios of e-scooter sharing in different cities show significant variations and range from 5.59% to 51.40% with a mean value of 31.58% and a standard deviation of 8.47%. The temporal patterns of integration ratio for first- and last-mile trips present an opposite trend. An increase in the integration ratio for first-mile trips is related to a decrease in the integration ratio for last mile in the time series. Additionally, these cities can be divided into four clusters according to their temporal variations of the integration ratios by a bottom-up hierarchical clustering method. Meanwhile, we explore the nonlinear effects of city-level factors on the integration ratio using explainable machine learning. Several factors are found to have noticeable and nonlinear influences. For example, the density of public transit stations and a higher ratio of the young are positively associated with the integration ratio to a certain extent. The results potentially support transport planners to collectively optimize and manage e-scooter sharing and public transport to facilitate multi-modal transport systems.}

Embedded into these big data are implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information and valuable knowledge that can be discovered by data science solutions, which apply techniques like data mining. There has been a trend that more and more collections of these big data have been made openly available in science, government and non-profit organizations so that people could collaboratively study and analysis these open big data. In this article, we focus on open big data for public transit because public transit (e.g., bus) as a means of transportation is a vital part of many people’s lives. As time is a precious resource, bus delays could negatively affect commuters’ plans. Unfortunately, they are inevitable. Hence, many existing works focused on predicting bus delays. However, predicting on-time or early buses is also important. For instance, commuters who come to a bus stop on time may still miss their buses if the buses leave early. So, in this article, we examine open big data about bus performance (e.g., early, on-time, and late stops). We analyze the data with frequent pattern mining and make predictions with decision-tree based classification. For illustration, we perform predictive analytics on real-life open big data available on Winnipeg Open Data Portal, about bus performance from Winnipeg Transit. It shows the benefits of predictive analytics on open big data for supporting smart transportation services.}

However, modern-day cars, particularly smart or driverless cars, store a wealth of digital information, such as recent destinations, favorite locations, routes, and personal data (e.g. call logs, contact lists, SMS messages, pictures, and videos). In this paper, we describe some of the challenges associated with vehicle data forensics, which is an understudied area. Next, we present our case studies on forensic acquisition and data analysis of an entertainment system on a Volkswagen car.

In this paper, attention is focused on the formalization of a model for the optimal scheduling of charging of EVs in a smart grid, also considering the vehicle to grid process (i.e., the possibility for the EV to inject power during the charging process). In the formalization of an optimization problem for a smart grid, a deferrable demand is considered, which is represented by the charging demand of the set of EVs. The cost to be optimized for the considered problem includes the economic cost of energy production/acquisition (from the main grid) and the cost relevant to the delay in the satisfaction of the customers’ demand (is represented as a tardiness cost). Also, the income coming from the service provided to vehicles is taken into account. The developed model is tested and applied in connection with a real case study characterized by a photovoltaic plant, two batteries, power production plants that use natural gas as primary energy, and a charging station.}

The compass-clinometer module measures the orientation of geological structures using data collected from built-in sensors. It converts the sensor data to orientation information using an algorithm developed specifically for this purpose. The visualization module plots the measured data on stereographic projections using three different methods, and can be used concurrently with the compass-clinometer module. The analysis module conducts instability analyses on the measured data, and can present the results in graphical and statistical forms. Users can send or receive data wirelessly with the data management module, even without a connection to a cellular network. To evaluate and validate the precision and accuracy of the compass-clinometer module, indoor and outdoor tests were conducted using Smart Compass-Clinometer and a conventional compass-clinometer. The minimum standard deviation of measured values with Smart Compass-Clinometer was 0.096° for dip and 0.122° for dip direction. The average difference between values measured using Smart Compass-Clinometer and the conventional compass-clinometer in the outdoor test was 1.70° for dip and 2.63° for dip direction. In an underground mine, the average discrepancies between Smart Compass-Clinometer and the conventional compass-clinometer were 2.57° in dip and 4.57° in dip direction.

The data collected by IoT system in smart industry can be used to replace manual employee evaluation system where there are ample chances of biasness. This paper proposes a model for automated performance evaluation of employees in a smart industry. The model uses the data collected by embedded sensors in smart industrial system to identify various industrial activities of employees. The identified activities are then classified as positive, negative and neutral activities. In addition, an employee is said to be participating in an activity if employee and activity are co-located. Therefore, the model collects the location data of every employee using GPS devices and calculates the participation of each employee in each of the identified positive, negative and neutral activities based upon the location data. The information hence obtained is then used to draw cognitive decisions for employees using game theory. The experimental study compares the proposed model with manual employee evaluation system and the results depict performance improvement of proposed model over manual system. The impact of automated system on employees is then evaluated both experimentally and mathematically. The results show that the correct evaluation of employees by the model effectively motivates employees in the favor of industry. Thus, the proposed model effectively and efficiently automates cognitive employee evaluation system and decision making process in smart industry.}

However, the exhaustive search method is computationally expensive for selecting the optimal thresholds. Therefore, a hybrid bat algorithm with genetic crossover operation and smart inertia weight (SGA-BA) is proposed to choose the optimal thresholds. Furthermore, between-class variance (the Otsu method) and Kapur’s entropy are used as objective functions. In the novel SGA-BA, the smart inertia weight balances the SGA-BA’s exploration and exploitation based on the number of iterations and fitness values. Moreover, the local search capability of SGA-BA is strengthened by the crossover operation of the genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, the random vector is replaced by the beta distribution, which updates the frequency of bat in a smart way. The proposed SGA-BA was evaluated by a set of benchmark images with various levels of thresholds. Additionally, SGA-BA was compared with some well-known and recent heuristic algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), improved salp swarm algorithm (LSSA) and basic bat algorithm (BA). The experimental results show that the proposed SGA-BA provides better outcomes than the other algorithms.}

An IPIS improves the efficiency of disseminating real time parking vacancy information and provides convenience to drivers via Apps installed in their smart phones. After giving an overview of various IPISs being applied globally, this research on a typical IPIS is aimed at valuing the benefits to drivers and modelling how variations in the independent variables affect their use. A stated preference approach is presented with a discrete choice survey conducted in Hong Kong with more than 800 valid samples. Contingent Valuation (CV) is applied to evaluate the intangible benefits associated with the use of IPIS, based on the estimation of Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) for its installation with a binary logit model. An aggregated WTP would be useful to policy makers when making decisions to scale up the system. It was found that three factors (download habit, parking time, and parking App usage) have positive impacts on WTP, whereas length of driving experience turned out to have a significantly negative influence. The econometric analysis provides useful contributions for the objective assessment of the viability of IPIS projects and their further investment in an emerging smart city environment.}

The IEC and the EPRI have backed to this end the harmonization of two widely used industrial standards, the CIM and the IEC 61850, as the global unified ontology in the smart grid scenario. Still, persisting such a huge general ontology in each and every one of the members of a distributed system is neither practical nor feasible. Moreover, the smart grid will be a heterogeneous conglomerate of legacy and upcoming architectures that will require first the possibility of representing all the existing assets in the power network as well as new unknown ones, and second, the collaboration of different entities of the system in order to deploy complex activities. Finally, the smart grid presents diverse time span requirements, such as real-time, and all of them must be addressed efficiently but use resources sparingly. Against this background, we put forward an architecture of intelligent nodes spread all over the smart grid structure. Each intelligent node only has a profile of the global ontology. Moreover, adding reasoning abilities, we achieve simultaneously the required intelligence distribution and local decision making. Furthermore, we address the aforementioned real-time and quasi-real-time requirements by integrating stream data processing tools within the intelligent node. Combined with the knowledge base profile and the reasoning capability, our intelligent architecture supports semantic stream reasoning. We have illustrated the feasibility of this approach with a prototype composed of three substations and the description of several complex activities involving a number of different entities of the smart grid. Moreover, we have also addressed the potential extension of the unified ontology.}

abstract = {Governments across the world are investing in smart metering devices that report energy use to the user with the aim of reducing consumption. However, the effectiveness of such In-Home Displays (IHDs) has been questioned, since savings are small. This is possibly because informing the consumer of their consumption in kWh, or monetary units, fails to give context, or inform of possible actions to reduce consumption. We investigate, for the first time, the effect of replacing the simple statement of energy use an IHD gives, with a detailed array of information specifically designed to improve consumer energy literacy and suggest behaviour change through personalised actionable messages set against a series of psychological value systems for context, and which can identify potential profligacy. The results from a carefully controlled field experiment show: 1) value framing and action prompts have a significant effect on occupants' behaviour, with the mean temperature of homes being reduced from 22.4 °C to 21.7 °C, and a marked reduction in gas consumption—22.0% overall and 27.2% in high consumers; 2) energy literacy increasing from 0.52 to 1.28 (on a 0–4 scale); 3) it is possible to target potentially profligate households, without inappropriately messaging others; 4) engagement is high, with 82% of the participants finding the system useful. These results emphasize the necessity of improving energy literacy when encouraging energy efficient behaviours and point to a new generation of smart meters with the potential to increase energy literacy, make much greater savings and impact climate change policy.}

They constitute an opportunity to create new urban hubs, considered as nodes of intermodality and places of urban intensity. In order to effectively plan the future locations of shared mobility hubs, this paper outlines the methodological framework that sustains the design of a new decision-support tool, the so-called Mcda2MobilityHub (M2MHub),11Link to the M2MHub tool, which is available as an open plugin for QGIS: https://github.com/natrouk/Mcda2MobilityHub-desicion-support-tool_QGIS-plugin. using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). For this purpose, the analysis of existing literature and interviews with local authorities and transport operators, led to the identification of six main location criteria (mobility, compactness, diversity of uses, profile of potential users, spatial configuration and environment). The criteria weights were calculated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the framework was applied to the case study of the city of Barcelona. The results obtained are presented in the form of heat maps, highlighting the flexibility of the decision-support tool to transform open data into appropriate indicators and detailed maps. This output can be used to support future policies for planning shared mobility hubs as places for convenient multimodal transfers, which also enable social activities and improve the quality of life in European cities.}

Articles in this field either take a regional or company point of view. During the last few decades, studies on the relatedness of knowledge and its importance for innovation and commercialisation have pushed policy makers towards clustering strategies such as smart specialisation in the EU and the Innovation Supercluster Initiative in Canada. Interestingly, universities as the source of new knowledge and technologies have been absent from this literature as the focal point. This paper aims at filling one of the missing links between the literature on technological relatedness and university research commercialisation. We use patent and licence data from the USPTO and the AUTM survey to study the effect of patent portfolio composition on university research commercialisation. We use Shannon’s entropy index to differentiate between the effects of related and unrelated diversification on the number of licences generating income. Our results show a positive association of related diversification with the number of licences, but none for unrelated diversification. Furthermore, technological proximity follows an inverted-U shaped association with the number of licences generating income. However, the effect is observed only for smaller universities. We conclude that the curvilinear association is the result of cognitive distance and the absence of boundary spanners. Our findings indicate that regional policy makers intending to use universities as an engine for innovation and regional economic growth should consider policies and initiatives aimed at bridging the cognitive gap between university and industry by either increasing technological proximity or reducing cognitive distances by financing boundary spanning organisations.}

The concept of driverless is also being applied to any moving vehicle such as wheelchairs, golf cars, tourism carts in recreational parks, etc. To achieve this ambition, vehicles must be able to drive safely on streets stay within required lanes, sense moving objects, sense obstacles, and be able to read traffic signs that are permanent and even temporary signs. It will be a completely integrated system of the Internet of Things (IoT), Global Positioning System (GPS), Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL), and Smart Technologies. A lot of work has been done on traffic sign recognition in the English language, but little has been done for Arabic traffic sign recognition. The concepts used for traffic sign recognition can also be applied to indoor signage, smart cities, supermarket labels, and others. In this paper, we propose two optimized Residual Network (ResNet) models (ResNet V1 and ResNet V2) for automatic traffic sign recognition using the Arabic Traffic Signs (ArTS) dataset. Additionally, the authors developed a new dataset specifically for Arabic Traffic Sign recognition consisting of 2,718 images taken from random places in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The optimized proposed ResNet V1 model achieved the highest training and validation accuracies of 99.18% and 96.14%, respectively. It should be noted here that the authors accounted for both overfitting and underfitting in the proposed models. It is also important to note that the results achieved using the proposed models outperform similar methods proposed in the extant literature for the same dataset or similar-size dataset.}

This study presents the possibility of utilizing an open-sourced real-time web-based platform linking simulation results to dashboards. Here, the micro traffic simulation, VISSIM is used. Traffic flow at intersections and location information of individual vehicles are stored in the cloud from VISSIM at analysis intervals. In real-time, the saved results are loaded into Elasticsearch, an open-source visualization tool. Data are visualized according to temporal and spatial characteristics and constitute the dashboard layout. Users intuitively analyze and predict traffic conditions through this visualization platform. In addition, traffic conditions can be easily communicated to general users who use web-based information.}

A multi-utility company could exploit wired and wireless communications to make homogenous access to smart metering even in hard-to-reach locations. For this reason, several standard solutions have been proposed in the recent past, all having a common approach based on the use of narrowband and robust modulation schemes. This paper suggests the adoption of a reconfigurable and multi-core approach for implementing a smart meter capable to easily switch among different standards and various application scenarios. The basic idea is to exploit the “software defined” paradigm for the realization of the three main units of a smart meter, i.e., the communication, the time synchronization and the measurement subsystems. A prototypal platform has been developed around low-cost GPP and DSP cores, using an FPGA for the implementation of reconfigurable peripherals, without losing in generality. Some experimental results have been carried out to verify the affordability and feasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting requirements in terms of computational and memory resource needs.}

To evaluate the impact of lockdown policies in the context of the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic, we leverage data on daily confirmed cases per million people and related characteristics of a large set of cities. The study analyzed 369 Chinese cities, among which 188 implemented lockdowns of varying severity levels from January 23 to March 31, 2020. We use nationwide Baidu Mobility data to estimate the impact of lockdown policies on mitigating COVID-19 cases through reducing human mobility. We adopt a heterogeneous treatment effect model to quantify the effect of lockdown policies on containing confirmed case counts. Our results suggest that lockdowns substantially reduced human mobility, and larger reduction in mobility occurred within-city compared to between-city. The COVID-19 daily confirmed cases per million people decreased by 9% - 9.2% for every ten-percentage point fall in within-city travel intensity in t+7 timeframe. We also find that one city’s lockdowns can effectively reduce the spillover cases of the traveler’s destination cities. We find no evidence that stricter lockdowns are more effective at mitigating COVID-19 risks. Our findings provide practical insights about the effectiveness of NPI during the early outbreak phase of the unprecedented pandemic.}

Such an understanding can benefit urban transport planners as well as urban modelling by providing simulation models with realistic mobility patterns of transit networks. In particular, the study of temporal activities has elicited substantial interest. In this regard, a number of methods have been developed in the literature for this type of analysis, most using clustering approaches. This paper presents a two-level generative model that applies the Gaussian mixture model to regroup passengers based on their temporal habits in their public transportation usage. The strength of the proposed methodology is that it can model a continuous representation of time instead of having to employ discrete time bins. For each cluster, the approach provides typical temporal patterns that enable easy interpretation. The experiments are performed on five years of data collected by the Société de transport de l’Outaouais. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in identifying a reduced set of passenger clusters linked to their fare types. A five-year longitudinal analysis also shows the relative stability of public transport usage.}

The circuit is instrumental for electrical energy storage whenever all the batteries (accumulators) within the network are charged, and a constant energy surplus exists in the network. The generated surplus energy is then converted to hydrogen, which is stored in a metal hydride storage case. At times of low energy status in the network, namely when the batteries are discharged and the applied generators (such as photovoltaic, wind, or microhydro power plants) cannot supply energy, a fuel cell is activated. The cell's operation principle is basically the reverse of that for an electrolytic cell (electrolyser), meaning that the cell consumes the hydrogen from the metal hydride storage to produce electric energy; this energy is subsequently stored in batteries (accumulators) connected to the smart grid. In the given context, the article aims to describe the relevant experiment and to present the algorithm to calculate energy efficiency, a most significant parameter of the entire hydrogen circuit.}

REDI based suggestions are place‐based and offer rationale for tailor‐made regional policy interventions. We found that without optimizing the entrepreneurial ecosystem, the industry specialization alone may not be successful because of the inability of the ecosystem to nurture high growth ventures.
Resumen
Este artículo demuestra que el Índice de Desarrollo e Iniciativa Empresarial Regional (IDIE) se puede utilizar para optimizar los procesos de descubrimiento de iniciativas empresariales locales, de manera que pueda servir de apoyo a las estrategias de especialización inteligentes (S3, por sus siglas en inglés). Si bien la priorización de industrias de las S3 se basa en la identificación de las fortalezas locales, la mejora regional se puede lograr mejorando las características más débiles del ecosistema local de iniciativas empresariales. Las sugerencias basadas en el IDIE están ligadas a cada lugar y ofrecen una justificación para realizar intervenciones formuladas a medida para las políticas regionales. Se descubrió que si no se optimiza el ecosistema de iniciativas empresariales, la especialización de la industria por sí sola puede no tener éxito, debido a la incapacidad del ecosistema para fomentar empresas de alto crecimiento.

本稿では、スマート・スペシャリゼーション戦略(smart specialization strategies:S3)を支持する方法で、地域の起業家的発見のプロセスを最適化するために、Regional Entrepreneurship and Development Index (REDI:地域のアントレプレナーシップと発展の指数)をどのように利用することができるかを例示する。S3は地域の強みを特定することにより産業の優先順位付けを行っているものの、地域の改善は、地域の起業エコシステムの最たる弱点を改善して達成できるものである。REDIに基づく提案は、地域ベースのものであり、地域個別の地域政策の介入の根拠を提示するものである。エコシステムには急成長ベンチャーを育成する能力がないため、起業エコシステムの最適化なくしては、産業特化は成功しない可能性があると考えられる。}

abstract = {In this paper, the isogeometric analysis (IGA) integrated with a simple first-order shear deformation theory (S-FSDT) with only four variables per node is extended to study geometrically nonlinear natural frequency, nonlinear static bending and transient dynamic response of two types of smart piezoelectric functionally graded plates (PFGPs) in thermal environment. The neutral surface is introduced to avoid the stretching-bending coupling effect. The nonlinear strain–displacement relation of the plates is obtained by combining the von Karman strains with the S-FSDT. To investigate the nonlinear mechanical behavior of PFGPs in thermal environment, closer to the real situation, an augmented piezoelectric constitutive equation considering the thermal effects of piezoelectric stress and dielectric constants is used. The accuracy and effectiveness of developed approach are demonstrated through numerical experiment with comparison. We additionally investigate the variation of temperature distribution on geometrically nonlinear response of PFGPs suffering thermo-electro-mechanical load.}

abstract = {Environmental concerns and high prices of fossil fuels increase the feasibility of using renewable energy sources in smart grid. Smart grid technologies are currently being developed to provide efficient and clean power systems. Communication in smart grid allows different components to collaborate and exchange information. Traditionally, the utility company uses a central management unit to schedule energy generation, distribution, and consumption. Using centralized management in a very large scale smart grid forms a single point of failure and leads to serious scalability issues in terms of information delivery and processing. In this paper, a three-level hierarchical optimization approach is proposed to solve scalability, computational overhead, and minimize daily electricity cost through maximizing the used percentage of renewable energy. At level one, a single home or a group of homes are combined to form an optimized power entity (OPE) that satisfies its load demand from its own renewable energy sources (RESs). At level two, a group of OPEs satisfies energy requirements of all OPEs within the group. At level three, excess in renewable energy from different groups along with the energy from the grid is used to fulfill unsatisfied demands and the remaining energy are sent to storage devices.}

Intelligent and effective solutions are necessary to tackle the matter of facilities’ sustainability and efficiency. Promoting efficient and environmentally sustainable SFs is pivotal towards environmentally friendly and socially resilient cities. There is a lack of systematic literature review focused on the progress in SFs operation, sustainability, and energy optimization. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research presents the first review article addressing the research gap in building operation management and optimization for SFs compared to other types of buildings and SFs located in hot climatic zones compared to cold ones. The topic’s significance is highlighted with emphasis on the climatic zone and the characteristics of SFs. A comprehensive review and in-depth discussion of existing solutions are presented. Limited studies covered the management and optimization of SFs for the past five years compared to residential and commercial buildings, and 71% of them were for facilities located in cold regions. About 45% of the surveyed works targeted swimming pools since they are the most popular SFs’ type with the highest energy consumption per usable area. 39% of the reviewed studies employed simulation-based approaches to investigate the subject, 26% used artificial intelligence and machine learning, and 35% utilized optimization algorithms and other standard approaches. The limitations of those works and the prospects in energy and operation optimization of SFs are presented. The latter includes deploying evolving typologies such as deep learning, developing modular solutions that can be integrated into existing technologies, and deploying renewable energy systems for sustainable facilities. Finally, the active role of SFs in energy markets is discussed.}

Accordingly, there is a need to develop strategies to motivate and involve citizens in the future electricity system. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an important role to play in reducing the energy intensity and therefore increasing the energy efficiency of the economy, contributing to sustainable growth. The emphasis of the smart grid in social media through mobile apps could give utilities a collection of new instruments to improve their customer engagement. To preserve long-term customer fidelity, utilities should transform themselves from energy suppliers to energy service advisor. Utilities can draw useful lessons from most valuable brands on how to expand their digital customer experience initiatives. Therefore, this paper discusses and offers guidance for utilities in creating a social roadmap for the smart grid, emphasizing prosumer role.}

It is further complemented by a control strategy focused on maximizing the electrical power produced when varying different water velocities. This method is based on three operating zones defined by the electrical frequency produced by the generator, and where different values of direct current set points are defined. It is set in motion in a boost converter power stage, using a maximum current control, with constant off time in the power switch, and continuous or discontinuous mode of operation depending on the current value required. The control strategy has been validated though the use of dynamic simulations. The microturbine modules are suitable for alignment in rows to increase the power produced. The modules connected in smart grids define the hydrokinetic smart grid concept. A global control strategy for hydrokinetic smart grids has also been proposed and tested.}

They are powerful in their procurement role and have the potential to promote and encourage consumers to buy climate smarter food. While food retailers have developed environmental visions, policies and goals, a major question is to what extent these commitments translate into action in the products sourced and promoted. This paper aims to explore the ways and extent to which food retailers assist consumers to make climate smarter food choices, more specific to reduce their meat consumption, and to identify potential and perceived difficulties towards doing this. The empirical data is based on interviews with 17 Swedish food retail representatives. The findings indicate that food retailers address climate change in their environmental policy statements and have environmental targets for retail operations, such as energy and transport efficiency and recycling of waste. Moreover, retailers promote and encourage consumers to buy organic, local, and seasonal food and to minimize food waste. No initiatives are taken to help consumers reduce their meat consumption. Yet, there is a growing consensus among scientists that meat production is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Food retailers seem reluctant to guide consumers to climate smarter food choices if it means reducing the meat range or the promotion of meat. To broaden the range of high quality and more expensive meat is seen as a more feasible option. The meat category is perceived as important to attract new and keep loyal customers.}

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate an ultra-efficient air conditioner with extremely low operating energy consumption to realize the goal of climate change, especially in the (sub) tropical area. In this paper, an ultra-efficient air conditioner with smart evaporative cooling ventilation and photovoltaic is proposed, which is composed of a highly efficient air conditioner, a fresh air ventilator with evaporative cooling, an evaporative condenser, and a photovoltaic. The mechanical vapor compression system adopts a gas-injected vapor compression cycle with relay cooling, which adapts to extremely high temperatures and harsh environments. Fresh air ventilation, water usage, and indoor temperature/humidity control strategies are also proposed. In the 31-day field test, the independent ventilator operation hours accounted for approximately 38.4% of the total test period. The electricity savings reached 89.8% as the indoor temperature and humidity satisfied all requirements. Through a typical 10-day lab-simulated year-round performance test, the calculated annual power consumption of the ultra-efficient air conditioner was 746.2 kWh, which was 82.8% lower than that of the baseline prototype. Based on the Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio test, the calculated results revealed a consumption of 8.43 kWh/kWh, an improvement of approximately 140.7%. The comprehensive electricity-saving rate was 84.1%. The developed prototype won the global cooling prize since it will counterbalance the booming of residential cooling demand in the future, demonstrating a reliable route for energy savings for room air conditioners.}

Recent methods exploit graph spatial–temporal characteristics, including constructing the shared patterns of traffic data, and modeling the topological space of traffic data. However, existing methods fail to consider the spatial position information and only utilize little spatial neighborhood information. To tackle above limitation, we design a Graph Spatial–Temporal Position Recurrent Network (GSTPRN) architecture for traffic forecasting. We first construct a position graph convolution module based on self-attention and calculate the dependence strengths among the nodes to capture the spatial dependence relationship. Next, we develop approximate personalized propagation that extends the propagation range of spatial dimension information to obtain more spatial neighborhood information. Finally, we systematically integrate the position graph convolution, approximate personalized propagation and adaptive graph learning into a recurrent network (i.e. Gated Recurrent Units). Experimental evaluation on two benchmark traffic datasets demonstrates that GSTPRN is superior to the state-of-art methods.}

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) usage. It aims to understand charging patterns in urban environments and retrieve some real-world insights. By collecting a 2-years historical dataset (from 2019 to 2021) of a public EVSE based in Rabat, the methodology presented in this study covers time evolution assessment, energy delivery analysis, and users’ behavior characterization. The analysis of about 2835 events showed that the average energy delivery is 12 kWh corresponding to an average charging duration of 48 min. Also, more than 95% of charging sessions consumed less than 25 kWh, which corresponds on average to 60km. The performed analyses resulted in various findings that led to a set of recommendations that could be insightful for different types of stakeholders (policymakers, grid operators, charging operators, EV drivers, etc.). Furthermore, the methodology followed in this work is reproducible and may be used as a reference for other EVSE usage analyses.}

abstract = {Radiofrequency radiation (RFR), used for wireless communications and “smart” building technologies, including the “Internet of Things,” is increasing rapidly. As both RFR exposures and scientific evidence of harmful effects increase apace, it is timely to heed calls to include low RFR levels as a performance indicator for the health, safety and well-being of occupants and the environment. Adverse biochemical and biological effects at commonly experienced RFR levels indicate that exposure guidelines for the U.S., Canada and other countries are inadequate to protect public health and the environment. Some industry liability insurance providers do not offer coverage against adverse health effects from radiation emitted by wireless technologies, and insurance authorities deem potential liability as “high.” Internationally, governments have enacted laws, and medical and public health authorities have issued recommendations, to reduce and limit exposure to RFR. There is an urgent need to implement strategies for no- or low-RFR emitting technologies, and shielding, in building design and retrofitting. These strategies include installing wired (not wireless) Internet networks, corded rather than cordless phones, and cable or wired connections in building systems (e.g., mechanical, lighting, security). Building science can profit from decades of work to institute performance parameters, operationalizing prudent guidelines and best practices. The goal is to achieve RFR exposures that are ALARA, “As Low As Reasonably Achievable.” We also challenge the business case of wireless systems, because wired or cabled connections are faster, more reliable and secure, emit substantially less RFR, and consume less energy in a sector with rapidly escalating greenhouse gas emissions.}

abstract = {Low-lying coastal cities are highly vulnerable to compound floods, which may result from a simultaneous occurrence of storm surges and heavy rainfall. Systematic numerical analysis is essential for projecting flood scenarios upon compound events. In this study, a coupled model that integrates the 1D drainage module with the 2D overland flow module is developed and validated by taking Macau as the study area. The joint cumulative probability distribution between rainfall and storm tide are derived based on the historical typhoon data. The flood hazards are projected under designed scenarios, and an investigation is conducted on the backflow processes through drainage system and effectiveness of installing tide gates. The flood zones are delineated and the contributions of rainfall and storm tide to floods are analyzed. Storm surge exerts a greater influence on the maximum inundation depth in the western Macau Peninsula than heavy precipitation does. As the peak tidal level increases from a 10-year to a 200-year return period, the increments of flooded area ratio to the total land area are approximately 19 %. The backflows through underground drainage system could expand the tide affected area during storm events, as indicated by the backflows in the pipe 1.4 km away from the coastal boundary. By installing tide gates, backflows could be greatly eliminated in the corresponding pipes. The inundation area in the compound flood scenario is not equal to the superposition of the extents by the individual components. The transition area that is affected by both storm tide and rainfall extends from coast to inland areas under the combined effects. This study is expected to furnish valuable insights for flood risk assessment, flood hazard prevention and mitigation in low-lying coastal cities such as Macau.}

This is because SAs can enhance the maximization of output power of the signal in desired directions amongst a whole lot of functions. Despite these benefits of SAs, long range communications still face unsolved challenges such as signal fading. Therefore, this paper focuses on enhancing the recursive least squares (RLS) in SA design for long range communication networks. The conventional RLS algorithm does not need any matrix inversion computations because the inverse correlation matrix is determined directly. Therefore, the RLS saves computational power. Hence, we have enhanced the RLS algorithm by introducing a constant m to the gain factor in order to yield an improved gain vector. Results from our simulations show that the enhanced RLS reduces mean square error (MSE), smoothens filter output and improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These benefits further result in the antenna’s gain improvement leading to an increased range and directivity of the smart antenna over a long range communication networks.}

One option that cities have is to start networking and build learning alliances with other cities. Forming meaningful alliances however asks for clear and easily accessible city-matching methodologies which are based on a standardised assessment approach and the presence of structured and large databases. The City Blueprint Approach is an example of such a methodology. Aim of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of this approach as a substantive methodology for enhancing learning on urban water management. This is done by illustrating the use of the approach in four cities, which were studied in the H2020 project POWER (Political and sOcial awareness on Water EnviRonmental challenges) and by comparing the results found with good practices present in the City Blueprint database. These good practices however cannot simply be copy-pasted from one city to another. We therefore outline in what way more in-depth city-to-city (C2C) learning results can be achieved and be tailored to best-fit particular urban areas. The paper concludes with some suggestions for enhancing the potential for C2C learning in urban water management networks.}

The assessments concern the impact of policies on different objectives, but also opinions concerning the importance of these objectives. These opinions are translated into constraints on the weights of the corresponding criteria, in a partial information setting. Then, policies are sorted into categories based on a stochastic multi-criteria analysis for the ELECTRE TRI method. A new ranking approach is also developed to be compatible with the sorting results, based on a robustness analysis of ELECTRE TRI credibility indices. Results are discussed considering the entire set of experts and considering subsets of experts representing different perspectives.}

The multi-channel AAVC methodology based on the filtered-X leastmean square (FXLMS) algorithm is widely implemented in active control applications owing to its self-adjustment ability to adaptto dynamically varying structures. In this paper, a new multi-channel FXLMS with online secondary path modelling (SPM) is designed based on the auxiliary random noise technique. Through a defined indirect error signal, the proposed variable step-size (VSS) strategies can ensure that every online SPM filter and every active control filter have their own exclusive step size to update the coefficients. Moreover, the proposed auxiliary noise power scheduling (ANPS) strategy can ensure that the variation rules of auxiliary noise power applied to different secondary paths are different. A complete multi-channel AAVC real-time experimental system based on NI compact RIO is set up to conduct the experimental investigation. A series of AAVC control experiments on a piezoelectric smart cantilever plate with PZT sensors and actuators are conducted to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the vibration of the smart cantilever plate could be effectively attenuated with a high convergence rate. The proposed methodology has an important advantage in applications where active vibration control of piezoelectric smart structures is required.}

This paper presents a forecasting model that assesses the possible impacts of Smart Infrastructure technology currently being applied to the British water pipe market. In doing so, we identify key benefits of proactively managing infrastructure with such new technology. A probabilistic cost benefit analysis, which takes into account future uncertainty, is conducted using a Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings suggest that if the Smart Infrastructure sensor system is applied to water pipelines in the British market, there are likely to be significant economic benefits. They could be realised by avoiding disruption and damage costs (including water loss) due to water pipe bursts, as well as by reducing annual operating and maintenance costs.

Five main methods have been chosen by asking experts in the related fields and to evaluate and select a proper way to design smart bridges.

Second, it explores how citizens view their participation and the respective challenges. This study was conducted within the Portuguese context, following a methodology supported by mixed methods research, which combined interviews with policymakers and questionnaires applied to citizens. Furthermore, this research shows detailed data about how the Portuguese population and how particular groups wish to engage in decision-making. Guidelines are presented in the following areas: willingness to be identified, subjects, topics, methods, and channels to participate. The findings suggest there is significant heterogeneity on the engagement modes.

As micromobility increases in popularity and becomes incorporated in policies and city planning, it is important to understand how disadvantaged and underserved communities utilize shared micromobility options. Underserved communities typically have the lowest access to transportation options and thus, opportunities to jobs, health care, and food. While micromobility has the potential to increase opportunities in low-income areas, it is unclear how people in low-income and high minority areas use these options. Using publicly available API data, we analyze how e-scooters and e-bikes are employed in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Detroit, and Louisville. We find that the built environment had a strong impact on both the number of trips within a census block group (CBG) and the duration of those trips. Specifically, pedestrian-friendly intersections (e.g. low-speed roads, bicycle and pedestrian trails) generated more trips than automobile oriented facilities. Presence of fixed transportation and percentage of households with one or less cars had a strong and positive impact on the number of trips. The proportion of minorities and percentage of low-wage employment in a CBG are both negatively associated with trips in all four cities. The results suggest that existing efforts to promote shared micromobility usage in minority and low-income communities may not be sufficient. Designing pedestrian and bicycle-oriented streets, increasing public outreach and promoting access, and enforcing equity zones could increase shared micromobility usage in low-income and minority areas.}

abstract = {Traveling vehicles participate in emphasizing the global warming problem due to the gases produced by them. The exponential increase in the number of daily traveling vehicles has exaggerated the world pollution problem threatening the life on the planet. This encourages several environmental organizations to look for designing green vehicles. Moreover, several countries have forced green driving rules and technologies. Road intersections are considered high fuel consumption areas over the road network. This is due to the required power to stop moving vehicles and restart stopped vehicles at these intersections. This work introduces an efficient traffic light scheduling algorithm (SmartLight) that controls the competing traffic flows at the road intersections. It is designed to reduce the total consumed fuel of vehicles and thus it reduces their produced gases. The topology of the road intersection, the context of the competing traffic flows, and the real-time traffic characteristics of each flow are mainly considered to schedule the phases of each located traffic light. The phases of the traffic light cycle are primly set to allow emergency vehicles to pass through the intersection without stopping. Then, the traffic flow that contains heavy vehicles or has the highest weight among the competing traffic flows is assigned the highest priority to pass through the signalized intersection. Finally, the average waiting delay time of each flow on the signalized intersection should not exceed a pre-determined threshold to guarantee fair sharing of the signalized intersection. The scheduling time of each phase is set based on the lengths of platoons of vehicles that are scheduled during that phase from different un-conflicted traffic flows. An experimental study has evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm (SmartLight) compared to previous traffic light scheduling algorithms in terms of total fuel consumption, gas emission, the average queuing delay time of vehicles, and the throughput of the road intersection.}

In light of climate change and the rapid urbanisation process, future flood risks and consequences of compound floods are growing. Among global coastal cities, Chinese coastal cities face substantial challenges reflected in recent flood impacts and damages. Here we investigate the previous compound flood sources, impacts, consequences, challenges, and more importantly the response measures from the case of Chinese coastal cities by integrating the media sources and governmental literature analyses. We have found that, during the last decade (the 2010s–2020s), the Chinese Central Government (CCG) and Municipality authorities have co-produced good practices to reduce compound flood impacts accordingly via efficient emergency responses, technological services (e.g., via mobile phones and apps), and improvement of the blue-green (i.e., via “Sponge City Program”) and adopted with the engineering measures standard in the coastal urban environment. For the advancement in the next 10 years and beyond, we encourage the governments to transform the Chinese coastal cities by further implementing the “Sponge”, Nature-Based Solutions mixed with communication technologies, engineering and meteorological perspectives. These practices are the keys to improving future Chinese coastal flood resilience in terms of reducing the risk and consequences of the compound flood generated by sea-level rise, storm surges and intensive rainstorms under climate uncertainties.}

This paper explores how Climate-resiliency Field Schools involving smallholder farmers in the Mindanao region of the Philippines advance climate-smart farming practices. Using data from field observations, 86 interviews, and 13 focus group discussions from five municipalities, the research finds that cross-scale activities, including local plans and multi-stakeholder forums, and municipal budgeting processes, influence adaptation and mitigation to climate change in smallholder farming systems. Furthermore, using matrix analysis and stakeholder responses, we identify interactions, synergies, conflicts, and potential co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation, and food production practices. The analysis of climate-resiliency field school practices shows that the addition of livelihood outcomes to smallholder farming landscapes strengthen adaptation, mitigation, and food production outcomes (and vice versa). Climate-resiliency Field Schools have promoted the practice of organic farming, various systems for rice intensification, and the establishment of community seed banks. Other practices, such as soil conservation, reforestation, and agroforestry, have been used in Mindanao to maintain carbon stocks while increasing crop production. Climate-resiliency Field Schools serve as a multilevel institutional platform where farmers can access climate information, which they can use to improve farm planning (i.e., choices of crops, timing of farm preparation, and harvest). The research findings suggest that climate-smart interventions are highly location-specific, technically rigorous, involve knowledge-intensive processes, and are influenced by the knowledge and capacities of local farming communities and implementing partners. We conclude with some suggestions for the design of programs, and the types of interventions that are required to sustain and ultimately scale up efforts to enhance climate-smart agriculture.}

This is mainly due to the ability to manage and process information and deploy actions in real-time mode. One important measurement tool is the smart meter, which will be present with all customers. Besides the measurement function, it has the communication feature and also some computational processing capability. Considering this base structure, the objective is to present methods to classify/identify nonlinear loads based only on current or voltage profiles measured by smart meters in this distributed computing environment. In this work, the MAS will manage the data and the tasks related to the classification and the ANN will perform the classification, both tools have been developed in JADE/JAVA and Matlab environment, respectively.

Bruny Island has a problem of peak demand for electricity during tourist periods, and a back-up diesel generator is currently used to supply electricity during peaks. An alternative solution is being trialled through CONSORT: household-level battery storage, which can be drawn upon by the utility to supply the grid as required. In this paper we explore two energy geography issues: first, how global and national energy challenges are manifesting on Bruny Island through the CONSORT project, and, second, the ways in which the particular sociotechnical context of Bruny Island has influenced the CONSORT project, creating tensions as well as opening up opportunities for energy innovation.}

Furthermore, the smoothing process of a large wind farm in which the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is used, needs a considerable initial investment cost. Utilizing Smart Parking Lots (SPLs) can be considered as an applicable solution. In this paper, assuming conventional parking lots in Tehran converted to an SPL set in a near future and thus establishing an enormous charging/discharging capacity, the smoothing process is performed on a 51 MW wind farm. For this purpose, a coordinated control system based on two control algorithms is proposed. The first proposed algorithm chooses eligible SPLs for charging/discharging activity before receiving a new sample of the wind farm output power. Afterwards, the second proposed algorithm determines qualified vehicles in selected SPLs. The main aim is to minimize the number of SPLs (vehicles) taking part in the process. According to the simulation results, the required BESS capacity in the power smoothing process of a typical wind farm decreases considerably when the proposed approach is applied. Thus, the investment cost of BESS is reduced significantly.}

This would enhance load and market operations through realization of the full range and value of services from storage technologies. Energy storage technologies provide significant opportunities to further enhance the efficiency and operation of the grid. Its ability to provide application-specific energy services across different components of the grid make it uniquely suited to respond quickly and effectively to signals throughout the smart grid. Therefore, energy storage as a distinct asset class will increase the value of storage investments while enhancing the operation of the smart grid. To further this goal, storage requires policy support. Research, development and demonstration (RD&D) policies will increase operational experience and reduce costs; investment tax credits will accelerate investment in storage projects; and continued market deregulation will augment revenue streams, enhance competition, and provide more accurate prices for storage services.}

All this carelessness and irresponsible activities plays a dominant role in accidents that are leading to cause of death and disability. Helmets plays a major role for protecting a human head injury in case of accidents. The purpose of this research is to create a smart and secure electronic helmet that plays a vital role in protecting human lives from accidents and this helmet help to send and monitor the information about the vehicle and also the person driving the vehicle. This research mainly focuses on giving indication of alerts to the driver about the surrounding vehicle movements while “changing the lane” and also helps to navigate the driver in correct way for travelling. The effect of a high-speed motorcyclist without wearing a helmet is highly dangerous and can lead to a fatality. Wearing a helmet can reduce damage and save a life. This project is specifically designed to improve the safety of motorcycle riders. Motorcyclists will be alerted if their speed limits are crossed and vehicles that enter the vehicle nearby hit. The helmet system emerging message using cloud-based service will send message to receiving contents in which the database has been stored. There are many countries enforcing a regulations requiring that the motorcycle driver wears a helmet while riding on his motorcycle. Most accidents are caused by reckless driving, drunk or mobile phone use, while traffic laws and rules are violated. Many People lose their lives due to late notification of accident due to that the people are not able to monitor the accident area's precise GPS coordinates. The significant reason that people get injured in head due to not wearing helmet while driving the bike. For the tracking of the rider's head and the acceleration of motorcycle, a Force Sensing resistor (FSR) are used. The motorcycle engine will only be started when the driver buckled the helmet. A LED will flash in helmet while some obstacles or a critical risk. Thus this research helps the researches for implementing and adopting the helmets in various aspects of security and protection of humans in future studies.}

This paper analyses the possibilities of replacing the natural gas boiler with district heating. Two systems were modelled using EnergyPRO software and compared to the reference system of the local boiler and heating network: connection to an existing high-temperature district heating network and a low-temperature energy cascade. All the three systems were modelled with two different energy price scenarios. The results were analysed from the perspective of the university campus and the entire city’s system. The low-temperature energy cascade connection to the city’s network will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 955 tonnes CO2. The conventional high-temperature connection would reduce the emission by 765 tons CO2. District heating connection will also lead to primary energy savings supporting the university’s efforts towards achieving its sustainable development goals. The low-temperature energy cascade utilising the return water of the city’s district heating network reduces the heat losses and increases the efficiency of heat and electricity production when compared to the systems with separate campus heating or the conventional high-temperature district heating.}

These events leads to damage to distribution grid equipments, and they are cause widespread blackouts. This paper presents short-term resilience enhancement of the residential sections against hurricane at day-ahead. The lines outage in the electrical distribution grid is implemented as stochastic modeling by hurricane. The resilience enhancement is done in the multiple energy systems such as integrated gas, heat and electrical. The three-stage multi-objective functions optimization is proposed for resilience-oriented enhancement. The proposed strategy for resilience-oriented enhancement including installation of the mobile generators (MGs), implementation of the demand side management (DSM) strategy and local generation (LG) in each stage. In first stage optimization, minimizing the installation costs of the MGs is modeled subject to lines outage. The DSM strategy is modeled in second stage optimization as minimization of the electrical demand deviation than optimal demand level at day-ahead. Then, minimization of the 1) operation cost and 2) loss of power supply probability (LPSP) index are considered in third stage optimization. In addition to, installation of the MGs and DSM in first and second stages; LG by electrical storage systems (ESSs) in third stage optimization is taken into accounted. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is confirmed on the IEEE 33-bus distribution grid as three case studies by numerical simulation. The obtained results for operation cost and LPSP index in first case are $1,098,833.4 and 0.11 kW, respectively. In second case, LPSP index is minimized by %52.2 than first case. Finally, operation cost and LPSP in third case and with participation of the ESS are reduced by %52.2 and %0.78 in comparison to second case, respectively.}

In disasters, most people are reluctant to rely on unfamiliar technologies. Thus, for these devices to become truly useful in disasters, it is important to understand factors that affect their acceptance by the public. Previous studies show that perceived usefulness is a clear antecedent of people’s acceptance of smart wearable devices. However, the underlying factors that affect perceived usefulness itself are not clearly known. Thus, the aim of this study is to fill this gap, and by doing so, to derive some practical implications for solution developers and governments. This study used structural equation modelling to analyse survey data collected from 647 respondents in Japan. We found that the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications of smart wearable devices was a strong predictor of their perceived usefulness of using these devices for disaster applications. Although indirect factors such as the ownership of ICT gadgets and the usage of social media also had some influences, most of their effects were mediated through increasing the respondents’ perceived usefulness of the current applications. In other words, through appreciating the functions of the current applications of smart wearable devices, people can visualise the usefulness of these devices in disaster situations. That being said, we found that in parallel, people also had concerns on the privacy issues of these devices. These findings shed light on the promotion and development of this fast growing technology for disaster applications.}

abstract = {Background
In the context of city operations and management, smart generally implies“…turning to technology to better connect our communities, improving citizen services”, and, more importantly, finding more intelligent ways to manage city resources and assets. It is a common notion that a city transportation system is a critical asset that must be intelligently managed to enable a better quality of life. It is less clear, however, that a city transportation system is in fact a public health tool and enabler. A transportation system, though, is not just the physical system it is; it is the integration of several activities some of which involve physical assets while other involve policies, standards and norms, that take place over long time span and involve significant resources including technology. Catering for public health should be an integral part of the smart city movement and thinking.
Methods
The paper first examines the different activities involved in putting together a transportation system, namely: Planning, Design, construction, Operations (management), Maintenance, and, in some cases, Decommissioning (henceforth PDCOMD), and then maps those activities to known public health outcomes. The paper notes that certain activities of the transport system development process are more suited to serve public health than others. For one, transportation system planning is fundamental to ensuring suitable integration of public health in the early stages of putting the transport system together. The operations activity is equally critical but historically—and to this day-- seldom viewed or used as the public health tool it is.
Results
This paper shows that “smart” as in integration of information and communication technology to improve efficiency of the transportation system may or may not serve public health; public health considerations in some cases require the calming/slowing down and spatial shifting-- thus the appearance of inefficiency-- of certain elements of the transportation system. Alternatively, the notion of efficiency as applied to transportation systems may need to be modified to explicitly incorporate aspects of public health.
Conclusions
The now trendy notion that information sensing, connectivity, and computation form the backbone of smart cities is questioned. The paper presents an alternate framework where public health is made integral to the notion of smart cities through explicit consideration and integration in key transportation system activities. Adopting an encompassing definition of “health” and “healthy” is vital. Among the many transport system activities, the paper identifies two, planning and operating, where public health consideration is particularly consequential.}

Traditional studies have investigated effects of urban appearance but have ignored the perception of place, which depends on people's unique social experiences. We distinguish “house” and “home” and propose an integrated model to test the prediction effect of combining conventional perception and social perception variables on house price appreciation. We establish a dataset that includes factors, e.g., housing structures, visual quality, and human physical perception. Then, we use machine learning models to extract features from multisource data, investigate the price appreciation of 1,032 houses in Wuhan from 2015 to 2020 and use multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) to discuss spatial dependence. Finally, we perform a cluster analysis to understand the combined effects. The results show that human physical perception has the highest effect, the visual quality of urban streets has the highest impact in places where highly educated people gather, and the impact of service facilities is greatest in economically underdeveloped areas. Our findings provide novel insights into the interlinkages between human social sensing and appreciation rates, which can be efficiently applied to build sustainable smart cities.}

As water is one of the basic needs of human survival, it is required to incorporate some mechanism to monitor water quality time to time. Around 40% of deaths are caused due to contaminated water in the world. Hence, there is a necessity to ensure supply of purified drinking water for the people both in cities and villages. Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) is a cost-effective and efficient system designed to monitor drinking water quality which makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In this paper, the proposed system consists of several sensors to measure various parameters such as pH value, the turbidity in the water, level of water in the tank, temperature and humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. And also, the Microcontroller Unit (MCU) interfaced with these sensors and further processing is performed at Personal Computer (PC).

However, the small dimensions of miniature sensors present some challenges, including power supply, active sensing materials, and material flexibility. In this article, we review microbatteries to power miniature sensors. We discuss materials and architectures for microbatteries and their fabrication methods. We also discuss energy harvesting materials for self-powered miniature sensors. We review in detail advanced materials for active sensing, including organic, inorganic, and composite materials with emphasis on wearable/implantable sensors targeted at humans and animals. In addition, flexible electronics as well as substrates and encapsulation materials and their integration are reviewed.

abstract = {In a typical smart grid, a large number of smart meters are deployed at energy consumers’ premises, which can report real-time usage data to the control center of the energy producer. Although such a communication model can help to improve the efficiency and reliability of electricity delivery, which is crucial to our society, it also leads to several security issues: (1) attackers may violate the privacy of energy consumers, and (2) attackers may tamper with the transmitted data for their own benefits or purposes. To deal with these security issues, many researchers have proposed different schemes for privacy preservation or abnormal data detection. However, existing studies usually address them separately. In this paper, we jointly resolve these two major security issues in the smart grid. Specifically, we propose a privacy-aware data dissemination scheme for smart grid with abnormal data traceability (PDDS), based on bilinear group theory and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. In our scheme, we design a novel link function that can verify whether there are different signatures that are signed by the same consumer, which effectively reduces the time and communication overhead for tracing. To evaluate the correctness and performance of the proposed scheme, we first develop a solid security analysis, which shows that the proposed scheme can efficiently preserve identity confidentiality and data integrity. We then conduct extensive simulation experiments, which further demonstrate that our scheme can significantly reduce communication costs.}

Furthermore, if water vapor is present in a processing unit, it can affect the final product, possibly causing changes in its material, biological, and physical properties. Measurement of humidity in the industry is challenging due to its high cost and fewer safety aspects, and thus humidity measurement is a significant research area. There are several humidity sensors available based on materials like ceramic, metals, polymers, and 2D materials. However, sensors based on these materials are very costly, have high recovery and response times, involve complex fabrication processes, and also are not environmentally friendly. On the other hand, humidity sensors fabricated from nanomaterials are very affordable, highly accurate, have high surface area, have long-lasting properties and nontoxic properties, as well as an easy manufacturing procedure. To increase the production rate in industry as well as accuracy and precision, smart manufacturing is needed. It is a manufacturing concept based on fully automatic machinery that reduces the human effort in industry and enables better controlled production. In this process the role of humidity sensors is vital, as humidity is a critical factor that needs to be measured in many applications related to smart manufacturing. This chapter reviews different types of humidity nanosensors, describing the state of the art, how they are used in smart manufacturing, fabrication methods, and important applications.}

abstract = {Activity recognition in smart homes enables the remote monitoring of elderly and patients. In healthcare systems, reliability of a recognition model is of high importance. Limited amount of training data and imbalanced number of activity instances result in over-fitting thus making recognition models inconsistent. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition approach that integrates the distance minimization (DM) and probability estimation (PE) approaches to improve the reliability of recognitions. DM uses distances of instances from the mean representation of each activity class for label assignment. DM is useful in avoiding decision biasing towards the activity class with majority instances; however, DM can result in over-fitting. PE on the other hand has good generalization abilities. PE measures the probability of correct assignments from the obtained distances, while it requires a large amount of data for training. We apply data oversampling to improve the representation of classes with less number of instances. Support vector machine (SVM) is applied to combine the outputs of both DM and PE, since SVM performs better with imbalanced data and further improves the generalization ability of the approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using five publicly available smart home datasets. The results demonstrate better performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art activity recognition approaches.}

The front-end system is used to develop an application that assists drivers in parking their cars. The main goal of this study is to solve the problem that the drivers spend a substantial amount of time in finding suitable parking slots in busy city streets. However, the extended problems, including traffic congestion, additional vehicle emissions, and illegal parking, can also be simultaneously solved. Meanwhile, the architecture of the proposed system can reduce the installation and maintenance costs compared with the existing schemes. The architecture of the intelligent parking system includes four stages: (i) the system utilizes sensors to capture the pictures of on-street parking and send them back to the database server in a short period; (ii) the proposed method uses an objection detection algorithm (i.e., region-based convolutional neural network) to identify whether the on-street parking slots are available or not and count the number of available parking slots; (iii) a smart parking application is developed for the driver to obtain the real-time parking information by using any possible mobile devices; (iv) two mathematical models corresponding to two situations are proposed for the recommendation of the best parking slots. The proposed system is also an important basis in a smart city. The numerical experiments confirm that the proposed algorithms embedded in the system are also efficient and effective compared with the current commercial solvers.}

These advancements are expected to greatly enhance efficiency and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources, as well as distributed intelligence and demand response (DR) programs. As various national and international organizations have started to draw PLC regulations, standards and technologies for countries, these standards intend to determine important criteria such as bandwidth, modulation types, channel coding schemes, operating frequency and electromagnetic capability limits from fixed indoor/outdoor applications to smart grid (SG) applications. Depending on the worldwide PLC regulation, standardization and technological developments, security schemes built around them can become interoperable from a standard point of view, but still have incompatible configurations or different maturity levels, or include non-standardized PLC functions. Moreover, the PLC based systems/solutions for renewable energy integration, are also surveyed in terms of distributed-power system (DPS) and distributed energy resources (DERs) units monitoring/controlling and management purposes. Thus, a particular section is dedicated to PLC based systems/solutions utilization of renewable energy sources (RESs) in SG covering all aspects of a monotype and hybrid energy plants. Finally, the survey is carried on by reviewing the most recent and comprehensive articles to highlight the importance of PLC in a logical way in the smart grid for readers.}

The climatological station and the ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation interact with the environmental system through a website, allowing the real time interconnection, acquisition and monitoring of information through mobile phone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. The system is self-sustaining through the use of solar panels. The ANN could be used to optimally predict the inside temperature of greenhouses and a Fuzzy Expert System (FES) controls the activation of a water pump. The ANN input variables involve the relative humidity, temperature of outside air, solar radiation, wind speed and inside air relative humidity. The fuzzy control and ANN allows the prediction of the internal temperature of the greenhouse and the cropland temperature, which are used to activate the anti-frost water distribution system. The ANN models give a temperature prediction through the coefficient of determination of variance analysis (ANOVA) method. The R2 values for temperature in summer season were 90.23, and 91.30; and for the winter season were 94.28, and 95.22, respectively. The fuzzy associative memory (FAM) controls the activation of the anti-frost irrigation system with five outputs for controlling the climatological frost presence: No-frost (NF), Possible-frost (PF), Mild-frost (MF), Severe-frost (SF) and Hard-frost (HF).}

abstract = {Electric vehicles are becoming an indispensable part of modern cities and power grids through their versatile and fast-response charge and discharge characteristics. Currently, smart parking lots in residential areas mainly provide slow-charging services and possibly participate in demand response programs. However, the fast emerging of EV fast-charge has brought the necessity to provide new installations and planning frameworks to cater a high level of energy within a small non-shiftable time fraction for this type of power demand. Also, due to its random nature and high power demand, fast charge may inflict heavy fluctuations to the grid. In this paper, the EV aggregator’s task in a parking lot is modeled to also incorporate fast-charge services. Through using the aggregate capacity of slow-charged EVs in the parking lot as a sourcing–sinking resource, the fast-charge demand fluctuations are guaranteed to be safely absorbed. Besides, the flexibility of slow-charged EVs is also used to perform the newly-restructured regulation services which credits the participants not only based on the offered capacities but also on their real-time regulation performance. A real-time stochastic approach is introduced to take care of the aggregator’s extensive planning for both slow and fast-charging EVs besides procuring dynamic regulation to the grid. This approach significantly lowers charging costs for aggregators in exchange for sophisticated scheduling task to use the available resources more efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed method in handling the energy and regulation management is demonstrated through several case studies.}

However, another aspect that deserves attention is the motivation for households to use the feed-back to save energy. This paper explores how the emerging trend of using complementary currencies for sustainability policies could translate into new interventions adapted to the smart meter deployment and capable of promoting more autonomous forms of motivation compared to interventions using official currencies. Three systems designs (rewarding, regulatory and hybrid) are presented and discussed within the framework of self-determination theory. Because the rewarding system S1 can contribute positively people's basic needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, it could lead to more autonomous forms of motivation. The conclusions regarding the regulatory system S2 are less clear, although the hybrid variant S3 that integrates mechanisms from the rewarding system into the regulatory system could be perceived as more consonant with people's basic need for autonomy.}

abstract = {As the urban populations increase, we must think more deeply about how to make cities less stressful and more creative for people to live in. Liveability and quality of life are key factors while designing and managing energy, water, pollution, and waste systems which are sustainable for the long term. The rapidly developing digital technologies can help to enable these aims to be achieved. Innovative approaches are proposed with recommendations for achieving these goals cities grow and change, digital technologies will be at the heart of improvement. This paper considers how observed trends will have implications on the digital cities of the future and how digital technologies will empower citizens and enable their cities to become intelligent, liveable, and sustainable.}
