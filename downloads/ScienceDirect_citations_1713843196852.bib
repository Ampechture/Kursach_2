abstract = {Despite the ongoing discussion of the recent years, there is no agreed definition of a ‘smart city’, while strategic planning in this field is still largely unexplored. Inspired by this, the purpose of this paper was to identify the forces shaping the smart city conception and, by doing so, to begin replacing the currently abstract image of what it means to be one. The paper commences by dividing the recent history of smart cities into two large sections – urban futures and the knowledge and innovation economy. The urban futures strand shows that technology has always played an important role in forward-looking visions about the city of the future. The knowledge and innovation economy strand shows that recent technological advancements have introduced a whole new level of knowledge management and innovation capabilities in the urban context. The paper proceeds to explicate the current technology push and demand pull for smart city solutions. On one hand, technology advances rapidly and creates a booming market of smart city products and solutions around it. On the other hand, there is demand on the side of cities that seek to address the problems of efficiency and sustainability, making the ground fertile for a smart city product economy. The research route of this paper eventually allows the identification of the underlying – and often forgotten – principles of what it means to be ‘smart’ in an urban context and yields conclusions about strategic planning for the development of smart cities today.}

Smart cities contribute to social stability and economic prosperity by encouraging and enabling corporations to invest their resources and expertise in the cities, and by providing more prosperity and contentment for their citizens. Smart city services provide citizens with an improved living environment and increase their overall quality of life. Since the citizens are the users of the services, it is vitally important that their ideas and perspectives are taken into account during the planning and management of such services. This study surveyed citizens in Taiwanese cities that had all participated in the Intelligent Community Forum smart city campaigns at least once. The findings reveal that citizens are willing to accept and use ICT-based smart city services if the services are designed with innovative concepts that secure their privacy and offer a high quality of services. The more they use the services, the higher the quality of life achieved. The only factor that does not influence citizens' acceptance and usage of ICT-based smart city services is their city engagement. The study contributes to the academic literature and also provides practical pointers for cities and technology suppliers embarking on smart city initiatives.}

abstract = {Favourable renewable energy policies led to a higher proportion of renewable energy in the country’s entire energy generation. However, these regulatory affairs caused the lower capacity utilisation factor of thermal power stations. It is not prudent to burden the thermal stations by enforcing ramp rates during peak hours as this would cause serious operational issues. Hence, further renewable additions must be supported by battery-energy storage systems (BESS) to meet the grid ramping requirements. BESS being quite expensive and require heavy maintenance, municipal solid waste-based waste-to-energy (WtE) plants play a crucial role in enhancing grid reliability under a high renewable energy (RE) environment. In this paper, the potential of four renewable energy technologies, such as floating solar, bifacial rooftop, wind energy conversion system, and WtE plant, are evaluated for a smart city, Visakhapatnam, India. This paper identifies a total of 439 MW of RE potential in the selected location. Mutation-enabled adaptive local attractor-based quantum behaved particle swarm optimisation (ALA-QPSO), supported by the combination of BESS and WtE plant, and is applied to obtain the optimal configuration of photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy conversion system (WECS) by minimising the techno-economic objectives of a municipal body. The results are compared with four variants of differential evolution. The results show that for an optimal set of BESS and hybrid renewable energy sources (HRES), the grid can offer better reliability with the presence of the WtE plant. The obtained optimal configuration results in a levelized cost of US $ 0.0539, high reliability with a loss of power supply probability of 0.049%, and reduced battery degradation with minimal life cycle loss of 0.048. The municipality requires a total investment of US $ 40.5 M, a significant part of which can be met by acting as a renewable energy service company between the rooftop owners and the distribution companies.}

Smart cities are composed of complex systems that usually process and analyse big data from the Cyber, Physical, and Social worlds. Traffic event detection is an important and complex task in smart transportation modelling and management. We address this problem using semi-supervised deep learning with data of different modalities, e.g., physical sensor observations and social media data. Unlike most existing studies focusing on data of single modality, the proposed method makes use of data of multiple modalities that appear to complement and reinforce each other. Meanwhile, as the amount of labelled data in big data applications is usually extremely limited, we extend the multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network model to a semi-supervised architecture to characterise traffic events. We evaluate the model with a large, real-world dataset consisting of traffic sensor observations and social media data collected from the San Francisco Bay Area over a period of four months. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in extracting and classifying traffic events.}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, known as drones, are components used in various civilian applications, such as agriculture, package delivery, and surveillance. To enhance drone’s flying safety and quality of service, a promising idea is to construct the Internet-of-Drones, where the drones are employed to collect the information, and citizens communicate with the drones of a particular flying zone via their mobile devices to obtain the data in real-time. However, due to the high sensitivity of the information, and the openness of communication media, privacy and security issues should be addressed. Specifically, an efficient and secure authentication scheme is needed to enable users and drones to authenticate each other and share a session key. Due to the drone’s limited resources and energy, the authentication scheme should be efficient regarding the computation overhead while providing high security. In this article, we devise a secure authentication scheme based on elliptic curve for drones to secure smart city surveillance. We demonstrate that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model, supporting the security requirements and resisting known attacks while incurring low computation and communication costs.}

In this regard, the objective of this work was to identify which factors influence the acceptance of IT in public safety in the context of smart city. For this purpose, the qualitative approach was used, through semi-structured interviews with representatives of the Military Police and the Civil Police in Pato Branco-PR, in order to investigate thoroughly the constructs of the UTAUT model, proposed by Venkatesh et al. (2003). The main system cited by the authorities was the monitoring by cameras, called Safe Look Program. The results show that in the performance expectation, the monitoring system has quality images, which help in the people’s identification. Concerning the effort expectation, the ideal would be the integration with the particular systems. Regarding the social influence, both police use social networks, by directing the sector, to publicize the work and make investigations. In relation to the facilitating conditions, there are difficulties with the functionalities of the monitoring software. With regard to smart cities, there are indications that the services are still in the process of being adjusted and they can be optimized. Furthermore, the participation of the citizen and the municipal administration is important in order to implement more services.}

An outstanding problem concerns the social and organisational aspects of smart cities security resulting from competing interests of different parties, high levels of interdependence, and social and political complexity. Our review shows that current standards and guidelines have not clearly defined roles and responsibilities of different parties. A common understanding of key security requirements is not shared between different parties. This research assessed the smart cities and their cyber security measures, with a particular focus on technical standards and the regulatory framework. It comprehensively reviewed 93 security standards and guidance. It then performed a comparative case study of Barcelona, Singapore and London smart cities on their governance models, security measures, technical standards and third party management.

abstract = {Smart City (SC) strategies that aim at fostering sustainable urban development through the systemic implementation of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to appeal to national and municipal governments despite of increasingly skeptical academic debates. Especially in Asian emerging economies aspirations to create SCs are widespread, yet seem hopelessly illusionary in many cases and might actually harm rather than benefit most citizens. This paper acknowledges these critical views, yet also accentuates constructive perspectives on SC achievements that offer rays of hope especially for cities in less developed countries. We propose to emphasize influential process qualities of SC strategies, which can instigate broader governance and institutional transformations locally, rather than mainly looking at the technical product features of final SC settings. Refined conceptual distinctions between the product and process view on achievable outcomes of SC schemes are suggested which also borrow from evolutionary geography perspectives. To illustrate our propositions, the example of India’s Smart Cities Mission launched in 2015 is used. While the planned refurbishment of urban spaces in India is rightfully criticized by some, our own qualitative empirical research – a multiple case study analysis of five SC schemes in South India in spring 2018 – reveals several promising process qualities besides implementation deficiencies. Our study finds eight mechanisms of detrimental path dependency that obstruct SC progress, but also eight mechanisms of positive evolutionary change with respect to urban governance procedures. Making agents in emerging economies aware of these potential outcomes that reach beyond a mere urban technology focus can inspire more effective forthcoming SC strategies and policies.}

However, in-depth research on the development of smart cities from a managerial and KM perspective has remained scant. In detail, although universities are deemed to be responsible for the competitiveness and superiority of knowledge-based ecosystems, like smart city projects, the different roles they play in such projects when dealing with KM governance and processes issues are still understudied. Therefore, by conducting an exploratory case study of 20 smart city projects, this paper aims to scrutinize how universities manage the KM governance issue when internal knowledge is used, the KM governance issue when external knowledge is used, the KM processes issue when internal knowledge is used, and the KM processes issue when external knowledge is used.

abstract = {The number of vehicles travelling on the road has increased tremendously over the past few decades throughout the globe. The advent of Intelligent Transport System (ITS) enabled the vehicles to be managed intelligently. However, the ITS network can be intruded by malicious users to access the sensitive information. So a strong Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to safeguard the ITS network. Due to the huge volume of data generated by the sensors in the vehicles in ITS, there is a dire need to extract the most important features from the ITS data for classification phase in IDS. Even though, many researchers have worked on building an IDS system in ITS, not much work is done on addressing the aforementioned issue. To address this problem, we have utilized the Moth–Flame Optimization (MFO) in this work. In the proposed work, a MFO based ensemble machine learning model is proposed to classify the IDS dataset in ITS. Firstly the IDS dataset is normalized using the standard-scaler method. Then optimal features from the IDS dataset are chosen by MFO. These optimal features are trained by an ensemble classifier comprising of linear regression, random forest and XGBoost classification algorithms for intelligent decision making. The performance of the proposed model is compared against several state of the art meta-heuristic algorithms based on ensemble models which achieved a superior accuracy and recall of 100%, and precision of 99.5% on shellcode attacks.}

With the lack of human resources, authorities are moving towards the use of smart and auto-traffic control systems to manage an increasing volume of traffic. Mostly, these systems monitor traffic using street cameras and identify illegal traffic behaviors, such as signal violations. However, it is not feasible to employ humans or static cameras everywhere in the city in order to cover all the urban roads. These days, modern automobiles come with cameras to store videos as a black-box in case of an accident. In this paper, we exploited the use of vehicular cameras and proposed a smart traffic control model to report any traffic violation on the road. To this end, the vehicle's camera monitors all front cars on the road and transmits videos to the car's attached fog device. The fog device analyses the captured video for unlawful behavior and reports to traffic authorities in case of any violation. Initially, front vehicles are recognized using Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), whereas road lanes are marked using Hough transform. Later, the violations are identified using the violation-detection algorithm. As a use case, the algorithm is designed for the fog device to identify driving violations, including wrong U-turn and driving on a central divider line or a yellow line. The role of the fog device is implemented on a GTX750-Ti GPU-based machine. Finally, the system's performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and efficiency.}

Modern day cities are deprived of vital elements like quality of life and socio-economic development which can be delivered by the smart cities. Smart cities are an endeavour to make cities more efficient, sustainable and liveable. In other words, a smart city is a city that can monitor and integrate functionality of all the critical infrastructure like roads, tunnels, airways, waterways, railways, communication power supply, etc., control maintenance activities and can help in optimizing the resources while keeping an eye on the security issues as well. This research paper explores various aspects and dimensions of a smart city. To bridge the gap in literature regarding the concept of smart cities and its implementation, a framework has been developed to get better insights about the idea of smart city. On the basis of extensive and deep research of literature from diverse domains, we have identified six significant pillars for developing the framework as: Social, Management, Economic, Legal, Technology and Sustainability (SMELTS). The paper throws light upon how these factors can make the smart city initiative a successful project. The proposed framework has been used to figure out various agendas for research and traces its practical implications.}

abstract = {Local urban identity, culture and knowledge ecosystems continue to shape innovative capacity and technological acceptance despite global exchange in talent, trade and technology. This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.}

abstract = {In Smart Cities (SC), the efficient management of services such as health, transport, public safety, and especially the electricity ensures the welfare of citizens. In recent years, the insertion of renewable sources (RSs) (e.g., solar and wind) in the power grid (PG) of SCs has contributed to meeting the electricity needs of the various consumer units. However, the large-scale integration of these RSs can fatigue the assets, leading to their premature aging and, consequently, compromising the quality of electricity supply. To overcome these challenges, the implementation of Neighboring Energy Storage Communities (NESCs) employing demand response (DR) strategies along with efficient coordination of storage batteries (SBs) could be a promising alternative. In this sense, the present work proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to efficiently manage SBs and the set of household appliances, including charging electric vehicles (EVs), in an NESC provided solely by PG. The proposed model aims to minimize: the total costs related to energy consumption, the peak rebound effect on the total consumption profile, energy wastage through load factor (LF) improvement, and the deep discharges in the SBs during their daily operational cycle. Operational constraints related to the home appliances, such as average usage time, the number of times that the appliance is used daily, etc., are taking into account. The EV state-of-charge (SOC), EV charging rate limits, and initial and final SOC of the SBs, are also considered. A Monte Carlo Algorithm (MCA) is used to simulate the habitual consumption patterns of each customer. The proposed model was implemented in AMPL and solved using CPLEX. The performance of this proposed model is evaluated considering two NESCs differentiated by the number of consumer communities. A first NESC (small-scale) is analyzed considering only two consumer communities. In this NESC, two case studies (Case 1 and 2) are discussed. Next, the second NESC (large-scale) that considers 14 consumer communities is analyzed for the most complete case study (Case 2). Within each NESC, consumer communities are differentiated by the household income and the types of SBs (individual and shared) that support each community. The results corroborate the applicability of the MILP model to real case studies on a diverse scale, guaranteeing the efficient use of PG at the same time that each SB seeks the most optimized operation.}

With tools for self-learning and personalized learning, the skill gaps can be manageably handled. The Technology Firms can effectively partner and provide the newer technology tools, which can be very effectively used for training, skilling, reskilling, and upskilling. With Natural Language Processes (NLP) facilities becoming better, these companies can also provide support in training in local languages. This chapter attempts to first bring in need for training by collating some of the new skilling requirements of Smart Cities. It then gets in detail of new methodologies that can be used for skilling and how some of the technology companies can partner in handling this. Even at early stage of conceptualization of “Smart Cities,” some of the technology companies helped in creating “Model Conceptual Smart Cities,” which were then expanded to include the “Smart City” implementations of today. The chapter also brings in some new thoughts to encourage the companies to spend and partner for reskilling in Public–Private Partnership (PPP) mode, to ensure continuity in this activity. The chapter also suggests the possibility of creating a “Resource Pool” for a city for getting a better return on investment required for creating this Smarter Workforce. It also goes into some suggestions on how this smarter workforce can lead to “Community Led Innovation” environment.}

The separated solid wastes are subjected to landfill and a review on landfill leachate management practice is presented in this paper. Then an enhanced Sequential Leach Bed–HUASB Reactor design is proposed for leachate treatment. The fabricated pilot scale model was functioning in the mesophilic state with pretreated solid waste as feed for ten different organic loading. The routine and real time monitoring of process control is based on plasma that depends on remote and onsite control. The materialization of devices is based on the Internet of Things (IoT) cloud, which is observed to be the emerging trend. By captivating the field data the devices are related to the process of mathematical calculation that plays significant role in transforming to the objects and are used to scrutinize turbidity, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen and COD using sensors, thereby managing the leachate for making Sustainable smart city development.}

The bandwidth demand for 5G, smart city, and IoT applications are fulfilled with wireless optical communications. Particularly, radio over free space optical (RoFSO) communication establishes a very attractive choice for interconnecting central base stations with remote antenna units. In this paper, we consider the transmission of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio signals with quadrature amplitude (QAM) modulation format through a free space optical link using spatial diversity mitigation technique. The atmosphere is modeled as the combined channel model which takes into account atmospheric attenuation, turbulence, and pointing errors. The atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors are modeled by Malaga, Beckmann, and Rayleigh distributions. The novel closed form BER expressions are derived for the proposed QAM OFDM RoFSO link with spatial diversity. The results are analyzed and plotted for different weather conditions (clear, haze, light fog), turbulence regimes (weak, moderate, strong), misalignment (weak, enhanced), the order of QAM and number of transceivers. The proposed RoFSO system is highly useful for 5G in smart city applications.}

abstract = {Accurate predictions of stock markets are important for investors and other stakeholders of the equity markets to formulate profitable investment strategies. The improved accuracy of a prediction model even with a slight margin can translate into considerable monetary returns. However, the stock markets' prediction is regarded as an intricate research problem for the noise, complexity and volatility of the stocks' data. In recent years, the deep learning models have been successful in providing robust forecasts for sequential data. We propose a novel deep learning-based hybrid classification model by combining peephole LSTM with temporal attention layer (TAL) to accurately predict the direction of stock markets. The daily data of four world indices including those of U.S., U.K., China and India, from 2005 to 2022, are examined. We present a comprehensive evaluation with preliminary data analysis, feature extraction and hyperparameters' optimization for the problem of stock market prediction. TAL is introduced post peephole LSTM to select the relevant information with respect to time and enhance the performance of the proposed model. The prediction performance of the proposed model is compared with that of the benchmark models CNN, LSTM, SVM and RF using evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, PR-AUC and MCC. The experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed model achieving better scores than the benchmark models for most evaluation metrics and for all datasets. The accuracy of the proposed model is 96% and 88% for U.K. and Chinese stock markets respectively and it is 85% for both U.S. and Indian markets. Hence, the stock markets of U.K. and China are found to be more predictable than those of U.S. and India. Significant findings of our work include that the attention layer enables peephole LSTM to better identify the long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in the stock markets' data. Profitable and timely trading strategies can be formulated based on our proposed prediction model.}

The reason is that it is the foundation of modern traffic management and traffic control. Most of the existing advanced traffic speed prediction models are Spatial-Temporal hybrid models. They improve the predicting accuracy by leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract spatial and temporal features from the traffic speed data, respectively. However, these models have complex structures and high computational costs. To improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce the cost of model training, we propose a hybrid model, Spatial-Temporal Gated Graph Attention network (ST-GGAN), based on Graph Attention mechanism (GAT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Such a method has a simpler structure, lower computational costs, and higher predicting accuracy. The experimental results show that our model's performance is better than the existing advanced models on a real-world dataset.}

Internet of Thing (IoT) is a rapidly evolving technology for sustainable and improved smart cities infrastructure that is revealing its manifestations to facilitate mankind. Numerous privileges and easily adaptable nature of the IoT applications makes it a core component of smart cities. IoT is also implemented in the industrial sector referred to as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) where various diverse services related to operation technologies, manufacturing, utilities, machines monitoring have been applied to connected devices. This phenomenon also makes it susceptible to a variety of crucial security concerns that need to be addressed. IPV6 based Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is an ideal choice to ensures effective data communication in resource constraint IIoT environments. By using basic concepts of genetic programming, this paper proposes a novel and secure framework to detect the presence of security threats in RPL based IoT and IIoT networks. The proposed framework possesses the capability to detect HELLO-Flood attack, Version number attack, Sinkhole attack, and Black hole attack. The performance of proposed framework is evaluated at various performance parameters including attack detection accuracy, true positive rate, false-positive rate, throughput, and end-to-end delay. Favorable results appear to support the proposed framework and makes it a best choice for RPL based IIoT environments.}

abstract = {Primary user (PU) signal detection or classification is a critical component of cognitive radio (CR) related wireless communication applications. In CR, the PU detection methods are mostly based on statistical models, and their detection performance heavily relies on the accuracy of assumed models. In this paper, we design a novel detector, dubbed as PU-Net, that dynamically learns the PU activity patterns in a cognitive 5G smart city, where a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deployed as flying base stations to serve the Internet-of-Things (IoT) users. Unlike the traditional schemes, the PU-Net is free from signal-noise model assumptions and is leveraged through deep residual learning integrated with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to sense the PU's transmitted signal patterns in the network. The PU-Net detects and classifies the active and idle PU states by exploiting the multilevel spatial-temporal features in the signal and noise frames. The proposed model is trained using locally synthesized Rayleigh channel-impaired data with large variability of modulated signals and different noise floor regimes. Additionally, the PU-Net model is blind-tested and evaluated on real-world over-the-air signals and with variable-length frames and varying channel effects at secondary users (SUs). With extensive experiments, it is shown that PU-Net outperforms other benchmark detectors, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9974, with 0.9978 recall and 0.9970 precision in detecting and classifying the PU transmitted signal patterns. Correspondingly, the proposed PU-Net can be adopted for IoT/UAV-assisted communication systems in optimizing spectrum efficiency and resolving the coexistence issues in 5G and beyond networks.}

Wireless sensor network (WSN) as a key enabling technology in IoT offers the potential for cities to get smarter. WSNs gained tremendous attention during the recent years because of their rising number of applications that enables remote monitoring and tracking in smart cities. One of the most exciting applications of WSNs in smart cities is detection, monitoring, and tracking which is referred to as object tracking sensor networks (OTSN). The adaptation of OTSN into urban cities brought new exciting challenges for reaching the goal of future smart cities. Such challenges focus primarily on problems related to active monitoring and tracking in smart cities. In this paper, we present the essential characteristics of OTSN, monitoring and tracking application used with the content of smart city. Moreover, we discussed the taxonomy of OTSN along with analysis and comparison. Furthermore, research challenges are investigated concerning energy reservation, object detection, object speed, accuracy in tracking, sensor node collaboration, data aggregation and object recovery position estimation. This review can serve as a benchmark for researchers for future development of smart cities in the context of OTSN. Lastly, we provide future research direction.}

abstract = {The ‘smart city’ is an oft-cited techno-urban imaginary promoted by businesses and governments alike. It thinks big, and is chiefly imagined in terms of large-scale information communications systems that hinge on the collection of real-time and so-called ‘big data’. Less talked about are the human-scale implications and user-experience of the smart city. Much of the current academic scholarship on smart cities offers synoptic and technical perspectives, leaving the users of smart systems curiously unaccounted for. While they purport to empower citizens, smart cities initiatives are rarely focused at the citizen-scale, nor do they necessarily attend to the ways initiatives can be user-led or co-designed. Drawing on the outcomes of a university studio, this article rethinks the smart city as a series of urban scales—metropolis, community, individual, and personal—and proposes an analytical model for classifying smart city initiatives in terms of engagement. Informed by the theory of proxemics, the model proposed analyses smart city initiatives in terms of the scope of their features and audience size; the actors accountable for their deployment and maintenance; their spatial reach; and the ability of design solutions to re-shape and adapt to different urban scenarios and precincts. We argue that the significance of this model lies in its potential to facilitate modes of thinking across and between scales in ways that can gauge the levels of involvement in the design of digitally mediated urban environments, and productively re-situate citizens as central to the design of smart city initiatives.}

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most widespread threats to smart city infrastructure. In this paper, a smart city intrusion detection framework based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is proposed. RBMs are applied due to their ability to learn high-level features from raw data in an unsupervised way and handle real data representation generated from smart meters and sensors. On top of these extracted features, different classifiers are trained. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested and benchmarked using a dataset from a smart water distribution plant. The results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology in attack detection with high accuracy. In addition, the proposed methodology outperforms the classification model applied without features learning step.}

Smart parking with the help of sensors embedded in cars and city infrastructures can alleviate the deadlocks in parking problems and provide the best quality of services and profit to citizens. However, several design aspects should be well investigated and analyzed before implementing such solutions. In this paper, we classify the smart parking systems while considering soft and hard design factors. We overview the enabling technologies and sensors which have been commonly used in the literature. We emphasize the importance of data reliability, security, privacy and other critical design factors in such systems. Emerging parking trends in the ecosystem are investigated, while focusing on data interoperability and exchange. We also outline open research issues in the current state of smart parking systems and recommend a conceptual hybrid-parking model.}

Arguably, IoT is becoming the building block for next generation smart cities owing to its potential in exploiting sustainable information and communication technologies. The rapid development of the IoT is impacting several scientific and engineering application domains. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of key features and applications of the IoT paradigm to support sustainable development of smart cities. An emphasis is placed on concomitance of the IoT solutions with other enabling technologies such as cloud computing, robotics, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), wireless communications, and radio-frequency identification (RFID).

The unjustifiable use of these non-renewable resources can affect the stability between environmental and biological diversity which leads to greenhouse effect. This situation requires awareness and motivation to encourage people towards sustainable energy use and conservation in order to reduce global warming. For effective implementation, government initiatives require a systematic public participation to assess household’s level of energy self-sustainability and reward accordingly. On this regard, we introduce an IoT powered green architecture to assign an optimal green score to a household by assessing the households’ level of energy self-sustainability using a novel green score algorithm based green score meter. The green score algorithm will results high green score rating to a household with high renewable energy production than the non-renewable energy consumption with less air contamination. Based the household energy data, the green score meter computes the green score rating of a household using the green score algorithm and forward the score to the authorized third party like cloud server for green rank calculation and virtual display. Here, we present a tax exemption scheme which benefits the households with high green score rating. The existing frameworks (HEMS, iCHEMS, SHEMS) monitor and aware the user/household for efficient energy management, cost management but in contrast our proposed green architecture is an integrated platform for collective energy management to evaluate energy self-sustainability of the household, so as to give financial incentives. Thus, our proposed green score based tax exemption scheme will appreciate and urge the residents to burn-through less natural assets and forestall less contamination.}

Insights gained from that data are used to manage assets, resources and services efficiently; in return, that data is used to improve the operations across the city. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, buildings, and assets that is then processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, utilities, water supply networks, waste, crime detection [1], information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services [2,3]. The smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT) and various physical devices connected to the IoT (Internet of things) network to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens [4,5]. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving. ICT is used to enhance quality, performance, and interactivity of urban services, to reduce costs and resource consumption and to increase contact between citizens and government [6]. Smart city applications are developed to manage urban flows and allow for real-time responses [7]. A smart city may therefore be more prepared to respond to challenges than one with a simple “transactional” relationship with its citizens [8,9]. Yet, the term itself remains unclear to its specifics and therefore, opens to many interpretations [10].}

Smart cities include different smart systems such as smart homes, smart grids, etc. These smart systems should be connected together along with huge number of smart objects in the world largest network known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Trusted communication between an IoT object, which could be any device, and smart systems is an essential objective for the security over the IoT. This can be supported by authentication enforcers which, with the large number of connected objects in the IoT, should impose efficient and scalable mobile object authentication solutions. In this paper, a four-layer architecture for mobile object authentication in the context of IoT smart cities is proposed. This architecture is designed to address different IoT challenges such as scalability, mobility, and heterogeneity. Moreover, the architecture is supported by the applicability of a proposed hierarchical elliptic curve identity based signature authentication protocol. The proposed architecture and the proposed authentication protocol have been compared with other related works proposed in the literature. Various design goals of IoT in smart cities have been considered in the comparison along with the computation cost on both the sender and the receiver entities. Results show that the proposed architecture supports more design goals of IoT in smart city than its rival architectures and the proposed authentication protocol has lower computation cost than the other related protocols.}

As the project is still ongoing, the final results of the work are yet to be seen, but, nonetheless worth documenting. This article is composed as an early analysis of the air quality sensing project as a framework for the larger smart city story of Christchurch. It provides an overview of the experiences and lessons learned about the implementation of new technologies in a post-disaster environment. We examine how the narrative of the smart city is constructed, with focus on the terminology used by citizens, academicians, government and corporations. We then argue that top-down technocratic solutions to urban problems alone do not suffice to improve life in the city; rather, they can result in misaligned expectations or outcomes for stakeholders at the government and citizen level. We conclude by suggesting that citizen-led initiatives may be a way to promote more nuanced and inclusive ways of addressing local urban problems in a smart cities context.}

Nevertheless, a “common understanding” of what smart city is or could be missing and generates questions regarding whether a “smart utopia” - that is the outcome of the “wedding” of vendors and local governments - drives the above efforts and leaves out real community problems.

The analysis is based on a multi-method that combines literature evidence, official websites and reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding officials.

abstract = {In the recent years, important key factor for urban planning is to analyze the sustainability and its functionality towards smart cities. Presently, many researchers employ the conservative machine learning based analysis but those are not appropriate for IoT based health data analysis because of their physical feature extraction and low accuracy. In this paper, we propose remote health monitoring and data analysis by integrating IoT and deep learning concepts. We proposed novel IoT based FoG assisted cloud network architecture that accumulates real-time health care data from patients via several medical IoT sensor networks, these data are analyzed using a deep learning algorithm deployed at Fog based Healthcare Platform. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is applied to the sustainable smart cities to evaluate the process for real-time. The proposed framework not only analyses the healthcare data but also provides immediate relief measures to the patient facing critical conditions and needs immediate consultancy of doctor. Performance is measure in terms of accuracy, precision and sensitivity of the proposed DHNN with task scheduling algorithm and it is obtained 97.6%, 97.9%, and 94.9%. While accuracy, precision and sensitivity for deep CNN is 96.5%, 97.5% and 94% and for Deep auto-encoder is 92%, 91%, and 82.5%.}

The sustainability indicators for designing a smart city in a developing country has been identified. DEA:AR-CCR model is adopted to determine the relative efficiency of each of the sustainability indicators for a smart city in the context of input and output criteria. The decomposition efficiency measures clearly highlight which sustainability indicator the country needs to focus based on the importance of the input criteria to achieve the desired outputs.

Smart cities are based on autonomous and distributed infrastructure that includes intelligent information processing and control systems heterogeneous network infrastructure, and ubiquitous sensing involving millions of information sources Due to the continued growth of data volume and number of connected IoT devices, however, issues such as high latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, security and privacy, and scalability arise in the current smart city network architecture. Designing an efficient, secure, and scalable distributed architecture by bringing computational and storage resources closer to endpoints is needed to address the limitations of today’s smart city network. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid network architecture for the smart city by leveraging the strength of emerging Software Defined Networking and blockchain technologies. To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, our architecture is divided into two parts: core network and edge network. Through the design of a hybrid architecture, our proposed architecture inherits the strength of both centralized and distributed network architectures. We also propose a Proof-of-Work scheme in our model to ensure security and privacy. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of our proposed model, we simulate our model and evaluate it based on various performance metrics. The result of the evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed model.}

Due to the growing number of vehicles in these cities, urban traffic congestion is becoming more common. In addition, finding places to park even in car parks is not easy for drivers who run in circles. Studies have shown that drivers looking for parking spaces contribute up to 30% to traffic congestion. In this context, it is necessary to predict the spaces available to drivers in parking lots where they want to park. We propose in this paper a new system that integrates the IoT and a predictive model based on ensemble methods to optimize the prediction of the availability of parking spaces in smart parking. The tests that we carried out on the Birmingham parking data set allowed to reach a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.06% on average with the algorithm of Bagging Regression (BR). This results have thus improved the best existing performance by over 6.6% while dramatically reducing system complexity.}

abstract = {The increasing integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and the replacement of fossil fuel vehicles with electric types in distribution systems, while enhancing economic and environmental aspects, have introduced new challenges to network production-consumption balance due to the inherent randomness of these resources. This factor has magnified the significance of balancing markets in renewable-based distribution networks, as these markets address uncertainties and are vital for operational stability. Consequently, this paper introduces a two-stage multi-layer methodology for organizing local energy and balancing markets among Residential Microgrids (RMGs) within an Active Distribution Network (ADN). The AND operator organizes both energy and balancing markets. In the first stage, the intra-day energy market operates, engaging non-profit-seeking aggregators, RMGs, and ADN. Moving to the second stage, the intra-hour balancing market is conducted involving profit-seeking Flexible Load (FL) and Electric Vehicle (EV) aggregators, RMGs, and ADN. The ADN operator organizes both markets and can alter the network topology online within the energy market. The planning of profit-seeking aggregators is formulated using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and Strong Duality Theory (SDT) in the form of Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), considering the correlation of aggregators' profit with the satisfaction index of end-users. The simulation results of the proposed methodology on a modified 118-bus IEEE distribution test system using GAMS indicate that this approach not only provides a significant share of balancing capacities through FLs and EVs but also ensures system stability against intra-hour fluctuations across various scenarios. The results also validate that the proposed methodology achieves a reduction of 24.8 % in power losses and 5.06 % in market costs, while simultaneously ensuring profitability for both aggregators and RMGs.}

With this idea, we started an investigation to examine whether, the cities that erect the seal of Smart City, take actions to integrate the entire population and improve social inclusion. After analysing documents from the centre and the implementation of Intercultural Education in different schools, through observation and interviews to teachers, at different stages and cities, defined as Smart City, we got that, no school undertakes any action respect the integration and social inclusion of the population in their classrooms. Leading us to conclude that the label of Smart city is adding new social disadvantages, leading us to, among our recommendations, that the concept of Intercultural Education should be renewed, including the idea of Intelligent Citizens for Smart Cities.}

This study provides a critical analysis of 34 selected smart city assessment tools to highlight their strengths and weaknesses and to examine their potential contribution to the evolution of the smart city movement. The selected tools are evaluated against an analysis framework that covers criteria related to comprehensiveness, stakeholder engagement, context sensitivity, strategic alignment, uncertainty management, interlinkages and interoperability, temporal dynamism, flexibility, feasibility, presentation and communication of the results, and action plans. Results indicate that selected tools have achieved limited success in addressing these criteria. In particular, only few tools have addressed criteria related to stakeholder engagement, uncertainty management, interlinkages, and feasibility. The paper argues that assessment tools should capitalize on the advancements in smart solutions and big data analytics to develop better strategies for addressing these criteria. In addition to highlighting weaknesses that need to be addressed in the future, results of this study can be used by interested target groups such as smart city developers, planners, and policy makers to choose tools that best fit their needs.}

The different yet complementary linkages formed by these actors must further be aligned with respect to their developmental stage and embedded cultural and social capabilities. Our findings point to eight ‘stylized facts’, based on both quantitative and qualitative empirical results that underlie the facilitation of an effective smart city.

The end goal is to leverage the use of city resources to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Achieving this goal, however, requires advanced support for the development and operation of applications in a complex and dynamic environment. Middleware platforms can provide an integrated infrastructure that enables solutions for smart cities by combining heterogeneous city devices and providing unified, high-level facilities for the development of applications and services. Although several smart city platforms have been proposed in the literature, there are still open research and development challenges related to their scalability, maintainability, interoperability, and reuse in the context of different cities, to name a few. Moreover, available platforms lack extensive scientific validation, which hinders a comparative analysis of their applicability. Aiming to close this gap, we propose InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source, smart city platform that enables the collaborative development of large-scale systems, applications, and services for the cities of the future, contributing to turn them into truly smart cyber–physical environments. In this paper, we present the architecture of the InterSCity platform, followed by a comprehensive set of experiments that evaluate its scalability. The experiments were conducted using a smart city simulator to generate realistic workloads used to assess the platform in extreme conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the platform can scale horizontally to handle the highly dynamic demands of a large smart city while maintaining low response times. The experiments also show the effectiveness of the technique used to generate synthetic workloads.}

Overcoming these conditions requires a change in traditional methods of urban management and a move toward the use of new technologies in all pillars of urban management. One of the available solutions is to create or develop smart cities to take advantage of new digital capacities and rely on the principles of industry 4.0 to manage complex situations and prevent possible anomalies. In this book chapter, the evolution of smart cities platforms along with industrial revolutions is reviewed, and the key points of policies applicable in the field of smart cities using industry 4.0 (city 4.0) are stated. Simultaneous attention to the financial effects and smart cities policy in the fourth generation of the different industrial revolution is the key highlight of this chapter that can be considered by policymakers in creating or developing smart cities.}

Two case studies, a community-based energy efficiency initiative, and a local authority electric vehicle policy were critically reviewed using discourse analysis. The method helped to reveal the explicit, implied and obscured aims of the examined initiatives. Using discourse analysis, the researchers developed a heuristic which could improve traditional policy analysis approaches. The examination of case studies illustrates how practitioners understand the notions of “urban climate justice” and “smart cities” and whether their conceptualisations differ from those present in the academic literature. Finally, the paper offers methodological suggestions for embedding justice in “smart” initiatives at each stage of policy and project design.}

In going some way to qualify this claim, the paper suggests that while such a statement does reflect much of what is currently understood about the infrastructure developments underlying this urban and regional innovation, the claim made about the World Expo building a smart city food system from the ground up, offers more of an insight into the state-of-the-art on the governance of smart cities than it does into the critical nature of the food system surfacing from the Expo in Milan. The paper suggests the reason for the partial synthesis of smart cities as food systems, rest with the claims made about the Expo in Milan failing to recognise the: (1) need for the governance of smart cities not to be in strictly technical, but wider social, cultural and environmental terms; (2) requirement for the infrastructure developments underpinning this urban and regional innovation to also support the sustainable growth of food systems; (3) pressure there is to re-direct the participatory governance agenda of smart cities towards urban policies whose management of natural resources is wise in meeting the human expectation of and social need for food and requirement there is for the municipal strategies and capacity-building exercises underpinning food systems, to be systematic in cultivating an environment able to support the inclusive growth of them across regions; (4) call for the resilience of any such sustainable and inclusive growth to constitute a material condition of the infrastructure developments underlying this urban and regional innovation and surfacing as a smart food system in the City of Milan.}

This research aims to define smart energy city development not only in a theoretical context, but also in terms of practical solutions. We adopt the 5W+1H (why, what, who, where, when, how) model integrated with literature review and expert knowledge elicitation, i.e., focus groups and interviews. This results in: (i) clarification of general interrelationship between smart energy city, smart city, and sustainable city; (ii) a holistic, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive conceptual framework of smart energy city, revealing its principles, objectives, domains of intervention, stakeholders, and time and spatial scales; and (iii) a set of smart energy practical solutions and technologies categorized in the eight domains of intervention: buildings and districts, transportation and mobility, energy and ICT (information and communication technology) infrastructures, collaborative planning, consumer behavior management, energy and data management, as well as two cross-cutting domains. We suggest that sustainable, rational, and integrated application of new technologies, collaboration of multiple stakeholders, and integration of multiple urban energy domains, mainstreamed in energy specific targets, enable distinguishing real from labeled smart energy city development. We suggest that smart energy solutions are mostly effective when combined with other sustainable solutions. This research is applicable for all smart energy city stakeholders, particularly decision makers and researchers, in order to enhance a common and comprehensive understanding of the smart energy city concept and its practical solutions to foster sustainable smart energy city development.}

The smart city provides better solutions for urban areas which are increasing at an unprecedented speed. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess and analyze the development pattern of 35 smart cities in China using the principal component analysis (PCA) and back propagation (BP) neural network techniques. The proposed PCA-BP neural network assessment processing model is applied with six dimensional factors and twenty-two operating indices. With the feature extraction and performance score calculated via PCA, BP neural network is adopted for city classification to recognize the development differences in smart cities. The results indicate that the factor-driven impetus evolves into innovation-driven impetus, narrowing the gap from the holistic perspective between the first and middle-ranking groups, while two middle-ranking groups show a similar upward trend in terms of developing a smart economy through sustainable productivity in innovative enterprises and high-tech industry. To some extent, in response to a similar improving trend in the application of smart services, a distinct advantage of an individual index can be a complementary offset to unapparent holistic highlighting the reception of the lowest average points. Unbalanced development exists in two subaverage groups that are deficient in the initial inventory of smart infrastructure and demands. A relatively large difference exists in the smart mobility index among cities, whereas the opposite case is found concerning the smart environment index. Finally, corresponding optimized development pattern are recommended for building a sustainable smart city.}

Keeping it in view, we proposed a Big Data analytics embedded smart city architecture, which is further integrated with the web via a smart gateway. Integration with the web provides a universal communication platform to overcome the platform incompatibilities of smart things. We introduced Big Data analytics to enhance data processing speed. Further, we evaluated authentic datasets to determine the threshold values for intelligent decision-making and to present the performance improvement gained in data processing. Finally, we presented a representational state transfer (RESTful) web of things (WoT) integrated smart building architecture (smart home) to reveal the performance improvements of the proposed smart city architecture in terms of network performance and energy management of smart buildings.}

abstract = {Energy supply of megacities is considered as an active research topic in the new aspects of urban management, especially in developing countries like Iran. With an introduction to the sustainable development goals, the smart city concept presents a novel idea for providing energy in a city with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), renewable energy, such as Photovoltaic (PV) technologies, and Transformational Participation (TP) based on motivational programs for citizens. This study aims to evaluate the electrical energy consumption in Mashhad, Iran, based on machine learning tools and present the dynamic strategies for promoting citizens’ willingness for renewable energy generation based on the experts’ knowledge. The main novelty of this research is simultaneous application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical analysis for creating a Decision Support System (DSS). Then, the solar energy potential is appraised by the PV system simulation tool during one year in our case study in Mashhad, Iran. Furthermore, a Classical Delphi (CD) method is applied for motivational strategies and further TP implementation. In particular, the motivational strategies are suggested by 45 experts and then are prioritized in sequential expert meetings. The outcomes of this research indicate that the ANN model can successfully forecast the electrical energy consumption in summer and winter periods with a 99% accuracy. Then, based on the solar energy computations in the PV system, the peak of electrical energy consumption can be controlled in the hottest and coldest months. Last but not least, the superposition of experts’ and citizens’ opinions reveal A4 (sharing benefits of optimized costs with the citizens by solar energy generation), B2 (reducing the electrical energy cost for solar energy generation, especially in peak times) and C1 (creating the energy coin in the city with credits instead of spending money in urban activities fits to solar energy generation) as the main motivational strategies for solar energy generation in short, middle and long-term planning horizons.}

One of the most significant pillars of the Smart City is to ensure healthy and sustainable environment by making the city pollution free as far as possible, to ensure the smart health of the citizens. In this work, a frame work is proposed using Context Aware Computing approach to monitor the air health of urban region. The proposed frame work is designed to help in sensing air pollutant parameters using smart sensors and generate alert using context if there is a threat of air pollution. Here, the Input layer optimization technique is also proposed. It has been shown that, the Input layer optimization technique has discarded the unwanted overheads of the proposed frame work without degrading the efficiency of the system.}

Meanwhile, since both of the quantity and the type of IoT devices are growing rapidly, how to quickly identify the type of IoT devices is of paramount importance, especially in the fields of IoT Device Security, IoT Forensics, Cyber Defense, and Cyber Threats Intelligence Sharing, to make the IoT smart city green and sustainable. Traditional identification mode based on device or gateway often suffers from their limited computing and storage resources. Our work is motivated by the observation of the emergence of edge computing, in which computing and storage servers are placed in close proximity to IoT/mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an Edge-based Classifier Identification Scheme (E-CIS) for IoT Devices, where the neighboring edge servers provide powerful computing and storage capabilities. E-CIS changes the traditional centralized architecture and realizes low time delay and efficient identification of IoT devices based on edge computing. Experiments show that the average identification accuracy is as high as 99.2%. Besides, the optimization and security of the classification model can be maintained by the edge servers at the same time.}

These devices generate the overwhelming volume of high-speed streaming data, termed as Big Data. However, the generation of city data at a remote location and then transmitting it to central city servers for analysis purpose raises the concerns of security and privacy. On the other hand, providing security to such Big Data streaming requires a high-speed security system that can work in a real-time environment without providing any delay that may slow down the overall performance of the Smart City System. To overthrown these challenges, in this paper, we proposed an efficient and real-time Smart City security system by providing strong intrusion detection at intelligent city building (ICB) and also a security protocol to protect the communication between the remote smart system(RSS)/User and the city analysis building, i.e., ICB. The proposed communication security protocol consists of various phases, i.e., registration phase, session key exchange phase, session key revocation phase, and data transmission phases from RSS to ICB as well as from User to ICB. Vast security analyses are performed to evaluate the credibility of the system. The proposed system is also evaluated on efficiency in terms of computation cost and throughput of overall functions used in the system. The system’s evaluation and the comparative study with existing system show that the prosed system is secure, more efficient, and able to work in a real-time, high-speed Smart City environment.}

While practices and lessons from these programs will be valuable to enlighten other regions and practitioners, to date, rather few studies have paid attentions to this issue. Particularly, the emerging smart technologies strongly support the practice, via offering smart solutions like better renewable energy projection, low-carbon life styles transformation, as well as energy planning and management. However, there has been a lack of discussing their future role in-depth. With this circumstance, this paper conducts an integrated and in-depth review on China's promotion on smart cities and smart industrial parks. In detail, the national pilots, key technical innovations, incentives and policies framework, as well as spatial features were discussed in-depth. Particularly, we further explored how the smart solutions can contribute to better decision making on low-carbon urban and industrial system planning. Finally, we highlighted policy recommendations targeting on future smart cities and industrial parks promotion, focusing on the perspectives of technological and social system innovations, innovative decision support tools, and smart management framework.

In this article, we propose a strategy for developing service-dominant platforms with the advancement of ICT and more internet enterprises initiatives. We use the concept of SDP (service dominant platform) as a key contributor in a smart city's construction to explain how value can be co-created during the formation and evolution of the platform. Drawing on case materials from a Business-oriented platform named WeChat in Guangzhou and a government-oriented one in Shanghai, an analytic framework on platform and service innovation-relevant theories are built around the dynamic cyclical value co-creation, and three elements are identified in this process defined as value proposition, value in exchange and value in use, which consist of ten sub-elements on different SDPs along four dimensions, namely openness, services innovation, governance and resource. The study makes three contributions. First, it provides new evidence that pursuing smart city construction is not a mere technological architecture but a value co-creation oriented strategy. While facing persistent problems, China's paths exhibit significant and rapidly improving readiness for it. Second, the study provides new insights into, by positively bridging the linkage between platform governance and service innovation and proposing the service dominant platform (SDP) as a clear sustainable strategy. Finally, the study proposes two different resources-based models for guiding smart city initiatives in developing countries. By providing theoretical concepts to support public service innovation, identifying some implications for smart city developed in emerging countries, and suggesting some operational approaches to co-creating value against the local context, this paper has made a meaningful theoretical and practical significance about smart city.}

Though the algorithm is competitive but still shows poor exploration properties and slow convergence. In the present work, chaos theory has been introduced to enhance the exploration properties of NMRA. Apart from that, parametric adaptation has been added to analyse the effect of mating factor (λ) using various chaotic maps (such as chebyshev map, circle map, iterative map etc.) on NMRA. Based on these chaotic maps, ten variants of NMRA are proposed, and their performance is evaluated for CEC 2005 test suite subjected to different population and dimension sets. Further, the best variant among the proposed variants is evaluated for CEC 2014 benchmark functions, 100-digit challenge problems (CEC 2019) and three engineering design problems. In addition, to check the effectiveness of proposed best variant, it is further applied to real time problem of energy efficient and prolonged lifetime design of wireless sensor network for smart city framework. The results of best proposed variant are compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms namely differential evolution with adaptive properties (JADE), whale optimization algorithm with opposition and exponential properties (OEWOA), sine cosine crow search algorithm (SCCSA), self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE), success-history based differential evolution along with parameter adaption (SHADE), equilibrium optimizer (EO), flower pollination algorithm based on fractional order calculus (FA-FPO), Gaussian-salp swarm algorithm (GSSA), variable neighbourhood bat algorithm (VNBA), blended biogeography-based optimization (B-BBO), improved elephant herding optimization (IMEHO), original NMRA and others. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed NMRA with Chebyshev map (CNMRA) as the best well supported by Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Friedman rank (f-rank) test, concerning other algorithms used for comparison.}

The Smart City has been praised but also criticized as a discourse for its narrow epistemology. Limitations have led to reductionist benchmarking that lends itself to comparison, yet limits practitioners’ ability to translate findings into ontologically diverse action. In the related fields of information systems and management studies, a pragmatist research paradigm has been used to address this challenge. This article explores that pragmatist paradigm, describing how it can expand the current limits of the current Smart City discourse to include local politics, technologies, and the relational genealogies that characterize sociotechnical systems. The pragmatist methodology I explore here uses excerpts from practitioner oral histories—organized visually using actor-network theory—to define and explain the emergence of two Smart City initiatives. This approach is capable of a more situated and contingent practitioner explanation of the complexity of urban projects. Ultimately, the article concludes with reflections on the use of pragmatism for Smart City cases to provide a counter perspective to the dominant discourse.}

It consists of electronic devices and is integrated with numerous tight constraint sensors for observing the real world and provide communication services to end-users. However, optimal data collection and its management among the heterogeneous G-IoT objects are one of the main challenges. Many researchers are still proposing different solutions to cope with such problems and offering IoT-cloud paradigms for processing, storage, and scalability services. However, the data of smart cities is forwarded using the open-source IoT platform, and sensitive information may be compromised. Therefore, this research aims to propose a model of security measures using the Green Internet of Things with Cloud Integrated Data Management (M-SMDM) for Smart Cities. Firstly, it forms a long-run and energy-efficient connectivity using self-balancing trees and distributing load factors uniformly in green communication systems. Secondly, it addresses the problem of secret key distribution between peer nodes and attained trust for both partial and direct communication. In the end, it securing the transmission system from mobile gateways to application users against threats with improved overheads and data latency. The security analysis of the proposed M-SMDM model is done along with simulation-based experiments. The attained results disclose the importance of the proposed model in terms of network parameters compared to existing work.}

Less attention has been devoted to identifying the practical conditions under which big data can realistically contribute to addressing urban policy problems. In this paper, we discuss the value and limitations of big data for long-term urban policy and planning. We first develop a theoretical perspective on urban analytics as a practice that is part of a new smart urbanism. We identify the particular tension of opposed temporalities of high-frequency data and the long durée of structural challenges facing cities. Drawing on empirical studies using big urban data, we highlight epistemological and practical challenges that arise from the analysis of high-frequency data for strategic purposesand formulate propositions on the ways in which urban analytics can inform long-term urban policy.}

It argues that trust is a moderator to influence the relationship between attitude, subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention in smart cities. This study tests hypotheses using a sample of 103 respondents from six smart cities in China. The results reveal that attitude is main factor influencing individual's behavioral intention. Subjective norm and trust are both not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval in the model of multiple-regression. Interestingly, it finds that trust moderates the relationship between subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention. It means that the audiologists' advice can positively affect person's behavioral intention in smart cities. The findings imply that the Theory of Reasoned Action can be partially used to explain the person's behavioral intention in Chinese context. This study contributes to encourage old people to use smart hospitals to consult audiologists about hearing loss and hearing aids rehabilitation. Hence, hearing aids can improve their quality of life (QoL), which can be reflected by the improved standard of living, better access to treatments and also the positive sentiment about their life, including comfort, friendship, happiness and a closer connection to the society.}

abstract = {Smart cities are providing advanced services aggregating and exploiting data from different sources. Cities collect static data such as road graphs, service description, as well as dynamic/real time data like weather forecast, traffic sensors, bus positions, city sensors, events, emergency data, flows, etc. RDF stores may be used to set up knowledge bases integrating heterogeneous information for web and mobile applications to use the data for new advanced services to citizens and city administrators, thus exploiting inferential capabilities, temporal and spatial reasoning, and text indexing. In this paper, the needs and constraints for RDF stores to be used for smart cities services, together with the currently available RDF stores are evaluated. The assessment model allows a full understanding of whether an RDF store is suitable to be used as a basis for Smart City modeling and applications. The RDF assessment model is also supported by a benchmark which extends available RDF store benchmarks at the state the art. The comparison of the RDF stores has been applied on a number of well-known RDF stores as Virtuoso, GraphDB (former OWLIM), Oracle, StarDog, and many others. The paper also reports the adoption of the proposed Smart City RDF Benchmark on the basis of Florence Smart City model, data sets and tools accessible as Km4City Http://www.Km4City.org, and adopted in the European Commission international smart city projects named RESOLUTE H2020, REPLICATE H2020, and in Sii-Mobility National Smart City project in Italy.}

Despite questions about the origin and intentions of IBM's involvement, 130 cities from all around the world took up the challenge in the first five years. There is limited case study research available on a number of participating cities which has not been able to unpack cities' rationale for working with IBM. This paper provides an index of all participating cities in the Smarter Cities Challenge, to understand the areas of interest in which urban governments have been seeking IBM's consulting service. Findings present the state of smart city thinking in urban governments, and raise questions about the multidimensional integration, if any, across the areas of focus in which digital technologies are shaping contemporary cities.}

abstract = {The term ‘smart cities’ is a widely used, but at the same time a highly fuzzy concept. The fuzziness hinders our understanding on the benefits of its adoption, and explains the existence of many relevant activities with fragmented or distorted views of what a truly smart city is. The aim of this paper is to undertake a comprehensive review of how smart cities are perceived in the literature and in the light of the findings propose a clearer definition. Overview of the key terms, concepts and definitions associated to smart cities, reported in this paper, demonstrates that the definitions found in the academic literature have limited scope, and are overly focused on strategic drivers and specific actions, instead of making explicitly the connection between the concept of smart cities and the creation of environments that promote happiness and wellbeing of their residents—which should be the main function of a city. Following the thorough review on the smart cities literature, the paper proposes a comprehensive, human-centred, and context-free definition for smart cities. This definition brings an endogenous view on smart cities in which the central element is the direct participation of local actors and stakeholders in the process of thinking, defining, planning, and executing social, technological and urban transformations in cities.}

However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities. This paper will contribute to urban planning and policy development in the modern data-rich economy.}

Smart city development promotes an established, interconnected, and sustainable urban system. The Indian government has launched “100 Smart Cities Mission” for planned urbanization in the country. The “100 cities” have been selected from a two-round city challenge competition. However, some controversial viewpoints have made questionable remarks over the selection process. For the effective planning of smart cities, an exhaustive analysis is essential to find the existing critical infrastructure, key resources, and development trends. The purpose of this study is to aid city planners and decision-makers to determine city eligibility in a multidimensional way and to develop evaluation criteria for city selection process to meet the goal of smart city mission. This article proposes a weighted criteria model to assess the city selection eligibility. The factors are identified from the literature studies. Total interpretive structure modeling is used to analyze the complex interrelationships among the factors and to develop a selection hierarchy. The fuzzy MICMAC process is used to classify the factors based on driving power and dependence. The stabilized driving power is applied to calculate the corresponding weights for each factor. In study findings, the most driving, linkage and dependent factors are identified for analyzing city selection eligibility. The policy-makers, government officials, and decisions-makers would get benefitted from the study outcomes to select top “N” number of cities for Smart Cities Mission.}

abstract = {Digital technologies integrated into port logistics are becoming increasingly decisive among port cities around the world. This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

abstract = {With the sustainable development being a consensus in human society, assessment of healthy development index in urban cities (HDI-UC) has been a hot concern in academia. Existing research works had proposed some assessment models from the perspective of sociology. However, these approaches can just assess HDI-UC values of current year and past years, as they relied on complete index systems. They failed to possess the ability to directly assess HDI-UC values in future years. To bridge such gap, this paper proposes a smart assessment and forecasting framework for HDI-UC. On the one hand, an assessment model proposed in a previous study is introduced as the basic model. On the other hand, the Gaussian process regression is utilized to model the evolving HDI-UC sequence, so that HDI-UC values in future years can be directly forecasted according to historical ones. A case study is conducted on real-world statistical data collected from some regions of China to illustrate assessment process of the framework. Besides, another group of experiments are also carried out to evaluate forecasting performance. The simulation results show that prediction error of SAF-HDI is around 5 %, which is within an acceptable range.}

The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.}

Many of the concrete steps will address the local level; however, these have to align with the broader energy perspective. It is therefore necessary to develop methods that enable cities to assess the compatibility of the local renewable energy strategy to the surrounding national and global energy systems. This paper presents a methodology to design Smart Energy Cities within the context of 100% renewable energy at a national level. Cities and municipalities should act locally with regard to local demands but acknowledge the national and global context when addressing resources, industry and transport. The method is applied to the case of transitioning the municipality of Aalborg to a 100% renewable smart energy system within the context of a Danish and European energy system. The case demonstrates how it is possible to transition to a Smart Energy City that fits within a 100% renewable energy context of Denmark and Europe. The suggested methodology is framed in a way that makes it applicable to other cases globally.}

We will start by looking at the definitions of all terms that make up the whole world of governance and citizen participation applied to smart cities in this case. In order to see how we can implement these techniques in the day-to-day governance of cities, we will do an exercise to analyze their evolution toward Smart Cities. Beyond technology, what will future cities be? Which cities we will have after applying all Smart City technology to their strategy and evolution? This will then allow us to address the governance of cities and more specifically analyze the instruments of governance and participation that we have and how we can implement them.}

Different mathematical models and statistical techniques have been proposed and tested to carry out bibliometric analyses and demonstrate their effectiveness in uncovering how fields of research are intellectually structured.

This paper reports on the findings of a bibliometric study in which these hybrid techniques are combined to: (1) build and visualize the network of publications shaping the intellectual structure of the smart city research field by considering the first two decades of literature dealing with this subject; (2) map the clusters of thematically-related publications; and (3) reveal the emerging development paths of smart cities that each thematic cluster represents and the strategic principles they embody. The five development paths which the analysis uncovers and the strategic principles each stands on are then compared by reviewing the most recent literature on smart cities. Overall, this bibliometric study offers a systematic review of the research on smart cities produced since 1992 and helps bridge the division affecting this research area, demonstrating that it is caused by the dichotomous nature of the development paths of smart cities that each thematic cluster relates to and the strategic principles they in turn support.}

In this framework, the smart city is actually a popular vision in discourses on urban development. This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen’s voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom. This paper analyses the role of citizens in four alternative smart city imaginaries. The thesis proposed is that all four imaginaries are characterised by citizens playing a subaltern role, and hence the smart city is a relatively poor concept if intended as a model of the urban life of the future.}
