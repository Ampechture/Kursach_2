abstract = {The penetration of smart homes into households in South Korea is fast growing and is predicted to reach a domestic market value of up to seven billion US dollars by 2026. However, the factors affecting user adoption and influencing successful performance are not adequately considered in the current delivery of smart housing. This research aims to explore user adoption by women in South Korea based on their current experience of the smart features delivered in their smart home units. An intensive interview targeting female residents in their thirties and forties who were the dominant occupiers and users of smart homes was conducted. The results from the intensive interviews provided three principle findings. First, the three steps of user adoption (awareness, opportunity and experience) were not adequately achieved by users, which led to unsatisfactory approaches to living in the smart home. Second, a lack of pre-instruction and guidance led to poor knowledgeability in the application, which negatively affected the opportunity and experience of smart features. Third, many smart features in the contemporary smart home are not users' preferred brand or product type. User preferences and needs are neglected in current top-down delivery systems, which negatively affect the satisfaction levels of users. This study reveals the significance of the three steps of user adoption to achieve optimal user performance through an alternative delivery strategy. The provision of a new approach to smart housing delivery that adequately considers users’ preferences and needs is required to achieve the successful user performance proposed in this study.}

The modified surface of a common thermal insulation wall (TIW) using Ti3C2Tx and polyaniline (PANI) by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer serves as an energy storage device in the wall and, at the same time, maintains the temperature inside the house. The as-fabricated PANI@Ti3C2Tx-TIW-based supercapacitor exhibited high specific capacitance with outstanding rate capability, cyclic stability, mechanical stability, and power density, and functions in extreme temperatures (−15 °C to 45 °C). Further, the device was integrated into real rock mineral wool insulation to develop a future house energy storage system that can store electricity in the house wall and supply power to operate emergency evacuation and alert devices in the event of a disaster.}

abstract = {Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning strategy to encourage the use of public transportation by clustering urban development centering on transit stations with dense and diverse land uses. TOD typology is important information for the urban planner to monitor and improve the TOD. However, many studies have focused only on static features such as land use and population density around the transit station. Such analysis does not reflect dynamic features based on human mobility patterns. This study focuses on a series of processes that evaluate the activity-based TOD typology of the transit station based on smart-card data. To consider the context of multimodal transit system, transit station areas consisting of one subway station and multiple bus stops are created and clustered according to the proportion of the identified activities. Passengers' trip-chain with missing activities are clustered by applying a hidden Markov model (HMM), and the activities are identified through land use and temporal patterns. Interpretation of each cluster is made through spatio-temporal patterns. The results provide six types of identified activities that are well aligned with general expectations. The transit station areas in Seoul, which were clustered with six identified types, describe the urban spatial structure, which is spatially distributed around a business district in order of mixed and residential zones. Also, the same category of clusters shows different functions depending on temporal patterns, indicating the need for consideration of dynamic features. Our approach provides insights into transit station changes throughout the day that has been overlooked in previous studies by considering the passenger's sequence of activity, start, and duration.}

The model first analyzes the characteristics of the variable model and determines the forecast model inputs using two methods of correlation analysis to understand the impact of actual energy costs, weather and other factors on the changes. Second, since Feedforward neural network is deficient in processing the correlation information between loads, the prediction model developed by the author was studied as CNN. After completing the training, input two sets of real datasets for final data analysis and comparison, and the results show that, LSTM, BP, SVR[UNK]MAPE[UNK]RMSE respectively 0.49%, 0.57%, 0.83%, 1.44% and 106.08 MW, 113.82MW, 169.77 MW, 285.61 MW.

Despite their limited resources, IoT devices collect and share large amounts of data and are connected to the internet, becoming an attractive target for malicious actors. This work uses machine learning combined with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect possible attacks. Due to the limitations of IoT devices and low latency services, the IDS must have a specialized architecture. Furthermore, although machine learning-based solutions have high potential, there are still challenges related to training and generalization, which may impose constraints on the architecture. Our proposal is an IDS with a distributed architecture that relies on Fog computing to run specialized modules and use deep neural networks to identify malicious traffic inside IoT data flows. We compare our IoT-Flow IDS with three other architectures. We assess model generalization using test data from different datasets and evaluate their performance in terms of Recall, Precision, and F1-Score. Results confirm the feasibility of flow-based anomaly detection and the importance of network traffic segmentation and specialized models in the AI-based IDS for IoT.}

Smart grid technologies possess innovative tools and frameworks to model the dynamic behaviour of microgrids regardless of their types, structures, etc. Various control and estimation technologies are reviewed for developing dynamic models of smart microgrids. The hierarchical system of a microgrid control consists of three architectural layers, primary, secondary and tertiary, which need to be supported by real-time monitoring and measurement environment of the system variables and parameters. Various control and estimation schemes have been devised to handle the dynamic performance of microgrids in the function of control layers requirement. Firstly, control schemes in the innovative grid environment are evaluated to understand the dynamics of the developed technologies. Six control technologies, linear, non-linear, robust, predictive, intelligent and adaptive, are mainly used to model the control design within the layer(s) regardless of the types of microgrids. Secondly, the estimation technologies are evaluated based on the state of variables, locations and modelling of microgrids that can efficiently support the performance of the controllers and operating microgrids. Finally, a future vision for designing hierarchical and architectural control techniques for the optimal operation of intelligent microgrids is also provided. Therefore, this study will serve as a fundamental conceptual framework to select a perfect optimal design modelling strategy and policy-making decisions to control, monitor and protect the innovative electrical network.}

However, unregulated battery charging remains a challenge causing high energy costs, power peaks or even blackouts. This paper studies this challenge from a socio-technical perspective: social dynamics such as the participation in demand-response programs, the discomfort experienced by alternative suggested vehicle usage times and even the fairness in terms of how equally discomfort is experienced among the population are highly intertwined with Smart Grid reliability. To address challenges of such a socio-technical nature, this paper introduces a fully decentralized and participatory learning mechanism for privacy-preserving coordinated charging control of electric vehicles that regulates three Smart Grid socio-technical aspects: (i) reliability, (ii) discomfort and (iii) fairness. In contrast to related work, a novel autonomous software agent exclusively uses local knowledge to generate energy demand plans for its vehicle that encode different battery charging regimes. Agents interact to learn and make collective decisions of which plan to execute so that power peaks and energy cost are reduced system-wide. Evaluation with real-world data confirms the improvement of drivers’ comfort and fairness using the proposed planning method, while this improvement is assessed in terms of reliability and cost reduction under a varying number of participating vehicles. These findings have a significant relevance and impact for power utilities and system operator on designing more reliable and socially responsible Smart Grids with high penetration of electric vehicles.}

However, their capability of differentiating multiple stimuli still remains a challenge. Here, we develop a multimodal smart textile that can simultaneously measure temperature and pulse/touch in real time, with high performance and no signal interference. The smart textile outputs two independent variables, with the whole textile as a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to detect touch/pulse and its core thermoresistive micro/nano porous fiber strand (also is the TENG’s working electrode) to detect temperature. The stretchable core thermoresistive micro/nano porous fiber of the smart textile achieves record-high thermal sensitivity (β = 4994.55 K, α=−5.58%/K at 26 ℃) and the fastest response/recovery time (97/239 ms) among previously reported fiber/textile-based temperature sensors, to our best knowledge. This fiber based on the growth of Fe2(MoO4)3 on graphene has much higher temperature sensing performance (∼3.2 times higher thermal sensitivity) than that based on directly blending Fe2(MoO4)3 and graphene. Moreover, the fiber has high thermal stability and its temperature sensing performance is insensitive to strain (stretching, bending and pressing). The smart textile is demonstrated for artificial sensation and health monitoring to simultaneously provide accurate profiles of both temperature and touch/pulse. This work provides new insights for wearable sensors.}

For SHS in SSA, however, a unique challenge exists as many of the households do not have access to net-metering system that allows extra PV energy generation during the daytime to be exported to the grid. This leads to waste energy generation (redundant energy) when the household energy demand is lower than the PV energy generation. In this study, analysis has been conducted to determine the magnitude of redundant energy of 3 SHS. Hypothesis testing of the existence of redundant energy from the SHS is also conducted. Our study has revealed that generally, there is redundant energy generation in the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. for the households, with hourly values ranging from 0.37 kWh to 1.55 kWh. The redundant energy represents 29.6 %–56.3 % of the households' monthly PV energy generation. The findings of this study give insights into the potential of harnessing redundant energy of SHS for planning smart energy cities if net-metering systems were available.}

In green building, a building information model (BIM) and ontology are used to manage multi-disciplinary activities. SWRL and OWL models based on the Jess rule engine are combined to improve building efficiency. Sustainable materials which are obtained from industrial waste help to reduce the carbon footprint on the environment. The strength, workability, and density of these materials are increased by the usage of various activators. Smart materials operate based on external factors such as sensors, weather conditions, and so on. Smart materials are used in the Electro-Mechanical Impedance (EMI) approach to detect structural flaws in a structure. In smart homes, technology can be used to control energy consumption. Shape Memory Alloys, fiber optics, piezoelectric materials, magnetorheological fluids, and electro-rheological fluids are examples of smart materials used in smart, sustainable urbanization. The Internet of Things (IoT) developed a method for collecting construction data that reduced the structure's cost.

keywords = {Asthma, Inhalers, Qualitative study, Asthma guidelines, Dissemination and implementation science},
abstract = {Background
The Global Initiative for Asthma and National Asthma Education and Prevention Program recently made paradigm-shifting recommendations regarding inhaler management in asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma now recommends that combination inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol inhalers replace short-acting β-agonists as the preferred reliever therapy at all steps of asthma management. Although the most recent guidelines of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program did not review reliever ICS-formoterol usage in mild asthma, they similarly recommended single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) at steps 3 and 4 of asthma management. Despite these recommendations, many clinicians—particularly in the United States—are not prescribing new inhaler paradigms. Clinician-level reasons for this implementation gap remain largely unexplored.
Objective
To gain an in-depth understanding of the facilitators and barriers to prescribing reliever ICS-formoterol inhalers and SMART in the United States.
Methods
Community and academic primary care providers, pulmonologists, and allergists who reported regularly caring for adults with asthma were interviewed. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, qualitatively coded, and analyzed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Interviews were continued until theme saturation.
Results
Among 20 interviewed clinicians, only 6 clinicians described regularly prescribing ICS-formoterol inhalers as a reliever inhaler (either alone or within SMART). Significant barriers to new inhaler approaches included concerns surrounding a lack of Food and Drug Administration labeling for ICS-formoterol as a reliever therapy, a lack of awareness regarding a patient’s formulary-preferred ICS–long-acting β-agonist choices, the high cost of combination inhalers, and time constraints. Facilitators to using new inhaler approaches included clinicians’ beliefs that the latest inhaler recommendations are simpler and more congruent with real-world patients’ behavior, and that a potential change in management strategy would offer a valuable opportunity for shared decision making.
Conclusions
Although new guidelines exist in asthma, many clinicians described significant barriers to using them including medicolegal issues, pharmaceutical formulary confusion, and high drug costs. Nonetheless, most clinicians believed that the latest inhaler approaches would be more intuitive for their patients and would offer an opportunity for patient-centered collaboration and care. Stakeholders may find these results useful in future attempts to increase the real-world adoption of recent asthma recommendations.}

However, weather conditions and diseases impact production efficiency, reducing economic activity and the food sovereignty of economies worldwide. Thus, computational methods can support disease classification based on an image. This classification requires training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models on high-performance computing resources, usually far from the user domain. State of the art has proposed the concept of Edge Computing (EC), which aims to bring computational resources closer to the domain problem to decrease application latency and improve computational power closer to the client. In addition, EC has become an enabling technology for Smart Farms, and the literature has appropriated EC to support these applications. However, predominantly state-of-the-art architectures are dependent on Internet connectivity and do not allow diverse real-time classification of diseases based on crop leaf on mobile devices. This paper sheds light on a new architecture, AgroLens, built with low-cost and green-friendly devices to support a mobile Smart Farm application, operational even in areas lacking Internet connectivity. Among our main contributions, we highlight the functional evaluation of AgroLens for AI-based real-time classification of diseases based on leaf images, achieving high classification performance using a smartphone. Our results indicate that AgroLens supports the connectivity of thousands of sensors from a smart farm without imposing computational overhead on edge-compute. The AgroLens architecture opens up opportunities and research avenues for deployment and evaluation for large-scale Smart Farm applications with low-cost devices.}

abstract = {The fine-grained electricity consumption data created by advanced metering technologies offers an opportunity to understand residential demand from new angles. Although there exists a large body of research on demand response in short- and long-term forecasting, household consumption behaviour studies based on smart metering data has not been discussed as much as the demand load studies, especially limited research focusing the residential consumption in China. The study's novelty lies in its use of unsupervised machine learning tools to explore residential customers' demand patterns and response in a finer picture, which provides a better understanding of household electricity demand profiles in China. We investigate behavioural response in three different contexts: 1) seasonal (using weekly consumption profiles); 2) holidays/festivals; and 3) extreme weather situations. The analysis is based on the smart metering data of 2000 households in Chengdu, China over three years from 2014 to 2016. Workday/weekend profiles indicate that there are two distinct groups of households that appear to be white-collar or relatively affluent families. Demand patterns at the major festivals in China, especially the Spring Festival, reveal various types of lifestyle and households. In terms of extreme weather response, the most striking finding was that in summer, at night-time, over 72% of households doubled (or more) their electricity usage, while consumption changes in winter do not seem to be significant. Our research offers more detailed insight into Chinese residential consumption and provides a practical framework to understand households' behaviour patterns in different settings.}

A total of 829 responses were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation model and multigroup analysis. The results imply the following:1) personal environmental beliefs of sustainability and perceived green value of sustainability (PGV) significantly affect attitude toward green smart technology product (ATT); 2) personal norm of sustainability and PGV significantly affect the subjective norm; 3) ATT and the subjective norm affect green smart technology product adoption intention (SAI); 4) cross-cultural effects moderate the relationships in the two groups; especially, the Chinese group has a stronger relationship between personal environmental beliefs of sustainability and ATT, while the South African group has a stronger relationship between the subjective norm and SAI; and 5) the Chinese group also has a stronger relationship between PGV and ATT with the highest difference between the groups. This study enriches the theories of value-belief-norm and Hofstede's Cultural Framework, and contributes to propose the green smart technology products adoption theoretical framework revealing cross-culture effects with empirical testing in emerging markets. This study also provides references for the corresponding enterprises and other stakeholders for decisions and policy-making. Finally, implications are discussed comprehensively for both research and practice.}

A techno-economic analysis is performed based on a real case in the city of Florence to show the benefits that the creation of a REC can bring to the stakeholders: consumers, prosumers, the national grid operator and third-party companies. Moreover, this study focuses on the role of batteries within a REC by comparing three different battery management systems (BMS). The standard BMS (StBMS) is developed for individual prosumer self-consumption (SC) and not for REC collective-self-consumption (CSC), which is thus penalized by the presence of batteries. For that reason, a new smart BMS (SmBMS) based on REC real-time data monitoring is proposed. This solution guarantees the same level of CSC as in the case without batteries, and compared to the StBMS, it ensures greater REC energy independence from the national grid and leads to more incentives for all stakeholders, causing only a negligible economic loss for prosumers, as their individual SC slightly decreases. The optimal BMS (OpBMS), based on deterministic knowledge of demand and production curves, could guarantee even greater REC energy independence and a better investment for all REC participants, but since it cannot be implemented, it is calculated only to be used as a benchmark to assess other BMSs and to explore the potential of forecasting based methods. StBMS and SmBMS are simulated by Multi​ Energy System Simulator (MESS) while OpBMS by a Mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP).}

abstract = {Slender buildings are prone to vortex-induced vibrations and turbulence-induced buffeting. Usually, vortex-induced vibrations govern the strength and serviceability design criteria. The building's shape determines the aerodynamics of it; therefore, optimizing building shape can greatly reduce wind-induced vibrations. With a growing industry in adaptive and double-skin facades—mainly for energy saving purposes—there is an opportunity to innovate and implement smart, morphing facade modules (which we refer as Smorphacades) that actively modify their aerodynamic shape to alleviate flow-induced vibrations during high winds. This paper evaluates the performance of a 44-story tall building with the different configurations of the developed Smorphacade module system in mitigating building vibrations. Dynamic nonlinear time history analysis of the building under varying wind speeds ranging between 35 and 75 m/s are performed to evaluate the performance of building equipped with Smorphacade at low and high wind speeds. The performance measures chosen in the study are displacements and accelerations. Structural responses of building equipped with Smorphacade are compared against the bare building model responses to evaluate improvements in performance. Acceleration response comparisons at lower wind speeds provide insights into Smorphacade contributions to improving occupant comfort. Displacement comparisons at high wind speeds help understand the improvements in overall structural performance by reducing nonlinear response.}

This study aims to examine determinants of farmers’ use of climate-smart agricultural practices, specifically improved crop varieties, intercropping, improved livestock breeds and rainwater harvesting in Wadla district, northeast Ethiopia.
Design/methodology/approach
A cross-sectional household survey was used. A structured interview schedule for respondent households and checklists for key informants and focus group discussants were used. This study used both descriptive statistics and a multivariate probit econometric model to analyze the collected data. The model was used to compute factors influencing the use of climate-smart agricultural practices in the study area.
Findings
The results revealed that households adopted selected practices. The likelihood of farmers’ decisions to use improved crop varieties, intercropping, improved livestock breeds and rainwater harvesting was 85%, 52%, 69% and 59%, respectively. The joint probability of using these climate-smart agricultural practices was 23.7%. The model results confirmed that sex, level of education, livestock holding, access to credit, farm distance, market distance and training were significant factors that affected the use of climate-smart agricultural practices in the study area.
Originality/value
The present study used the most selected locally practiced interventions for climate-smart agriculture.}

The natural user interface (NUI) enables intuitive interaction between users and the SHS, significantly lowering the barrier to entry and enhancing user experience. However, a comprehensive evaluation of research on NUI for the SHS to provide a valuable synthesis of existing research and informing future research directions remains unavailable. This study attempts to address this gap by systematically evaluating 1979 relevant journal and conference articles from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus, and those articles with a weak connection to the topic and poor data integrity were excluded. Finally, 1330 articles were chosen to for analysis in terms of contributions, critical papers, co-occurrence, and clustering using scientometric techniques. It was revealed that, with the help of advancing technologies, the research field of NUI aims to enrich the variety of interactive device types, improve the accuracy of interpreting and responding to user behavior, and optimize the compatibility with diverse user demographics. Besides, a conceptual framework summarizing typical types of NUI for the SHS was proposed, and strengths and weaknesses of each NUI were discussed for investigating specific future directions. Furthermore, four general research directions (strategies for promoting effective multimodal NUI, adoption of artificial intelligence for better performance, exploration of mixed reality applications in the SHS, and standardization of protocols in the smart home ecosystem) were also identified for academics and practitioners in their future research and practice.}

Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is an integrated system that through a single online interface enables commuters to plan, book, and pay for trips which utilise a range of mobility providers. MaaS has a unique characteristic to provide a system into which new service options can be integrated with traditional transportation modes. This makes MaaS a potential alternative to private vehicle ownership, and a means to overcome some of the negative externalities associated with automobile dependency. To realise this potential, many cities have implemented—or are in the process of implementing—MaaS trials to better understand how this service will function within cities. This paper utilises a systematic literature review to extract insights, and develops a conceptual framework to identify barriers and risks related to MaaS adoption in cities. The study findings reveal that: (a) the desired MaaS outcomes are associated with reduced vehicle kilometres travelled, increased trip awareness, reduced parking, reduced vehicle ownership, and improved social equity; (b) MaaS supply side barriers include public private cooperation, business support, service coverage, shared vision, and data and cyber security; (c) MaaS demand side barriers are its lack of appeal to older generations, public transport users, and private vehicle users, the attractiveness of the digital platform, and user willingness-to-pay.}

There are few rigorous empirical estimates regarding the efficacy of these policies, particularly for outcomes such as transit ridership or traffic flow, which are of key policy relevance. Exploiting features of the roll out of SFpark, a smart-parking program for the city of San Francisco, we are able to estimate its effect upon public transit usage and traffic flow. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and a rich micro data-set on transit bus ridership along with data from SFpark, we find that SFpark led to a significant increase in bus ridership and a reduction in traffic flow. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the economic benefits resulting from avoided pollution and reduced congestion consequent to SFpark is larger than the approximate nominal costs of the program. Overall, our results suggest that smart-parking programs can help mitigate many traffic-related externalities, yielding significant economic benefits.}

The NG infrastructure, in fact, can act as a storage facility for green hydrogen produced from excess RES, also providing flexibility to the electric system. However, the unbalance of the networks and the raise of protection issues for consumers may occur as a consequence of the potential decay of the metrological performance of gas meters operating with natural gas and hydrogen blends. In this paper, the authors present the results of an experimental campaign aimed at analysing the effect of hydrogen blending on the accuracy of smart domestic gas meters. Experimental tests were performed in the laboratory using air, natural gas and gas-hydrogen blends up to 23%vol. The results show no criticalities occur for diaphragm and ultrasonic gas meters, regardless of the hydrogen content. On the other hand, thermal mass gas meters show good reliability when hydrogen blends are within 2%vol, whereas for higher hydrogen contents, reliability is demonstrated only when they are equipped with a specific new design routine capable to address the gas quality changes.}

Thus, to boost the transition from a traditional university campus to a sustainable and smart campus, this paper proposes an optimal siting and sizing study of photovoltaic systems and electric vehicle charging stations for a microgrid of a Brazilian university. This problem is formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming and is carried out in two stages. The first stage minimizes grid losses by locating and sizing photovoltaic panels, while the second stage minimizes the grid losses and maximizes the proximity of charging stations to the load centers by optimizing the place and sizing of charging stations. In addition, this work considers load uncertainty through the Monte Carlo method with a scenario reduction technique. The results estimate that photovoltaic systems can reduce 13.48% of the monthly electricity cost. The optimal charging station location is usually nearby the photovoltaic system siting or the substation. However, the increase in the number of chargers in buses with high consumption causes an increase of around 5% in grid losses. Furthermore, this paper discusses possible scenarios for photovoltaic systems and charging station installation based on the benefits of the transition to a sustainable and smart campus, considering Brazilian electricity sector policies.}

This paper contributes to the research on institutional logic diversity in three ways. First, we find that individuals use different strategies as interaction modes to achieve institutional logic convergence, but these strategies serve diverse purposes over time in a project. Second, when the organizational and individual goals in a project are balanced, this eases institutional logic convergence. Third, individuals can be facilitators of institutional logic convergence if they can unite diverse institutional logics and are perceived to have a central position in a project.}

abstract = {Management of safety, and barriers in particular, includes using information expressing performance, i.e. use of safety performance indicators. For this information to be useful, the indicators should demonstrate adequate quality. In other words, they should satisfy some predefined set of quality criteria. Without showing adequate quality, the indicators are generally unable to provide sufficient support for barrier management, which could result in poor decisions. In this article, the use of the SMART criteria is considered to assess the quality of safety performance indicators in process industries. SMART being an acronym for ‘specificity’, ‘measurability’ or ‘manageability’, ‘achievability’, ‘relevancy’ and ‘time-based’, covering five key aspects and criteria for assessing the quality of an indicator. A discussion on whether the indicators are able to demonstrate adequate quality by satisfying these criteria has been conducted. The finding is that all of the SMART criteria should be satisfied for a safety performance indicator to demonstrate acceptable quality and to be regarded as useful to support barrier management decision-making. However, it has also been observed that including the ‘M’ criterion in the assessment of quality is not needed. When all the other criteria are satisfied there is no way the conclusions could be misleading as a result of measurability or manageability aspects. Hence, for safety performance indicator quality, only four of the criteria are assessed and suggested for such situations to shorten the acronym to ‘STAR’. A key safety indicator used in downstream process facilities, i.e. ‘dangerous fluid overfilling events’, motivated from the 2005 Texas City refinery accident, is used to illustrate the situation. The indicator is also applied to another incident, the Buncefield oil storage depot's accident in 2005, to provide a broader context for using it. The findings in this article could also be applied beyond the context studied. This means that, despite focusing on safety indicators in the process industries, the findings are considered as relevant and applicable to other types of performance indicators and to other energy industries.}

It also shows that digitalization improves the total factor productivity of manufacturing enterprises by reducing transaction costs, facilitating servitization, and stimulating innovation investment. In addition, environmental regulation can force manufacturing enterprises to transform and improve their total factor productivity. However, the interaction between environmental regulation and digitalization has a significant negative impact on total factor productivity, implying that the paths of clean transformation and digitalization transformation is not coordinated.

Additionally, digital game-based learning (DGBL) activities have also been tried out in schools in recent years, as well as different mobile technologies, with the ambition to create smart learning. In this study, we aim to explore how school children’s collaborative interactions, while engaged in problem-solving activities using smart and mobile technology, unfolds. Drawing from a contextual perspective on learning, our study combines theoretical views on joint participation, affordances and sense of community in relation to collaborative interactions. Questions posed in this study are: (1) In what ways do children’s digital game design activities drive and/or support collaborative interactions while engaged in problem-solving activities? and (2) How are children’s digital game design ideas manifested during game design activities involving smart mobile technology? The study is based on a case where a creative workshop involving 22 Swedish third-grade children (9–10 years of age) participating in game design activities carried out in a pedagogical lab setting. By employing a thematic analysis, the results of the study show that the children deployed different orientations in their collaborative interactions, and that a sense of community emerged when the children worked on solving the problem of designing and producing a joint digital game idea, using mobile technology. On the basis of this, we argue that, when designing for educational activities involving smart mobile technology, it is pivotal to be aware of the pedagogical context, since this aspect of the design creates meaningful collaborative interactions; it is only then smart mobile technology becomes smart. These results have important implications for the methodological field of including smart mobile technology in learning situations.}

abstract = {The European strategy 20-20-20 – providing for energy efficiency increase, pollutant emissions reduction and fossil fuel consumption reduction – leads to an increasing attention on the concept of smart cities. In this scenario, it is important to consider a possible integration between networks and distributed generation systems – i.e. to realize a bidirectional energy flux at the utilities, giving rise to the so-called smart grid – not only for the electrical sector, but also for the thermal energy field. Therefore, the concept of smart grid could be extended to the heat sector in relation to District Heating Networks (DHNs) and considering thermal energy distributed generation systems, such as solar thermal panels or micro-Combined Heat and Power (micro-CHP) generators. In this study several different layouts for the utilities substations in smart DHNs will be presented and discussed. These layouts have been developed in order to allow the bidirectional exchange of thermal energy at the utilities, optimizing the thermal exchange as function of network design temperatures (for both the supply and the return), of utilities’ thermal power requirement and depending on the characteristics of the production system. Further, in this paper the results obtained from the simulations, carried out with the software Intelligent Heat Energy Network Analysis (I.H.E.N.A.) considering the implementation of the elaborated layouts, will be analyzed.}

Based on a natural skin-derived organohydrogel (SGC@MA-Gel) triboelectric nanogenerator, a bioresorbable, battery-free, and wireless smart wound treatment bioelectronic system for pharmacological treatment, nanogenerator-driven electrostimulation, and visual wound condition assessment was engineered in this study. The inherent hierarchical architecture and origins of natural skin, in tandem with the substantial loading capabilities of collagen-based biomaterials, endowed SGC@MA-Gel with favorable characteristics. These included mechanical and adhesive robustness, electrical conductivity, antibacterial properties, controlled on-demand drug release capabilities, and human physiological signal monitoring performance. The customizable bioelectronic system, developed in-house, employs a single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator, which facilitates skin wound healing via electrostimulation. Consequently, the system's biosensors can simultaneously measure glucose, uric acid, and pH at wound sites, thereby enabling accurate wound diagnosis and real-time assessment. This system accelerates cell proliferation and wound healing in vitro and in vivo, which validates its effectiveness in chronic wound treatment. The results demonstrated that the smart wound treatment bioelectronic system could provide a facile therapeutic strategy to assist with integrated wound monitoring, diagnosis, and therapy for hospitalized patients and those recovering at home.}

A fresh city profile of Jakarta is long overdue, given that there have been major events and developments since the turn of the millennium (the Asian Financial crisis and decentralisation in Indonesia, among the most important), as well as the fact that the city is a living entity with its own processes to be examined. The inhabitants of the city have also taken centre stage now in these urban processes, including the recent pandemic COVID-19 response. Our paper profiles Jakarta heuristically in two cuts: presenting the city from conventional and academic perspectives of megacities like it, which includes contending with its negative perceptions, and more originally, observing the city from below by paying attention to the viewpoints of citizens and practitioners of the city. In doing so, we draw from history, geography, anthropology, sociology and political science as well as from our experience as researchers who are based in the region and have witnessed the transformation of this megacity from within, with the idea that the portrayal of the city is a project permanently under construction.}

abstract = {Given the ongoing transition towards a more decentralised and adaptive energy system, the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts for the energy sector is being increasingly recognised. Due to their self-executing, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.}

abstract = {Reducing peak demand on the utility grid benefits both grid operators and consumers. However, achieving this goal while maintaining human comfort presents a significant challenge. This study proposes the deployment of an energy-efficient grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage (BES) system to perform peak shaving. We employ an optimal rule-based control strategy that considers day-ahead PV power and load demand predictions, along with a daily load profile limit, specifically designed for the C1 tariff in Malaysian Commercial Buildings. The peak shaving control strategy proactively determines optimal schedules for battery charging and discharging, aiming to effectively minimize peak demand. To regulate the daily demand accordingly, we employ a root-finding algorithm to determine the optimal demand limit in conjunction with the formulated rule-based peak-shaving control strategy. The required optimal inputs for the rule-based control strategy are determined using a genetic algorithm, which minimizes peak grid power. We verify the effectiveness of the rule-based peak-shaving method using MATLAB. The results demonstrate significant reductions in both energy consumption and peak demand for different load profiles. Specifically, we achieve a reduction of 19.02%, 20.9%, 4.72%, and 0% in energy consumption, and 42.46%, 49.82%, 40.44%, and 33.1% in peak demand for case studies (CS) 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that the application of the rule-based peak shaving method maintains a state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery at 50% by the end of the day, allowing for day-to-day management flexibility.}

The revolution in IoT technologies made homes more convenient, efficient and perhaps more secure. The need to advance smart home technology is necessary at this stage as IoT is abundantly used in automation industry. However, most of the proposed solutions are lacking in certain key areas of the system i.e., high interoperability, data independence, privacy, and optimization in general. The use of machine learning algorithms requires high-end hardware and are usually deployed on servers, where computation is convenient, but at the cost of bandwidth. However, more recently edge AI enabled systems are being proposed to shift the computation burden from the server side to the client side enabling smart devices. In this paper, we take advantage of the edge AI enabled technology to propose a fully featured cohesive system for smart home based on IoT and edge computing. The proposed system makes use of industry standards adopted for fog computing as well as providing robust responses from connected IoT sensors in a typical smart home. The proposed system employs edge devices as a computational platform in terms of reducing energy costs and provides security, while remotely controlling all appliances behind a secure gateway. A case study of human fall detection is evaluated by a custom lightweight deep neural network architecture implemented over the edge device of the proposed framework. The case study was validated using the Le2i dataset. During the training, the early stopping threshold was achieved with 98% accuracy for training set and 94% for validation set. The model size of the network was 6.4 MB which is significantly lower than other networks with similar performance.}

However, traditional evaluation of footprints for mega cities or urban agglomerations requires overmuch different types of high-quality data. There is a great need of seeking a smart model/approach with declined data requirements for evaluation of footprints where part of data can hardly be accessed. Here we propose a new ensemble inversion model (EIM) based on integrated multitask machine learning (MML) and multi-modeling stacking (MMS) algorithms for smart evaluation and prediction of water, carbon and ecological footprints. The accuracy and generalization capability of the model are illustrated through three largest urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR). The testing results show that the EIM achieves similar prediction performance compared to traditional footprints calculation methods (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.18, MAE = 0.11), yet greatly reduces the amount of required data by approximately 80%. Moreover, the accuracy of the EIM is improved by more than 20%, compared with other models using a single inversion algorithm. The modeling results also show that 1) water, carbon and ecological footprints are significantly positively correlated, and 2) an annual increase of 4.8% can be found in terms of the urban environmental pressure index (UEPI), and its projection is even less optimistic for the future.}

The South Korean government has implemented a national policy to establish smart farming communities; a concept that addresses the entire agri-food supply chain. In the U.S., a national plan to develop smart farming technologies does not exist. However, discrete smart farming solutions driven mainly by competition in the private sector have resulted in high-tech solutions that are advancing smart farming concepts. The differences in approaches and reporting of successes and failures between the two countries could facilitate the rate of evolution of successful smart farming solutions, and moreover, could provide pathways to facilitate sustainable development goals in developing countries where smart farming activities are currently underway.}

Recent understandings of smart cities suggest to put people at the core, by actively engaging citizens in co-creating innovative urban services. However, notwithstanding the benefits of participatory processes in urban governance are well-known, low receptiveness towards them is still widespread, which can largely hinder the effectiveness of smart city interventions. In this paper we present the experience of a Swiss city, where, against a past background of resistance to participatory processes, a “living” lab experiment was set for the co-creation of a behavior change app targeting a reduction in car-based traffic. Motivated by the opportunity to overcome limitations of such apps, the lab turned out to deliver wider benefits than initially expected. In fact, the concrete experience of new mobility behaviors stimulated by the app activated a collective learning process among lab participants. Discussions in the lab thus spontaneously scaled-up to far-reaching and potentially conflicting topics about future mobility scenarios. Furthermore, the protected space of the lab favored strengthening of reciprocal trust between citizens and policy-makers, opening-up possibilities for adoption of participatory practices also in future decision-making.}

This study, by means of a systematic literature review, analyzes the gap in research on urban theory on how epidemics are confronted. The term “cities” had 2,440,607 articles published and were identified 665 that presents the combination of the term “pandemic”. After the development of content analysis were identified 11 articles prior to 2019 and 10 articles published between January and June 2020, adhering to the objective of this investigation. Prior to 2019 studies addressed topics related to the construction of an urban structure aimed at reducing people's vulnerability to infectious diseases, starting in 2020, the focus of researchers' attention is on the use of information and communication technologies used as tools for prevention and control. Theories of the management of cities indicate the need to extrapolate the urban perimeter, incorporating the relations of dependence in cities with the other actors within the surroundings, especially in times of crisis. Studies have emphasized that cities are not isolated islands; rather, they are parts of a complex system with multiple exchanges. This thematic field of study enhances research that presents urban planning solutions by using data-driven management to consider conduct, parameters, and protocols relating to public health in moments of crisis.}

abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective non-invasive or minimally invasive treatment method against different tumors. Loading photosensitizers in nanocarriers can potentially increase their accumulation in tumor sites. However, the PDT efficacy may be hindered because of self-quenching of the encapsulated photosensitizer and the small diffusion radii of the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, light responsive nano assemblies composed of (Polyethylene glycol)-block-poly(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzylmethacrylate) (PEG-b-PNBMA) were designed and loaded with the photosensitizer, Rose Bengal lactone (RB), to act as a smart nanocarrier (RB-M) for the delivery of the photosensitizer. A wirelessly activated light-emitting diode (LED) implant was designed to programmatically induce the release of the loaded RB first, followed by activating PDT after diffusion of RB into the cytoplasm. The results showed that sequential '405-580 nm' irradiation of the RB-M treated 22RV1 cells resulted in the highest PDT outcome among different irradiation protocols. The combination of this smart nanocarrier and sequential '405-580 nm' irradiation strategy exhibited good PDT efficacy against 2D 22RV1 prostate cancer cells as well as 3D cancer cell spheroids. This platform overcomes the light penetration limitations in PDT, and can potentially be applied in cancer bearing patients who are unfit for chemotherapy.
Statement of significance
Nanocarriers for the delivery of photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy may result in relatively low therapeutic efficacy because of self-quenching of the encapsulated photosensitizer and the small diffusion radii of the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Light responsive smart nanocarriers can potentially overcome this challenge. In this study, a light responsive polymer (Polyethylene glycol)-block-poly(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzylmethacrylate) (PEG-b-PNBMA) was synthesized and utilized to fabricate the smart nanocarrier. A wirelessly activated light-emitting diode (LED) implant was designed for light delivery in deep tissue. This new approach permits wirelessly and programmatically control of photosensitizer release and PDT activation under deep tissue, thus significantly enhancing PDT efficacy against prostate cancer cells as well as 3D cancer cell spheroids. This design should have a significant impact on controllable PDT under deep tissue.}

abstract = {How do technology users effectively transit from having zero knowledge about a technology to making the best use of it after an authoritative technology adoption? This post-adoption user learning has received little research attention in technology management literature. In this paper we investigate user learning in authoritative technology adoption by developing an agent-based model using the case of council-led smart meter deployment in the UK City of Leeds. Energy consumers gain experience of using smart meters based on the learning curve in behavioural learning. With the agent-based model we carry out experiments to validate the model and test different energy interventions that local authorities can use to facilitate energy consumers' learning and maintain their continuous use of the technology. Our results show that the easier energy consumers become experienced, the more energy-efficient they are and the more energy saving they can achieve; encouraging energy consumers' contacts via various informational means can facilitate their learning; and developing and maintaining their positive attitude toward smart metering can enable them to use the technology continuously. Contributions and energy policy/intervention implications are discussed in this paper.}

Using the Internet of Things (IoT) and automated learning methods in homes, creating an intelligent environment can help identify stress-related emotions. An approach to stress detection based on metaheuristic fuzzy inference system-based learning (fMFiS-L) and emotion recognition is presented in this paper. Accordingly, our study focuses on the use of fusion learning to diagnose stress using the healthcare system and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for smart homes. Music videos were shown to participants in the first stage to arouse emotional states such as anger, anxiety, and depression. Volunteers were divided into two groups, with one group practicing Reiki meditation for two weeks. The EEG signals were recorded before and after meditation, stress levels were assessed using the Likert scale, and emotions were classified using the modified fusion fuzzy inference system. In addition, a method is presented for determining the optimal parameters in the fMFiS-L structure by optimizing the innovative gunner algorithm (AIG). We conclude that Reiki meditation can significantly reduce negative emotions and stress levels in the IoMT environment of smart homes. Furthermore, the fMFiS-L architecture was evaluated for generalization of emotion recognition based on unseen EEG data. Generally, the classification of emotions produced satisfactory results, with a 92% accuracy rate.}

abstract = {Sustainable and clean multi-energy systems have been hybrid coordinated in microgrid (MG) to fulfill regional multi-energy users economically, but shortages and surpluses still exist. The growth of win-win energy sharing between MGs attracts attention to smart information center (SIC) concept in MGs’ community, which facilitates sustainable solutions across three key objectives: lower carbon emission, sufficient utilization, and long-term cooperation. This paper designs a two-stage decision framework for day-ahead operations of SIC, where the first stage minimizes the total cost (i.e. operational cost and carbon emission cost) by the proposed multi-energy intra-scheduling and inter-sharing model (MIIM) and the second stage implements the smart cost-saving redistribution model (SCRM) to stimulate MGs in long-term joining of energy sharing. The extended alternating direction multipliers method algorithm (E-ADMM) is developed to protect the privacy of MGs' data while approximating the optimal solution of MIIM. The case study proves that a) demand response and energy sharing in MIIM result in cost savings of 2.01% for carbon emissions and 7.25% for total operations; b) renewable energy has been fully utilized and the total multi-energy loss has been avoided nearly 92.22% in MIIM; c) the asymmetric Nash bargaining approach fits the SCRM with incentive cooperation, whereby those who contribute more gain a higher share; d) the optimal gap of E-ADMM is less than 0.2% by iterated insensitive decision result from each MG, which computes in polynomial time when the scale of MG increases; e) the two-stage framework performs better with more heterogeneity of MGs. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights for guidance and models with worldwide generalization potential.}

abstract = {Action identification for smart home ecosystem has experienced a rising interest among relevant fields. Nevertheless, thoroughly understanding context and movement in video, which is the key component for an effective action identification system and a visual-based smart home ecosystem, remains a challenge. Recently, 3DCNN architectures including SlowFast, have proved to be the proper solution for this issue due to ability to filter spatiotemporal features in video. Additionally, the growth in Natural Language Processing, particularly BERT, has shown the potential of utilizing the Attention Mechanism for extracting temporal relationship of movement throughout a video. We introduce a novel fusing approach aiming to fully exploit the temporal relationship within spatiotemporal features produced by 3DCNN and enhance the efficiency of action identification system for smart home surveillance. The proposed method consists of two models: SlowFast with two distinct ResNet-50 backbones for spatiotemporal features extraction and BERT for aggregating temporal relationship. These models are sequentially stacked using two varieties of fusing techniques: early-ensemble and late-ensemble, constructing a robust unified system with the capability to compete against state-of-the-art modalities. This paper also contribute a new Kinetics51 dataset for our experiment on these mentioned models. The proposed method provides positively high top-1 accuracy for the following datasets: specifically, HMDB-51 dataset, which contains 51 variety of actions, achieves 78.05% using 10-crop testing; Kinetics51, our derived dataset from Kinetics400, achieves 82.53% using 10-crop testing. The performance on challenging action identification datasets HMDB51 and our Kinetics51 has shown the robustness of the mentioned fusing technique applied on two proposed models.}

In this work, we first devise a flexible triple-junction III-V solar cell embedded inside a smart dust module suitable for outdoor applications. These flexible solar cells are demonstrated to have a bending radius of over 5 cm and exhibit a conversion efficiency of around 25% under air mass 1.5G (1 sun) conditions. Under normal incidence of sunlight at the same conditions, our cell with its small active area of 0.4 cm2 can generate around 10.1 mW of electrical power. This is sufficient to meet the direct current power consumption (∼5.4 mW) requirements of our dust module, which includes a temperature/moisture sensor, a 3-axis linear accelerometer, and a Bluetooth chip. In comparison to a silicon-based flexible solar cell, our demonstrated III-V solar cell is smaller, requiring approximately 40% of the area to produce the same electrical power output. Our dust module is controlled using a self-developed Android application installed on a smartphone and can sustain continuous-wave operation for data collection and wireless transmission even when the incident angle of the sunlight reaches 75°. Pulse-mode operation is still possible even in the case of nearly 90° illuminations (for example, at sunset). Overall, the measurement results for this flexible solar cell are promising, allowing for further reduction in the size of a self-sustaining smart dust module with improved reliability. These advantages could facilitate development of the next generation of energy saving smart electric grids.}

Two different technologies comprising heat pump (HP) and heat-only boiler (HOB) are investigated to retrieve waste heat from a data centre and LuxTurrim5G smart poles to use in a low-temperature district heating network. We investigate various scenarios to supply the required energy for the HP (which receives electricity from the electricity market, photovoltaic (PV) system, wind turbine (WT) and hybrid PV/WT; 4 scenarios) and HOB (which works with electricity, forest fuel wood, biogas, ammonia, wood pellets and industry wood residue; 6 scenarios). We found that the heat pump scenario is an efficient and cost-effective way to retrieve waste heat from the data centre and 5G smart poles with an LCOE of 3.192 ¢/kWh if electricity is produced by the PV system, and 3.516 ¢/kWh when the heat pump receives its electricity only from the electricity market.}

The accuracy and time it takes for different search engines to retrieve information from a cloud computing repository around the world, varies. However, it has been discovered in the literature that webpage ranking reduces the amount of time a user spends surfing, which saves a significant amount of energy during computation and transmission across the network. The hyperlink structure of the web graph is used in most of the earlier solutions documented in the literature, which consumes a lot of energy during calculation. It may exacerbate the link leakage problem by increasing the frequency of spam pages. In light of the energy consumption of various smart gadgets, hyperlink structure alone is no longer sufficient for predicting webpage relevance. Its true importance is revealed by user surfing activity. To improve search engine accuracy and speed, it is critical to demote spam pages, lowering energy consumption. Among all the existing ranking algorithms in the literature, one of the important components is the PageRank algorithm used by Google’s ranking module. Keeping focus on these points, in this paper, various page ranking algorithms based upon supervised learning are surveyed and summarized with respect to different selected parameters and experiments performed. Using this information, a detailed taxonomy of search engine results is presented in the text. Moreover, PageRank algorithms are explored by using different supervised learning techniques applied in the existing proposals for getting and processing the results. In the nutshell, the PageRank methodology is surveyed with respect to web spam detection which is the demand of cognitive systems in smart cities.}

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an emerging concept, which pursues the synthesis of higher crop productivity, lower carbon emissions, and improved soil resilience to the climate change. However, few studies have been done to evaluate the productivity and environmental consequences following the CSA of maize production. Herein, the effects of CSA practice on maize yield, nitrogen use efficiency (partial factor productivity, PFPN), soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and carbon footprint (CF) were evaluated based on a nine-year in-situ field experiment in northeastern China. The experiment followed a randomized block design with three treatments including in traditional farmers’ practices (FM), optimized agronomic practices (OPT, aiming to high grain yield and PFPN), and climate-smart agriculture practices (CSA, aiming to higher grain yield, PFPN, SOC stock, while lower CF). Compared with FM, OPT and CSA practices significantly increased grain yield and PFPN by 25.0%− 30.1% and 92.2%− 100.2% on average of experimental duration, respectively. CSA practice had significant higher global warming potential (GWP) but equivalent global warming potential intensity (GWPI) than these of FM and OPT practices during 2016 and 2017. Meanwhile, CSA practice also achieved the highest SOC sequestration in 0–40 cm soil depth compared to other treatments. Consequently, CF per hectare (CFa) of CSA significantly decreased by 41.4% on average than that of FM mainly due to higher SOC sequestration. Concerning the profit of cropping system, CSA had the highest net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) of 2090.62 $ ha−1 among the treatments. Overall, CSA practice showed advantages in promoting maize yield while reducing carbon footprint by integrated agronomic management (e.g. dense planting, subsoiling tillage, manure amendments, nitrogen fertilizer optimization, and so on), which could be regarded as a promising practice towards food security and carbon emission mitigation.}

The task of anomaly detection is made difficult by the presence of complex environments and varying perspectives, even in diverse situations. Furthermore, the lack of labeled data in this field presents additional challenges. In this article, we present a robust pyramidal frame prediction architecture coupled with an efficient anomaly detection mechanism. The foundation of the frame prediction module rests upon a combination of localized predictors, incorporating bidirectional sampling techniques and a proficient discriminator-sharing mechanism. For the purpose of anomaly detection, an innovative loss function is employed, tailored to accommodate multi-instance learning scenarios. Departing from the conventional treatment of anomalies as a binary classification problem, we adopt a regression-oriented approach, thereby enabling a nuanced understanding of disruptive occurrences at a granular level, whilst facilitating an assessment of the severity associated with anomalous events. The amalgamation of these dual modules culminates in a distinctive and robust framework adept at comprehending anomalies within intricate scenarios. Empirical assessments conducted across benchmark datasets within this domain serve to underscore the efficacy of the proposed architectural paradigm across a spectrum of environments.}

By combining the data into centralized storage to develop a reliable learning model, there are concerns with privacy, ownership, and strict rules. It is self-evident that the samples in the typical machine learning centralized server paradigm have vastly different probability distributions of data supplied by each user. As a result, the typical model needs to be personalized for critical medical applications, and the deployment needs an efficient mechanism that can adapt to varying user inputs. Due to the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of critical medical IoT applications in such Edge/Fog scenarios, the privacy of patients become a crucial problem. Federated Learning, the model trained on diversity helps in addressing these concerns when used. This paper proposes the integration of Federated Learning for distributed Edge–Fog–Cloud architecture in the IoT smart healthcare sector. This paper presents FedSDM, the Federated Learning-based Smart Decision Making framework for the ECG data in microservice-based IoT medical applications. This proposal makes use of the advantages of Edge/Fog computing for real-time critical applications. It deploys the Federated Learning model at the Edge, Fog, and Cloud layers for performance comparison. The parameters considered for performance evaluation are energy consumption, network usage, cost, execution time, and latency. The proposed method shows that Edge-based deployment outperforms Fog and Cloud in terms of energy consumption, network usage, cost, execution time, and latency (i.e.) 0.3%, 2%, 15%, 11%, and 3% when compared with Fog and 1.6%, 31%, 41%, 24 % and 85% against Cloud respectively.}

Since the change trend of outflow COD is highly related to operation status, this paper innovatively uses different types of temperature and water inflow data as model inputs and applies three algorithms to make prediction, which are Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The experimental results show that GRU model performs better (MAPE = 10.18%, RMSE = 35.67, MAE = 31.16) than LSTM and SVR. This study can be extended to various sewage treatment scenarios in sustainable cities.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.}

A key finding of this study is that different institutions have largely affected smart governance strategies, arrangements and outcomes. Smart governance is tightly linked with e-governance and e-democracy in some Western countries, while it officially emphasizes smart management and service in China. A common aspect is that the increasing use of social media, smartphones, portals, crowdsourcing platforms, and planning support systems have generally promoted smart governments and services, e-participation, and wider collaboration through both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

However, as IoT networks grow, so does the potential for cyber threats and attacks. In an IoT-based application infrastructure, devices are linked to sensors that connect to big network servers, leaving them exposed to malicious attacks and threats. The current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not capable to process massive data coming from IoT devices and works only for known intrusion. For such type of smart systems, a smart ML/AI-based IDS system is required that helps process massive data and detect unknown intrusion too. In this paper, we investigate important features from the intrusion dataset which can help to classify malicious activity to develop an efficient smart model. As it is important to understand the dataset well before using it for training any ML/AI classifier model, our goal of this paper is to give a comprehensive view of the popular NSL KDD dataset for finding the best features for developing a robust ML/AI-based IDS for IoT security. Furthermore, this study provides an overview of the most and least used features so that the best feature selection method can be applied in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in an IoT environment.}

Here, we are interested in grappling with the current ‘place’ of smart cities in the context of what seems to be an emerging platform urbanism, thereby highlighting a complex platform-based ecosystem encompassing private and public organisations and citizens. Our point of departure is the operationalization of three intertwined trends associated with the conceptualizations of participation, mediatisation and (multi-sided) platformisation. Through the examination of (social) traffic and navigation application, Waze, we explore manifestations of (contested) dynamics in mobility practices occurring between commerce and community in the public space of the city. The preliminary findings point to the emergence of new socio-spatial constructs which afford a better frame of ‘what is going on’, challenging the smart city framework as a planning and development paradigm. In putting forward the notion of public value and ownership, it is our aim to prompt a critical debate about platform urbanism made explicit by a driving politics that offers a window to a future driving world, urging cities and governments to anticipate and mitigate (un)intended consequences.}

However, the concept is still considered in need of more in-depth explanations for understanding and making sense of the notion. The contribution of the concept of smart tourism destinations to managerially relevant knowledge is particularly difficult to assess due to its complexity. Therefore, a qualitative text analysis of stakeholder interviews is proposed and conducted using the GABEK® methodology to identify recurring themes in the stakeholders' understanding of smart tourism destinations. The GABEK® methodology aims to represent the texts of open interviews as networks of interrelated keywords to make sense of a complex phenomenon. This study explores how destination stakeholders from two different Swedish destinations make sense of the concept of smart tourism destinations. Study findings show that, from the destination stakeholders' point of view, there is a need to counterbalance the currently dominant focus on technology with softer though more existential values to construct a sustainable path of destination development. As for the theoretical contribution, this study clarifies properties of smart tourism destinations and stakeholders’ sense-making of the concept of smart tourism destination.}

abstract = {Due to the huge energy consumption of traditional cooling- and heating-based electricity, passive radiative cooling and solar heating with a minimum carbon footprint using the outer space and Sun as natural thermodynamic resources have attracted much attention. However, most passive devices are static and monofunctional, and cannot meet the practical requirements of dynamic cooling and heating under various conditions. Here, we demonstrate a smart thermal-gated (STG) bilayer membrane that enables fully automatic and temperature-adaptive radiative cooling and solar heating. Specifically, this device can switch from reflective to absorptive (white to black) in the solar wavelength with the reduction in optical scattering upon ambient temperature, corresponding to a sunlight reflectivity change from 0.962 to 0.059 when the temperature drops below ∼30 °C, whereas its mid-infrared emissivity remains at ∼0.95. Consequently, this STG membrane achieves a temperature of ∼5 °C below ambient (a key signature of radiative cooling) under direct sunlight (peak solar irradiance >900 W m−2) in summer and a solar heating power of ∼550 W m−2 in winter. Theoretical analysis reveals the substantial advantage of this switchable cooling/heating device in potential energy saving compared with cooling-only and heating-only strategies when widely used in different climates. It is expected that this work will pave a new pathway for designing temperature-adaptive devices with zero energy consumption and provide an innovative way to achieve sustainable energy.}

I offer a case study based on newspaper articles and legislative sessions that outline user opposition to a smart meter policy in Chile between March and August 2019. The results show the importance of being transparent about technical features and offering opportunities for users to participate in discussions as part of the process of introducing smart meters. The case also highlights the tangibility of meters -the essential requirement that users must allow these devices to be placed inside of their homes- as enacting political agency. Although it cannot be assumed that users will become actively involved in decisions once smart meters are installed, future studies should explore whether energy democracy can be experienced by users through these apparatuses on a more permanent basis.}

Based on survey data and the partial least square structural equation modeling approach, we found that the intention to use smart grid technologies is significantly affected by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (positive), respectively by perceived risk (negative). Moreover, we advance the existing theory by showing that perceived risk determines perceived usefulness and not the other way around. Further exogenous influences are identified for each core determinant: compatibility and understanding affect ease of use; understanding, power supply reliability and electricity rate saving affect usefulness; risk is determined by cyber insecurity and fear of electromagnetic radiation. Only environmental concerns do not appear to play a significant role in shaping the perceived use of smart grid technologies. The paper discusses the implications of these findings, both as refining the theory and as providing policy recommendations.}

Smart grid is one such application that helps monitor, control, and make efficient use of power in a smart city. However, due to the interconnected nature of the smart grid with other technologies, it becomes a challenge to design a fully optimized wireless sensor network (WSN) for smart grid. Wireless sensors and actuators are major components in smart grid. These sensing devices are used for real-time detection and monitoring of smart grid operations. One important role of WSN is real-time identification of outages in the smart grid based power system. An efficient deployment and optimized operational framework is required for WSN in smart grid to reduce the cost, increase reliability, security, and smooth working of the next generation power systems/networks. In this chapter, we present the optimization classification of WSNs for smart grids with respect to different types of renewable energy sources, different modes of operations, types of optimization, and different geographical areas. We present a general optimization framework for WSN in smart grid and will specify different possibilities for input, output, objective function, and constraints. In addition, we investigate different objectives used in defining the optimization problems. We also present different types of linear and nonlinear optimization algorithms used to solve these types of optimization problems in WSN-assisted smart-grid applications. Finally, we will discuss future directions and research challenges related to WSNs for smart grid applications.}

Multifunctional pavement is a new paradigm that enhances pavement functionalities, durability, and serviceability for intelligent transport system. Cement-asphalt composite possesses significant attributes, including self-healing, self-sensing, photocatalytic, and thermochromic capacities, which collectively contribute to the multifunctionalities of these pavements. The self-healing property plays a vital role in extending the service life of pavement and enhancing its durability. At the same time, self-sensing concrete, a concept widely explored for structural health monitoring, finds its applications. The photocatalytic feature aids in reducing pollution stemming from vehicle emissions, while the thermochromic capacity allows for temperature detection in asphalt concrete pavements. Previous research has mainly concentrated on the discrete attributes and performance of these functionalities within cement-asphalt composite. Achieving these multifunctional capabilities involves the incorporation of diverse carbon nanomaterials into cement-asphalt composite, such as carbon black (CB), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene nanoplates (GNPs), and so on. Notably, there is an increasing focus on integrating these functionalities within pavements themselves. Functional concrete has been effectively deployed within smart transport system, encompassing pavements, railways, bridges, and tunnels, for the purposes of infrastructure health monitoring and traffic-flow management. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in multifunctional technologies, highlighting potential applications across novel domains. The insights will serve as a valuable resource for future investigations into multifunctional pavements and their integration into intelligent transport systems.}

This makes them promising candidates for sensing elements, especially in a biomedical context due to their easily achievable biocompatibility. The main challenge in harnessing the smart polymer’s potential for sensor applications lies in a reliable transduction of the swelling change into an electrical signal. A novel platform approach is based on a bending sensor where the smart hydrogel acts as an actuator on a thin film with embedded metal traces. Mechanical deformation due to the hydrogel volume change alters the traces’ electric impedance. However, besides deformation, the medium surrounding the sensor structure will also affect the impedance. For sensor design it is therefore crucial to understand the complex interdependencies between electric sensor properties, influences of the surrounding medium and mechanical deformation. Here, an electric circuit model is presented which considers all these contributions through a minimum number of lumped elements and is strictly based on physical considerations. By employing measured impedance spectra from an experimental sensor implementation subjected to different surrounding media and mechanical deformation, the validity of the simplified model is demonstrated. A detailed analysis and discussion give insights into the determination of the different model parameters and how external influences can clearly be attributed to specific circuit elements. This work provides a general approach for deducing minimalistic but strictly physics-based circuit models which can still adequately replicate the actual behavior of such types of impedance-based bending sensors.}

abstract = {The next-generation systems are expected to be largely cyber–physical systems (CPSs) that autonomously control physical processes, through sensors and actuators typically in real-time feedback and cooperative control loops distributed among physical and cyber environments. The rapid technological advancements enhance the smartness of these CPSs, pushing their boundaries of performance and efficiency by embedding new information and communication technologies. However, to what extent CPSs should be smarter so that they do not compromise safety and security of safety critical systems? is an open research question. Towards this goal, the purpose of this study is to establish a grounded theory to analyse what makes these systems smart? and eventually, how to find a balance between smartness and safety risks? In this precinct, this article aims to develop a conceptual framework, define the dimensions and derive the characteristics that make CPSs smart. The proposed approach combines an automated informetric and systematic analysis of literature pertinent to the topic of smartness across anthropology, science, engineering and technology. The analysis of a case study building and the discussions presented herein support the connection between the existing understanding of CPSs and smartness offered by the building design approach in urban environment.}

This paper aims to design two type-2 fuzzy logic controllers in the demand-side energy management system. For this purpose, a combination of renewable energy sources, such as fuel cells, photovoltaic solar panels, vertical axis wind turbines with a helical savonius rotor, and an electric vehicle and energy storage system along with an external grid are utilized to supply the electricity usage of home appliances in a smart home. By using the proposed method, higher quality, more economical, and environmentally friendly energy can be accomplished. To this end, the outputs of the proposed controllers are defined to make appropriate decisions about the generated energy, how to supply energy for own consumption, and controllable loads. The number and distribution of membership functions of type-2 fuzzy logic controllers are selected according to the measured real input data over a year in Tehran, Iran. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method it is simulated by MATLAB/Simulink software, which indicates that the proposed system causes the smart home to receive 49.186 kWh less electricity energy from the grid to supply daily power for home appliances and therefore can weekly consume approximately 343.95 kWh less electricity energy from the grid. it is shown that after applying the proposed strategy, electricity costs were reduced by 71.5%, and the peak-to-average ratio was reduced by 64.6%.}

In this era of increased consumer awareness and preference for organic food, the challenge lies in making informed choices amidst various crop production options. To address this, the present research introduces a groundbreaking study that utilizes blockchain technology to record and trace information on crop production from seeds to end-user consumption, enabling easy consumer choices. This study introduces a model that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to monitor the impact of selected chemicals and nutrients used in agriculture to enhance production yields. To ensure sustainability, the study employs the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol, which optimizes energy consumption and network stability, thereby avoiding disruptions. Results indicate that different fertilizers affect soil physical properties such as temperature and moisture. These parameters are monitored using the Agriculture Vercel App, equipped with temperature, moisture, and light sensors in agricultural fields. The app provided threshold readings via alert notifications, revealing significant fluctuations in temperature (12%–43%) and moisture (83%–41%) concentrations upon the application of specific fertilizers like “Agricultural lime” and “Calcium Ammonium Nitrate.” Our IoT-based model is linked with private blockchain technology to prioritize consumer choice and facilitate transparency. This integration enhances food security while mitigating environmental degradation risks. By providing a comprehensive record of crop production practices, our model empowers consumers to make informed decisions aligned with their health and environmental concerns. This research demonstrates the potential of combining IoT and blockchain technologies to revolutionize agriculture, ensure sustainable practices, and promote food security. The findings offer significant implications for policymakers, farmers, and consumers, fostering a more sustainable and health-conscious approach to agriculture worldwide.}

It is based on developing adaptive external walls in order to adopt dynamic responses to external climate conditions, by controlling and adjusting the absorption and reflection of solar radiation. A numerical model is developed to simulate the thermal behavior of five wall configurations including passive techniques, namely an optically intelligent thin film of tungsten doped with VO2, a mono or double layer of Phase Change Materials. Numerical simulations are performed for different climate conditions during the summer and winter seasons. Additionally, a comparison analysis is carried out to compare climate conditions in seven cities: Marrakech, Dubai, Nice, London, Tianjin, Mexico City and Ottawa. In the summer season, the results show that using W-doped VO2 can reduce the indoor surface temperature, while in the winter season, this solution does not significantly influence the indoor temperature when compared to a reference case, where the climates have a shallow outdoor temperature, and the thermochromic material behaves as a transparent semiconductor to heat. In addition, the results show that a configuration that includes two Phase Change Materials with different melting temperatures can minimize the effects of external climate conditions during the summer and winter seasons. According to our analysis, this configuration has the best performance and can achieve better thermal comfort in buildings when compared to other existing configurations. The proposed configuration also achieves a significant phase shift and a lower dampening factor than the different studied configurations in respect to thermal optimization.}

Things in smart cities are intractable via the Internet. These things are naturally deployed in a distributed environment wirelessly. They become vulnerable to the diverse security attacks that can adversely influence their proper functionalities at any time. The stated problem severity even becomes higher when they are deployed in smart cities. In addition, it is very likely to compromise data while transferring from one source to another until reaching the destination during data routing. Existing Routing Protocols for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) are considered lightweight and secure routing protocols for IoT devices, which offer a slight safeguard against innumerable forms of RPL routing attacks. Based on the nature of the IoT network, being resource constraints, the conventional routing techniques do not suit them at all. The IoT routing security is therefore, a challenging task. This review aims to elaborate on the current research literature, opportunities and research gaps of secure RPL routing protocols.

This paper takes advantage of the large-scale smart meter data to investigate the electricity consumption inequality and adaptation vulnerability issues. We find that there is a serious inequality underestimation issue arising from annual aggregate data. An average of 8.39% of the inequality is hidden every quarter, while the monthly hidden value reached 13.41% due to the seasonal offset effects. This inequality is the robust nonlinear inverted-N shaped relationship with temperature, which implies that the cold temperatures have a more severe impact on social inequality issues than hot. For cold days, one additional day in the range < 30 °F would result in an increase of 3.05% electricity consumption inequality. We also find households in high inequality cities have worse response ability when facing extreme temperature, indicating poor will suffer more from extreme temperature exposure. Policies to address climate-induced inequality issues would be more efficient if more attention be paid to the poor in cold winter.}

A micro smart grid (MSG), which includes a solar cell, a wind turbine, a diesel generator, and battery storage system capable of trading energy with the smart gride (SG), connected to smart buildings with different types of loads is modelled. Different types of intelligent fuzzy controllers for distributed management were proposed and optimized via the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII), which is a multi-objective optimization method. Maximum user comfort, the amount of renewable energy employment, minimum total power consumption cost, total energy consumption at peak time, and MSG loss of power supply probability are the five objective functions of the optimization process. Various uncertainties of the real world have also been considered. The most crucial distinguishing feature of this proposed method is the design of controllers to manage the demand and supply of electricity without the need for daily optimization. Comparison experiments with other methods presented in the field of electricity supply and demand management are conducted to show the superiority of this method in terms of optimality of the results, low processing volume required to implement real controllers, and its resilience to changing conditions.}

A technology breakout such as Smart Farming, is lacking of feedback and network interactions, so Networking is crucial for knowledge accumulation and systems’ integration, thus, it embeds interaction between different elements, enhances feedback loops between them, integrates Research & Development and improves marketing practices. Rural development requires the insights of several established disciplines and needs to be connected to politics in order to achieve successful results, so this approach was applied. Moreover, if the goal is Sustainability, the interdisciplinarity of the involved scientists should assist policy decisions and be of use for Rural Strategic Planning. The equipment suppliers' participation in the planning of rural strategies should be explored due to the fact that the communication between them and policy makers does not always occur and their interests could conflict. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted among three groups of stakeholders- researchers, politicians and professionals in Greece; in order to explore the importance of implementing Smart Farming Technologies aiming at Sustainable Rural Development. Thematic and Content Analysis were applied. Then a Quantitative Analysis was performed in order to evaluate the stakeholders’ disagreement or consistency on their preferences in research orientation of SFTs’. The results not only indicated the challenges rural areas face in relation to the adoption of SFT, such as lack of strategic planning and necessary infrastructures, but also revealed the main reasons for underdevelopment and environmental degradation in Greece. Finally, the gap in communication and feedback between the stakeholders was confirmed. The results can be used by policy makers to customize their interventions based on the stakeholders’ priorities.}

Smart tourism advocates claim that technologically-driven innovations can help DMOs to optimise tourism development by addressing issues such as carrying capacity, stakeholder management and community involvement. This study enhances the understanding of smart tourism governance (SG), showing how contextual factors affect DMO perspectives of SG. A mixed-methods approach was used to investigate heritage tourism destinations in the United Kingdom. The results demonstrate that well-established DMOs do not perceive SG as potentially beneficial, as they already perform well in many areas in which SG promises improvements, such as citizen engagement, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement. Despite this, this research highlights the aspects of SG that these destinations can take advantage of as social inclusion, environmental performance and the provision of citizen-centric services. All of these can help heritage tourism destinations to optimise their tourism development. This research additionally demonstrates the effect of contextual factors, such as the level of public-sector support for tourism and the growing influence of non-tourism stakeholders in destination management, on DMO perceptions of SG and makes recommendations for how developments in the use of SG by DMOs can be made, in light of these.}

Therefore, analyzing load profiles, it is crucial to know how hourly consumption varies during summers, winters, weekdays, and weekends. In addition, determining the influence of occupancy, dwelling size, and building topologies on consumption is equally important to build predictive models. Therefore, this paper presents detailed research on the electricity consumption and profiles of the residential sector in Dubai based on the dwellings’ characteristics and 15-minute resolution smart meter data. The data utilized includes the cooling systems, the number of occupants, and the physical characteristics of a dwelling, such as its typology, sizes, and number of bedrooms. First, using the K-Means clustering method, the authors grouped the households based on their consumption profiles. Second, the consumption patterns of each group of households were identified and organized based on similar consumption profiles over 24 h. Third, the authors applied several classification algorithms to assess the potential of using dwellings and occupants’ characteristics to predict the patterns with which each household is associated. The analysis of consumption patterns showed that 43% of households with cooling included in their bills had the global peak demand at midnight during weekdays and weekends in summer. However, the global peak demand for cooling-excluded households occurs from 7:00 to 10:00 pm on weekdays and, in some specific cases, on the weekends, as early as 10:00 am. Finally, the methods used for classification were able to identify key characteristics driving the patterns of electricity demand and were well suited to this predictive modeling context.}

Waste business processes consist of mixed-collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment, and chained-disposal. The design of the proposed waste management system presents circular economy processes that can separate municipal waste, identify waste characteristics, and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Internet of Thing (IoT) as the integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG’s) such as Good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13). The study proposes a new design of smart and sustainable waste management which could achieve satisfactory economic, social, and environmental waste management performances.}

abstract = {One of the key elements affecting the efficiency of maritime transport is the design of ports, including traditional facilities and smart port designs with automated machinery. Governments are committed to transforming their ports into smart ports because of the potential benefits, such as more efficient operation from information and communication technologies and the internet of things. A smart port can also save energy and manage environmental impacts to achieve sustainable development. This research investigates how smart port design can influence the efficiency of maritime transport with a three-step DEA-Tobit modeling procedure. First, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to evaluate port operating performance. Second, to investigate the influence of smart port design, three smart port aspects are identified: automation, environment and intelligence. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the importance of each aspect. Finally, a Tobit regression modeling approach is constructed to evaluate how the weighted smart port aspects influence operating efficiency. This study uses the top 20 maritime ports based on their throughputs as the case study. Model results show the various influence of the three aspects. Pollution control from the environment aspect has the largest positive impact on port efficiency. On the contrary, information sharing from the intelligence aspect has a negative impact on efficiency which might be due to technology requirements, information overload and information process complexity. This study defines the smart port concepts that are integrated into port performance evaluation process. Model results confirm not all the design elements bring positive impacts. This is also the main contribution of this study that proposed an integrated measurement structure to investigate the influence and impact of the smart port concept. Finally, this study concludes with policy implications to prioritize smart aspects and indicators for policy makers and operators to help develop smart ports.}

abstract = {Service area analysis is crucial for determining the accessibility of public facilities in smart cities. However, the acquisition of service areas using conventional approaches has been limited. First, investigating traffic flow is difficult, as this factor varies significantly over time and space. Second, obtaining service areas of mobile facilities/targets has remained a challenge owing to a lack of data and methods. To address these problems, this study proposes an efficient big-data-driven approach that utilizes large-scale taxi GPS location data collected over two years within Seoul City and distributed computation to obtain the average travel time values on fine-grained grid cells of 100 m × 100 m resolution. On-the-fly visualization methods were then established with an ability to construct isochrone maps of service areas in near-real-time. This enabled performing accurate service area analysis of mobile facilities/targets dynamically. The proposed solution can be effectively used in various applications, such as optimizing the ride-sharing services or the routes of autonomous electric vehicles in future smart cities, as demonstrated in this study.}

abstract = {The current trend indicates that energy demand and supply will eventually be controlled by autonomous software that optimizes decision-making and energy distribution operations. New state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technologies are integral in optimizing decision-making in energy distribution networks and systems. This study was conducted on data-driven probabilistic ML techniques and their real-time applications to smart energy systems and networks to highlight the urgency of this area of research. This study focused on two key areas: i) the use of ML in core energy technologies and ii) the use cases of ML for energy distribution utilities. The core energy technologies include the use of ML in advanced energy materials, energy systems and storage devices, energy efficiency, smart energy material manufacturing in the smart grid paradigm, strategic energy planning, integration of renewable energy, and big data analytics in the smart grid environment. The investigated ML area in energy distribution systems includes energy consumption and price forecasting, the merit order of energy price forecasting, and the consumer lifetime value. Cybersecurity topics for power delivery and utilization, grid edge systems and distributed energy resources, power transmission, and distribution systems are also briefly studied. The primary goal of this work was to identify common issues useful in future studies on ML for smooth energy distribution operations. This study was concluded with many energy perspectives on significant opportunities and challenges. It is noted that if the smart ML automation is used in its targeting energy systems, the utility sector and energy industry could potentially save from $237 billion up to $813 billion.}

abstract = {IoT infrastructures have been growing in recent years across a variety of industrial applications in sustainable smart cities and communities, including smart manufacturing and smart industries. Infrastructure geared towards Internet of Things also includes Cyber-Physical System (CPS). With a distributed environment, CPS has experienced significant success in industrial applications and critical infrastructure. However, there are numerous difficulties in such an environment, including those related to scalability, centralization, communication latency, and security and privacy. Deep residual squeeze and excitation network (DRSEN) with Single Candidate Optimizer-based IoT-oriented infrastructure is used in this manuscript to address these challenges. Blockchain creates a distributed environment for CPS's communication phase, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) establishes protocols for data forwarding in network. At the application layer of suggested infrastructure, a deep learning-based cloud is used to address communication latency, centralization, and scalability issues. It makes high-performance, affordable computing resources available for smart city applications like smart industrial and smart transportation. The proposed method is implemented in ns-3 tool and the effectiveness is assessed using F-measure, reliability, scalability, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The proposed method provides 35.39%, 23.87% and 20.67% higher reliability, 42.39%, 11.39%, 34.16% and 25.78% higher accuracy, 15.02%, 26.64% and 37.55% higher F-measure compared with existing techniques like Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain Secure Device Authentication Solution (IIoT-BC-BASA), Industrial Internet of things based on Blockchain- InterPlanetary File System (IIoT-BC-IPFS), Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain- Shamir Threshold Cryptography (IIoT-BC-SHC), Industrial Internet of Things based on Blockchain- software Define Networking (IIoT-BC-SDN) methods, respectively.}
