abstract = {Big data collection practices using Internet of Things (IoT) pervasive technologies are often privacy-intrusive and result in surveillance, profiling, and discriminatory actions over citizens that in turn undermine the participation of citizens to the development of sustainable smart cities. Nevertheless, real-time data analytics and aggregate information from IoT devices open up tremendous opportunities for managing and regulating smart city infrastructures in a more efficient and sustainable way. The privacy-enhancing aggregation of distributed sensor data, such as residential energy consumption or traffic information, is the research focus and challenge tackled in this paper. Citizens have the option to choose their privacy level by reducing the quality of the shared data at a cost of a lower accuracy in data analytics services. A baseline scenario is considered in which IoT sensor data are shared directly with an untrustworthy central aggregator. A grouping mechanism is introduced that improves privacy by sharing data aggregated first at a group level compared to a baseline scenario in which each individual shares data directly to the central aggregator. Group-level aggregation obfuscates sensor data of individuals, in a similar fashion as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption schemes, thus inference of privacy-sensitive information from single sensors becomes computationally harder compared to the baseline scenario. The proposed system and its generic applicability are evaluated using real-world data from two smart city pilot projects. Privacy under grouping increases, while preserving the accuracy of the baseline scenario. Intra-group influences of privacy by one group member on the other ones are measured and fairness on privacy is found to be maximized between group members with similar privacy choices. Several grouping strategies are compared. Grouping by proximity of privacy choices provides the highest privacy gains. The implications of the strategy on the design of incentives mechanisms are discussed.}

abstract = {Deterministic Synchronous Multichannel Extension (DSME) and Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) are two emerging MAC behaviors that are based on IEEE 802.15.4 and permit the deployment of wireless sensor devices in a variety of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. While TSCH focuses on multi-channel hopping and fixed-size TDMA timeslots, DSME primarily addresses the drawbacks of the legacy IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, including the best use of the Guaranteed Time Slots (GTSs) and the application of channel diversity techniques. However, the existing literature lack the robustness for an ideal IIoT setup. In this regard, our suggested i-DSME MAC offers the best Quality of Service (QoS), incorporating an effective sensor prioritization strategy and suitable channel assessment techniques. The associated QoS constraints of the sensor devices are also considered by i-DSME in its core methodology, which is not explored adequately in the existing literature. To demonstrate the compatibility of i-DSME’s adaptability with the body of existing literature, we run thorough simulations of it. The results demonstrate that, on average, the proposed MAC protocol is more efficient than the benchmarks in terms of goodput (>39.82%), reliability (>12.50%), packet drop rate (>19.69%), and delay (>54.37%).}

abstract = {Since Smart Cyber–Physical Systems (sCPS) are complex and decentralized systems of dynamically cooperating components, architecture-based adaptation is of high importance in their design. In this context, a key challenge is that they typically operate in uncertain environments. Thus, an inherent requirement in sCPS design is the need to deal with the uncertainty of data coming from the environment. Existing approaches often rely on the fact that an adequate model of the environment and/or base probabilities or a prior distribution of data are available. In this paper, we present a specific logic (CB logic), which, based on statistical testing, allows specifying transition guards in architecture-based adaptation without requiring knowledge of the base probabilities or prior knowledge about the data distribution. Applicable in state machines’ transition guards in general, CB logic provides a number of operators over time series that simplify the filtering, resampling, and statistics-backed comparisons of time series, making the application of multiple statistical procedures easy for non-experts. The viability of our approach is illustrated on a running example and a case study demonstrating how CB logic simplifies adaptation triggers. Moreover, a library with a Java and C ++ implementation of CB logic’s key operators is available on GitHub.}

abstract = {The services provided in smart cities are dependent upon the seamless connectivity and communication services for the users and the Internet of Things (IoT) network. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based communication is a new paradigm for 5G and beyond network architectures. Advancement in the UAV technology has enabled aerial base stations (ABSs) to be deployed as a viable solution for the provisioning of cellular services in different environments. Google Project Loon and Facebook Aquila have turned the idea of aerial platforms providing communication services into a well established reality. The future roles envisaged for ABSs in the smart cities are to provide on demand connectivity either as a standalone airborne network or to assist the already existing terrestrial cellular infrastructure. UAVs can come to the assistance of terrestrial networks for multiple purposes such as for the offloading of users from ground base stations in case of a crowded event or for the capacity enhancement of existing terrestrial network. Availability of huge bandwidth in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies makes it a key element in managing the large traffic volumes in smart cities. Furthermore, enhanced line of sight capability of the UAVs make it a suitable platform for deployment as mmWave communications platform in the urban scenarios where concrete structures can degrade communication in the mmWave frequencies considerably. On demand deployment of the UAVs also make it suitable for dealing with varying traffic flows in smart cities, where an optimum number of UAVs can assist the existing communication infrastructure to deal with the massive user demands. Similarly UAVs can reach any area in the smart city where there is network congestion like a crowded hot spot, a sporting event or a traffic jam, and relieve the network load. UAVs also offer smart cities resilience to the network failures in case of a disaster or in the case of an unexpected event. Network resilience is indispensable for the future smart cities which will be dependent upon round the clock data collection and dissemination of ubiquitous sensors for automation and decision making. Rapid deployment capability of UAVs make it a suitable platform for allowing smart cities to continue its operations by restoring communication services in any unforeseen scenario. Apart from complete network failure in the case of disaster, the meeting of huge user demands will be a key concern for future smart cities. Through deployment of ABSs, network coverage in terms of data rates can be enhanced whenever and wherever required. Our proposed case study considers a scenario inside a smart city in which UAVs, operating in mmWave bands, assist the existing cellular infrastructure in meeting huge user demands that have arisen due to any event. We believe that on demand UAV-assisted networks, in the smart cities, provide a quick and efficient solution for the provisioning of cellular services and meeting of the user demands.}

The porous polystyrene (PS) honey-comb patterned (HCP) film containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO) was first fabricated by the breath figure (BF) method under humid conditions, further, the film was immersed into aniline hydrochloride aqueous solution for the interfacial polymerization of PANI. The interfacial polymerization of the HCP porous film led to the biomimetic growth of PANI in fractal configuration for a bio-inspired snowflake or leaf-like pattern in the pore surface. The bio-inspired structure of PANI in the HCP porous film through interfacial polymerization is explained by the diffusion-leading aggregation (DLA) by the reaction of aniline monomer into an aqueous solution and self-assembled BPO in the pore surface. The morphology of the bio-inspired PANI structure in the HCP film was highly sensitive to pH, and revealed the conductivity variation over several orders of magnitude (10-3 to 10-1 S/cm) similar to a smart material. Due to the high pH sensitivity, the film can be applied in various biomedical sensing applications.}

Although operational rules, guiding questions, and plans on gender dimension are established for domains such as health and machine translation, evidence from historical analyses of gendered innovations in smart forestry and agriculture, as well as frameworks for future designs and research, is fragmented. Therefore, this chapter is informed by a critical literature analysis, where I delved into different fields that intersect smart forestry, agriculture, and rural impacts and asked critical questions – by email and short virtual roundtables – to various domain experts within the Horizon Europe project SPADE. This chapter provides a short overview of definitions, operational rules, and recommendations that are relevant for different work packages in the Horizon Europe project SPADE. It is tailored for drone and DT engineers, operators, and researchers in smart forestry and agriculture. This perspective presents the framework we used in virtual roundtables during consortium and work package meetings in the first phase of the project.}

Both businesses and business researchers are increasingly interested in the application of gamification. In this regard, this review aims to offer a state-of-the-art overview of gamification in business, revealing its current trends and future directions. Using business research on gamification published in the last decade (2012–2022) found on Scopus and Web of Science, we conduct a performance analysis to illuminate the field's performance (publication productivity and impact) alongside its key contributors (journals, authors, and countries) as well as a science mapping using a co-citation analysis to locate knowledge foundations, and bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence analysis to reveal major themes in business gamification. Our exploration has unearthed gamification's pervasive influence across business domains, from enhancing learning and fostering innovation to empowering marketing strategies and catalyzing transformation. Gamification has also made significant inroads into management practices, driving engagement, influencing behavioral outcomes, and ushering sustainability. Peering into the future, our density-centrality quadrant analysis casts light on emerging frontiers. Noteworthily, we expect the next wave of gamification to be shaped by the allure of video games and the metaverse, bespoke industry-specific designs, confluence with e-commerce trends, emphasis on sustainable development, expanded social responsibilities, innovations in virtual reality, intersections with human urbanism, and the rise of smart cities. As gamification continues to integrate and reshape myriad facets of the business world, it holds the promise of not only enriching current practices but also charting the course for the future of innovative, sustainable, and transformative business strategies.}

The recently enabled Application Programming Interface (API) to GNSS raw measurement in Android Nougat operating system, make it possible to implement precise positioning technology on Android smart devices, such as Real-Time Kinematic Positioning (RTK) and Precise Point Positioning (PPP). An optimized kinematic positioning approach on Android smart devices with Doppler-Smoothed-Code (DSC) filter and Constant Acceleration (CA) model is assessed in this paper. In this optimized approach, DSC filter is used to reduce the code measurement noise, which is extremely high on smart devices and CA model is used to accurately predict the kinematic state of smart devices. The optimized approach is named Smart-RTK for its applicability to smart devices, respectively. The performance of the Smart-RTK approach is validated by two Google/HTC Nexus 9 tablets separately under stationary, walking, and vehicular condition. The numerical experiments show the significant improvement on positioning accuracy and continuity. The positioning Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in horizontal component reaches about 0.3–0.6 m in stationary condition and 0.4–0.7 m in walking condition, improved by about 85% compared with that of chipset original solutions. In the subsequent vehicular experiment, the horizontal positioning RMSE is about 0.85 m, 50% better than that of chipset solutions.}

Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology, makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing. A simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it with a group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred. This creates a decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time; doesn’t lock out anyone awaiting changes from another party; while recording all modifications to the doc in real-time, making changes completely transparent. Smart grids are currently advancing technologically at a very fast pace by using borrowed capitals for the benefits offered by Wireless Sensor Networks and the Internet of Things. They not only offer optimization in energy production and energy consumption by the adoption of intelligent systems that can monitor and communicate with each other but also reduces manpower requirements with attendant enhanced accuracy that come with automation of the smart sensor-based metering system using Advanced Metering Devices. Thus, the grid is made more cost-efficient with enhanced performance and better intelligence achieving efficient energy utilization. Smart grids also promise more cost-efficient tapping of renewable sources of energy by offering technological support for the transfer of energy between local energy producers and consumers. The consumers who can harvest renewable sources of energy such as sunlight using rooftop solar panels can become producers-cum-consumers by selling their surplus energy either to neighboring consumers or to the grid. This promotes the urgency in consumers to utilize renewable sources of energy. Applications of blockchain in smart grid are Security and Privacy-Preserving Techniques, Energy Trading in Electric Vehicles, Peer-To-Peer Trading Infrastructure, and so forth. Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology because it helps reduce risk, stamps out fraud, and brings transparency in a scalable way for myriad uses.}

This work proposes: (i) a structured On-the-Job Training strategy for non-routine tasks, called ‘training-on-the-go’ or ‘prescriptive training’, according to which a Prescriptive Analytics module schedules the training sessions not long before the actual performance, but only when and if needed; (ii) a proof-of-concept of a game-based training system where virtual scenes and context of an industrial site are faithfully recreated thanks to digital twin data and models; (iii) the use of evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive maps (E-FCM) for the extraction of the workers’ implicit procedural knowledge and for the comparison of mental models of experienced vs. inexperienced workers to assess potential misconceptions or flaws in their decision-making process. This work contributes to the evolution of worker training paradigms and systems from the perspective of human-centric cyber-physical production systems and aims for current gaps in workforce training, i.e. poor timeliness and effectiveness, limited context and industrial information integration, and scarce focus on the experts’ implicit knowledge. An application study with a non-routine task on an offshore oil platform demonstrates how the proposed system facilitates knowledge transfer, offers situational awareness and sustains the workforce competence development process.}

In this paper, we construct a smart alarm sound recommendation system working with smartphones to deliver smart alarm sounds by considering not only specified information, such as sleep patterns, but also context information such as weather, and social information. Our system aims to provide a smart life through orchestrating sensing data collected by multiple sensors on smartphones and collaborating with cloud computing to recommend preferable alarm sounds. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system, we conduct experiments of using our system to recommend smart alarm sounds to wake people up in the morning. Experimental results show that our system can improve people emotional states by about 10.73%, compared to traditional alarm sound delivery methods.}

In today’s “smart” cities, massive amounts of multiple forms of geolocated content is generated daily in social media, out of which knowledge for social interactions and urban dynamics can be derived. This work addresses the problem of detecting urban social activity patterns and interactions, by modeling cities into “dynamic areas”, i.e., coherent geographic areas shaped through social activities. Social media users provide the information on such social activities and interactions in cases when they are on the move around the city neighborhoods. The proposed approach models city places as feature vectors which represent users visiting patterns (social activity), the time of observed visits (temporal activity), and the context of functionality of visited places category. To uncover the dynamics of city areas, a clustering approach is proposed which considers the derived feature vectors to group people’s activities with respect to location, time, and context. The proposed methodology has been implemented on the DynamiCITY platform which demonstrates neighborhood analytics via a Web interface that allows end-users to explore neighborhoods dynamics and gain insights for city cross-neighborhood patterns and inter-relationships.}

The current cost per kilometre, differentiated between location, time, and vehicle type, and was then sent back such that each driver instantly knew the current cost of the trip. Based on this smart technology, we then organised an experiment that researched human behaviour and responses to an example service, i.e., road pricing stimuli within a large geographic region. As a result, road users adapted their behaviour, resulting in a lower overall cost. As a side effect, the experiment provided a solution to drive and support the city's mobility objectives.}

However, the quantitative research on the potential and economics of smart charging for different types of EVs in China remains insufficient, which has been increasingly regarded as a critical barrier for associated policy decision marking. To address this issue, this paper conducts a survey on the charging behaviors of four types of EVs in Shanghai and evaluates the capacity potential and cost of EV smart charging. A Bass Diffusion model is adopted to forecast the stock growth of EVs and the potential of smart charging is investigated by simulating EV charging behavior under two scenarios. It finds that private and commercial EVs could deliver greater smart charging than that of electric bus and taxis. Business models and charging policies that could cost-effectively explore the potential of EV smart charging are further discussed. The paper concludes that charging service providers with time of use charging tariffs could realize the potential of smart charging in a cost-efficient way.}

This analysis takes account a pattern for smart grid development, and one may observe that Brazil is going towards a smart grid full implementation; however it could take decades and requires adjusts from govern, regulatory agency, utilities and consumers, and more investments. Moreover, some of the major smart grid projects in Brazil are presented, and their characteristics are compared considering the technologies used, location and electric utility goals. Depending on the electric utilities objectives, one may observe similarities and differences between concepts adopted and location of the Brazilian smart grid pilot projects. The first objective is the validation and replicability of the pilot project implemented; once, the project location is a sample of the utility׳s energy market or it is a particular area of interest, like an off-grid powered island with high environmental restrictions, for instance. The second objective is creating a model of sustainable smart grid with national visibility, once the project location is a touristic place. The conception of smart grid is aligned with sustainability, and it is a tendency in Brazil a massive entry of smart grid technologies in the next years.}

In the first part of the analysis, the results show that the latitude of the location is a very strong driver in determining the size of the system (hence footprint) and the amount of seasonal storage. The rated capacity of the PV plant and electrolyzer are 37%/41% and 58%/64% higher in Frankfurt and Newcastle, respectively, as compared to the original design for Palermo. And not only this, but seasonal storage also increases largely from 3125 kg H2 to 5023 and 5920 kg H2. As a consequence of this, LCOE‾ takes values of 0.86 €/kWh, 1.26 €/kWh, and 1.5 €/kWh for the three cities, respectively, whilst round-trip efficiency is approximately 15.7% for the three designs at the 3 cities. Finally, with the aim to reduce the footprint and rating of the different systems, a final assessment of the system hybridised with battery storage shows a 20% LCOE‾ reduction and a 10% higher round-trip efficiency.}

This research works to reveal the trends and determining factors of urban CO2 emissions under different urban development patterns. Taking the cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) as an example, this study develops an identification system in light of the dynamics of urban population and population density to categorize urban development patterns as growth, potential shrinkage, smart shrinkage, and continuous shrinkage. Then, the Theil-sen medium analysis and spatial econometric modeling are applied to shed light on the trend and influencing factors of CO2 emissions, respectively. The findings indicate that urban growth and potential shrinkage are the main development patterns in the YREB, and the percentage of growing cities and potentially shrinking cities is more than 77 % across the different geographic areas of the YREB. CO2 emissions are remarkably heterogeneous under different urban development patterns. Over 90 % of cities show a growth trend or fluctuation in per capita CO2 emissions under the four development patterns during 2010∼2019. Only a few growing and potentially shrinking cities show a decreasing trend in per capita carbon emissions, suggesting a severe peak carbon challenge in the YREB. CO2 emissions in growing and shrinking cities are significantly influenced by their neighboring cities. Factors affecting CO2 emissions are different in shrinking and growing cities, and spatial spillover effects enhance the role of these factors. Compared with growing cities, improving population concentration, developing appropriate tertiary industries, strictly controlling land expansion, and developing green areas can pave the way for carbon emission reduction in shrinking cities. This study can support designing efficient carbon emission reduction measures for various cities.}

However, channel insecurity and battery limitation may not protect the aerial coverage area. Thus, sensitive information gathered through aerial vehicles causes security threats. To manage the security issues, Smart Internet of Drone (S-IoD) have been evolved to use Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) as a software agent while monitoring and observing areas of interest. The current state-of-the-art technologies provide ubiquitous communication to enable several Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. It achieves a feature of a decision support system that allows the smart interaction and communication between real-time entities. IPA offers smart interaction with other smart real-time entities to gain the user’s knowledge and awareness. This paper presents an S-IoD framework for a UAV environment that independently collects sensible information. In order to reduce the computation cost of the authentication protocol, a lightweight privacy-preserving scheme (L-PPS) is introduced. The proposed L-PPS is constructive to provide the robustness between the IoT devices with a valid authentication period. To demonstrate the security and performance efficiencies, the formal verification was performed using a verification tool, Scyther, and a random oracle model. In addition, the proposed L-PPS introduces a secret token and dynamic user authentication to speed up the authentication process between the communication entities. Importantly, the authentication session of L-PPS does not use any complex cryptographic operations, whereby it has less computation and communication costs to meet the standard constraints of surveillance systems. Moreover, the obtained simulation analysis proves that the proposed L-PPS achieves better quality metrics than other authentication schemes in the literature.}

They are associated with sprawling land use developments that have been the dominant pattern in the United States and across the globe for several decades. On the contrary, smart growth promotes compact development, infill development or redevelopment in existing neighborhoods, mixed-use development, high accessibility supported by multimodal transportation options, and open spaces and the natural environment. Smart growth has significant impacts on people's travel behavior. Empirical studies from the United States and other countries showed that adopting the smart growth principles on land use patterns and transportation could reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and auto dependency through shorter travel distance and mode shifts. With compact and mixed-use developments, destinations are closer to origins and each other, thus travel distances are shorter. With developments toward well-connected streets with multimodal transportation services, walking, cycling, and taking transit become viable options. The mode choice starts to shift from dominantly driving to these alternative modes. Despite the transportation and other benefits that it has, smart growth faces many challenges in practice, such as consumer preferences, mixed information, lack of tools. With the intensification of climate change and other crises we are facing today, it becomes urgent to overcome these challenges to implement smart growth principles more widely across the globe.}

There are hundreds of thousands of books in libraries, causing problems in searching and counting books. To overcome these problems, this research presents a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) dataset and a new automated book location classification model using the RSSI dataset.
Materials and method
In this study, a RSSI signals dataset was collected using a mobile vehicle from 3279 books. These books are randomly placed on six benches, 24 cabinets, and 144 racks. The primary objective of this work is to detect book position automatically using a simple learning model. Thus, a new automated book position detection model is presented and this model is tested on the RSSI dataset collected. (i) Multiscale principal component analysis (MSPCA) is considered a pre-processing method. (ii) Iterative minimum redundancy maximum relevance (ImRMR) algorithm was used to select the most informative features automatically. (iii) The most informative features selected are classified using the Decision Trees (DT) and Ensemble Bagged Trees (BT) algorithms. Three cases are defined according to bench, cabinet, and rack.
Results
The recommended model yielded 97.34% 98.26% and 93.1% overall accuracies using the bench, cabinet, and rack cases consecutively deploying the BT classifier with 10-fold cross-validation.
Conclusions
The presented book position classification model reached above 90% for all cases and these results calculated and finding clearly demonstrates that this model is ready to use in a big library for book position detection.}

abstract = {Blockchain application and cyber-physical systems play a crucial role to modernize the traditional industrial process, technical procedures, and business models. It uses frame resilient and smart contracts to reduce the complexities of service costs. The blockchain applications associate the key features such as self-verification, and self-integrity to eliminate the role of trusted third parties access. It evolves scientific and industrial progress to reform as Industry 4.0 that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process and extract the significant information of the real-time systems. Moreover, it applies digital analytics to link the data with blockchain and cloud repositories to improve system efficiencies. However, the security and privacy issues are still challenging to investigate the AI techniques and tools. Thus, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving in smart contracts using blockchain and artificial intelligence (PPSC-BCAI) framework that simplifies human interaction, system activities, service alerts, security risks, and fraudulent claims. To analyze the data transaction and sharing, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is applied. It analyses the transaction service to optimize the network load that reveals whether the transmission rate changes over the connectivity of unreliable networks.}

The ARO was partially intended to reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT) by encouraging mixed commercial and residential uses in existing buildings within Downtown Los Angeles. Researchers and planners claim that the ARO helped reduce VMT, but these claims are not supported by analysis. This study evaluates the contributions of the ARO to transit-oriented growth in the City of Los Angeles. Two methods of analysis are used: a spatial analysis examining the number of ARO projects within a half-mile radius of Metro stations, and a statistical analysis examining the number of new buildings constructed in Downtown Los Angeles from 1985 to 2013. It finds that the majority of ARO projects (72%) have been developed within a half-mile radius of Metro rail stations. Furthermore, the ARO appears to have accelerated downtown development activity, reversing development trends and potentially providing an additional tool for developers during economic lulls. These findings suggest that the ARO has helped to accommodate and spur transit-oriented growth while preserving historic resources in the City of Los Angeles.}

To guide practices related to management of urban areas and advance policy-making decisions and scientific inquiry in this domain, we identify 7 criteria and 27 sub-criteria mainly from the literature related to socio-technical perspectives. To handle the inter-relations among the identified criteria and sub-criteria, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach based on Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory based Analytic Network Process (DANP). Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for urban renewal in South India is demonstrated with a real-life case study. Finally, we establish how the obtained results will help the policy makers to initiate urban renewal in southern India.}

Utilizing data from Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2019 and city-level statistics from the China City Statistical Yearbooks, we employ rigorous econometric methodologies, including Difference-in-Differences and multi-period multi-entity Difference-in-Differences, to analyze the policy effects. Our findings suggest that “Broadband China” demonstration cities significantly reduce staff redundancy and enhance the efficiency of employee allocation within firms. This effect is attributed to the stimulation of entrepreneurial activity and the promotion of digital transformation driven by the demonstration city pilot program. Furthermore, the policy’s effectiveness is found to vary based on city location, workforce scale, the nature of enterprise ownership, and growth stage. Importantly, the improved efficiency of employee allocation resulting from the demonstration cities leads to favorable economic outcomes, augmenting total factor productivity for firms. In conclusion, this research highlights the crucial role of digital economy policies in optimizing the structure of human resources within firms, emphasizing the importance of fostering digital transformation to achieve efficient talent allocation and enhance production efficiency.}

The smart proxy models were applied on two cases, the first case study investigated the application of a proxy model for calibrating a reservoir simulation model based on historical data and predicting well production while the second case study investigated the application of an ANN-based proxy model for fast-track modeling of CO2 enhanced oil recovery, aiming at the prediction of the reservoir pressure and phase saturation distribution at injection stage and post-injection stage. The prediction effects for both cases are promising. While a single run of basic numerical simulation model takes hours to days, the smart proxy model runs in a matter of seconds, saving 98.9% of calculating time. The results of these case studies demonstrate the advantage of the proposed workflow for addressing the high run-time, computational time and computational cost of numerical simulation models. In addition, these proxy models predict the outputs of reservoir simulation models with high accuracy.}

The system consists of three components: the mechanical subsystem, the electrical subsystem, and the control subsystem. The mechanical subsystem, utilising a coil spring booster (CSB), effectively stores braking energy as elastic potential energy, enhancing the flexibility of the braking system. The electrical subsystem converts braking energy into electrical energy. The control subsystem ensures cooperative operation among the mechanical subsystem, the electrical subsystem, and traditional friction braking methods. The study focuses on the characteristics and design process of coil springs, showing that braking force significantly impacts braking efficiency and energy recovery. Finite element analysis demonstrates the working mode of the coil spring in auxiliary braking. Furthermore, the tests conducted on a prototype analysed the energy storage characteristics of the coil spring, revealing the influence of mechanical properties, supporting connection strength, and the number of coil springs. Overall, the proposed SC-RBS utilising the CSB enables efficient utilisation of tram regenerative braking energy, contributing to the development of sustainable cities.}

Japan is one of the pioneers in smart grid deployment. The Japanese model is characterised by a government-led, community-oriented, and business-driven approach with the launch of four large-scale smart-community demonstration projects. Our case study of large smart grid demonstration projects in Japan found that the Japanese government has demonstrated its high governing capacity in terms of leadership, recombinative capacity, institutional capacity, enabling capacity, and inducement capacity. However, the major limitations of the government in introducing some critical regulatory changes have constrained the smart grid deployment from advancing to a higher-order form of smart grid developments. This paper calls for more attention to be given to the importance of regulatory changes that are essential to overcome the technological lock-in, and the complementary roles of non-state actors such as the business sector and consumers to strengthen the governing capacity of the state.}

Although smart home objects have also been acknowledged to promote environmental sustainability, investigation of the influence of altruistic and ecological motivational variables on consumers' willingness to purchase these products has been limited. This study presents a conceptual model that considers three relevant altruistic, ecological antecedents of eco-friendly product adoption (environmental beliefs, environmental concern, and smart home objects' perceived usefulness for the environment) and assesses their influence on the intention to purchase smart home objects. Furthermore, it uncovers the moderating role of the two dimensions of materialism (success and happiness) and hypothesizes that they moderate the relationship between environmental concern and intentions to purchase smart home objects. Structural equation modeling is applied to data from a sample of 641 French respondents. The results confirm that altruistic, ecological variables do matter in developing intentions to purchase smart home objects. Environmental concern and perceived usefulness positively affect consumers' intentions to purchase smart home objects. Furthermore, both happiness and success negatively moderate the effect of environmental concern on consumers' intentions to purchase smart home objects.}

Consequently, housing stock models are sensitive to assumptions made on heating temperatures. This study proposes a heat balance approach, inspired by the classical degree-day method, applied to an extensive urban dataset. The goal of this analysis is to determine heterogeneous characteristics, such as temperature setpoints of heating systems and thermal envelope characteristics from an overall population of residential buildings. Measured energy data are utilized for the purpose of the study from the city of Aarhus, Denmark, where the energy usage for heating of circa 14,000 households was monitored over time via smart meters. These data are combined with actual weather data as well as data extracted by a national building database. Using linear regression and heat balance models, temperature setpoints for the whole dataset are determined with a median and average of 19 °C and 19.1 °C, respectively. Furthermore, building related characteristics such as thermal and ventilation losses per building and overall heat transfer coefficients are extracted at urban scale. The reliability of the method over its complexity is discussed with regards to the big sample that has been applied to. In general, the overall performance of the approach is satisfactory achieving a coefficient of determination with an average of 0.8, and is found to be in line with previous findings, considering also the high uncertainty associated with building-related input parameters. The extracted setpoint distribution should be transferrable across Scandinavia.}

In the proposed system, solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) panels are integrated with a heat storage tank to supply a significant portion of the building’s heat and electricity demands. The system does not have any battery making it considerably cheaper and may have a two-way interaction with both of the local heat and electricity grids. In this way, the proposed system is strongly compatible with countries with both electricity and heat grids, e.g., Denmark. By such a system, not only the share of renewable energy in the national energy matrix may securely increase, but also the building will benefit the cheap, environmentally-friendly energy flows produced by its own. Considering the local weather data of a real smart building located in Western Denmark, the proposed building energy system is investigated. The results reveal that the system not only provides the entire annual domestic hot water building but also it generates 402.8 m3 hot water of 40 °C to be sold to the local ultralow-temperature district heating grid. With 2083 kWh electricity bought from the grid vs. 1938 kWh sold to that, the building’s yearly electricity cost is almost compensated.}

An important cause of this evolution is the growing presence of dispersed generation; the increasing levels of quality of service required by final users are another important issue for Distribution System Operators. These driving forces are particularly challenging in Italy: on the one hand, recent incentives have fostered the installation of many Dispersed Generation units on MV networks; on the other hand, the quality of service regulations put in place by the Italian Energy Regulator push Distribution System Operators to exploit automation on distribution grids. Within this framework, the paper describes a practical implementation of the smart grid concept to a real-life MV network in the urban area of Milan, developed by A2A Reti Elettriche (which owns and operates the distribution network in the cities of Milan and Brescia) in the context of smart grid demonstration projects launched by the Italian Energy Regulator in 2010. After a brief illustration of the network adopted for the experiment, the smart grid architecture is presented, along with the main functionalities to be achieved. Particular attention is devoted to an innovative automatic procedure for selective fault detection, based on logic selectivity and fast network reconfiguration. Some remarks are also provided about the performances of telecommunication supports used for the project.}

abstract = {The interaction between the static and dynamic magnetic fields generated from a conventional magnetostrictive sensor (MsS) is an important factor in the sensitivity of defect detection. Normally, the dynamic magnetic field of an MsS is generated by its electric coils, whereas the static magnetic field is generated by permanent magnets. The magnitude of the generated fields and their interactions significantly affect the amplitude of the induced guided-wave signals. The conventional hard coil-based MsS is usually bulky and is not sufficiently flexible to fit pipes of various sizes. Such inflexibility limits the use of conventional MsS in practical situations. To overcome these limitations, the authors designed an innovative type of coil, called the flexible printed coil (FPC), to replace the inflexible hard coil. Because the FPC is a thin film, it can be easily wrapped around any size pipe, whereas the conventional hard coil–based MsS requires modification with changes in the size of pipes. Although the smart FPC-MsS can work as expected, due to the design of the flexible coils, the interference caused by the coils exerted an uneven magnetostrictive force on the tested pipe. This increases the sensitivity required to detect defects, which differ at each circumferential location of the inspected pipe. Hence, the smart FPC-MsS generates different results at different circumferential locations even though the sizes of the cracks are the same at each circumferential location. To address this deficiency, we designed a smart and harmonized FPC-MsS, called smart HFPC-MsS, which can generate an even magnetostrictive force regardless of the circumferential location of the crack. Ultimately, an evenly distributed amplitude of guided waves can be emitted into the entire pipe, which improves the accuracy of crack detection. In this paper, the theoretical foundation of designing the smart HFPC-MsS is explained, and its working principles are introduced. Both the simulated and experimental results prove the effectiveness of such a novel HFPC-MsS, and the results show that it can generate even amplitude of the guided waves to the pipe regardless of the circumferential location of the crack, resulting in more accurate crack detection than that provided by the author's previously designed smart FPC-MsS.}

How to choose the optimal energy use strategy among different decision makers is a problem that urgently needs to be solved today. Therefore, first, this paper proposes a comprehensive energy multi-objective scheduling model based on the established smart community energy management framework, which considers the utility of decision makers. From the perspective of risk, the model divides decision makers into adventurous, intermediate and conservative types in order to study the impacts of different decision makers on energy use strategies. Second, to prevent the phenomenon of the solution of the intelligent algorithm falling into the local optimum, this paper innovatively uses the Lévy flight to optimize the learning step length of the chicken swarm algorithm to quickly solve the proposed mixed integer nonlinear programming model. Finally, the model is tested through multi-scenario simulation. The results show that decision makers have an important influence on energy use strategies, and different decision makers have different energy use strategies when utility is maximized. In addition, compared with the chicken swarm algorithm, the improved algorithm increases the utility of adventurous, intermediate and conservative decision makers in type-I cases by 0.54 %, 1.2 %, and 1.5 %, respectively; and in type-II cases by 4.5 %, 4.8 %, and 3.6 %, respectively.}

Of particular concern is the potential for large-scale attacks to disrupt road transportation, which is the lifeline of cities. This concern has only been growing with the increase in cybersecurity incidents and disinformation attacks in related infrastructures. In this study, we develop a framework to quantify, detect, and mitigate cascading consequences of attacks on road transportation networks. Application of our framework to the road network of Boston reveals that targeted attacks on a small fraction of nodes leads to disproportionately larger disruptions of routes. We develop an unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on network percolation theory and density based clustering (P-DBSCAN) to quantify risk for urban networks based on real-time traffic data. Our study illustrates a holistic approach to build resilience in existing road networks to attacks. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our framework in other smart city infrastructures.}

To address this issue, smart edge computing in Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) is proposed to enable mobile users to offload computation-intensive tasks to the edge computing nodes which deploys computing resources nearby the mobile devices. However, the normal operation of edge computing nodes consumes plenty of energy. Thus, it is still a challenge to be aware of energy consumption while the computing tasks are migrated to the Edge Computing Nodes (ECNs). In view of this challenge, an Energy-Aware Computation Offloading method, named EACO, is designed to reduce the energy consumption. Technically, we analyze all access point (AP) routings between the original AP to destination AP and select the shortest path to offload the computing tasks. Furthermore we adopt Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to realize multi-objective optimization to shorten the offloading time of the computing tasks and reduce the energy consumption of the ECNs. Besides, we exploit Multiple Criteria Decision Marking (MCDM) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) to select the optimal offloading solution. Finally, the simulation experimental results show that our proposed EACO outperforms other methods.}

However, improper use of RFID tags is highly likely to threaten the safety and privacy of hospitals and even patients, which may not only cause physical and mental harm to patients but also damage the reputation of hospitals. Medical monitoring system based on RFID technology plays a significant role in guaranteeing the security of medical records as well as the privacy of patients. Nevertheless, due to the resource constraint of RFID tags/readers, it is also challenging to design an efficient and effective authentication protocol for RFID medical monitoring system. Aiming to reduce the resource overhead and meet security requirements of the RFID system, in this paper, we propose an ultra-lightweight RFID security authentication protocol utilizing a cloud server named CRUSAP, which is based on Bit-Crossing XOR rearrangement operations that can effectively resist forgery attacks, replay attacks, desynchronization attacks, and denial of service attacks while certifying the cloud server. The formal logic of BAN proves the safety and feasibility of the protocol. Additionally, the security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed authentication protocol can realize higher security goals at a lower cost and is more suitable for scaling to large-scale authentication.}

This paper uses edge cloud computing technology and wearable technology to improve the inconvenient information flow of on-site maintenance of communication networks. We propose an Emergent Task Allocation Mechanism based on Comprehensive Reputation and Regional Prediction Model (ETARR) in the edge cloud computing environment to solve emergency task allocation in smart network maintenance. Firstly, based on the basic reputation value, we add the work enthusiasm and work activity as the indicators to measure the work efficiency of the maintenance personnel. By using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the historical reputation value sequence, the work enthusiasm of the maintenance personnel is quantified. Furthermore, based on the historical movement route of the maintenance personnel, the location of maintenance personnel is predicted by using the modified Workers’ Movement Patterns (WMP) model. Finally, combined with the reputation value requirements of the emergency task and the geographical location of the maintenance personnel, the maintenance emergency task is assigned. Simulation results show that the ETARR mechanism proposed in this paper reduces the cost of task allocation, improves the efficiency of the completion of the emergency task, and can be better applied to the emergency task scenario in the smart network maintenance environment.}

In Eastern Africa, public and private companies are engineering far-reaching ICT-based projects for urban service delivery. In their appropriation, these projects have become subject to overarching dynamics. This chapter follows recent deployments of ICT-based projects for water access in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. I take two examples from two of Nairobi’s largest informal areas where ICT-based projects have been deployed in the urge to formalize access and undercut urban informality. These projects include Water ATMs, automated water dispensing machines for informal areas in Nairobi deployed by the central water provider in the city, and the M-Maji platform, a mobile-based data management platform for water availability in informal areas deployed by a self-organized “goodwill” collective. Thus I explore the different ways through which these projects are shaping urban infrastructure provision in informal areas and how they are being reconstituted through their very situatedness within contexts of urban informality. In doing so, I draw from a theoretical base of urban and technology studies to demonstrate how, while ambitious and standard in their design, their implementation and appropriation is marked by heterogeneous processes of domestication. I argue that these projects and their variegated manifestations radically displace the notion of the ideal type or standard of urban smartness. As such, they reflect the situated natures of ICTs and infrastructures in the making.}

The development of appropriate design techniques for the surrounded built environment of TOD has become increasingly important as TOD concepts apply to urban development. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combined design strategies and TOD patterns planning approach that promotes the quality of urban built environment will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. This is an essential element of this research. The TOD design strategies can be proposed by utilizing the supply side prediction methodologies of planning. There has also been an increasing interest in the urban built environment design in the past decade. This interest is motivated by the possibility that design policies associated with the built environment can be used to control, manage, and shape individual activity and behavior. This paper first studies and classifies smart growth principles based on literature review. Then the individual expert's judgments are obtained and utilized to evaluate the relative importance of smart growth principles. Next, the site selection for a new metro transit station in Taipei (Taiwan) is conducted to show the application of our proposed methodological approach.

It is being adopted by several companies and startups, using distinct business models with different results.

This paper aims to propose an empirical model to analyze which components from smart mobility, collaborative consumption, and multisided platforms have been incorporated into companies' business models and their relationship with companies´ results. It was applied to 14 case studies of Brazilian shared mobility companies to investigate the relationship between these components and the business goals proposed by the authors (active company, survival, and mobile application ratings). This study offers a theoretical contribution to deepening the knowledge in this area, considering that the authors found no similar studies. Canvas business model framework, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), content analysis, and cross-case analysis were applied to analyze these case studies.

These talent meets paved a way for researchers to come forward and think out of the box in the field of AI from language simulation to learning machines. Since then, decades have been spent for machine to imitate human intelligence. Despite the hardwork, progress was not impressive. But for the past two decades, we can witness tremendous growth in the domain of AI. AI is an umbrella that clutches machine learning and deep learning techniques. Machine-learning algorithms have been grown expressly due to the expansion of deep learning and reinforcement-learning techniques, which are grounded on neural networks. In this chapter, we study the influence of AI, its necessity, techniques, and challenges in the smart power system.}

abstract = {Background
The vast majority of women with breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa present with advanced stage disease, due primarily to the lack of opportunities for early detection and treatment. As part of a larger effort to increase access to diagnostic and therapeutic services for women’s cancers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we implemented a curriculum to train the local workforce and a program to build the supportive infrastructure for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer at a private sector health facility (Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital) in Kinshasa.
Study design
After onsite trainings in the DRC by a US breast surgeon (RT), Congolese surgeons, general physicians, physician assistants, and nurses used the Phillips Lumify smart-phone ultrasound device to perform and interpret the results of whole breast ultrasound on symptomatic women. Surgeons were trained to perform ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on those who met the criteria for tissue diagnosis, after which they trained nurses to do the same.
Results
Over 3 years, 5,211 patients were identified as having a breast abnormality on clinical breast examination. Ultrasound abnormalities were noted in 1,493 (27%) patients, of which 632 (42%) met the criteria for ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration. Pathology reports were available on 368 (58%) patients who underwent biopsy, of which 164 were malignant and 204 benign.
Conclusions
We demonstrated how the “ability to look” using smart technology can be successfully used to augment clinical breast exam and triage patients for biopsy in a resource-constrained African setting.}

The inherent uncertainty and complexity of the risks associated with urban flooding limit the ability to plan optimal rescue paths that prioritize both timeliness and safety. This study addresses the challenge by proposing an innovative assessment methodology to output risk values and probability representing safety and timeliness in each passable area while simulating real-world flood scenarios. Furthermore, the paper develops a pioneering path-planning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, incorporating improved stochastic reward exploitation and heterogeneous reward exploration mechanisms to function in a simulation rescue path-planning scenario with uncertainty and complexity. According to the findings, the proposed algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms in converging to the optimal path, fully sampling, and running efficiency. The study contributes to theoretical progress on urban pluvial flood rescue, deep reinforcement learning, risk assessment, and decision intelligence while offering practical implications for smart cities, emergency management, and optimizing real-world problems by employing artificial intelligence.}

In the healthcare sector, a sizable number of IoT devices have been developed for diagnosing, monitoring, forecasting, and treatment of chronic diseases remotely. The sensors are to obtain important body parameters such as blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and breath acetone store the data in the cloud repositories for healthcare professionals. The use of these devices referred to as smart sensors is becoming acceptable in smart healthcare for diagnosing and treatment of diseases as a result of the technological development of the needed devices. The data generated by these devices is huge and requires standard infrastructure to cope with the processing and transmissions. Edge computing technology tends to provide the required solution to smart sensor device processing and computational difficulties in smart healthcare by increase the communication and computational speed of the smart sensors with its cost-effective and low latency data services. The data transmitted by the smart sensor in smart healthcare systems (SHS) are personal that require confidentiality, integrity, and availability for prompt and correct decisions to be taken by the healthcare professionals, thus the data needed to be transmitted and stored securely. Therefore this paper proposes a lightweight Speck encryption algorithm for medical data from SHS. The proposed algorithm is applied to decrease the time for encryption in the SHS platform and to preserve the trade-off between security and efficiency. The proposed work is compared with recent works on lightweight start-ups in terms of accuracy, memory use, execution time, and precision. Results show that in an IoT-edge computing-driven setup, the algorithm is highly secure, efficient, and more suitable for securing data.}

A smart agriculture refers to all sorts of developments related to farming to marking or distribution and reaching the end user without any wastage. The use of today’s advanced technology gives us increased productivity in optimized resource uses. That is possible if the farmer cultivates in a controlled and transparent way. A smart farm is an example of facilitating sustainable agricultural productivity increases. This coupled with decreasing common assets, restricted accessibility of arable land, and increments in flighty climate conditions make food security a significant worry for most nations. Thus, the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics (DA) are used to upgrade the operational effectiveness and profitability in horticulture. It not only gives importance to increased productivity, but it also emphasizes environmental sustainability along with features of data analytics, where the task is to find requirements and predict the suitability of a crop. There is a change in outlook from the utilization of wireless sensor networks (WSN) as a significant driver of shrewd agribusiness to the utilization of IoT and DA. The IoT coordinates a few existing advances, such as WSN, radio recurrence ID, distributed computing, middleware frameworks, and end client applications. In this chapter, a few advantages and difficulties of IoT are distinguished. This article shows that the IoT environment with DA analysis is leading to brilliant and smart agriculture.

A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, the fog needs to send a high volume of data to the cloud and this can cause link congestion with unusable data traffic. Here we propose an approach to collect and store data in a fog-based smart agriculture environment and different data reduction methods. Sixteen techniques for data reduction are investigated; eight machine learning (ML) methods combined with run-length encoding, and eight combined with Huffman encoding. Our experiment uses two real data sets, where the first contains air temperature and humidity values, and the second has soil moisture and temperature conditions. The fog filters cluster the unlabelled data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms that group data into categories according to their value ranges in all experiments. Supervised learning classification methods are also used to predict the class of data samples from these categories. After that, the fog filter compresses the identified categories using two data compression techniques, run-length encoding (RLE) and the Huffman encoding, preserving the data time series nature. Our results reveal that a k-means combined with RLE method achieved the highest reduction, where the fog needed to store and transmit only 3%–6% of the original data generated by sensors.}

Street sweeping is a day to day activity of the sweepers of the Municipal Corporation. Due to limited manpower and the vast geographical area, this cleaning activity cannot be done effectively on a daily basis in every area. Mechanization of the road sweeping activity is hence gaining importance. In Metro cities, the cleaning of highways is done by using certain cleaning attachments over Vehicles. There are a range of machine tools available in the market which are either powered using certain fuels or in the form of vehicle attachments. Considering the need for automated cleaning using less manpower, we developed a Solar operated Street sweeping machine that can be used for cleaning small streets. The machine consists of a solar panel mounted on its top and a battery unit which can be used to used to power the entire machine. The electricity generated using the solar panel is stored in the battery which can be used to provide energy to operate the motor. The machine is made smart by including sensors for the Bin indicating system and for Obstacle detection. Though the initial cost of this machine is slightly higher, it can be considered as a good alternative for road cleaning.}

The emergence of new transport services that utilise technological innovations allows for new, more convenient ways to provide demand-responsive transport services in areas with limited or no regular public transport service. The question is how the features of these new services are preferred by all age groups, in particular, those with limited mobility, such as the elderly. In this study, we evaluate the preference of the elderly toward Breng flex, a smart Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) service offered in two adjacent Dutch cities and their surroundings. We combine results from expert interviews (n = 4), a face-to-face survey with elderly non-users of Breng flex (n = 38), and an online survey of Breng flex users of all ages (n = 958). The results illustrate fourteen features of smart forms of DRT that are preferred by the elderly, three of which are identified here for the first time. We discuss the trade-off between various features for the case study area and make suggestions regarding the design of a mobility service that can improve accessibility of the elderly.}

abstract = {The potential of combining Internet-of-Medical-Things technology with medical cloud storage can greatly improve the current smart healthcare environment. But some critical obstacles arise when developing the two technologies. One of the most difficult aspects is how to efficiently guarantee medical data’s privacy and authentication since the biomedical sensors (BMSs), implanted on patient’s body, have very limited battery life and computing abilities. Another one is to check the integrity of data stored on medical cloud. In this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight, especially for the BMSs, data management model for healthcare system, in which a BMS only needs to perform symmetric encryption consisting of XOR and message-authentication-code (MAC) operations. The adopted encryption technique ensures the privacy and authentication of medical data. Moreover, an aggregated homomorphic certificateless signature scheme is also proposed for the personal-assisted device and server device, which guarantees the public verifiability of medical data stored on cloud. Meanwhile, the certificateless property naturally implies that the whole system is immune to key-escrow attack. Finally, the detailed performance analysis and comparisons with related works show that our proposed system is very competitive in terms of communication overheads and computational costs.}

The new generation of smart district heating and cooling networks, for instance, pledges efficient energy distribution, flexibility and low-carbon energy integration. However, in the literature it is hard to find comprehensive frameworks for the integrated setup and testing of smart control strategies. This paper defines and demonstrates a framework that involves all steps of the controller development for small-scale district heating networks: from conceptualization to prototype testing. The innovative controller prototype, which relies on Model Predictive Control and aims to minimize operating costs and/or energy, is demonstrated in three original case studies, one in a simulation environment and two in real systems of different complexity in operational conditions. Compared to the control approaches previously adopted, based on predefined rules and operator experience, the smart solution achieves 6% reduction in cost and up to 34% reduction in energy consumption while meeting user requirements. The fast replicability of the proposed integrated methodology can foster the transition toward the next generation of smart heating networks.}

This paper develops a new framework based on privacy reinforcement learning to accurately identify anomalous patterns in a distributed and heterogeneous energy environment. The local outlier factor is first performed to derive the local simple anomalous patterns in each site of the distributed energy platform. A reinforcement privacy learning is then established using blockchain technology to merge the local anomalous patterns into global complex anomalous patterns. Besides, different optimization strategies are suggested to improve the whole outlier detection process. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, intensive experiments have been carried out on well-known CASAS (Center of Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems) platform.

abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid development in industrialization and urbanization with a huge growth in the population throughout the world. In this regard, an efficient and robust decision-making framework for the concept of a green city and sustainable development goals to manage municipal plastic wastes is still needed. This study models a bio-recovery of municipal different plastic wastes management based on a new integrated Multi-Criterion Decision-Making (MCDM) approach through a case study in Mashahd, Iran. The proposed integrated MCDM framework includes the Shannon Entropy (SE), Ordered Weighted Aggregation (OWA), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and, ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) systems in an intelligent way. Through decision-making computations, all criteria are approved after extraction from the literature review by experts with more than 60% agreement percentage. Different scenarios of economic, energy, and environmental crises are created. One finding of this paper is to propose a new entrance in economic competition with plastic biodegradation to present a novel, environmental-friendly product with high-quality and low-cost advantages. Another finding determines that with an application of plastic wastes bio-recovery, citizens' satisfaction from urban management system will be increased from 49% to 64%. Whereas, based on the outcomes of this investigation, the rate of municipal waste industries development, smart city goals’ meeting, and rate of hazardous material emission from municipal solid wastes are increased to 58%, 25%, and 70%, respectively. The declared numerical outcomes illustrate the effectiveness of plastic waste bio-recovery on the smart city concept.}

abstract = {Application of nano/micro structures has become popular in a wide range of advanced engineering systems in recent years. For a better insight, this paper presents an intensive numerical study on the static and dynamic responses of smart functionally graded microplates with graphene platelets (GPLs) reinforcement under concurrently mechanical and electrical loads. To this end, a powerful and effective numerical model based on refined plate theory (RPT), modified couple stress theory (MCST) and NURBS-based isogeometric analysis (IGA) is introduced to predict the complex behaviors of small-scale structures. Wherein, the MCST containing only one material length scale parameter is utilized to capture the size-dependent effects while the four-variable RPT-based IGA approach is exploited to describe the displacement field. The host microplate can be constituted by four different GPLs dispersions and integrated with two symmetric piezoelectric layers. A closed-loop control procedure based on displacement and velocity feedback gains is employed to actively control the static and dynamic responses of smart small-scale structures, which takes into account the structural damping effect. Several numerical examples are performed to examine the influence of some key parameters such as geometry, material length scale parameter, boundary condition, dynamic load, input electrical voltage as well as weight fraction and distribution of GPLs.}

Up-to-date demand models are needed to capture the impact of these policies on emerging mobility-enabled travel patterns. The study explores modeling requirements to assess the impact of such built environment policies. A synthetic population of New York City with a tour-based nested logit mode choice model was developed with accessibility to bikesharing and ride hail services via smartphone ownership. The model results suggest Manhattanites have a value of time of $29/h, consistent with the literature. Smartphone ownership is positively influenced by income and negatively influenced by age, and in turn negatively impacts Citi Bike ridership relative to other modes available. The synthetic population is also applied to analyze two city-scale built environment scenarios: a hypothetical Amazon headquarter deployment and a Citi Bike service expansion. If Amazon succeeded in Long Island City, it would have increased the number of trips to/from that neighborhood by 239%, of which FHVs would grow by over 441% and transit by 294%. It would have led to an increase of peak morning trips from 5000 up to at least 8000. Citi Bike’s expansion plan would grow ridership by 92%, and if they were able to expand efficiently throughout NYC this would grow further to 210% over the baseline.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to forecast day-ahead electricity consumption for residential households where highly irregular human behaviour plays a significant role. The methodology requires data from fiscal smart meters, which makes it applicable to real scenarios where personal data gathering is not feasible. These data are rarely complete; therefore, a robust combination of machine-learning techniques is used to handle missing data and outliers. The novelty of this method relies on identifying and predicting user electricity consumption behaviour as a procedure to improve the forecasting of the overall electricity consumption of each individual customer. The methodology uses Gaussian mixture clustering to identify behaviour clusters and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classification (XGBoost) model to predict the day-ahead behaviour pattern. This predicted user behaviour cluster is fed into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to enable an improved capturing of the highly unpredictable user conduct for the forecast of electricity consumption. A novel metric, namely the Euclidean Distance-based Accuracy (EDA), is finally proposed to enable a more thorough evaluation of time series classification algorithms. The whole development is tested over 500 residential users placed in a southeastern region of Spain. The results showed that, when the novel approach was used, the MAPEd and NRMSEd were reduced by 7% and 9% respectively, increasing to a 20% and 17% respective reduction for the best cases according to EDA. This methodology sets the basis for massive user-centred analyses, very profitable to any electricity company.}

It is expected that a huge number of sensors and access points (APs) are utilized in a smart home network in an integrated way to fulfill the necessary functionalities in homes and buildings. In this regard, energy optimization and providing network connectivity have an extremely important role in enabling smart home network in its mission. In this paper, we investigate the optimal measures that can be used to more optimally manage the sensor nodes traffic distribution between the available APs in a smart home network while considering joint constraints on the average energy consumption of the nodes and also the full coverage and connectivity across the network. In particular, we consider a typical smart home network scenario with multiple number of sensor nodes and APs distributed within the network area where the sensors have the freedom to choose between any neighboring APs for data communication that can better improve the energy efficiency and connectivity of the network. Accordingly, we consider constraints on the average battery consumption of the sensor nodes and also the energy consumption at the APs to improve energy efficiency and life-time of the smart home network. Moreover, an additional constraint is considered to guarantee the necessary full network connectivity and coverage across the proposed smart home network. In this regard, we consider a cost model for a typical smart home network and form an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the cost of the network while taking into account aforementioned constraints on the consumed energy by the sensor nodes and APs, and also addressing the coverage and connectivity requirements in the network. Finally, the benefits of using the proposed optimization problem in smart home networks are discussed and numerical results and comparisons regarding various operating scenarios are provided.}

A consequence of an aging population is that more people will require care and additional skilled healthcare staff to support them, resulting in increased healthcare costs. Smart homes can provide a cost-effective solution to the rising healthcare costs of the increasingly elderly population while allowing individuals the opportunity to live independently at home. The wide range of sensors within a Smart home generates large volumes of data, at a high velocity in a variety of formats. Big Data Analytics can be utilized to analyze the Big Data generated to improve the wellbeing of the elderly residents including identification of anomalies in behavior, such as fall detection, and pre-emptive identification of the onset of medical complications. However, there are many challenges of converting existing homes into Smart homes. This chapter discusses ambient-assisted living (AAL), Smart homes, Big Data, and the importance of Big Data Analytics and its application to Smart homes to support AAL for the purpose of geriatric rehabilitation. Several examples are provided throughout this chapter, which highlight the benefits of this technology.}

Our goal is to find an accurate method to predict electrical energy consumption and production. Being able to anticipate how consumers will use energy in the near future, homeowners, companies and governments may optimize their behavior and the import and export of electricity. We evaluated the ARIMA and TBATS statistical prediction methods and compared them with other models on datasets from a household equipped with photovoltaics and an energy management system.

abstract = {Managing the intermittency of renewable sources together with transient (hourly to daily to seasonal) energy demands is one of the principal challenges of delivering a net-zero energy system. Smart multifunctional thermo-chemical energy networks represent an alternative energy network and storage system, a solution based on the distribution of energy via thermo-chemical material rather than thermal energy, gas, fuels or electricity– an option that has scope for integrated short- and long-term energy storage. This is the first research work to realise such a system and demonstrate how it might operate using smart control strategies and how thermo-chemical fluids (TCFs) can be used as a medium for timely energy storage and distribution. The experimental study also describes the effect of steady and variable heat sources on TCF regeneration performance and estimates the potential of thermo-chemical energy networks, which would be particularly beneficial in buildings with high energy consumption for humidity control. This research proves the practicality of the design idea for such a network, which would be governed by centralised control, regenerated by steady or transient heat loads and capable of supplying a variety of demands in an experimental setting. The energy and economic potential of the network were also assessed, identifying temperature and humidity control application scenarios with energy savings of more than 60% compared to conventional operation and payback periods of 6.6–9.7 years.}

However, as both CE and DTs are emerging fields, there exists little systematic guidance on how DTs can be applied to capture the full potential of circular strategies for improving resource efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, there is little insight into the supporting business analytics (BA) capabilities required to accomplish this. To address this gap, this paper conducts a theory- and practice-based review, resulting in the Smart CE framework that supports translating the circular strategies central to the goals of manufacturing companies in contributing the United Nation’s (UN) 12th Sustainable Development Goal, that is, “sustainable consumption and production,” into the BA requirements of DTs. Both scholars and practitioners may find the framework useful to (1) create a common language for aligning activities across the boundaries of disciplines such as information systems and the CE body of knowledge, and (2) identify the gap between the current and entailed BA requirements and identify the strategic initiatives needed to close it. Additionally, the framework is used to organize a database of case examples to identify some best practices related to specific smart circular strategies.}

abstract = {Earth's plastic pollution has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the world is on the doorstep of an enormous waste pandemic. The extensive use of mandatory personal protectives like masks, gloves, and PPE kits and the lack of proper waste management systems lead to a rise in the plastic pollution content of the earth. Such disposable and non-biodegradable personal protectives are thrown out to the environment after use. These distributed wastes pollute land, soil, and water bodies and effects their ecosystems. This research work establishes the concept of a waste-to-energy conversion approach to reuse COVID-19 scraps for green and sustainable development. Three-layered surgical masks and nitrile gloves were reused in this work after sterilization for energy harvesting and sensing applications by fabricating a 3D-printed contact-separation-based triboelectric nanogenerator. A piece of three-layered mask and nitrile gloves were placed inside the 3D structure as the top negative and bottom positive triboelectric materials with copper and aluminum as corresponding electrodes (MG-CS TENG). It can convert external mechanical motions into electrical energy. The maximum voltage, current, and power density obtained from the device are 50.7 V, 4.8 µA, and 6.39 µW/cm2, respectively, for a mechanical force of 9 N. The harvested energy was sufficient to power small-scale electronic devices like digital tally counters, wristwatches, lumex displays, and series connected 25 LEDs. MG-CS TENG was also performed as a pedal-operated touch sensor to dispense hand sanitizer. MG-CS TENG was pedal pressed to trigger a microcontroller and control the solenoid valve's opening and closing to regulate sanitizer flow. The setup was integrated using the internet of things (IoT) and Blynk cloud services for the remote monitoring and controlling of the sanitizer dispenser using a smartphone. This work contributes a substantial role in disaster management to suppress microplastic environmental pollution by reusing pandemic wastes for energy harvesting and sensing applications and preventing the spread of coronavirus through proper hand sanitization.}
