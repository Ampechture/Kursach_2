abstract = {Reducing the amount of electricity used by cooling systems is essential for lowering CO2 emissions; therefore suppressing increases in room temperature in an environmentally friendly manner requires the development of heat-shielding materials that autonomously control sunlight without the use of electricity. Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) has attracted attention as a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) type of temperature-responsive polymer. HPC is a thermochromic material that changes its optical properties in response to changes in external temperature. In this study, acrylamide (AAm) and HPC with various molecular weights were used to prepare HPC-AAm hydrogels, and their optical, heat-shielding, and weathering-resistant properties were evaluated. UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy revealed that the solar transmittance (αTsol) of the HPC-AAm hydrogel decreased while its solar reflectance (αRsol) increased with increasing HPC concentration above LCST. The αTsol of low-molecular-weight HPC was found to be lower than that of high-molecular-weight HPC. In addition, the temperature inside a box constructed using an HPC-AAm hydrogel window was approximately 10 °C lower than that constructed using glass alone. Furthermore, the optical properties of the HPC-AAm hydrogel were found to hardly deteriorated even when continuously exposed to heat and UV radiation for 150 h. Therefore, the HPC-AAm hydrogel prepared in this study is expected to be useful as a heat-shielding material.}

The optimisation analysis of a seaport grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system is presented, comparing the impact of two dispatch strategies and three energy storage systems. Seventeen scenarios have been examined regarding the possible combinations of the most mature renewable and energy storage systems according to the Levelised Cost of Energy, environmental footprint, and future employability. Vanadium Redox Flow Battery based Hybrid Renewable Energy System employed offering 10-h port services' autonomy. For the grid-connected net metering and 24-h port autonomy, the optimal Levelised Cost of Energy is 12.9 c€/kWh. The overall optimum was 8.0 c€/kWh, incorporating 10-h port services' autonomy. All the alternative cases proved much lower of the Levelised Cost of Energy could be much lower than the current grid's tariff. Peak shaving strategy is proven to be more efficient for seaports than cycle charging, resulting in improved energy management and lower energy billing costs by setting peak monthly demand limits. The emissions are diminished to zero, as the net grid purchases are zero, incorporating totally green infrastructure. The nearly Zero Energy Port concept proved to be a viable and feasible solution for ports towards sustainability.}

Specifically, the paper affords the conclusion that in most instances of home automation, a potential topological place to start the blockchain is in the home gateway that supports the processing and computing required to aggregate or in-network-preprocess the data flows from the various appliances; however, the computing and storage requirements may limit this deployment paradigm to a subset of cases. Alternatively, the place to start the blockchain could be in the fog-to-core gateway point, but in this case this process does not fully guarantee end-to-end integrity. The actual Proof of Work (PoW) functionality would likely be in the core network and not in the relatively low computing-power home gateway. Another alternative envisions private local blockchains to be instituted in the home area network, but still not necessarily for all appliance-generated transactions due to the large volume of such status, event, and usage data.}

This paper attempts to design and develop a smart aquaponics system that can synergize fish farming and plant growing. Various sensors, actuators, microcontroller, and microprocessor were employed in the system to monitor and control water quality, light intensity, and fish feed. To ensure healthy growing environment for fish and plant, early warnings in form of email, short message service, and push notification are automatically sent to the user when the sensor detects any abnormal condition. Concurrently, the respective actuator will intervene and rectify the abnormal condition without human interference. Moreover, fish feed is dispensed at the user preset timings of the day. All system activities and live sensor measurements are securely stored in a cloud storage for data analysis. User-friendly web and mobile applications were also created to provide graphical user interfaces between the aquaponics system and the user. Additionally, the user can monitor the aquaponics facilities live from web application through a camera module of the system. As such, the proposed smart aquaponics system has demonstrated to be a self-sustainable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly urban farming that can attract commercial farmers and home gardeners.}

They are characterised by high variability and are modelled by large Variability Models (VMs), leading to large configuration spaces. Due to the high number of variants present in such systems, it is challenging to find the best-ranked product regarding particular Quality Attributes (QAs) in a short time. Moreover, measuring QAs sometimes is not trivial, requiring a lot of time and resources, as is the case of the energy footprint of software systems — the focus of this paper. Hence, we need a mechanism to analyse how features and their interactions influence energy footprint, but without measuring all configurations. While practical, sampling and predictive techniques base their accuracy on uniform spaces or some initial domain knowledge, which are not always possible to achieve. Indeed, analysing the energy footprint of products in large configuration spaces raises specific requirements that we explore in this work. This paper presents SAVRUS (Smart Analyser of Variability Requirements in Unknown Spaces), an approach for sampling and dynamic statistical learning without relying on initial domain knowledge of large and partially QA-measured spaces. SAVRUS reports the degree to which features and pairwise interactions influence a particular QA, like energy efficiency. We validate and evaluate SAVRUS with a selection of likewise systems, which define large searching spaces containing scattered measurements.}

At the same time, an increasing interest is rising about local energy systems using renewable energy sources (RES). In this paper, the creation of a monitoring and managing procedure of an electricity micro-smart grid in a small agro-food enterprise is presented. Scopes of the procedure are both the minimization of the energy exchange between the local grid and the public utility grid and the optimization of the exploitation of renewable sources. To achieve that, it was necessary to match energy demand and supply in as short as possible time steps, trying to create a self-sufficient small district. The two objectives above can also generate financial savings due to the reduction of the electricity purchase from the grid. The agro-industrial test site is a prosumer (both a producer and a consumer of energy) and it was equipped with wireless networks of smart meters and devices, monitoring generators and loads, a data acquisition tool and a user interface that shows the monitoring results and suggests the optimization strategies of the smart grid to be undertaken.}

abstract = {This paper answers an important question consensually identified as crucial for smart grid roll-out. Our objective is to highlight the reasons for economic, technological and regulatory uncertainty continuing in the smart grid sector. The argument of this paper is that to face uncertainty, actors adopted strategic positioning but not systematically favoring the emergence of a structuring and shared vision of smart grid. However, converging visions are necessary to limit uncertainty and thus secure the sector’s development and durability in the coming years. The results presented here are based on two methodological approaches. First, a social network analysis of worldwide relationships between smart grid actors has been performed to characterize the actors’ positioning strategies. The paper identifies four categories of actors: local observers, global observers, experimenters, and central actors. Second, a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with approximately 30 French smart grid stakeholders gave us information on discourses and perceptions of the sector's reality and constraints. It appeared that smart grid merges both long-established actors in the smart grid focal sector, i.e., energy, promoting a highly accurate but strictly energy-oriented perception, and new entrants coming from related sectors such as ICT, offering an open but indistinct perspective. Therefore, stakeholders diverge on the definition and potential source of added value. These results help to elucidate the transition of socio-technical systems. Indeed, at this very moment when contextual uncertainty remains high, it appears that actors from the focal sector play a crucial part in driving the current sector development, whereas new entrants remain unable to modify the sector’s regime decisively. One can interpret this situation as a sign of the failure of the smart grid sector to emerge as such. Conversely, one can see here an evolution of focal actors’ strategies regarding uncertainty in an innovative socio-technical system in transition. To solve this issue, further studies should be conducted both on the smart grid sector to see how it will evolve and on other sectors to search for similar trends.}

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are established as drivers of this new wave of change in the redefinition of the relationship between the city and its citizens. Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICTs involving directly local governments, citizens and communities. Open data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be appropriately elaborated, communicated and used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities: free and readily available services based on the wealth of information ‘owned’ by local governments. Adopting a design science research methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between citizens and city-government may be devised. On this point, the focus is on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations and visualisations as a means for the local government to create new and open services for citizens and communities. The use of the services prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city government. These interactions may be used to foster an open innovation ecosystem.}

This study investigates the potential sources and human health risks of REEs contained in the topsoils of the industrial Russian city of Chelyabinsk. The study also takes into account natural sources of REE as the city is located on the border of granites (Urals) and sedimentary rocks (Western Siberia). We analyzed the concentration and distribution of REEs in the soils of four types of locations: residential courtyards, city parks, roadsides, and industrial locations. The total REE concentrations ranged from 44 to 255 mg/kg, with average concentrations of 140, 124, 113 and 89 mg/kg in the courtyards, roadsides, industrial location and city parks, respectively. The REE content in courtyard soils could be influenced by poor cleaning of fallen leaves. The ratios of light REE (LREE) to heavy REE (HREE) ranged from 9.5 to 10.1, revealing an obvious fractionation between them. The fractionation of LREE and HREE, and the REE/ES (European Shale) pattern showed that REE accumulation in Chelyabinsk soils has been disturbed by human activities. It was shown that the dust from industrial emissions was the main anthropogenic source of REE accumulation in urban soil. The largest amounts of REEs are emitted from an electrometallurgical plant and zinc production plant. Fortunately, the estimated daily intakes of REE from soils for children and adults were well below the safety thresholds. At the same time, in order to prevent social tension and reduce the anthropogenic load on the urban area, it is recommended to use phytoremediation technologies, smart landscaping of industrial and residential areas, more thorough cleaning of fallen leaves and road dust. It is also recommended to move the most dangerous production processes outside the urban area.}

Smart toy data exchange is a new powerful area. However, there is no efficient, secure and reliable data exchange mechanism among isolated smart toy data platforms and other IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a smart-toy-edge-computing-oriented data exchange prototype using Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. We target to solve the issue of automatically maintaining a tamper-resistant, reliable and distributed ledger by writing smart contract in the environment where the participants are distrustful of each other. This prototype can simplify the process, save resources and ensure a fair solution of dispute. This method also facilitates the implementation of P2P data exchange among the isolated smart toy and other IoT systems.}

Some of the new research and development policies are aimed at development of novel and renewable hybrid systems, shift from unit to integration technology; implementation of demand-side management; move from centralized macro to decentralized micro technologies, etc. Recognizing the importance of trigeneration in future energy mix, hybrid renewable trigeneration systems - with integration of photovoltaic-thermal (PVT), ground source heat pump (GSHP) and smart control - were developed for a small commercial building. This paper discusses the energy and cost performance as well as GHG emissions of these systems sized to meet building space heating/cooling loads and HVAC electric power requirements. The results enhance the knowledge and provide useful information to designers on how these trigeneration systems should be applied under variety of conditions, what are their advantages in comparison to a single ground source heat pump system, and what are the energy, economic and GHG emission impacts of smart communications and artificial intelligence controls.}

abstract = {Urban dashboards form part of a wider ecosystem of urban data platforms and products being created and used in an age of ever-increasing digitalisation of city services and governance. The design of these dashboards typically consolidates information into a single view for government and industry to efficiently and effectively monitor the performance of urban systems – such as those of energy, built form, transport, culture, performance, innovation and health. Many of these dashboards focus on a one-way flow of data and thus do not cater specifically to the functions of public participation, community engagement and collaboration. With growing concerns in digital democracy, there is an increasing demand for software and tools that maximise human-centred design elements and include such participatory and collaborative features. The current trajectory of their development can be reframed to support this. This review frames a more porous definition of the term, integrating the concept of the urban dashboard among other existing digital urban planning methods and tools. It highlights the potential for further work to integrate with emerging media such as virtual, augmented and mixed realities. Reflecting on a diverse range of literature, the result of this paper is a classification system and key recommendations for development and understanding participatory urban dashboards as they fall within the existing lexicon of Smart City platforms and technologies.}

MaaS could address many current challenges in transport and tourism, enabling visitors to spend less time planning their travel, and more time enjoying their visit. It also provides an avenue for businesses to reach out to potential visitors and customers. This paper explores opportunities and challenges for regional MaaS development, with a multi-county review of selected tourism applications of MaaS, including Finland, Japan, and Taiwan. Then, a regional applicability study was conducted in three Queensland (Australia) regional centres of varying forms – Townsville, Rockhampton-Yeppoon, and Gladstone. Stakeholder interviews and a workshop were conducted, followed by a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis across four dimensions: i) stakeholder collaboration, ii) technology, iii) operating environment, and iv) service and market. The results suggest that a multimodal tourism-based MaaS offering has better potential in a place with a diverse economy and a growing tourist offer. Respondents indicated that a successful MaaS requires close integration of various modes, and also non-transport value-adding services (e.g., events, accommodation or attractions). Significant challenges remain in intermodal integration, long term transport funding, and cooperation between various businesses and transport operators.}

Based on the basic connotation of Chinese-style modernization, an evaluation index system for the HQD of city clusters is constructed from five dimensions, namely, demographic advantages, coordinated regional development, material and cultural-ethical advancement, ecological sustainability, and opening-up. The HQD of 19 city clusters was measured from 2011 to 2021 using the entropy weight-CRITIC method, and the dynamic evolution, spatial correlation and long-term trend were analyzed. The study revealed that (1) the overall HQD of Chinese city clusters has shown continuous growth, and the spatial distribution of the gradient of HQD in the 'East, Center and West' has decreased, but the spatial pattern of 'South High and North Low' has further emerged. (2) The overall and intra-regional differences in the HQD of city clusters gradually narrowed, while the differences between city clusters remained significant. (3) The HQD of city clusters shows obvious positive spatial correlation and obvious spatial agglomeration characteristics, with high-value agglomerations mostly in mature-stage city clusters along the east coast. (4) There is an obvious 'club convergence' phenomenon in the HQD of city clusters; the higher the HQD of neighboring regions is, the greater the probability of upward HQD of city clusters, and the higher the quality of Chinese city clusters shows an upward trend in the long run.}

In this paper, we explore the potential for exploiting information retrieved from two IoT devices which, seemingly, are unlikely to store substantial amounts of data. We specifically focus on prominent smart home devices for the purpose of obtaining compromising information. We undertake a collection and analysis process, constrained by the limitations placed upon three types of adversaries, namely: forensic passive, forensic active and real-time active. The former two adversaries aim to comply with the requirements of forensic soundness, whereas the real-time active adversary does not have these constraints and therefore more closely models a malicious real-world attacker. The findings show that a variety of device data is available to even the passive adversary, and this data can be used to determine the actions and/or presence of an individual at a given time based on their interactions with the IoT device. These interactions can be both user initiated (e.g. powering on or off a switch or light) and device initiated (e.g. background polling).}

abstract = {Global food production needs to be doubled by 50% by the middle of 21st century to ensure the food and nutritional security for 9 billion people explicitly in the challenging scenarios such as land degradation, water scarcity and environmental pollution. Climate change is evident worldwide due to exponential rise in atmospheric carbon-di-oxide (eCO2) and temperature (eT). It leads to more complexity in achieving the sustainable food security. Grain legumes are the major sources of dietary proteins with multifaceted impact on ecosystem services. Being the C3 crops climate change (more specifically eCO2) usually has positive impact on physiology and productivity of grain legumes as compared to C4 cereal crops. Grain legumes can allocate the above ground photosynthates into the below ground parts like roots and nodules resulting improvement in plant biomass, rhizospheric activities and higher input (water and nutrients) use efficacy. However, the impact of eT on grain legume is not always favourable. High temperature explicitly in the reproductive phase is extremely deleterious causing flower abortion and abnormal pod filling. Besides, eT impairs the performance of grain legumes because of higher evaporative demand, poor root-microbial association and pest severity. Therefore, both agronomic and genetic interventions must be integrated to raise successful grain legumes and to achieve the targeted yield in the changing climatic conditions. The targeted breeding programmes should be selection of high yielding, biotic stress resistant and abiotic stress tolerant grain legume genotypes that are adapted to eCO2 and eT conditions. Further, integrating the grain legumes with desirable traits to the food production system might impart resilience towards climate change. In this comprehensive review the impacts of climate change (eCO2 and eT) on above and below ground crop growth, productivity, water use efficiency and disease-pest severity are thoroughly discussed. Further, climate smart technologies which make grain legumes as a perfect candidate crop in the future climatic condition are also highlighted.}

This paper presents a new methodology to leverage geo-referenced data, linking latent technology data to the municipalities' need for feedback and guidance on past and new investments supporting urban function identification via unsupervised algorithms. We propose a 3-step data-driven pipeline. In the first step, we collect geotagged images posted on Flickr and Instagram and treat them as points on a map. Then, through clustering techniques, we explore a city's geographic contours and investigate how the users' interaction with the city evolved. Eventually, we exploit classification tools to determine what primarily characterizes the city areas. The pipeline, which can be generalized to any geographical area at any level of detail, is verified for the city of Turin through peak detection and zoning tasks. The results demonstrate that the pipeline's outcomes are coherent with the city's traditional characterizations and that social data can provide valid support for the urban experts' analysis.}

The detour is achieved by having access to crowdsourced data of an imminent congestion on its route. In this paper, a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model is developed to develop an efficiency improvement model. Example using ramp exit 24 off interstate 405 (I-405) and I-605 in the Southern California Region show improvements in freight truck efficiencies for the detour. It is observed that almost 33% of freight trucks subscribed to crowdsourced information could use the ramp exit to avoid downstream congestion. Finally, formulation for probability mass function is also presented which can be used within traffic simulation software packages to enhance both passenger and truck freight operations using crowdsourcing}

Eight sensing transitions are successfully achieved by the 3-bit BRGC encoding patterns with two electrodes. One electrode represents the binary bit “0”; another electrode represents the binary bit “1”. A third electrode located in the middle of the disk is utilized to indicate the sliding directions (inward or outward). The output signal detection mechanism and signal processing circuit have been developed, and a Bluetooth transmitter is employed for enabling controlling applications wirelessly.

With the help of an exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis framework, this paper examined the spatiotemporal interactions of CEE across 110 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). In addition, a multiscale geographically weighted regression model was employed to reveal the scale effects of influencing factors on CEE. The main conclusions are as follows: first, the CEE of cities in the YREB shows a fluctuating upward trend, but the overall level is still low, and a certain polarization phenomenon exists. Second, the spatial pattern of the CEE of cities in the YREB is generally relatively stable, with strong spatial integration and path dependence. Finally, the factors influencing CEE exhibit obvious scale variability and spatial heterogeneity. Our findings can provide a basis for localized and differentiated carbon emission reduction decision-making at the city level, as well as new insights for the formulation of sustainable urban spatial planning and low-carbon development strategies.}

This study bridges two vital gaps in urban carbon neutrality research: unraveling the causal dynamics of carbon emissions within urban networks and forecasting emission trends. This study proposes a reinforcement learning-based causal discovery algorithm, progressively deciphering the complex causal relationships in global urban emissions, and facilitating the creation of directed acyclic causal graphs. Furthermore, a hyperbolic graph neural network-based forecasting algorithm is introduced, through integrated fusion curvature to improve the information transfer between cities, for predicting global urban emission trends. A comparative analysis positions these innovative algorithms against leading methods, using emission data from thousands of cities for predictions one, five, and ten steps ahead. The experiment employs prediction error metrics, Taylor statistics, the Diebold-Mariano test, and the ablation analysis for validation. Results reveal proposed causal discovery algorithm effectively identifies the causality of carbon emissions among cities, while the forecasting algorithm leads other competing models across all prediction ranges. Based on the effectiveness of the algorithms, this study decodes the significant nature of the global urban carbon emission network, offering policy insights for collaborative carbon mitigation in cities worldwide.}

But managing this natural capital is challenging for its biological complexity and interactions with other environmental, social, and economic aspects of the cities. In line with the current digital revolution with the rise of Smart Cities, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more common, including in urban forestry. In this systematic review, we evaluated 67 studies on the interplay between AI and urban forestry surveyed on Science Direct and Scopus to provide an overview of the state of the art and identify new research avenues. The sample includes studies in 23 countries and 85 cities, including 5 megacities, comprising the remote assessment of canopy cover and species distribution; ecosystem services assessment; management practices; and socioeconomic aspects of urban forestry. Most studies focused on extant urban forests, with few examples evaluating temporal trends, and only one focused on future scenarios despite the predictive potential of AI. A total of 22 AI methods were employed in these studies. Only half of them point to clear advantages of the chosen methods, such as robustness against missing data, overfitting, collinearity, non-linearity, non-normality, the combination of discrete and continuous variables, and higher accuracy. The choice of these methods depends on the various combinations of aim, timescale, data type, and data source. The application of AI in urban forestry is in full growth and will support decision making to improve livability in the cities.}

This paper proposes a methodology to indicate the order of priority, based on the characteristics of each system where there is the possibility of deployment of the smart grid. The methodology is to assess and quantify relevant criteria (technical, economic and environmental) for this deployment and apply the fuzzy logic to calculate a priority factor. This factor will help in the decision-making process for choosing the order of priority for deployment of smart grid analysed systems. This method was applied in the analysis of six local dealership systems and the results are presented in this paper.}

abstract = {The energy transition is increasingly being discussed and implemented to cope with the growing environmental crisis. However, great challenges remain for effectively harvesting and utilizing solar energy in cities related to time and location-dependant supply and demand, which needs more accurate forecasting- and an in-depth understanding of the electricity production and dynamic balancing of the flexible energy supplies concerning the electricity market. To tackle this problem, this article discusses the development of solar cities over the past few decades and proposes a refined and enriched concept of a sustainable solar city with six integrated modules, namely, land surface solar irradiation, three-dimensional (3D) urban surfaces, spatiotemporal solar distribution on 3D urban surfaces, solar photovoltaic (PV) planning, solar PV penetration into different urban systems, and the consequent socio-economic and environmental impacts. In this context, Geographical Information Science (GIScience) demonstrates its potent capability in building the conceptualized solar city with a dynamic balance between power supply and demand over time and space, which includes the production of multi-sourced spatiotemporal big data, the development of spatiotemporal data modelling, analysing and optimization, and geo-visualization. To facilitate the development of such a solar city, this article from the GIScience perspective discusses the achievements and challenges of (i) the development of spatiotemporal big data used for solar farming, (ii) the estimation of solar PV potential on 3D urban surfaces, (iii) the penetration of distributed PV systems in digital cities that contains the effects of urban morphology on solar accessibility, optimization of PV systems for dynamic balancing between supply and demand, and PV penetration represented by the solar charging of urban mobility, and (iv) the interaction between PV systems and urban thermal environment. We suggest that GIScience is the foundation, while further development of GIS models is required to achieve the proposed sustainable solar city.}

A novel method is proposed to evaluate the post-earthquake functionality of city building portfolios, which can serve as the foundation for assessing the seismic resilience of cities. This method incorporates multiple dimensions of functional evaluation, ranging from structural and nonstructural components to city building portfolios, elucidating the mechanism of functional assemblies from lower to higher dimensions. The calculation of the physical functionality of individual buildings relies on the functionalities of their structural and nonstructural components, which are determined using the functional mapping method. The impacts of infrastructure failures on the functionality of individual buildings are explored using the hierarchical belief rule base inference method based on the evidential reasoning algorithm (BRBI-ER). A technique that combines Point of Interest analysis and visual interpretation is utilized to classify building portfolios into three types: single-function building portfolios, multi-function building portfolios, and integrated-function building portfolios. A cumulative functional correlation model and an integrated functional correlation model using BRBI-ER are established to evaluate the functionality of these types of building portfolios. The results can contribute to predicting the risk of functional losses before earthquakes, guiding the recovery process after earthquakes, and taking proactive measures to improve the seismic resilience of cities.}

Energy management of such frameworks is essential to maximize the collective welfare. This paper addresses this issue by developing an energy management framework that accounts for flexible demand, storage devices and electric vehicles. Its two-level structure allows to address the energy exchanging among prosumers in the 1st stage, while the 2nd stage focuses on optimally schedule the different collective assets. A novel stochastic-interval model is proposed to handle with uncertainties from demand, renewable generation, vehicles’ behaviour and energy pricing. A case study is performed on a six-prosumer community. Results serve to validate the new tool and analyse the importance of smart devices. In addition, the new proposal allows to adopt different operating strategies. Actually, the total operating cost may increase by 90% if a pessimistic point of view is adopted while the importance of the vehicle-to-grid capability is marginal otherwise. Furthermore, the energy purchased could be reduced by 7% when adopting a community arrangement, supposing an improvement in the economy and environmental indicators of the network. Other relevant aspects are identified and discussed in depth.}

In this paper, we examined to what extent the evaluations of these three attributes can also explain the actual adoption of smart energy systems that facilitate sustainable energy use. Results showed that adopters of smart energy systems (who agreed to participate in a project in which these systems were tested) evaluated the symbolic attributes of these systems more positively than non-adopters (who did not participate in this project), while both groups did not differ in their evaluation of the instrumental and environmental attributes of smart energy systems. A logistic regression analysis indicated that only evaluations of the symbolic attributes explained actual adoption of smart energy systems. Policy could stress and enhance the symbolic attributes of sustainable innovations to encourage adoption.}

We draw on an international magazine and online media content analysis of the 21st Century smart home, alongside 10 interviews conducted with Australian smart home industry professionals. The analysis explores the contradiction between complexity and simplicity embedded in smart home industry visions, where an expanded range of devices, services and options are marketed as a way to simplify and enhance everyday practices. A promoted side-benefit is reduced and more efficient energy consumption. We unpack the expectations embodied in this current convenience narrative to show how smart home devices may transform everyday practices in ways which result in increased energy consumption and household labour. The paper concludes by calling for energy research and scholarship which seeks to disrupt the convenience and other smart home narratives.}

We postulate that a new narrative of ‘urban degrowth economics’ is necessary to operationalise degrowth on a larger scale. Analysing the strategies and policies of cities that represent selected networks or phenomena through the lens of such a narrative can demonstrate which of the current approaches to urban development are the closest to degrowth values. By juxtaposing degrowth proposals with the main themes analysed in urban economics, we propose criteria for urban degrowth economics. We then apply these criteria to assess selected case study cities that represent the following networks and phenomena: C40 (Copenhagen), Transition Towns (Totnes), doughnut economics (Amsterdam), and shrinking cities (Detroit).}

As enclosed spaces, public transit systems (e.g., buses and metros) in densely populated areas are locations where physical encounters occur numerously. Currently, encounter networks in bus systems have been investigated with the help of smart card data (SCD); however, no attempt has been made toward the metro systems, which is more challenging as the travel behaviors of metro passengers are complex but not recorded in the SCD in detail. This study proposed a novel framework for investigating physical encounters of individuals in urban metro systems with SCD. First, we developed a method to match passengers to specific trains, which can allow the segmentation of individual trips inside a metro system. Second, we proposed an approach to measuring the encounter frequencies and durations of each passenger pair by synthesizing their encounter behaviors in not only the train space, but also the entering/exiting space and the transfer space. Finally, using the SCD of Shenzhen, China, we analyzed the physical encounter patterns at a population scale, and demonstrated the potential of applying the encounter network to trace the spread of infectious diseases. Overall, this study provided a framework for evaluating physical encounters in metro systems with SCD, and revealed the underlying physical encounter patterns in the metro system of a metropolitan city, which is of considerable application value.}

The development of a lightweight communication approach for big data traffic that can prevent or quickly respond to the occurrence of network congestion presents an interesting challenge with respect to computing power and bandwidth limits.

This work proposes a probabilistic topic model, adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual-level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the activity-travel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document, and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity. The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes—the location, start time of day, start day of week, and duration of each activity episode. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London, U.K. The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activities—home, work, and other. As the specified number of activity categories increases, more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge, and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve. This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules.}

We tested the factors that influence individuals’ interest and actual participation in smart energy systems. We compared the predictive power of the value-belief-norm theory with a novel model to explain pro-environmental actions: the value-identity-personal norm model. Both focus on normative considerations in explaining behaviour, but the VIP model focuses on general rather than behaviour-specific antecedents. Our results show that both models explained a similar amount of variance in interest and actual participation in smart energy systems. This suggests that the value-identity-personal norm model is a promising model to explain and promote pro-environmental actions such as participation in smart grids. Further, it is more parsimonious than the value-belief-norm theory and focuses on general factors that are likely to predict other environmental behaviours as well. The value-identity-personal norm model is therefore a particularly promising model in promoting a range of environmental behaviours.}

They use sensor and actuator networks deployed on people and the surrounding environment. Such networks are complex systems with distributed configurations. This issue causes difficulties in their development and configuration. To alleviate these problems, simulations become a key tool. They provide controlled environments to develop and test components. However, the use of simulations has downsides. Their development usually demands multidisciplinary groups, where misunderstandings due to different backgrounds are frequent. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) can help to alleviate this kind of problems. This paper introduces a framework for the development of simulations of Smart Roads following the Model-Driven Architecture (a specific MDE approach). It extends an existing MDE framework for simulations of road traffic with specific elements for Smart Roads (e.g., sensors and services). Two different Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are respectively modeled to address these issues. The proposed framework also provides two specific support tools: a code generator to transform the models into source code, and an agent-based simulation platform for road traffic. A case study illustrates how to adapt the produced model specifications to the specific requirements of the road traffic platform. These specifications are included into a simulation based on tracking vehicles using sensors. Promising results have been obtained showing the viability of the proposal.}

abstract = {Nowadays, as set by the EU 20-20-20 targets, the reduction of primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector can be attained by increasing the use of renewable sources and improving energy efficiency. Many national and international research programs are aiming at developing innovative technologies and new energy management strategies in order to reach the targets set out in the 20-20-20 directive. In this context, a primary role is played by the Distributed Generation (DG), which refers to the electrical and thermal generation located near to the place of use, exploiting available renewable sources. One of the best way to exploit the emerging potential of DG is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a whole concept called “microgrid.” The sources can operate in parallel to the grid or can operate in island, providing utility power station services. Utilization of waste heat from the sources will increase total efficiency, making the polygeneration microgrid more financially attractive and “smart” from the energy consumption standpoint. The “smartness” is also in the management system, where control strategies aiming at the optimization of technical, economical and environmental issues are typically implemented. This paper deals with smart microgrids, addressing basically the following topics: (1) to review methods, models, tools, technologies and research challenges in the specific field; (2) to present the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), built with the financial contribution of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research at the decentralized Savona Campus facilities. The SPM produces energy at low emissions for the University and operates as a test-bed facility for research, testing and development of smart grid components.}

In Kazakhstan, people receive color statuses depending on the vaccination status, which can be checked through mobile phones. Depending on this colour, different restrictions are imposed. This status, along with the presence of a facemask, is checked in public places. However, security workers may overlook or ignore visitors without facemasks or dangerous status. To address these issues, the following paper presents a method for automating the checking procedure of the visitors at the entrance to any building. The automatic door opener is programmed using Python and OpenCV image processing library. This door opener can identify the green color from the display of the mobile phone placed in front of the camera as well as the presence of the facemask on the human face. The door is opener sends signals to the Arduino microcontroller, which actuates the motor to open the door if all the above-mentioned conditions are satisfied. The main feature of this project is that a build-in face recognizer was used to classify the human faces on masked and non-masked. Despite this, such a method shows good accuracy of 99% in identifying non-masked faces and 77% if a masked face test dataset is used. This project has the potential benefit of automating the checkup process, avoiding the crowds’ formation in front of the door, and facilitating the work of security guards.}

Series of fundamental experiments are carried out. The two-phase heat transfer at the helically coiled tube is affected linearly by a heat flux and system pressure. However, it has nearly the same value at the high quality region regardless of the pressure change. The condensate heat transfer depends on the tube diameter and the mass flux at the PRHRS heat exchanger. The condensate heat transfer increases at a high steam flow, low pressure and large diameter. The calculation results of MARS and TASS/SMR codes are predicted to have similar values because the two codes incorporate the same heat transfer correlations for a helically coiled tube and condensate heat exchanger.}

However, the challenge is that people have different needs (or attitudes toward smart homes), and provision should be tailored to individuals. A few studies have classified the functions of smart homes. Therefore, the Kano model is first adopted as a theoretical base to explore whether the functional classifications of smart homes are attractive or necessary, or both. Second, three models and test user attitudes toward three function types of smart homes are proposed. Based on the Kano model, the principal results, namely, two “Attractive Quality” and nine “Indifferent Quality” items, are found. Verification of the hypotheses also indicates that the entertainment, security, and automation functions are significantly correlated with the variables “perceive useful” and “attitude.” Cost consideration is negatively correlated with attitudes toward entertainment and automation. Results suggest that smart home providers should survey user needs for their product instead of merely producing smart homes based on the design of the builder or engineer.}

The ongoing European smart city project SINFONIA offers the chance to analyze a double international case study, and to estimate expected positive effects on dwellings’ value, due to energy retrofit measures undertaken at the district level. This paper, starting from previous similar experiences, designs an operational approach based on spatial hedonic price method and analytic hierarchy process.

However, the acceleration data were recorded for only 4 subjects on one day. In this study, we carry out additional experiments increasing the number of subjects and adding the data recorded on other day. The results show that although the correctly classified rate when the phone is in the pocket is not yet affected by the number of subjects, the performance in the cases of calling and touching is influenced by the small number of subjects. Interestingly, we observe that the additional data on other day have a different effect on identification performance according to phone holding states. We also examine the influence of various walking states for one subject. Furthermore, we discuss the application of an immunity-based diagnosis model to gait recognition to integrate the identification results from multiple smart phone sensors.}

Decarbonization, Digitalization and Decentralization are considered the main key drivers for this power system transition and Brazil is no exception to this universal trend. A search of the literature revealed few studies which attempt to address the main challenges and opportunities towards a smart grid power system in Brazil. This paper provides an up-to-date assessment of the present and potential capabilities of existing and future technologies, regulations and policies and attempts to identify how these elements are interrelated. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that policies for Distributed Generation (DG), Demand-Side Management (DSM) and new tariff schemes are on a path of accelerated deployment in the country. The deployment of storage technologies, however, is at a slow pace of growth. We highlight the need to further develop new business models to address the various decentralized energy technologies and services that are emerging in the sector. The current net-metering system is considered a key issue to be addressed as this regulatory structure may shift the costs from DG to non-DG users.}

abstract = {Smart buildings generally adopt a centralized optimal control for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to improve the building system performance. As a crucial technology adopted in smart buildings, Internet of Things (IoT) based wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are promising platforms for implementing novel distributed optimal control to achieve distributed intelligence effectively. Such a future mist computing paradigm can be hindered by the limited energy resource of WSNs. The event-driven optimization method activates the optimization only when events occur. It can save the energy resource of WSNs, and thus pave the way for implementing the distributed optimal control architecture in IoT-based WSNs. This study therefore proposes an event-driven multi-agent based distributed optimal control strategy for HVAC systems for implementation in IoT-based battery-powered WSNs. The strategy consists of two novel schemes. First, an event determination scheme determines the event threshold by comprehensively considering the system performance and the total energy consumption of individual sensors implementing the distributed optimal control architecture. Second, an event-driven distributed optimization scheme solves the optimization problems with distributed optimization algorithms in IoT sensors of limited data processing capacity when an event occurs. Comparison and case studies are conducted to compare different strategies and validate the proposed strategy. Results show that different strategies require very different sensor energy consumption. The proposed strategy can provide satisfactory system performance while reducing the energy consumption of IoT sensors.}

A total of 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the project co-ordinators, community advocates for active travel and retail traders (shops and small businesses). The results indicated that the Smarter Travel co-ordinators were inexperienced in using a full range of pricing, programming and policy measures specific to active travel. A more significant factor was the power of the trader lobby. In the town with the lower population density, car accessibility in the urban centre was perceived by retail traders to be directly associated with retail turnover. In the town with the higher population density, retail traders stated that car accessibility created an illusion of vibrancy that provided security to the retail sector. The retail traders disliked the local authority’s didactic approach to consultation and this dissonance manifested itself in displays of power against the local authority and not necessarily against Smarter Travel per se. Both local authorities struggled to sell the business case for car restrictive policies to the retail traders. They also failed to engage the silent majority in the wider community to act as advocates for active travel. The wider implications for the implementation of Smarter Travel policy are presented. It is important to create community support for active travel interventions by forming ‘town user’ forums and active travel lobby groups and making the local media partners in the project. Training and support should be provided to local authorities to deliver a more comprehensive suite of measures. A toolkit should be developed for local authorities to create a business case for introducing car restrictive measures. Incentives such as improvements to the public realm and accessibility for cyclists should be introduced before car restrictive measures. Car restrictive measures should be introduced incrementally such as introducing temporary pedestrianization or gradually reducing parking supply thereby demonstrating the benefits of the measure to stakeholders.}

The proposed system comprises an intelligent model in which traffic lights are connected to the remote server through the Internet. The primary objective of the proposed system is to estimate the real-time traffic congestion on the roads based on enhanced image-processing techniques such as deep neural network models and background subtraction methods. The next objective is to prototype a model for controlling traffic light signals. For this purpose, the real-time traffic information is gathered, processed, and analyzed based on video images captured by smart video cameras on the traffic light poles. The traffic light density is estimated and used to decide which side of the road to clear first to minimize standing time, air pollution, noise pollution, and oil consumption. This approach to a traffic light system includes a system that can classify between emergency and nonemergency vehicles and clear the roads that have emergency vehicles first. A smart traffic light can be used for many things other than those mentioned here; it can be used to read number plates and check with police databases to continuously scan for stolen vehicles, to detect the speed of vehicles, and even to issue notifications to owners of vehicles using number plate recognition.}

This study provides the first One Health-based study on the epidemiology of Carbapenemase-Producing Gram-Negative Bacteria (CP-GNB) in Djibouti City, Djibouti, East Africa. In total, 800 community urine samples and 500 hospital specimens from humans, 270 livestock fecal samples, 60 fish samples, and 20 water samples were collected and tested for carbapenem resistance. The overall estimated CP-GNB prevalence was 1.9 % (32/1650 samples) and specifically concerned 0.3 % of community urine samples, 2.8 % of clinical specimens, 2.6 % of livestock fecal samples, 11.7 % of fish samples, and 10 % of water samples. The 32 CP-GNB included 19 Escherichia coli, seven Acinetobacter baumannii, five Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one Proteus mirabilis isolate. Short-read (Illumina) and long-read (Nanopore) genome sequencing revealed that carbapenem resistance was mainly associated with chromosomal carriage of blaNDM-1, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-66, and blaOXA-69 in A. baumannii, and with plasmid carriage in Enterobacterales (blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-181 in E. coli, blaNDM-1, blaNDM-5 and blaOXA-48 in K. pneumoniae, and blaNDM-1 in P. mirabilis). Moreover, 17/32 CP-GNB isolates belonged to three epidemic clones: (1) A. baumannii sequence type (ST) 1697,2535 that showed a distribution pattern consistent with intra- and inter-hospital dissemination; (2) E. coli ST10 that circulated at the human-animal-environment interface; and (3) K. pneumoniae ST147 that circulated at the human-environment interface. Horizontal exchanges probably contributed to carbapenem resistance dissemination in the city, especially the blaOXA-181-carrying ColKP3-IncX3 hybrid plasmid that was found in E. coli isolates belonging to different STs. Our study highlights that despite a relatively low CP-GNB prevalence in Djibouti City, plasmids harboring carbapenem resistance circulate in humans, animals and environment. Our findings stress the need to implement preventive and control measures for reducing the circulation of this potentially emerging public health threat.}

Based on the panel data of 292 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2020, this paper constructs a PSM-DID model based on machine learning to empirically test the impact of LCCP policy on urban CUL. The regression result shows that the low carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy significantly increases the level of CUL by 1.25 % in the pilot cities, which is still valid after range of robustness tests, and the mechanism analysis shows that green innovation and green habits are important ways for the policy to affect CUL. Based on the generalized random forest (GRF) algorithm, we further find that the policy can increase the CUL level by 0.6 %, and the average treatment effect (ATE) of the sample is concentrated between 0.004 and 0.006, which exhibits obvious heterogeneity. This paper chooses population quality, openness level and industrial structure as heterogeneous factors, which are finally found to have a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped relationship with ATE. This study provides useful insights for China and other countries to break the carbon lock-in and realize green development.}

abstract = {A majority of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries depend to a large extent on agriculture for food security and income. Efforts aimed at improving farm-related profitability are therefore important to improving livelihoods among smallholder farmers. In Ghana, for example, smallholder farmers that depend on agriculture face serious risks especially those related to climate change and variability and soil degradation. Notwithstanding these dangers, evidence of the published literature on how best to tackle these challenges is limited. Over the recent decades, however, there has been advancement by programs channelling resources into Climate-Smart Agricultural (CSA) practices to improving smallholder livelihoods and food security. The interest in advancing investment in CSA practices is a key pathway that has the potential to significantly reduce the negative effect of climate change and variability risks on smallholder farmers livelihoods. Investing in CSA practices is also a key pathway to improving farm yield per unit area. Consequently, smallholder farmers are adopting and implementing CSA practices. Despite that, a gap still exists on the profitability of undertaking such an investment, as this is key in determining the sustainability of CSA practices. On this basis, the present study undertook a detailed cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of seven CSA practices identified with smallholder farmers in the coastal savannah agro-ecological zone of Ghana. A total of 48 smallholder farmers that had adopted these practices were studied. Three CBA indicators namely the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR) and payback period (PP) were assessed for each of the seven CSA practices. The results showed that out of the seven CSA practices examined, six of them were profitably suitable for adoption and scaling up from the perspective of smallholder farmers as well as the public perspective. The finding from this study, therefore, fill the current information gap in the literature on the costs and benefits of adopting CSA practices on household livelihoods in Ghana. Such a finding is critical to the promotion and scaling up the adoption of CSA practices by smallholder farmers and serve as a basis of formulating appropriate guidelines and policies for supporting CSA practices.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for different kinds of devices to be connected and properly communicated at a mass scale. However, conventional mechanisms used to sustain security and privacy cannot be directly applied to IoT whose topology is increasingly becoming decentralized. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) on the other hand comprise varying forms of decentralized data structures that provide immutability through cryptographically linking blocks of data. To be able to build reliable, autonomous and trusted IoT platforms, DLT has the potential to provide security, privacy and decentralized operation while adhering to the limitations of IoT devices. The marriage of IoT and DLT technology is not very recent. In fact many projects have been focusing on this interesting combination to address the challenges of smart cities, smart grids, internet of everything and other decentralized applications, most based on blockchain structures. In this special issue, the focus is on the new and broader technical problems associated with the DLT-based security and backend platform solutions for IoT devices and applications.}

Herein, thermo and light-responsive strategies were adopted to adjust and enhance the bacterial anti-adhesion and render composite material surface with smart response for the complex environmental change. This composite surface was designed with light-responsive titanium dioxide nanotubes/titanium (TNTs)/Ti surface as base and grafting thermo-responsive P(vinylcaprolactam (VCL)–co-polyethylene glycol methacrylate (PEGMA)–co-alkyl-dimethyl tertiary amine (QAS)–co-vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMO)) copolymer on, and endowed with the long-lasting antibacterial QAS and hydrophilic PEGMA constituents to greatly reduce bacterial adhesion. The bacterial anti-adhesion could be intelligently adjusted and enhanced owing to the thermo-response of VCL in the copolymer and light-response of TNTs arrays. The resisting effect of hydrated layer formed by PEGMA and its resisting enhancement by TNTs were demonstrated as important roles in bacterial anti-adhesion. An enhancement of bacterial anti-adhesion triggered by thermo-response was ascribed to the underwater conformational change of polymer molecules observed by in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), and that triggered by light-response was due to the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the composite surface. The robust durability of antibacterial and bacterially anti-adhesive properties paved good foundations for application in the mutable environment.}

It is a significant capability achievement if the 30% of reserve potential can be unlocked partially or in full for operational use, realising enhancement in asset and space utilisation. Energy storage is known to the industry to be able to achieve economic advantages such as “peak shavings” and more efficient usage of renewable energy. This paper explores how smart Energy Storage System (ESS), by means of an inverter in parallel interface to a diesel generator, operating seamlessly in a hybrid system, could lead to a 28 percentage point increase of the generator prime capacity, and result in better diesel generator capacity utilisation. It is proposed to configure ESS to support load variability and allow diesel generator to operate more in constant power mode, thereby freeing up generators from load-following constraint. When the generator is decoupled from instantaneous load variability, the additional degree of freedom in the system allows it to operate at closer to its rated capacity.}

The importance of using multipurpose smart cards in transit systems has been recently recognized by users and transit operation agencies. However, only a few studies have focused on users' perspectives when researching the use of multipurpose smart cards in transit systems. This study thus adopts the revised new product adoption model and considers the specific characteristics of transit use as a research framework to examine the effects of constructs on consumer intention to use smart cards in transit systems. The first stage of the study employs structural equation modeling (SEM). Critical attributes identified during the first-stage survey are then extracted to design the stated preference method questionnaire for the second stage. During this stage, user choice behavior is investigated and changes in the adoption rates of different payment alternatives are predicted under various scenarios. Data from two metropolitan areas are then analyzed and compared. SEM analysis results reveal that consumer use intention is significantly influenced by perceived product attribute, promotion strategy, and perceived risk. The last one is demonstrated to have an effect on perceived product attribute for consumers in terms of metropolitan difference. Initial card cost, transit fare, consumption discount, and personal information protection are further considered as critical factors that affect the possible adoption rate of smart card use in transit systems based on the analytical results obtained by the mixed logit model. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that reducing transit fare and protecting personal information significantly impact adoption rate changes of different payment alternatives. This study also offers several managerial implications and suggests future research directions.}

The key findings are: (1) there was some evidence on leadership shown by mayors, governors, public transport administrators and police in all four cities; (2) limited stakeholder engagement in the whole process of policy formation to implementation and some forms of donor influence were observed in three capital cities that resulted in follow-up projects or studies; and (3) the implementation of policies and plans faced many challenges relating to leadership, resources, prioritization, and coordination among various organizations. There was much focus on the formulation of mobility policies and plans and the users could not feel a meaningful improvement to urban mobility services despite the implementation of large urban mobility projects. A comprehensive evaluation framework is proposed and used to evaluate the whole process of improving urban mobility from policy formulation to implementation. There seems to be much preference for large urban transit projects vis-à-vis infrastructure for active mobility and low-cost solutions. The research also indicates the need for meaningful public engagement so that the mobility plans take a citizen-centric approach that reflects the needs of the urban residents, rather than taking a modernistic approach with solutions more suitable for middle-income groups. Delays in the implementation of major projects also suggest that more realistic planning, scheduling, and improvement in project management and coordination is necessary.}

To identify the urban structure of Greater London and uncover how it co-evolves with socio-economic and spatial policy factors, this study applies network community detection, using smart card data derived from the years 2013, 2015 and 2017, respectively. Our findings show that, firstly, between 2013 and 2017, London's urban structure moved towards a more polycentric and compact pattern. Secondly, it is found that Greater London can be clustered into five communities based on the characteristics of passengers' travel patterns. Thirdly, the dynamics of structural change in different urban clusters differ both in terms of changing intensity and potential motivation. In addition to spatial impact and spatial strategic policies, our results show that employment density and residential densities are also the main indicators that affected the interaction between Londoners in different areas on various levels.}

The increasing frequency of extreme climate change events has significant implications and poses a serious challenge for policymakers to build resilient urban societies. In Africa, a considerable amount of effort has been invested in building a climate resilient society. This study made an assessment of current urban planning and development practices at the city level and evaluated their effectiveness in mainstreaming adaptation strategies to climate change. Based on our case study of the city of Kigali in Rwanda, we examined various urban development policies and plans. The study used an assessment framework developed by Kumar et al. (2015). This study revealed that out of the plans analyzed, only a fraction explicitly addressed climate change, with most lacking comprehensive climate adaptation measures. Our study further spotlighted Kigali's limited climate change awareness, analytical capacity, and resource allocation. This echoes a wider trend across African cities, which, despite experiencing climate risks, often overlook its integration into developmental plans. As the global conversation pivots to climate resilient planning and policies, the experiences and challenges of African cities emerge as invaluable. Their experiences highlight specific challenges and stress the need to modify development policies and planning practices with a strong focus on climate. Through this research, we echo the urgency to not only recognize but actively incorporate these vital African perspectives, mainstreaming climate efforts into local development ambitions.}

The protests and backlash not only challenge the effective implementation of x-minute city policies, but also highlight our lack of understanding regarding which acceptability factors affect public reactance to this new kind of urban policy. This paper reviews the existing literature to reveal the four main factors shaping policy acceptability. It then juxtaposes these factors against the common criticisms leveled at the 15-min city model. This comparative analysis not only illuminates the limitations of applying traditional policy frameworks to the x-minute city context, but also identifies critical gaps in the existing literature. By bridging this divide, we aid policymakers in navigating the spectrum of public skepticism of the 15-min city model, from addressing and debunking conspiracy theories to engaging with scientifically-grounded critiques. Our findings offer a roadmap for transforming these innovative urban planning concepts into widely embraced solutions for climate change mitigation.}

A prolonged period of lockdown, promotion of social distancing, and quarantine of infected individuals, which had been recommended as preventive measures raises a question on the feasibility of these measures in Indian cities considering the challenges related to adequate housing and exclusive access to basic amenities. Against this background, this paper tries to understand the level of pandemic preparedness of urban households across different socio-economic groups, city-size, and settlement types and its changes in the last two decades based on an analysis of unit level data from the National Sample Survey (NSS). The paper has attempted to construct a ‘Pandemic Preparedness Index’ (PPI) to measure a household’s ability to maintain isolation and social distancing. Results indicate that urban households have become more prepared for such pandemics over this period. However, the poor and slum households, particularly located in metropolitan cities still face multiple deprivations related to housing and basic amenities, which make them more vulnerable to such pandemics. This paper calls for urban household's pandemic and disaster preparedness with an increased policy focus on poor and slum households in metropolitan cities.}

In order to help asset managers make better decisions and thus improve safety, soil properties should be accurately identified using sensor-data collected at the current stage. This task is not easy to accomplish, mainly because of its intrinsic ambiguity. Sensors usually only measure effects (e.g., field responses) but not causes (e.g., soil parameter values). A strategy that helps meet this challenge is to perform inverse analysis to validate soil parameter values. Error-Domain Model Falsification (EDMF) is a methodology that achieves this goal. More precisely, EDMF helps identify good behavior models of excavation by falsifying soil parameter values for which the predictions of the corresponding behavior models cannot explain field-response measurements collected by sensors. However, a remaining challenge is the identification of soil parameter values that are not falsified by EDMF, especially when the computation of the predictions is time-consuming. This paper proposes a new framework that combines EDMF and an optimization algorithm for efficient identification of soil parameter values. Results on a full-scale excavation site in Singapore show that the new framework is robust and accurate, and it has the potential to improve current practice, which relies primarily on surrogate models without uncertainty.}

Developing functional triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with universally harvesting various energy and anti-impact effect may be an effective strategy to collect energy as well as protect human beings from danger. Thus, a miniaturized all-in-one TENG with high structural durability, anti-impact and multi-mode harvesting energy from compression, swaying and magnetic field was developed by assembling shear thickening fluid (STF) and magneto-sensitive films. TENG yielded maximum power density of 27.05 mW/m2 with the voltage of 10.40 V at 10 MΩ under compression. It also sensed and collected tiny STF flowing energy under non-contact mode. Besides, high magnetic-sensitive effect endowed TENG with magnetic dependent programmable shapes which enabled it to harvest non-contact rubbing/deformation energy. More importantly, the device with STF exhibited high anti-impact properties which could resist and dissipate harsh collision force from 1390 N to 409 N, demonstrating excellent safeguarding properties for TENG and human wearers. This versatile device also showed reliable sensing properties to various external magnetic field, human motions, contacted materials and impact forces. In addition, a wearable TENG-based smart glove as a self-powered functional sensor presented the ability of precisely mapping finger joints. Finally, newly-designed Kevlar/TENG-based e-textile arrays with 95% impact-force dissipating and multi-fields display performance was proposed. Thus, this work opened a new perspective for the development of functional TENGs as wearable electronic devices in universally energy-scavenging and safeguarding areas.}

It addresses the problems in the current public affairs governance strategy for the outbreak of the COVID-2019 epidemic, and uses digital twins technology to map the epidemic P & C situation in the real space to the virtual space. Then, the blockchain technology and deep learning algorithms are introduced to construct a digital twins model of the COVID-2019 epidemic (the COVID-DT model) based on blockchain combined with BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory). In addition, performance of the constructed COVID-DT model is analyzed through simulation. Analysis of network data security transmission performance reveals that the constructed COVID-DT model shows a lower average delay, its data message delivery rate (DMDR) is basically stable at 80%, and the data message disclosure rate (DMDCR) is basically stable at about 10%. The analysis on network communication cost suggests that the cost of this study does not exceed 700 bytes, and the prediction error does not exceed 10%. Therefore, the COVID-DT model constructed shows high network security performance while ensuring low latency performance, enabling more efficient and accurate interaction of information, which can provide experimental basis for information security and development trends of epidemic P & C in smart cities.}

abstract = {Fonio millets (Digitaria exilis Stapf, D. iburua Stapf) are important cereal crops of West Africa with cultural, nutritional, and economic significance. Fonio is an early maturing cereal, highly adapted to poor soils, and remarkably drought tolerant. It plays an important role in household food security and income generation, having a relatively high yield (up to 1tha−1) and nutritional value (exceeding 1400kJ per 100g), with superior protein, carbohydrate, and fiber contents compared to other cereals, thus a promising staple crop for household food security among rural dwellers in West Africa. However, fonio remains grossly underutilized, often neglected as a “minor” millet. Lack of improved seeds, infestation by insect pests, and toilsome postharvest processes are the major constraints to its production. This article discusses Fonio millet, its biology, distribution, importance, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and its potential as future smart food.}

However, real-time power consumption data contain some sensitive information, and could disclose the privacy of users. As an immunological technique, the negative survey is proposed to preserve the privacy of static data. In this paper, firstly, we demonstrate that traditional negative survey might disclose the privacy of users when it is used to collect time-series data. Secondly, we propose an improved negative survey method for collecting the time-series data. Thirdly, for the first time, we apply the negative survey to preserving the privacy of the power consumption data aggregated from smart meters. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper could aggregate the power consumption data while preserving the privacy of users. Compared with existing techniques, our method is simple and efficient, and does not need a trusted third party. Moreover, it could tolerate the failure of some users and resist differential attack.}

abstract = {Purpose
Findings are reported from the original study that supported the creation and validation of the current road network-based (“Street Smart”) version of Walk Score. It shows how Street Smart Walk Score improved upon the former “airline” (Euclidean, crow-fly or straight-line) distance method. It further compares the ability to predict objectively measured physical activity between the original airline Walk Score and Street Smart Walk Score methods and a code-based composite three-dimensional “Walkability Index” of net-residential density, land use mix, street connectivity, and retail floor area ratio.
Methods
The three walkability approaches were linked with objective physical activity data from 2,199 participants in the Neighborhood Quality of Life Study and compared. Walk Score's classic airline-based distance method to assess proximity to destinations was dramatically enhanced to form the new network-based method. A road network method to measure distance was created. A non-linear distance decay function with distance-based weights was also developed for specific destinations. Inclusion of a link-node ratio measure of connectivity and removal of schools was advised. Findings were externally validated using similar data from another region.
Results
The code-based Walkability Index remained the best predictor of physical activity even after all of the enhancements were made to create a network-based Walk Score which was positively associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Each step of the Walk Score calibration process further improved the strength of association with MVPA.
Discussion
Destination proximity used by Walk Score provides a useful measure of accessibility for a wide range of end-users. However, from a policy perspective, it is essential to measure features enforceable through development regulations. Components of these regulations are contained in the Walkability Index. Presence of shops, restaurants, and other destinations captured by Walk Score can be enabled but not mandated through these regulated features.}

The emergence of devices known as “smart home hubs” allow for such hardware to be controlled by non-technical users providing inexpensive home security and other home automation functions. To the cyber analyst, these smart environments can be a boon to digital forensics; information such as interactions with the devices, sensors registering motion, temperature or moisture levels in different rooms, all tend to be collected in one central location rather than separate ones.

In this paper, we examine how urban governance approaches for autonomous vehicles development and deployment in the United States are evolving within multi-scalar regulatory contexts. We conceptualize the various types of engagements by cities through four different roles: city as regulator, mediator, data catalyst, and promoter. These categories are not mutually exclusive, but complementary, and are intended to support the development of appropriate models as cities continue to evaluate options for their urban mobility futures. We present two illustrative examples, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Boston, Massachusetts, to analyze how cities vary in their approaches to the new urban mobility sector. These are two of the leading municipalities in the United States on autonomous vehicle testing and deployment, and their experiences are helpful to elucidating the variety of regulatory contexts, approaches to governance, and potential outcomes.}

We examine the impact of service attributes, including travel time, reliability and travel cost, on commuters’ transportation mode choices and estimate the implied value of travel time (VOT) and value of reliability (VOR) for different types of public transit commuters. The results show significant heterogeneity in the transport preferences of commuters, with adult transit commuters having higher VOT and VOR relative to senior citizens, students and children. Within the adult group, commuters who frequently switch their transportation modes have significantly higher VOT and VOR. These results have important implications for policymakers in formulating strategies to improve the efficiency of the public transport system, and having flexible and customized transport services could increase the utility and satisfaction levels of public transit commuters.}

To address these issues, complex innovative systems may be developed such as smart grids. When these systems are realized challenges pertaining to renewable energy and sustainability may, in part, be solved. To implement them, generally accepted common standards should be developed and used by firms and society so that the technological components can be connected and quality and safety requirements of smart grids and their governance can be guaranteed. This paper studies a subcomponent of the smart grid. Specifically, the paper studies competing technologies for a standard means of interface between the smart meter and the concentration point for collecting meter data. Three types of communication technologies for the interface are currently battling for standard dominance: Power line communication, Mobile telephony, and Radio frequency. Nine relevant standard dominance factors were found: operational supremacy, technological superiority, compatibility, flexibility, pricing strategy, timing of entry, current installed base, regulator, and suppliers. The Best-Worst Method was applied to calculate the factors’ relative weights. The results show that experts believe that Power line communication has a high chance of becoming dominant and that the most important factor affecting standard success is technological superiority. The relative weights per factor are explained and theoretical and practical contributions, limitations, and areas for further research are discussed.}

In the era of an extraordinary public health crisis due to the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused the deaths of millions and affected a multitude of people worldwide in different ways, the role of smart healthcare has become indispensable. Any modern method that allows for speedy and efficient monitoring of COVID19-affected patients could be highly beneficial to medical staff. Several smart-healthcare systems based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have attracted worldwide interest in their growing technical assistance in health services, notably in predicting, identifying and preventing, and their remote surveillance of most infectious diseases. In this paper, a real time health monitoring system for COVID19 patients based on edge computing and fuzzy logic technique is proposed. The proposed model makes use of the IoMT architecture to collect real time biological data (or health information) from the patients to monitor and analyze the health conditions of the infected patients and generates alert messages that are transmitted to the concerned parties such as relatives, medical staff and doctors to provide appropriate treatment in a timely fashion. The health data are collected through sensors attached to the patients and transmitted to the edge devices and cloud storage for further processing. The collected data are analyzed through fuzzy logic in edge devices to efficiently identify the risk status (such as low risk, moderate risk and high risk) of the COVID19 patients in real time. The proposed system is also associated with a mobile app that enables the continuous monitoring of the health status of the patients. Moreover, once alerted by the system about the high risk status of a patient, a doctor can fetch all the health records of the patient for a specified period, which can be utilized for a detailed clinical diagnosis.}

abstract = {PM2.5 has negative impact on human health. Although air purifiers can remove indoor PM2.5 effectively, occupants do not use them well to achieve best performance. It is important to develop automatic control strategy for air purifiers to achieve both indoor air quality and energy efficiency. As traditional air purifier control strategy cannot adapt to the stochastic behavior of residents such as PM2.5 emissions and occupants’ window behavior and result in superfluous energy consumption, this study uses the deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL) approach to automatically control the air purifier, which provide better indoor air quality with lower energy consumption. To make the DeepRL applicable in real daily life, we first develop a stochastic model based on measured indoor air quality data, which is able to simulate the indoor PM2.5 process in real time. To improve the energy efficiency of air purifier under this condition, we further trained DeepRL approach to control the air purifier under the simulated PM2.5 process. By virtue of adaption to the stochastic environmental parameters, RL strategy can make the best fit decision in advance to achieve more stable control effect. Comparing to the baseline strategy, both RL-1 and RL-2 show significant improvement in energy efficiency. In specific, RL-1 strategy could reduce 43.7% energy consumption with basically the same indoor PM2.5 concentration level in the best-IAQ scenario, and RL-2 strategy could reduce 40.6% energy consumption and 25.6% frequency of indoor PM2.5 concentration exceed WHO air quality guideline. Thus, it has better comprehensive control performance in the general-IAQ scenario.}

In recent decades, socially sustainable development has become essential to multinational transportation policies and strategies. Several bibliometric analysis studies have systematically evaluated sustainable transport, economically sustainable transport, and environmentally sustainable transport; however, no such analysis has been conducted on socially sustainable transport. In response to this research gap, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and thorough visualization and mapping of socially sustainable transport research over 1993–2021. A total of 2,703 publications from the Web of Science core collection database were analyzed using VOSviewer, ArcGIS, and CiteSpace. The results found that the United States of America published 17.13% of the total number of articles, China published 14.17% of the articles, and the United Kingdom published 13.47% of the articles. Four stages of development were identified: 50 articles in the initial stage (1993–2000), 76 articles in the exploration stage (2001–2005), 550 articles in the stable development stage (2006–2014), and 1877 articles in the rapid development stage (2015–2021). Cluster analysis revealed two persistent research topics: multi-objective optimization and social sustainability index for the transport sector. Emerging research topics included shared transport, frames of transportation, smart city, sustainable mobility, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility. Finally, we explored the four potential avenues to develop the socially sustainable transport field. These analytical findings may be valuable for sustainable transportation industry practitioners, researchers, and policymakers.}

The 15-minute city concept prefigures a reorganization of urban spaces, structures, and functions aimed at increasing residents’ access to essential services, favoring sustainable modes of transportation, and transforming public urban spaces into multifunctional places. The proposed study develops a set of indicators derived from the spatial and configurational analysis to evaluate the compliance of urban systems with the 15-minute city concept. The selected areas of study are the cities of Cagliari, Perugia, Pisa, and Trieste, in Italy. The study investigates four issues: i) defining a set of relevant, reproducible, and comparable indicators for measuring density, proximity, and diversity; ii) investigating the influence of distinct urban planning concepts, manifested by distinct spatial configurations, on density, proximity, and diversity; iii) defining urban scale metrics to measure levels of spatial injustice in terms of unequal conditions of access to essential services and iv) measuring the correlation between configurational factors and access to services. The analysis underlines the gap in access to essential services among central compact districts and dispersed outer areas, thus enabling the identification of inequalities in the distribution of spatial capital. Moreover, the study underlines the relationship between the urban environment structure and the location of functions. As a result, the study emphasizes that the proposed set of indicators is instrumental to understanding the urban environment's potential to meet urban populations' needs and facilitating informed decisions in urban planning.}
