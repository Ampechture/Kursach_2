abstract = {Understanding the effectiveness of alternative approaches to water conservation is imperative for ensuring the security and reliability of water services for urban residents. We analyze data from one of the longest-running “cash for grass” policies – the Southern Nevada Water Authority's Water Smart Landscapes program – where homeowners are paid to replace grass with desert landscaping. We use a sixteen year long panel dataset of monthly water consumption records for 300,000 homes in Las Vegas, Nevada. We estimate the average water savings per square meter of turf removed with an event study and a panel difference-in-differences approach. We find that participation in this program reduced the average treated home's consumption by 20 percent. We find no evidence that water savings degrade as the landscape ages. Depending on the assumed time horizon of benefits from turf removal, we find that the Water Smart Landscapes program cost the water authority about $1.88 per thousand gallons of water saved, which compares favorably to alternative means of water conservation or supply augmentation.}

The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based image demosaicking and denoising methods has been very successful. However, still there is a room for improvement in the network performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The main challenge that remains to be addressed is to guarantee the visual quality of reconstructed images, particularly in the presence of noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel demosaicking and denoising conjunct strategy using deep adaptive residual learning. The proposed framework has three stages. Initially, zero padding is performed to increase processing speed and preserve the edges of the image. In the second phase, we perform demosaicking using interpolation in order to find missing values using information about neighboring pixels. Finally, the reconstructed image is created using the original image. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, we used Pytorch and Google Colab with 400 images for training and 100 images for validation The outcomes show that the proposed scheme beats cutting edge joint demosaicking and denoising schemes regarding both structural similarity index metrics (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and basic similitude record measurements (SSIM).}

Herein, we present a self-powered double-authentication microsystem (DAM) composed of a piezoelectric-based active code and a triboelectric-based self-driven code to realize a high-security, high-identification-rate, and self-powered smart identification system. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films with different lengths were arranged in binary sequence to construct the piezoelectric-based active code. A complementary filler and an opaque cover were implemented to conceal the coded information. The high consistency of output amplitudes of length-consistent piezoelectric units, the great difference of output amplitudes of length-inconsistent piezoelectric units, and the ultra-small speed dependence were experimentally confirmed, which enable the piezoelectric-based active code to achieve a high identification accuracy rate. The triboelectric-based self-driven code was implemented by a relative-sliding mode triboelectric nanogenerator (RS-TENG) to drive an information storage unit, such as a pre-compiled liquid crystal display (LCD). The obtained electrical energy during one operation could drive the LCD for ~26 s, which allows the operator to have enough time to read the information. In addition, as attractive application prototypes, the two coded information were combined to realize personal identification and automatic unlocking. The high safety and identification accuracy rate make the self-powered DAM have attractive feasibility for applications in smart identification field.}

An effective approach to address this important process still needs to be developed. This study introduced a novel data-driven approach to sewer detection utilizing in-sewer distributed temperature sensing (DTS) measurement combined with wavelet-based denoising of DTS data. It underlines that the effective denoising of DTS data, and consequently the accurate determination of DTS noise threshold, is pivotal to reliable sewer detection. DTS background noise is chiefly influenced by the threshold rescaling. A reliable DTS background noise threshold was found to be ±0.25 °C in a field study, established with the threshold rescaling of a level-dependent estimation of level noise, and the associated threshold selection rule of heuristics threshold or minimum maximum variance. Deviation from this threshold could hamper the identification of true inflow or infiltration points. Applying the established threshold to the study site, our study identified two sewer problematic points including a groundwater infiltration point, and a clean water inflow point based on generated three-value image. Further interpretation of the three-value image revealed that both groundwater infiltration and clean water inflow into the sewer exhibited intermittent instead of constant behavior, which was due to time-variable water head difference associated with sewage discharge variation over the daily period and rainfall events. Thus, the methodology offers considerable potential for urban sewer detection, especially for its performance to capture intermittent sewer infiltrations and inflows without draining sewers.}

abstract = {Around the world, smart technologies are being embraced as a cost-efficient means of enabling the elderly to be cared for in new, more non-proximate ways. They can facilitate ageing-in-place, and have the potential to relieve pressure on the providers of care. Yet, the fact is that the interface of technology and society is a negotiated one. These negotiations are most acutely felt when technology is used to supplement the hitherto human-centred process of caregiving, especially amongst “marginalised” societal cohorts, like the elderly. With this, there is a need to better understand the ways in which smart eldercare technologies are used, misused, or not used by those that they are designed to benefit. Drawing on qualitative data derived from triallists of three smart eldercare technologies in Singapore, this paper explores how the lived experience of smart eldercare can cause agentic and apathetic behaviours towards technology to manifest. Specifically, we identify four expectations – of understanding, response, compliance and appreciation – that undermine the potential beneficence of smart eldercare. To conclude, we emphasise the need for more collaborative, and more contextually-sensitive, approaches to the design, development and implementation of smart eldercare solutions.}

However, the conventional electroylzer systems are only designed for constant operation at full load. Depending on the employed rectifiers, they show reduced efficiencies in dynamic operation. Recent advances in rectifier and electrolysis systems allow their dynamic operation in a smart grid environment with volatile renewable energy generation. This study investigates the techno-economic benefits of a recently developed process current source in combination with an alkaline electrolyzer, compared to three frequently employed conventional rectifier topologies. The smart grid simulation regards three scenarios with differently scaled electrolyzer units and therefore, varying amounts of surplus energy. Simulation results display an increased amount of annually produced hydrogen from 2250 MWhH2,LHV for the worst conventional system to 3050 MWhH2,LHV for the new process current source, in the scenario with the highest electrolyzer scaling. In this case, a larger electrolysis system results in more partial load operation and here, the process current source outperforms all conventional rectifiers in amount of generated hydrogen as well as in the economic viability. The levelized costs of hydrogen are always more than 0.5 €/kgH2 cheaper, especially in highly dynamic operation.}

The proposed model, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, minimizes the total manufacturing cost by co-optimizing the operation schedule of production lines. The proposed model implements several operating constraints of the production lines that include their energy consumption and associated costs, productivity, scrap rates, changeover duration, and labor costs. The proposed model is implemented on a sample manufacturer, where seven production lines with different operational constraints are optimized to manufacture six product types. In addition, the model is utilized to optimize the operation of a real-world food production plant with five lines and twelve different product types. The simulation results show that the proposed optimal scheduling model allows the manufacturers to enhance production efficiency and save on operation costs by co-optimizing the operation schedule of production lines. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the model in different demand levels, where the manufacturers are enabled to optimally schedule the production lines at minimum cost given the production demand.}

Therefore, data management approaches for smart environments need to support flexibility, dynamicity, incremental change, while keeping costs to a minimum. A Dataspace is an emerging approach to data management that has proved fruitful for personal information and scientific data management. However, their use within smart environments and for real-time data remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as an enabling platform for data management within smart environments. This paper identifies common data management requirements for smart energy and water environments, details the RLD architecture and the key support services and their tiered support levels, and a principled approach to “Pay-As-You-Go” data management. The paper presents a dataspace query service for real-time data streams and entities to enable unified entity-centric queries across live and historical stream data. The RLD was validated in 5 real-world pilot smart environments following the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop to build real-time analytics, decisions support, and smart apps for energy and water management. The pilots demonstrate that the RLD enables incremental pay-as-you-go data management with support services that simplify the development of applications and analytics for smart environments. Finally, the paper discusses experiences, lessons learnt, and future directions.}

Through smart homes, household appliances as the Internet of Things (IoT) devices can easily be handled and monitored from a far distance by remote controls. With the day-to-day popularity of smart homes, it is anticipated that the number of connections rises faster. With this remarkable rise in connections, some issues such as substantial data volumes, security weaknesses, and response time disorders are predicted. In order to solve these obstacles and suggest an auspicious solution, fog computing as an eminently distributed architecture has been proposed to administer the massive, security-crucial, and delay-sensitive data, which are produced by communications of the IoT devices in smart homes. Indeed, fog computing bridges space between various IoT appliances and cloud-side servers and brings the supply side (cloud layer) to the demand side (user device layer). By utilizing fog computing architecture in smart homes, the issues of traditional architectures can be solved. This paper proposes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for fog-based smart homes (published between 2014 and May 2019). A practical taxonomy based on the contents of the present research studies is represented as resource-management-based and service-management-based approaches. This paper also demonstrates an abreast comparison of the aforementioned solutions and assesses them under the same evaluation factors.

In such environments, service providers collect, store, and process a huge amount of personal information from the users, and provide appropriate services in return. Processing personal information helps service providers dispense personalized services to users. The flow of personal information requires legal documents such as privacy preferences and privacy policies from the users and service providers, respectively. A software agent (to be installed either at the client’s or server’s end) performs the privacy checking (i.e., matches the service provider’s privacy policies with the user’s privacy preferences), and produces a decision based on a “take it or leave it” approach. Often, this check is too restrictive such that the user is denied the services, even if the privacy policies partially satisfy the user preferences. In this work, the privacy checking problem is envisaged as a knapsack problem, and to address it, we derive (i) knapsack privacy checking (KPC), and (ii) knapsack graph-based privacy checking (KPC-G) techniques. The system developed using these techniques finds the services that best match the user’s privacy preferences as well as the service provider’s policies, with a twofold functionality: (a) it recommends the best matching services based on user-supplied tolerance values, or (b) it solves an optimization problem to suggest services after adjusting the user-supplied tolerance values. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

Blockchain technology solves some vulnerabilities, i.e., authentication can be done by public-private encryption with key access, which restricts the anonymous entry of intruders. All the transactions are recorded in an immutable format and decentralization makes the data exchanges transparent for all parties who are involved in this platform. This entire platform itself acts as a validator, which performs the transaction compliance monitoring and thus abolishes the third-party intervention and makes the system cost-efficient. Blockchain technology solves insecure payment vulnerabilities by creating wallets. In the case of energy trading, this technology performs a vital role to deploy the smart contracts, a negotiable software package code module to the underlying architecture, which controls the user access, validation for impure contracts, and thus provides the automation, transactional as well as contractual security. The main contribution of this work lies in a comparative study of IoT-aided smart grid management, control, and security, energy trading, payment schemes.

While these systems provided easy control of the house depending on the commands only given by the user in the early period, today with artificial intelligence algorithms developed for energy saving, home security, control etc., these systems have begun to perform many operations autonomously. Many researchers and R&D companies work in this field and develop new algorithms every day to create new products. Artificial intelligence algorithms must be continuously tested and improved under different conditions in order to function properly and perform the desired function. Performing the algorithm tests in real environments involves many problems and reduces the efficiency in terms of studies. In similar situations in smart homes and different disciplines, algorithm development and improvement studies are performed in simulated environments. However, it may not be possible to include all the variables of real life in simulation environments. Considering all these situations, in this study, a hybrid smart home simulation that runs real and virtual smart homes together is developed to test the artificial intelligence algorithms developed for use in smart homes. A real smart home system is first developed and installed in a room for hybrid simulation. Then, a simulated house is developed with the desired number of rooms, desired number of smart home components with different tasks for this house, virtual individuals who use this house, and weekly life scenarios for these individuals. The room in which the real smart home system works is converted into a room in the virtual house by changing the simulation codes. Likewise, a real person who uses the real smart home becomes an inhabitant living in a virtual home. In addition, virtual inhabitants are created to use the real smart home system. Thus, the real and the virtual smart home and real and virtual inhabitants live together in a hybrid simulation. Finally, the hybrid simulation is operated smoothly under different conditions for two months with different artificial intelligence algorithms.}

abstract = {Purpose
Increasing trends of climatic risk pose challenges to the food security and livelihoods of smallholders in vulnerable regions, where farmers often face loss of the entire crop, pushing farmers (mostly men) out of agriculture in destitution, creating a situation of agricultural making agriculture highly feminization and compelling male farmers to out-migrate. Climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) are promoted to cope with climatic risks. This study aims to assess how knowledge related to CSAPs, male out-migration, education and income contribute to the determinants of male out-migration and CSAPs adoption and how they respond to household food security.
Design/methodology/approach
Sex-disaggregated primary data were collected from adopter and non-adopter farm families. STATA 13.1 was used to perform principle component analysis to construct knowledge, yield and income indices.
Findings
Yield and income index of adopters was higher for men than women. The probability of out-migration reduced by 21% with adoption of CSAPs. An increase in female literacy by 1 unit reduces log of odds to migrate by 0.37. With every unit increase in knowledge index, increase in log-odds of CSAPs adoption was 1.57. Male:female knowledge gap was less among adopters. Non-adopters tended to reduce food consumption when faced with climatic risks significantly, and the probability of migration increased by 50% with a one-unit fall in the nutrition level, thus compelling women to work more in agriculture.

Various types of problems like global warming, green house effect, ozone depletion, natural calamities are now continuously affecting the nature. Bioremediation is an effective tool for saving our ecosystem. It basically includes oxidation- reduction methods, which enhance biodegradation process for cleaning polluted environment. Smart materials are the efficient materials designed with specific properties for cleaning environment. These are polymers which can alter with environmental conditions. In the context of present climatic conditions where environmental problems are enormous and needs to be stabilized, these smart materials can be proved to be an effective tool for environmental sustainability. Smart materials can change with changing temperature, humidity, light, pressure, etc. Tinted glass- used in sunglasses, solar panels etc for absorbing sunlight.

The pre-hazard early warning system are crucial to the disaster prevention, and would be an important part of smart city planning. This paper introduced a way to support the pre-hazard identification based on ground water level change fast prediction, which is the key factor for occurrence of the rainstorm-induced hazard. Firstly, the remote monitoring stations supplied by solar power are established, the data about the water content of surface soil and rainfall were real-time collected from different sensors. By introducing the sliding windows of historical data and for prediction, the early warning system are effective in pre-hazard identification as considering the vulnerable environmental factors such as rainfall, surface runoff, temperature, sunshine, vegetations, soil properties and structures. Based on the model analysis on the 4982 time-series samples, taking the sliding window T=7d of historical data and sliding window G=7d for prediction as an example, the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the predicted result of the model reached 0.0812, with R2 up to 0.9776. Thus, Our study aims to provide a strategic way in quick response for the connection of pre-disaster planning and urban planning, and the improvement of disaster prevention, mitigation capacities, increasing the resilience of mountainous cities and their inhabitants.}

Usually, designers in various fields can only design subsystems of an SMS based on the limited cognition of dynamics. Conducting SMS designs concurrently and developing a unified model to effectively imitate every interaction and behavior of manufacturing processes are challenging. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulations to reduce the vast time and cost of physical commissioning/reconfiguration by the early detection of design errors/flaws of the SMS. However, the development of the digital twins concept in the SMS design remains vague. An innovative Function-Structure-Behavior-Control-Intelligence-Performance (FSBCIP) framework is proposed to review how digital twins technologies are integrated into and promote the SMS design based on a literature search in the Web of Science database. The definitions, frameworks, major design steps, new blueprint models, key enabling technologies, design cases, and research directions of digital twins-based SMS design are presented in this survey. It is expected that this survey will shed new light on urgent industrial concerns in developing new SMSs in the Industry 4.0 era.}

Other studies have found that the cabin temperature may exceed 60°C when it is exposed to direct sunlight, but it can be reduced by more than 15°C if the vehicle is covered. Hence, this chapter introduces TICKET, an intelligent parking space allocation system for greater energy efficiency. TICKET informs drivers of which parking space they should occupy within the parking lot so that when the driver returns to collect the vehicle, the cabin temperature is as low as possible. To do so, the system considers multiple environmental factors such as the sunlight movement or the weather conditions in the target parking lot and also combines predictive algorithms like hidden Markov models for demand estimation. Finally, TICKET has been tested in a real parking-lot premises with promising results.}

The fact that the built environment energy consumption contributes to a huge amount of CO2 emissions has a significant impact on the public agenda. Consequently, the emergence of the low carbon city concept has enhanced the necessity for a both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of related energy strategies and policies. Support decision maker's tools can play an essential role for sustainable and effective land use governance, in particular, geo-referencing territorial data. This paper proposes a mixed approach method, integrating GIS Urban Energy Mapping, Stakeholders Analysis, and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis whit the aim at defining urban energy saving scenarios in two sides which includes (a) the development of an energy consumption model of the building stock that is able to explore a number of possible futures scenarios based on GIS and give a representative picture of the actual energy consumption state and performance of urban systems (b) and the pre-selection of evaluation criteria based on environmental, economic, and social sustainability pillars. The expected result is the development of spatial decision support tool able to support urban planners, policy makers and built environment stakeholders in their efforts to plan, design and manage low carbon cities in their future strategic decisions by visualizing scenarios analysis.

For such a network to become a smart energy system, however, it needs to be managed and controlled in a smart way. While existing techniques mainly focus either on short-term unit commitment or on yearly scheduling separately, this work presents an original combined optimization algorithm which merges the two methods, in order to enhance system real-time control with long-term evaluations (e.g. incentives and yearly constraints). The control architecture comprises three coordinated optimization levels, each periodically updated through the receding time horizon strategy. A long-term supervisory module performs whole-year optimal scheduling accounting for long-term factors and determines the constraints for a short-term supervisory module which, in turn, optimizes the control action for the energy production system in real-time. In parallel, energy distribution modules minimize energy supply to the different portions of the distribution network downstream. Simulation results on a hospital case study demonstrate a 9.7% reduction in total operating cost over the whole year, as well as an increase in revenues deriving from incentives for high efficiency cogeneration.}

The UK government regards smart meters to be enablers of a low-carbon energy grid and has set out ambitious consumer-orientated aims within their programme across England, Scotland, and Wales. Despite considerable amount of research on how consumers will (or not) engage with smart meters, media discourses, where some public debates about smart meters are created and reproduced, have received little attention. This paper presents a content analysis of how smart meters are discussed within 11 years of popular print media coverage. A collection of nine discourses are identified: Four of these – “empowered consumers”, “energy conscious world”, “low-carbon grid”, and “future smart innovation” – depict smart meters as a harbinger of positive social change. Five of these – “hacked and vulnerable grid”, “big brother”, “costly disaster”, “astronomical bills”, and “families in turmoil” – represent smart meters as negative forces on society. The results show that discourses and associated storylines mainly represent continuous struggles over particular socio-technical promises linked to smart meters. Somewhat missing are attempts to open up the smart energy debate to broader issues of democracy and energy justice within the print media coverage.}

Each parking space has an IoT gadget, which includes sensors and embedded systems. The user is given a real-time update on the availability of all parking spaces and is given the option to pick the optimal position. This study is centered on fully automated parking area utilizing image analysis, as well as or before parking places with sensing and OTP generating. The car park reduces the need for user interaction, increases wage costs, and allows for space well before. The Autonomous Vehicle Parking System allows users to park their cars without the need for human interaction and operates 24 h a day, seven days a week. The Pre-Booking software allows the user can reserve a parking space via this app, reducing the customer's time spent hunting for a parked spot and energy usage.

The pollutants flowing with water made a severe pollution in downstream areas of rivers. Metals concentrations in river water was found to be higher in dry season. Dissolve oxygen (DO) was nearly zero in Buriganga River and several points in Turag, Balu, Sitalakhya and Karnaphuli River. NO3-, NO2- and PO43- pollution occurred in different rivers. Zn, Cu, Fe, Pb, Cd, Ni, Mn, As and Cr concentration was above drinking water standard in most of the river and some metals was even above irrigation standard in water from several rivers. Sediment data showed very much higher metal concentrations in most of the rivers especially peripheral rivers in Dhaka and Karnaphuli, Korotoa, Teesta, Rupsha and Meghna River. Metal concentrations in sediment was above US EPA threshold value in most of the rivers. Metal concentrations in fish and agricultural crops showed that bioaccumulations of metals had occurred. The concentration of metals showed the trend like: water<fish<sediment. Agricultural crops were found to contain toxic metals through polluted water irrigation. The calculated data of daily intake for the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic showed that consumption of the contaminated foodstuff can cause serious health injuries.}

The interaction among these stakeholders, which are regarded as subjects of individual interest, leads to a complex energy generation, storage, transaction, and consumption problem. Based on the assumption that the customers always provide the best response to the signals of leaders, the trilevel problem is transformed into a bilevel problem by replacing the lowest level problem with its optimality conditions. Next, two coordination schemes are formulated to analyze the interactions between the smart distribution network and microgrids with demand response resources. The first scheme is a full cooperative coordination framework, in which the smart distribution network and microgrids jointly activate the resources located under the distribution networks. The second scheme is an ancillary service framework in the sense that the smart distribution network acts as a service subject to balance the supply and demand of the networks, and charges the management fee for transmission service. This scheme can achieve rapid convergence in a distributed manner, expose little information, and protect the privacy of the selfish participants. For each coordination scheme, a detailed mathematical model and solution method are formed. Illustrative examples highlight the feasibility and applicability of the schemes and provide references for the government in making decision with respect to the problems of coordination among the smart distribution networks, microgrids, and customers.}

Several key findings are highlighted: (1) Low-carbon city policy exerts negative impact on carbon lock-in, which means that the policy successfully inhibits carbon lock-in. (2) The dynamic effect of low-carbon city policy is constant and becomes more prominent over time. (3) The impact of low-carbon city policy on carbon lock-in is heterogeneous and asymmetric. This policy is more effective in cities in the eastern regions, in cities where there is strong government administrative power, and where there is a high level of industry structure upgrading as well as technology innovation. (4) Low-carbon city policy indirectly influences carbon lock-in through environmental regulation, informatization, and human capital effects, which are three effective mediators. Several specific policy implications are put forward according to the above conclusions to overcome the reinforced carbon lock-in situation.}

abstract = {Detecting faults in electrical power grids is of paramount importance, both from the electricity operator and consumer point of view. Modern electric power grids (smart grids) are equipped with smart sensors that allow to gather real-time information regarding the physical status of all components belonging to the whole infrastructure (e.g., cables and related insulation, transformers, and breakers). In real-world smart grid systems, usually, additional information that are related to the operational status of the grid are collected, such as meteorological information. Designing an efficient recognition model to discriminate faults in real-world smart grid system is hence a challenging task. This follows from the heterogeneity of the information that actually determine a typical fault condition. In this paper, we deal with the problem of modeling and recognizing faults in a real-world smart grid system, which supplies the entire city of Rome, Italy. Recognition of faults is addressed by following a combined approach of dissimilarity measures learning and one-class classification techniques. We provide here an in-depth study related to the available data and to the models based on the proposed one-class classification approach. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the fault recognition results by exploiting a fuzzy set based decision rule.}

Ongoing advances in science and engineering is going to improve the link between computational and physical elements by means of intelligent mechanisms, dramatically increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems. The transformation of physical systems into cyber-physical systems (CPS) by imbibing them with intelligence is an ongoing process that can substantially benefit the society and the environment by improving comfort, convenience and quality of life of the people, while reducing consumption of natural resources and reducing environmental footprint. Examples of cyber physical systems are Smart Grid Networks, Smart Transportation System, Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure, Utility Service Infrastructure for Smart Cities, etc. But, the inherent dangers in this transformation are: it allows flexible control and resource use; provides conduits for information leakage; prone to misconfigurations and deliberate attacks by outsiders and insiders.

However, the question of how to mitigate and adapt to urban heat– a critical weather-related problem has environmental, social and economic consequences within an FMC– is rarely discussed. Such a research gap has significantly limited the satisfaction of inclusive, resilient and safe requirements, especially in (sub)tropical cities. To overcome this gap, this study aims to systematically elucidate a heat-resilient FMC that can enhance urban resilience to extreme heat. In particular, this paper clarifies opportunities, measurement, and mechanism of a heat-resilient FMC. Afterwards, this paper proposes the recommendation on high-resolution heat assessment, heat-prone area identification, heat mitigation measures, and heat adaptation measures for improving FMC heat resilience. Overall, this paper is important to broaden FMC theories and practices tailoring to increasingly severe urban heat challenges and to provide imperative implications for urban planners, designers and managers to implement heat preparation, mitigation and adaptation under a promising sustainable initiative.}

abstract = {The evolution of existing electricity grids to smart grids is aimed at accommodating increasing shares of renewable generation thus contributing for the de-carbonization of economy, offering more diversified services to consumers, enhancing different types of markets (energy, capacity, ancillary services) and improving the system's overall efficiency. As the economic characteristics of the electricity sector tend to discourage investments in smart grids, many countries have adopted incentive policies to foster the deployment of new technologies, which vary according to the particular characteristics of each country. Therefore, the design of specific public policies for Brazil must consider not only the motivations involved, but also the existing challenges for the implementation of smart grids and the socio-economic context. Moreover, the relevance of the proposed policies can be seen from different perspectives. This justifies the need to elicit information from multiple stakeholders for decision support purposes. This paper presents and assesses a set of policies identified by different stakeholders as having a potential to foster the development of smart grids in Brazil. The methodology to shape this set of policies consisted of a thorough literature review of international experiences, combined with meetings with experts in several domains. Then, these policies were assessed by applying a Delphi questionnaire aiming at measuring their effectiveness in fulfilling the objectives associated with investments in smart grids. A first conclusion is that all policies were assessed as having a positive impact taking into account each of the objectives, differing only in the priority to be assigned to each one. The policies that were considered more relevant were: "Incentive Policies for Promoting Demand-Side Management, Distributed Generation and Storage", "Regulatory Changes to Foster Innovation in the Energy Sector" and "Regulation of New Business Models". Among the policies with the worst scores, "Mandatory Rollout of Smart Meters" and "Establishing Quality Standards for the Telecommunications Industry" were ranked as the two lower-ranked policies, i.e., they were assigned lower priority under all objectives.}

The severe security flaw discourages the adoption of the Internet of things in smart living. In this paper, we leverage fog computing and microservice to push certificate authority (CA) functions to the proximity of data sources. Through which, we can minimize attack surfaces and authentication latency, and result in a fast and scalable scheme in authenticating a large volume of resource-limited devices. Then, we design lightweight protocols to implement the scheme, where both a high level of security and low computation workloads on SO (no bilinear pairing requirement on the client-side) is accomplished. Evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our scheme in handling authentication and registration for a large number of nodes, meanwhile protecting them against various threats to smart living. Finally, we showcase the success of computing intelligence movement towards data sources in handling complicated services.}

However, the solid–liquid leakage, low thermal conductivity, and single functionality of PCMs hinder their applications to electronic equipment. In this study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene oxide/ferric oxide (PEO/Fe3O4)-based core–sheath textiles are prepared using an eco-friendly coaxial electrospinning technique and simple steam crosslinking. The composite phase change fibers (CPCFs) and magnetic composite phase change fibers (MCPCFs) produced in this way show ultrahigh encapsulation ratios of 78.02 wt% and 69.11 wt%, respectively, and high phase change enthalpies of 106.96 J g−1 and 94.75 J g−1, respectively. The addition of Fe3O4 (20 wt%) introduces a saturation magnetization of 9.5 emu g−1, thereby realizing 3 dB electromagnetic shielding performance. The textiles exhibit excellent flexibility and can be formed into complex shapes. Owing to their core–sheath structure, the CPCFs and MCPCFs exhibit outstanding structural and thermal stabilities during 100 thermal cycles. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the CPCF and MCPCF textiles can be enhanced by crosslinking.}

Consequently, they also provide benefits to water service providers, in terms of augmentation deferrals and reduced sized infrastructure. However, while these benefits are acknowledged in the literature, they have not been thoroughly investigated and quantified. This paper empirically demonstrates how the installation of different potable water saving measures would affect the design of urban water supply networks. Peak day water demand profiles were developed for the baseline scenario, which represented the typical building code mandated for new dwellings constructed in Queensland, Australia, and for households fitted with water saving measures. The core novel feature of this study relates to the use of an innovative bottom-up approach to the development of demand profiles based on smart meters enabling comprehensive water end use datasets (i.e. demand in shower, tap, etc.) to be obtained. Hydraulic model runs were conducted for various water savings scenarios across different planning horizons to determine the scheduling of augmentations in a water supply study area. The results of the model runs showed deferred and eliminated augmentations, as well as reductions in infrastructure sizing for the water savings scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. Financial analysis (i.e. NPV) on trunk main augmentation requirements over 50 year asset life cycles indicated that savings of between $1,574,289 (11.4%) and $7,030,796 (51%) could be achieved by incorporating water efficiency and potable source substitution measures in new infill developments in the study region.}

In order to improve the efficiency of the model, this paper combines ant colony algorithm with genetic algorithm and introduces smoothing factor and guiding factor, and obtains genetic algorithm (genetic algorithm-path smoothing ant colony optimization) with changing probability. Experimental results show that the convergence speed of the algorithm is fast, and it can converge in 78 iterations, and the operation efficiency is higher. The result error of the proposed algorithm is 1.39, which is smaller than that of other comparative algorithms. In the actual application effect evaluation, the average satisfaction of the planned route of the intelligent tourism route planning model based on efficiency improvement is 15.38, which is higher than that of the traditional genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm. It shows that the model can not only efficiently plan the best travel route, but also comprehensively consider the whole trip of tourists, so that tourists can have a better travel experience. The research provides an intelligent route planning method that is more efficient and more in line with tourists' needs for tourism development.}

Demand response (DR), the matching of demand to available electricity supply, is a relatively new activity, important for systems that rely on distributed renewable generation. Price-based DR is spreading among residential and small business customers, along with direct control of distributed and aggregated small loads, mostly thermal. In both types of DR, information and communication technology plays a part. This paper contributes to the debates on implementing electricity system transition and on adoption of smart technologies. Through analysis of a large-scale demonstration of highly-distributed smart thermal storage in three European countries, using mixed methods, it supports the claim that DR can usefully be seen as an outcome of interactions between technologies, activities and service expectations. Adopting a broad scope of enquiry to take in customer experiences of DR and the contributions from a range of actors, the paper shows how it was possible to achieve useful levels of aggregated DR in some circumstances. The quality and quantity of DR were influenced by customer experiences of taking part in the demonstration, which in turn were affected by three types of communication: connectivity, control and care. Outcomes also depended on contributions from a range of actors, especially the 'middle actors' who had some direct contact with both customers and programme leaders. Mainstream theory of DR has concentrated on deploying technologies, controls and price signals. The paper demonstrates how, in practice, effectiveness relates to social and organisational as well as technical and economic features of energy systems. It concludes with some implications for design and implementation of DR programmes, and for smart energy policy in general.}

However, stakeholders are facing challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. “Islands of Information” issue is commonly existing and creates information fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple stakeholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines. Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress traceability, and real-time KPI visualization & evaluation, but also improves the information reliability, immutability, and transparency in MiC projects.}

This paper employs a multi-period DID model to investigate the effect of the “City-County Merger” policy (CCMP) on urban carbon emissions, while also exploring potential channels and heterogeneity characteristics. The findings of this study are unequivocal: the implementation of the CCMP has proven to be a potent strategy in effectively curbing urban carbon emissions. This conclusion remains robust after a series of robustness tests. Furthermore, the study identifies certain channels that play a pivotal role in moderating the nexus between the CCMP and urban carbon emissions, including enhancing government intervention, optimizing urban energy structure, and improving urban (green) technology innovation. The heterogeneity analysis shows that CCMP yields heightened effectiveness in small and medium-sized cities, non-resource-based cities, and cities in the eastern and western regions. This study serves to provide nuanced insights, offering both theoretical underpinnings and pragmatic recommendations to propel the effective implementation of the CCMP.}

However, as projects move from planning to implementation, the exploratory innovation methods are replaced by exploitative approaches. ‘The holistic vision and in particular, citizens’ described needs, fail to transfer into the implementation phase. This paper identifies four main challenges as to why this happens and link these to theory on ambidextrous organizations that need to exploit existing knowledge while reaching into the future with its rapidly changing goals and technological opportunities. Implementing stakeholders are familiar with exploitative tools, which build on earlier experience and capabilities of the selected implementing stakeholders, and the implementation stage leaves little time and resources for innovation on a lower hierarchical level. While extensive research on smart and integrated planning focus on ‘breaking down the silos’ meaning sectors and disciplines, our findings argue that the need to manage ambidextrous organizations and support both exploratory and exploitative innovation is equally important. An ambidextrous organization is one that has the ability to be efficient in its management of today's business while being adaptable for coping with the changing demand of tomorrow. We propose a model in which the organizational style and management style of innovative neighborhood pilots focus more on how to transfer knowledge and learn from the bottom-up and horizontally through management that foster both innovation models.}

To increase the reliability of the current electrical systems and to make them more capable of dealing with the challenges of wind energy would be possible with the utilization of smart grid systems.

A quasi-natural experimental framework reveals direct effects, indirect influences, non-linear relationships, and spatial heterogeneity of DIC on CEE. The research distills several pivotal insights: (1) DIC exerts a markedly positive impact on CEE, as evidenced by comprehensive robustness analyses. (2) The digital service industry agglomeration and green technology innovation act as key mechanisms through which DIC influences CEE. (3) The intensity of BCP exhibits an "inverted U-shaped" relationship with CEE. As the level of CEE increases, the impact of DIC on CEE gradually rises, demonstrating a marginal increasing effect. (4) The spatial spillover effects of DIC on CEE vary with increasing distance, revealing a dichotomy: an "agglomeration shadow" within 200 km of policy pilot cities and a pronounced stimulative effect on CEE within a 200–300 km radius. (5) The efficacy of DIC in enhancing CEE is augmented by proximity to central cities, with the optimal radius of influence for central cities determined to be 200 km, beyond which a diminishing gradient effect is observed, forming a "core-peripheral" spatial pattern. The findings endorse the strategic augmentation of digital infrastructure as a lever for economic and environmental co-benefits, steering towards carbon neutrality and equitable regional development.}

abstract = {Cities need to adapt to ageing societies because the average age of habitants is increasing rapidly alongside the global trend of urbanisation. Apparent effects on both society and individual livelihoods will continue to increase in the coming decades. Great hopes are projected on technology to support solutions for the ageing society and urban planning. Smart city strategies and the field of ambient assisted living are two concepts sharing the assumption that technology will make our lives more independent, more efficient and safer with a higher quality of life. This paper presents a case study of a participatory foresight project that investigates how transdisciplinary agenda setting through the means of including citizens, experts and stakeholders can provide orientation for long-term planning on the future of ageing in the city. Results enforce the argument that urban governance needs to address additional tasks whilst adapting to challenges arising from ageing societies and urbanisation. Alongside mere technological innovation, human factors gain importance. Future-oriented urban development strategies need to incorporate this fact and should not predominantly be drafted on the paradigm of technological progress.}

abstract = {A smart municipal energy grid including electricity and heat production infrastructure and electricity demand response has been modeled in HOMER case study with the aim of decreasing total yearly community energy costs. The optimal configurations of used technologies (photovoltaic plants, combined heat and power plants, wind power plants) and sizing, with minimal costs, are presented and compared using three scenarios of average electricity market price 3.5 c€/kWh, 5 c€/kWh and 10 c€/kWh. Smart municipal energy grids will have an important role in future electricity markets, due to their flexibility to utilize excess electricity production from CHP and variable renewable energy sources through heat storage. This flexibility enables the levelized costs of energy within smart municipal energy grids to decrease below electricity market prices even in case of fuel price disturbances. With initial costs in the range 0–3,931,882 €, it has been shown that economical and environmental benefits of smart municipal energy grids are: the internal rate of return in the range 6.87–15.3%, and CO2 emissions in the range from −4,885,203 to 5,165,780 kg/year. The resulting realistic number of hours of operation of combined heat and power plants obtained by simulations is in the range 2410- 7849 h/year.}

Instead of the “creative design” approach in the scenario making in traditional PSS and recent Geodesign frameworks, the Smart Design method applies the optimization algorithms to search for optimal design solutions in the design space. It integrates the design thinking, computational performance modeling and optimization techniques to efficiently and effectively approximate optimal designs. This method is applied to a hypothetical residential neighborhood design case study with three sustainability objectives: to maximize FAR, to minimize building energy use, and to minimize outdoor human discomfort. Based on the form parameterization, the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm is utilized to guide the evolution of the neighborhood design throughout 80 generations, with neighborhood performance modeling tools. The Smart Design method is able to identify 38 representative design solutions as Pareto optimal which are equally optimal. Those solutions set a basis for discussions and negotiations among stake holders to make design decisions with the three objectives. Further research will be focused on addressing the challenges such as recursive objective definitions, parametrization of complex forms, quantification of performances and optimization uncertainties, from simple cases to more realistic and complex designs for sustainable neighborhood development.}

The ‘smartness’ of a smart grid is wasted if major consumption locations, ranging from individual buildings to larger collection of buildings (such as campuses or cities) don’t have a comparable level of intelligence. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective tool for integrating the smart grid with future smart buildings. Interest is growing about the need to research the application of MPC to the operation of building systems; however, full-scale MPC concepts have not made it yet into commercially available building energy management systems. Much of the prior published work uses a simplified description of building and systems performance in order to reduce computational complexity. We describe in this paper a vision for data flow and modeling developments that a future, high level control system will need. This would allow a smart building or connected campus of buildings to effectively integrate an overall operational strategy for a future time horizon of 24-48hours to minimize the energy consumption and cost, enable integration of regional renewable energy sources, and, importantly, consider human factors such as building indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort indoor air quality, etc.). This idealized data exchange and systems control network would obtain or predict data on parameters such as the real-time cost of electricity, renewable energy production, building cooling and heating loads, and current system disruptions (such as equipment maintenance). System monitoring would provide feedback for advanced features such as adaptive learning and automated fault detection and diagnostics. In addition to the idealized future system that is fully capable as described, we discuss some of the issues involved with trying to implement these concepts in older, existing building systems.}

In this chapter, Q-Chem presents the information collected from facilities operated by Chevron Philips Chemicals (CPChem) and its joint ventures to develop LDAR programs and compare traditional and “Smart” programs. Inclusion of a LDAR program became a State of Qatar environmental requirement. The State authority had enforced LDAR program in some industries' consent to operate, when QChem was only required to monitor hydrocarbon tanks. Q-Chem had chosen to be in full compliance with the contractual agreement with Mesaieed Industrial City (MIC) and Ras Laffan Industrial City (RLIC) for the operated plants at these cities. For that, Q-Chem decided to build and implement a "Smart LDAR Program", incorporating the use of Infra Red Optical Gas Imaging Cameras (IR Camera) for qualitative monitoring of leaks and traditional VOC “Sniffers” for the quantitative measures of identified leakers. Moreover, this “Smart LDAR Program” is predicated on the use of P&IDs and PFDs and populating a database that lists and tracks all fugitive sources, their annual leaking values, and repair histories without physical tagging of individual sources in the field.}

abstract = {The emergence of mobile edge computing can provide technical support for the development of Internet services and for coping with massive data traffic, thereby reducing network latency and ensuring efficient network operations and service delivery. However, the mobile edge computing environment is prone to data loss and privacy leakage, and data security and reliability cannot be guaranteed. The application of blockchain technology ensures the stability and dependability of data caching and transactions. In order to guarantee the security of data caching in the mobile edge computing environment and minimize the response time of caching servers, this paper proposes a decentralized data caching strategy in the mobile edge computing environment. The strategy uses a greedy algorithm to make the transmission delay of the requested content as small as possible under the multiple constraints of the storage space of each server and whether the content is cached on the server. To address the problem that data trading platforms are unable to afford the computation and storage of massive amounts of data and cannot guarantee that the data will not be leaked, this paper proposes a secure decentralized data transaction program. The scheme promotes the increase of transaction turnover rate and improves the revenue of both participating parties by establishing a buyer–seller matching algorithm. According to the experimental results, the proposed data caching strategy can improve the cache hit rate and reduce the transmission delay; the proposed data transaction solution can increase the revenue of both the data holder and the data buyer.}

In this research, the techno-economic feasibility and dynamic performance assessment of a smart solar Photovoltaic (PV) Direct Current grid (DC-grid) powered Separately Excited Direct Current Motor (SEDCM) is presented. The energy mapping was done at Agbani City (6°18.3′N, 7°33.8′E), in Enugu State, Nigeria. Agbani city was identified to have a good amount of solar energy with an annual average solar radiation of 4.67 kWh/m2/d. The dynamic performance assessment of a smart solar PV DC-grid powered SEDCM was conducted with the help of MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The result show that a change in sun intensity affects the photon-generated current and it has effect on the open-circuit voltage of the solar panel. This change in the intensity can be compensated for by the use of a boost converter. The whole system was optimized in HOMER Pro simulation software to assess the techno-economic feasibility of the system. From the techno-economic study, it was observed that the proposed DC-grid PV system is feasible for the generation of electricity to power the SEDCM. The cost of energy was calculated and the categorized result from HOMER Pro shows that the capacity of the DC-grid PV system (35.67 kW) with 120 Surrette S-260 batteries gives the cheapest configuration. This configuration has a cost of energy of 0.11 $/kWh and a Net Present Cost (NPC) value of 0.048 million dollars and was used as optimum system configuration. Comparing the system with the national grid, the proposed DC-grid PV configuration has a cost saving of 35% with 1.679 gCO2~eq/kWh greenhouse gas emission, while the national grid emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas up to 15,104 kg/y.}

The first studies around day-to-day variability of travel behaviour were based on surveys. Those studies have shown that there is considerable variation in individual travel behaviour. They have also discussed the implications of this variability in terms of modelling, policy evaluation or marketing. Recently, the multiplication of big data has led to an explosion in the number of studies about travel behaviour. This is because those new data sources collect lots of data, about lots of people over long periods. In the field of public transit, smart card data is one of those big data sources. They have been used by various authors to conduct longitudinal analyses of transit usage behaviour. However, researchers working with smart card data mostly rely on clustering techniques to measure variability, and they often use conceptual framework different from those of transportation researchers familiar with traditional data sources. In particular, there is no study based on smart card data that explicitly measure day-to-day intrapersonal variability of transit usage. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation is to address this gap. To do this, a clustering method and a similarity metric are combined to explore simultaneously interpersonal and intrapersonal variability of transit usage. The application is done with a rich dataset covering a 6 months period (181 days) and it contributes to the growing literature on smart card data. Results of this research confirm previous works based on survey data and show that there is no one size fits all approach to the problem of day-to-day variability of transit usage. They also prove that combining clustering algorithm with day-to-day intrapersonal similarity metric is a valuable tool to mine smart card data. The findings of this study can help in identifying new passenger segmentation and in tailoring information and services.}

Sometimes, the products are extremely limited in the social communication between products to consumers and products to products, and the primary communication system is the interface, but typically, this interface is not designed as a social element. As a result, social communication is minimal. Thus, a basic design methodology that allows product designers to incorporate social factors between products to consumers and products to products is presented in this paper. Also, the term social communication PCPP (Product-Consumer and Product-Product) is coined as a part of the product design methodology that allows defining the social features as primary elements in the process of designing products. Besides, a conceptual method for smart thermostats is proposed for a social communication PCPP to demonstrate how this conceptual proposal could be implemented using the sensing, smart and sustainable (S3) features.}

Services that offer trusted timestamps on the blockchain exist, where one creates a timestamp on a value by sending the blockchain a transaction containing the value, which is eventually confirmed in a block a miner creates and timestamps. Our work focuses on the accuracy of such timestamps created on the Ethereum blockchain. We estimate that their mean accuracy is half of the average time between consecutive blocks. However, Ethereum clients geth and parity allow accuracy to vary in up to a few tens of seconds. Surprisingly, we found out empirically that miners can backdate data using the timestamp on a block, which is a serious flaw in timestamping services. To address this problem, we propose a new decentralized timestamping service that combines smart contracts and distinct time providers. The service offers timestamps with higher accuracy of milliseconds. We conduct a cost analysis of our service, which shows that Ethereum transaction fees drive our timestamps costs when the service scales up. Finally, we discuss alternatives to cut costs.}

IoV aims to increase road user safety and lower accident rates. It is one of the main components of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). ITS appears as the most crucial component since the cities in any country are evolving into digital civilisations as a result of the smart city concept, regardless of whether people are travelling within the city, to work, in school, or for other purposes. It can also be used to improve infrastructure utilisation and road safety (i.e., reduction in road accidents), in addition to enhancing traffic management and easing congestion. However, IoV-driven ITS is susceptible to several forms of attacks because of the insecure communication among the participating entities. We, therefore, propose a secure authentication protocol for IoV-driven ITS to stop these attacks from happening (in short, SAKP-ITS). Its resistance to a number of potential attacks is confirmed by the security analysis of the proposed SAKP-ITS. Additionally, SAKP-ITS is juxtaposed with other comparable competing methods put out in an IoV environment. Additionally, it has been found that SAKP-ITS outperforms competing schemes in terms of critical metrics like communication costs, computation costs, and security and functionality attributes. To test the effect of the proposed SAKP-ITS on the critical performance attributes, a practical implementation of SAKP-ITS is also presented.}

Recently, the number of rankings for inclusive cities is rising, in fact along with growing investments in inclusive city projects and initiatives. The inclusive city rankings have both the strength to enhance lesson-drawing and self-improvement and the weakness to exacerbate competition among un-equals. In this article, nine different ranking systems for assessing urban inclusion are scrutinized and compared. Based on relevant theory regarding inclusive urban development and ranking systems, a methodology to compare and assess ranking systems is established, building on different quality aspects. The findings indicate that although for most ranking systems much essential information to understand how they produce results can be retrieved, motivations for generating these inclusive city rankings can be moral, utilitarian, or a combination of both, and that evaluation methods and dissemination of the results sometimes lack transparency and timeliness. Some metrics are incomplete and/or biased toward specific dimensions and indicators. The consistency across the ranking systems in producing the best-performing cities is much stronger than that of the worst-performing cities. Moreover, an obvious developed-developing gap was observed in the sense that most high performers are in Europe and to a lesser extent Nord-America, while the bottom 25 % are primarily in developing countries. Finally, suggestions are given to make methodologies for inclusive ranking systems more transparent, comprehensive and less biased.}

The rapid proliferation of EVs will introduce an unprecedented load on the existing electric grid due to the charging/discharging behavior of the EVs, thus motivating the need for novel approaches for routing EVs across the grid. In this paper, a novel distributed control framework based on noncooperative game theory for routing of EVs within the smart grid is proposed. The goal of this framework is to control and balance the electricity load in a distributed manner across the grid while taking into account the traffic congestion and the waiting time at charging stations. The EV routing problem is formulated as a repeated game, and it is shown that the selfish behavior of EVs will result in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with the price of anarchy upper bounded by the ratio of the variance of the ground load to the total number of EVs in the grid. In particular, it is shown that any achieved Nash equilibrium substantially improves the load balance across the grid. Moreover, the results are extended to capture the stochastic nature of induced ground load as well as the subjective behavior of the EV owners using the behavioral framework of prospect theory. Simulation results provide new insights on efficient energy pricing at charging stations and under realistic grid conditions.}

abstract = {Through tests conducted at the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority’s (TRCA) Archetype Sustainable Houses, a hybrid residential space heating system with a supervisory controller was monitored and studied to evaluate its performance and effectiveness for the heating season. A high efficiency natural gas furnace (NGF) and an electric air source heat pump (ASHP) were coupled together to meet the space heating demand of the house. This integrated system is called the cloud based Smart Dual Fuel Switching System (SDFSS) that considers time-of-use (TOU) pricing, fuel cost, short-term weather forecast, and equipment efficiencies and capacities. This multi-variable decision-making process defines an optimal schedule for the hybrid system to run more cost effectively. This paper analyses two separate SDFSSs. According to these analyses, the SDFSS systems showed lower operating cost with respect to the furnace or the ASHP system alone with various carbon tax (CT) levels from $0 to $250/tonne of CT with an increment of $10/tonne of CT that were simulated, along with a significant GHG emission reduction relative to the conventional heating systems. Furthermore, with these technologies, Canada’s residential sector could potentially meet Canada’s Paris Agreement goals. The SDFSS technology is a is flexible, user friendly, ubiquitous technology for the smooth transition from today’s natural gas dominated space heating system to the future’s low carbon infrastructure powered by a heat pump and renewable energy.}

In the first step, based on the accessibility to existence of excess capacities of water and wastewater networks the extent of study area is analyzed. In the second step, based on the combination of mentioned infrastructures capacities, the extent of study area is classified into three zones entitled High, Medium and Low Ability to Development. In fact, each of this zone reflects a specific level of ability for the potential future development. Then share and extension of unused areas in these zones are discovered. Finally, by calculating the weight of each zone by AHP approach and then using them as well as the areas of unused lands as the input variables in the Simple Additive Weighting method, all the neighborhoods within the study area were ranked for future development. The results show that not only access to urban water infrastructure must not be considered as the only criterion for deciding about future development but also excess capacity in these infrastructures and their location are more crucial. Also, the results of sensitivity analyses show that uncertainties involved in AHP weights can truly be handled in the proposed framework. Leading to better use of unconsidered urban infrastructure opportunities and provide better sight for future land-use planning can be interpreted as the main achievement of this research.}

abstract = {Rising peak demand is a major cause for high emissions from the electricity sector. In this study, we investigate how different combinations of distributed energy technologies affect peak grid load, energy consumption from the grid, and emissions in the residential sector under time-varying prices. To do so, we develop an optimization framework in which households with varied amalgamations of distributed energy technologies minimize electricity costs, amortized capital, and operational costs over a year, with marginally increasing penalties for deviating from room temperature set-points. The four technologies we consider are: solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, ice cold thermal energy storage, and smart thermostats. The study also incorporates a one-parameter thermal model of the home, so that the discomfort penalties can apply to the room temperature rather than the total appliance load. Based on empirical energy consumption profiles and solar generation data from 25 homes in Austin, we find that residential customers would keep overall annual expenditure and environmental footprint low by investing in solar panels and smart thermostats. The capital costs of both storage systems are still too high to make them economically profitable investments for typical residential customers. Additionally, the Value of Solar policy disincentivizes solar customer investment in storage systems. The study also shows that, while the energetic effect of the two storage systems can be favorable or detrimental depending upon the pricing structure and the household load profile, lithium-ion batteries are the main instruments to avoid high demand charges. Thus, we recommend that, as an effective peak load control mechanism, electric utilities should offer significant rebates to encourage residential customer investment in storage systems in addition to subjecting them to demand charges.}

Through the in-depth demand analysis including quantification of energy consumption dynamics and consumer preferences, energy decision-makers can develop reasonable and forethoughtful energy efficiency plans and demand-response programs. Previous work in energy-demand behavioral research relied primarily on ideal socio-economic models or data-driven approaches, both of which lack flexibility, intuition and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal visual analysis approach for urban energy consumption pattern discovery in order to identify energy-saving potentials, plan energy supply and improve energy efficiency. In this approach, energy consumption time series are embeded into a two-dimensional scatterplot for coordinated visual exploration. Users can interactively explore and discover different patterns for decision-making purposes. In addition, we propose the method for modeling energy demand shift patterns based on a potential flow method and integrate it into a pattern exploration tool. The proposed approach is comprehensively evaluated through empirical studies using the real-world electricity consumption data from Pudong district, Shanghai. We identify five typical energy consumption patterns and demand shift patterns across different geographical locations, which can be well interpreted by the knowledge of energy consumption in the area of interest. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the tool. This tool can be integrated into smart energy systems for a better understanding of user energy consumption behaviors and preferences.}

Fog Computing aims at supporting the development of time-sensitive, location-, social-, and context-aware applications by using computational resources in close proximity of information producers and consumers, such as increasingly common cheap and powerful modern hardware platforms. However, realizing Fog Computing solutions for Smart Cities represents a very challenging task, because of the massive amount of data to process, the strict resource and time constraints, and the significant dynamicity and heterogeneity of computation and network resources. These formidable challenges suggest taking into consideration new information and service model solutions that explore several trade-offs between processing speed and accuracy. Along these guidelines, we designed the SPF Fog-as-a-Service platform, which proposes a new information-centric and utility-based service model and allows the definition of self-adaptive and composition-friendly services, which can execute either on edge devices or in the Cloud. In numerous evaluations, SPF proved to be a very effective platform for running Fog services on heterogeneous devices with significantly different computational capabilities while also demonstrating remarkable ease of development and management characteristics.}

abstract = {The introduction of market forces in the energy sector in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe has drastically changed the climate for investments in the electricity infrastructure. In contrast with the former public monopoly situation, many new uncertainties need to be taken into account in network investment decisions. Another marked difference is the fragmentation of energy markets and the entrance of new players on the energy market stage, often in new roles. The upgrading of electricity networks to create so-called smart grids has therewith become a multi-actor investment problem, which requires a well-designed and well-managed process. For the specific case of the Netherlands, the challenges of smart grid development are explored in depth. As several competing scenarios are possible for the realization of smart grids, it is likely that the scenario first entering the implementation stage will have a first-mover advantage. This, in combination with the split incentive issue for smart grids, results in the conclusion that the realization of smart grids needs public support. Similar outcomes are observed in other European countries despite markedly different local conditions and drivers for the smart grid. It seems that smart public policy intervention is needed to reduce the overwhelming uncertainties related to smart grid investments, which by far exceed the normal investment risk as encountered in network expansion. Finally, the relevance of these findings is discussed for the future of the electricity sector in China's emerging economy.}

This article provides an HEESS overview focusing on battery-supercapacitor hybrids, covering different aspects in smart grid and electrified vehicle applications. The primary goal of this paper is to summarize recent research progress and stimulate innovative thoughts for HEESS development. To this end, system configuration, DC/DC converter design and energy management strategy development are covered in great details. The state-of-the-art methods to approach these issues are surveyed; the relationship and technological details in between are also expounded. A case study is presented to demonstrate a framework of integrated sizing formulation and energy management strategy synthesis. The results show that an HEESS with appropriate sizing and enabling energy management can markedly reduce the battery degradation rate by about 40% only at an extra expense of 1/8 of the system cost compared with battery-only energy storage.}

abstract = {We contribute to the understanding of public transport passenger route choice behavior by developing and applying methods that capture behavioral strategies by making use of smart card data. We begin by proposing the classification of possible route choice behavioral strategies in two groups: disaggregated strategies and aggregated strategies. In the former, the alternatives correspond to itineraries, which are fixed sequences of stops and public transport lines. In the latter, common line alternatives are considered, which are combinations of itineraries defined under given criteria. Almost all route choice models use consideration sets composed only of itineraries, while public transport assignment models for strategic analysis mostly use a version of the common lines approach. We postulate that this dichotomy is inappropriate and that, instead, heterogeneity exists in the route choice strategy, both between users and across contexts. With the aim of verifying this hypothesis, we first propose an indicator function constructed as the difference between expected and observed trips for a given behavioral assumption. We apply then the indicator to a case study based on smart card data from the city of Santiago, Chile, from which we find evidence of heterogeneity. We identify individuals that follow either an aggregated or a disaggregated strategy, as well as others who seem to be using a combination of both strategies. We further analyze the heterogeneity hypothesis using an integrated discrete choice and latent class approach, which we apply to the same case study. This approach involves estimating path-size logit models built with alternatives from disaggregated and aggregated strategies, as well as a latent class model built from a combination of both. It also addresses methodological challenges related to the definition of the consideration set and the correction of endogeneity. Results confirm the heterogeneity hypothesis, suggesting that the mean probability that passengers belong to the class that uses a disaggregated strategy for route choice is 51.2%, and that this heterogeneity markedly occurs between individuals, not within their choices. We also find that the latent class considering aggregated alternatives appear to prefer bus over metro, while the latent class considering disaggregated alternatives prefer metro over bus. The fact that waiting time is relatively more burdensome for the aggregated strategy class is in line with this class’s preference for common lines. Walking time and bus crowding are more burdensome for the disaggregated strategy class, in line with their observed modal preferences.}

Besides other infrastructural components, healthcare sector has to go through many changes in terms of acquiring, processing, and distribution of healthcare data. Many healthcare mobile solutions are designed to support elderly and rural patients, healthcare workers, and urban consultants. With the fast pace of urbanization comes the undue stress on some vital human organs, the most vital among them are the eyes. The focus of the research is related with monitoring the eye health in some adverse health conditions such as diabetes. The risk of related visual loss in people with diabetes is up to 25 times higher than the population not affected by diabetes. Visual impairment is therefore the most feared complication of diabetes. Diabetes can damage the retina, and the chances of this happening increase with the duration of the disease. Treatment can be given to arrest this damage and prevent loss of vision, but it must be applied at the right moment because once vision is lost, treatment is unlikely to restore it. Unfortunately, retinal damage can become sight-threatening without the patient being aware of it. Therefore patients with diabetes should be encouraged to have regular check-ups for diabetic retinopathy. With advanced communication technology information can be processed and communicated rapidly which shows how heathcare has turned smarter and faster. This research reviews the technology available for smartphone-based fundus photography and suggests further research to evaluate the effectiveness of these devices when dealing with diagnosing eye diseases. However, none of the devices are meant to replace traditional fundus cameras or rule out a trained health professional for diagnosis.}

In this framework we model the energy consumption of a living unit, and its energy exchanges with the surroundings. A unit is a well delimited space inside a building, for which the information on electrical consumption is known. We assume that the unit has no energy exchanges with its neighbors. Examples of units are a household, an office, a restaurant or a gym. We explicitly consider the impact of the outside environment and design features such as building orientation, automatic shading, and double façade. We formulate this problem as a nonlinear optimization model in which the living unit minimizes a performance function subject to the energy flows from and toward the unit as well as the building-specific features. It is solved using off-the-shelf solvers. We present computational experiments to validate the proposed approach, considering different objective functions and several building configurations. The experiments show that our approach enhances the unit's performance and also provides demand flexibility for the grid. We demonstrate that for heating a unit in Montreal, Canada, there are periods where the EMS alone can lower the electricity cost by up to 26% and the energy consumption by up to 14%. If the EMS is combined with smart design features, the electricity cost of heating can be lowered by up to 35%, the cost of cooling by up to 97%, and the energy consumption by up to 49%.}

Currently, supervised learning methods are widely adopted to identify household profiles using smart meter data. Such methods could achieve promising performance in the case of sufficient labeled data but show low accuracy if labeled data is insufficient or even unavailable. However, the acquisition of accurately labeled data (usually obtained by survey) is very difficult, costly, and time-consuming in practice due to various reasons such as privacy concerns. To this end, a semi-supervised learning approach is proposed in this paper to address the above issues. Firstly, 78 preliminary features reflecting the household profiles information are extracted from both time and frequency domain. Secondly, feature selection methods are introduced to select more relevant ones as the input of the identification model from the preliminary features. Thirdly, a transductive support vector machine method is adopted to learn the mapping relation between the input features and the output household profile identification results. Case study on an Irish dataset indicates that the proposed approach outperforms supervised learning methods when only limited labeled data is available. Furthermore, the impacts of different feature selection methods (i.e., Filter, Wrapper and Embedding methods) are also investigated, among which the wrapper method performs best, and the identification accuracy improves with the increase of data resolution.}

The Metro Manila Light Rail Transit Line 1 (LRT-1) presents an appropriate context to examine how the glocalization of smart cards can help improve the quality of public transport services, and to provide planning and policy recommendations on smart card uptake and integrated ticketing, with the end goal of improving public transport provision and management. LRT-1 alongside its change in management, also introduced a new smart card payment system. However, more than half continue to use single journey tickets. The model parameters are estimated using primary survey data collected from LRT-1 passengers. Transit smart card has been widely used around the world and effectively reduces waiting time for passengers who used to purchase paper tickets. The main results of the model reveal that: (1) only groups with high education background, stable income, or with stable job would likely to use smart card; (2) passengers with lower education level, lower income, or with unstable job prefer to use single journey ticket; and (3) the sachet economy is strongly associated with the purchasing practices amongst Filipinos, particularly the urban poor, hence may affect the promotion and uptake of public transit smart cards. These findings may inform changes to the introduction of alternative payment schemes and the planning of public transport policies that recognise the need for an effective glocalization strategy, paving the way towards improved public transport service and provision.}

Hence, This paper proposes a stochastic-based decision-making framework for the efficient short-term management of smart energy hub (EH) in restructured power systems with high penetration of renewable energy. The electrical and natural gas carriers are the input of smart EH, while the electricity and heat demands are considered as the outputs. The EH, including battery storage system (BSS) and EV fleet, is managed in the regulation market and day-ahead (DA) horizons. The energy hub operator makes optimal decisions regarding the natural gas network and energy supply for the thermal and electricity customers. An optimal self-scheduling model is developed to take into account the day ahead (DA) and regulation markets (RM) and decisions regarding generations of electrical and thermal devices as well as EV aggregator decisions. The primary goal of the proposed framework is minimizing the cost of procuring electricity and heat energy carriers in DA and regulation markets, including upward/downward regulations via a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach. In order to get the uncertainty around the exact outcomes of RM prices, wind generation, and EV patterns, the model also takes into account the conditional value at risk (CVaR) term. The proposed formulation is examined by applying to a smart EH. Results show the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed framework in managing the smart EHs efficiently.}

Modern solutions, like smart traffic control systems, parking restrictions, the introduction of speed limitations and dynamic yellow lanes, increasing control of existing yellow lanes, and the establishment of multimodal solutions, are introduced to eliminate traffic problems in these areas. When it comes to the abovementioned development issues, the historic Lower Town area in Croatia’s capital Zagreb, with residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure dating from the beginning of the 20th century, is no exception. Following a very strong earthquake that hit in March 2020, severely damaging the structures in Zagreb’s historical center, a program for the complete reconstruction of this area is being developed, which will contain the Urban mobility development program. This paper presents the process and the results of Zagreb City’s Lower Town urban transport reprogramming performed by the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Civil Engineering. The main premise of the Zagreb historic center reconstruction program is that the quality of life in the area will be improved through the regeneration of neglected and unorganized city blocks, as well as the planning and construction of new public spaces. The aspiration is the transformation of Lower Town into the "15-minute city". The prerequisite for this is (1) improved mobility and (2) reshaped transportation system, with the emphasis on cost-effective technical solutions and the integration of zero-emission modes of transport, and green mobility. At the same time, it will be necessary to preserve buildings and infrastructure that are part of the identity of the City and to prevent the transformation of the reconstruction process into a process of gentrification.}

Meanwhile, industries are ever increasingly adopting service business models (i.e. servitization), so as to offer not only physical products but also services as a solution bundle to meet individual customer needs. Such convergence of both digitalization and servitization (i.e. digital servitization) has triggered an emerging IT-driven business paradigm, smart product-service systems (Smart PSS). As a novel paradigm coined in 2014, to the authors’ knowledge, only 2 conference papers have provided some literature review to date, and many issues remain uncovered or not comprehensively investigated. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper has conducted a systematic review of Smart PSS or related papers published ever since its first brought up to date (30/06/2019), and selected 97 representative items together with other 37 supplementary works to summarize the tendency towards Smart PSS, its business and technical aspects, current challenges, and future perspectives. From the survey, it is found that several hybrid concerns are the key challenges faced, and self-adaptiveness with sustainability, advanced IT infrastructure, human-centric perspectives, and circular lifecycle management are the core future perspectives to explore. It is hoped that this work can attract more open discussions and provide useful insights to both academics and industries in their exploration and implementation of Smart PSS.}

abstract = {Background and aims
Traffic-related exposures, such as air pollution and noise, have a detrimental impact on human health, especially in urban areas. However, there remains a critical research and knowledge gap in understanding the impact of community severance, a measure of the physical separation imposed by road infrastructure and motorized road traffic, limiting access to goods, services, or social connections, breaking down the social fabric and potentially also adversely impacting health. We aimed to robustly quantify a community severance metric in urban settings exemplified by its characterization in New York City (NYC).
Methods
We used geospatial location data and dimensionality reduction techniques to capture NYC community severance variation. We employed principal component pursuit, a pattern recognition algorithm, combined with factor analysis as a novel method to estimate the Community Severance Index. We used public data for the year 2019 at census block group (CBG) level on road infrastructure, road traffic activity, and pedestrian infrastructure. As a demonstrative application of the Community Severance Index, we investigated the association between community severance and traffic collisions, as a proxy for road safety, in 2019 in NYC at CBG level.
Results
Our data revealed one multidimensional factor related to community severance explaining 74% of the data variation. In adjusted analyses, traffic collisions in general, and specifically those involving pedestrians or cyclists, were nonlinearly associated with an increasing level of Community Severance Index in NYC.
Conclusion
We developed a high spatial-resolution Community Severance Index for NYC using data available nationwide, making it feasible for replication in other cities across the United States. Our findings suggest that increases in the Community Severance Index across CBG may be linked to increases in traffic collisions in NYC. The Community Severance Index, which provides a novel traffic-related exposure, may be used to inform equitable urban policies that mitigate health risks and enhance well-being.}

abstract = {Electricity theft menace has attracted various research efforts with most proposed detection algorithms relying on analysing customers' consumption profile to determine fraudulent electricity consumers (FEC). This necessitates the need for on-site inspections before penalties are sanctioned despite the manpower, cost, energy, time, and stress associated with such tedious routine. Moreover, the penalty-imposed fines are bogusly determined and uncoordinated, and losses in revenue are burdened on the honest consumers. Fortunately, the advent of advanced metering infrastructure offers a flexible and efficient platform which can be leveraged to provide additional functionality of curbing these complicated procedures. In this work, a cost estimation-based model deploying a forced corrective measure for a real-time enforcement of penalties on FEC in a smart utility network is proposed. It relies on the results of commonly applied intelligent algorithms for electricity theft detection to obtain the amount and cost of energy consumed by reported FEC while also providing efficient monitoring till imposed fines are cleared. The results of the developed model give proportionate sanctions and enhances the functions of the system manager's monitoring of the operational status to ensure compliance and is suitable for deployment in a smart utility network.}

This defy is assessed from Mexico City, from which a series of observations and a methodology analyze and compare scenarios of water conditions in the 16 municipalities, integrating citizen participation to implement sustainable actions that improve water supply. Citizens' reports from 2002 to 2022 in a free digital platform were used to correlate the variables of leaks and water shortages. This was complemented with information from water endowment (Liters/day/inhabitant) from groundwater sources that supply the city. For the latter, projections (with the additive model) to 2022 were generated since records were available up to 2018. To identify priority areas to invest in measures that favor water supply in the municipalities, we further considered the adaptation measures applied by the city government, e.g., the purchase of portable water tanks and Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RWHS). Both measurements proved essential but need to be of more extensive application. Government and society must improve their use by promoting conscious consumption of water, impulse repairing leaks, further implementing Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RWHS), and integrating the resources (inputs/outputs) in a water circularity model, maximizing their utility and recirculation.}

abstract = {Smart thermostats and home energy management systems (HEMSs) are generally studied separately. However, their joint use can provide a greater benefit. Therefore, this study primarily aims to combine a smart thermostat with a HEMS. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based HEMS performs day-ahead load scheduling for cost-minimization and provides optimal demand response (DR) and photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption, and the fuzzy logic-based thermostat aims efficient DR of air-conditioning and maintenance of thermal comfort. In the first stage, unlike conventional fixed set-point thermostats, the proposed thermostat defines different set-points for each time interval, by fuzzifying input parameters of electricity prices, solar radiation, and occupant presence, to be used by HEMS. In the second stage, the HEMS schedules the operation of time-shiftable, thermostatically controlled, and power-shiftable (battery energy storage system (BESS), electric vehicle (EV)) loads. The HEMS considers bi-directional power flow between home, BESS, EV, and grid, as well as battery degradation to avoid unnecessary energy arbitrage. The simulation results show that a daily cost reduction of 53.2 % is achieved under time-of-use (TOU) and feed-in tariff rates of Turkey. AC cost is reduced by 24 % compared to conventional thermostats. In a future scenario of real-time pricing (RTP) and dynamic feed-in tariff, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) becomes possible.}

The three core concepts, which are smartness, sustainability, and circularity, need to be intertwined and adapted by companies to overcome these barriers. Based on this intertwined structure, this paper presents the concept of Smart and Sustainable Circular Economy (SSCE) at the macro-level and addresses the barriers of SSCE under four main aspects: technology, producers, consumers, and policy. Moreover, these four aspects are investigated for small and medium-sized enterprises of an Eco-Cluster in the automotive industry. The fuzzy DEMATEL method is used to uncover, analyse, and discuss the influencing and affected SSCE barriers critically. Finding these SSCE barriers gives an insight into the underlying problems of CE practices, as the only way to ensure an opportunity to achieve SSCE goals is to overcome them. The principal results show that problems of ownership issues in an Eco-Cluster, lack of governmental support and administrative burden, and lack of effective execution of environmental regulations are found as causal barriers that are difficult to change. Furthermore, lack of integration and collaboration among supply chain partners, ineffective CE framework adoption, and product complexity for CE principles are classified as effect barriers that are easily affected by the other factors and the implications can be shown in the short-term. Besides, the cooperation between supply chain partners can be encouraged to provide a solution to the lack of integration and collaboration between supply chain partners and the adoption of an ineffective CE framework.}

To cope with these issues, access to water-related data and information related to the water grid is fundamental in order to build sophisticated strategies for water management. Integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into the current water infrastructure is one viable solution to access to water-related data. This new infrastructure that integrates ICT into the water distribution system is called Smart Water Grid (SWG). The information layer of the SWG requires well-suited communication networks. This paper reviews wireless communication technologies that can be exploited for the implementation of SWG applications. The paper mainly focuses on the exploration of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) that promise to overcome problems confronted by communication technologies used currently in SWG applications. Some of the wireless technologies used in SWG applications suffer from high power consumption issues while others are limited in terms of communication range. For future SWG applications, in this work we recommend LPWAN technologies due to their low power consumption, long communication range and excellent radio penetration. A range of challenges and research directions regarding the recommended LPWANs is also discussed.}

The nexus among water and energy sources and sinks are considered to develop hydropower composite curves, grand composite curves, and continuous composite curves. These graphical tools are accompanied by hydropower cascade tables to facilitate numerical analysis of conservation and recovery of water resources at high resolution. The minimum hydro storage is targeted, and three management cases are determined by obtaining the surplus (or deficit) head of a hydro reservoir in successive operational years in unreliable, reliable, and self-sufficient cases. The effects of climate change are predicted using smart algorithms to manage varying downstream energy and water sinks under optimal conditions by HyPoPA. Two prediction scenarios are developed to mimic annual operation and online monitoring cases using advanced neural networks. Karkheh hydro reservoir serves as a case study to verify smart HyPoPA. The results showed that the sources were successfully predicted employing a hybrid long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit network in 2018 (R2 = 97.3%, MAPE = 15.9%), which was a dry year when reservoir water levels fell in a non-reliable case with deficit head. The Karkheh reservoir produced 37.2 GWh more hydroelectricity and saved 1.66 billion m3 of water after meeting all water requirements using the smart HyPoPA in the target year.}

However services which can be enabled via smart technology are much broader than simply energy consumption and management, spanning from assisted living to security to remote monitoring, control and management of appliances and devices. Using a combination of in-depth deliberative public workshops, expert interviews and a review of the existing literature, this paper gives an overview of services that smart homes can offer and reveals key barriers to smart home adoption such as interoperability, deregulated electricity supply industry, UK housing stock characteristics, tenure as well as reliability, security, and cost of smart technologies. The findings indicate a need for a holistic view for the design and delivery of smart home services so that consumers are offered integrated services across energy consumption and management to air quality management to security, allowing for individual or tailored services for householders.}

Unfortunately, the IoT devices have limited resources to handle the performance of big data feature learning with machine learning techniques. IoT devices often compromise the privacy of users and make them vulnerable to numerous cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication protocol based on blockchain technology and the secret computational model of physically unclonable function (denoted by PUF model). The proposed protocol guarantees the users privacy with a decentralized smart contract blockchain with the PUF model. In practice, the proposed protocol guarantees that IoT devices and the miner are authenticated in a faster authentication process compared to current blockchain techniques. In addition, Blockchain and PUF combine to ensure data provenance and data transparency in IoT networks. Blockchain-based smart contracts provide decentralized digital ledgers that are able to withstand data tampering attacks. This ensures the security and privacy of outsourced big data in IoT environments. We also investigated the privacy implications of using IoT devices with various security analysis, and avenues for research to extenuate the privacy concerns in IoT environments.}

abstract = {The development of new smart objects for the sensing and actuation of a given place or environment led both the academia and industry to research and propose new protocols and intelligent systems to support such objects. One of the systems that has been gaining prominence is the smart residential environments. In this context, homes are equipped with smart objects to manage the living resources. However, managing such objects in residential environments requires data contextualization, i.e. collecting data from heterogeneous devices and actuate on the environment through context information generated from such data. To solve this problem, we propose an intelligent decision system based on the fog computing paradigm, which provides an efficient management of residential applications. The proposed solution is evaluated both in simulated and real environments. When compared with other studies from the literature in a simulated environment, the proposed solution shows a higher success rate with a lower delay in the decision-making process, higher efficiency in information dissemination with a lower overhead in the communication infrastructure, and increased robustness in processing with a lower power consumption. These results are also observed when considering a real environment evaluation.}

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) application in e-health can play a vital role in countering rapidly spreading diseases that can effectively manage health emergency scenarios like pandemics. Efficient disease control also requires monitoring of Standard operating procedure (SOP) follow-up of the population in the disease-prone area with a cost-effective reporting and responding mechanism to register any violation. However, the IoT devices have limited resources and the application requires delay-sensitive data transmission. Named Data Networking (NDN) can significantly reduce content retrieval delays but inherits cache overflow and network congestion challenges. Therefore, we are motivated to present a novel smart COVID-19 pandemic-controlled eradication over NDN-IoT (SPICE-IT) mechanism. SPICE-IT introduces autonomous monitoring in indoor environments with efficient pull-based reporting mechanism that records violations at local servers and cloud server. Intelligent face mask detection and temperature monitoring mechanism examines every person. Cloud server controls the response action from the centre with an adaptive decision-making mechanism. Long short-term memory (LSTM) based caching mechanism reduces the cache overflow and overall network congestion problem.}

abstract = {To deal with the increasing complexity of customer demands, supply chain (SC) and logistics organisation and management have been constantly moving towards collaboration, intelligence, and service-orientation. The importance of service-oriented design for SC and logistics systems has been stressed, especially with regards to interoperability and sustainability. In this context, the recent intelligent interoperable logistics paradigm has been increasingly studied and the Smart Product-Service System (PSS) concept seems interesting for the paradigm. Smart PSS are characterised by their ability to collect and process information autonomously and subsequently make decisions and self-act/evolve. Interested in the potential for tackling complex logistics systems, this paper investigates how smart PSS could be considered and designed for service-oriented, intelligent interoperable logistics. A recent breakthrough logistics paradigm called the Physical Internet (PI) is taken as a practical example in this research. We present and discuss key design issues and innovative business models associated with smart PSS in PI. The results clearly indicate the promising potential of smart PSS in PI and the need for further research. Consequently, new research avenues leading to a new era of intelligent interoperable logistics are outlined. This paper intends to contribute to two main areas of research: the design and implementation of smart PSS in PI, and functional and conceptual research on PI and intelligent interoperable logistics.}

abstract = {With the evolution of the digital economy, the gradual digital transformation of enterprises has garnered considerable attention in the market, profoundly influencing sustainable business operations. Local governments are actively fostering this transformation through urban innovation policies. This study analyzes Chinese A-share listed companies from 2003 to 2021 as the research sample. The implementation of the national innovative city pilot policy is regarded as an exogenous shock. A difference-in-differences model was constructed to empirically explore the impact of the national innovative city pilot policy for innovative cities on the digital transformation of local enterprises. The findings indicate a significant enhancement in the level of enterprise digital transformation due to the innovative city pilot policy, supported by robustness tests. Mechanism analysis identifies four pathways through which the policy drives digital transformation: advancing technological progress, improving internal controls, mitigating financing constraints, and reinforcing government support. Subsequent investigations reveal noteworthy heterogeneity in the policy's impact on enterprise digital transformation based on attributes, scale, growth cycles, and regions. The study's conclusions offer valuable insights for maximizing the effectiveness of innovative city pilot policies and fostering enterprise digital transformation.}
