abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative integrated policy secure framework employing blockchain technology to effectively handle optimal structure switching within microgrids. The primary objectives are to enhance electric work for cost reduction and power quality enhancement. The structure utilizes remote switches to adjust the microgrid's power supply route to consumers, minimizing resistive power losses. Additionally, it integrates the mobile storage capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance microgrid operations. The aging costs of battery for EVs are modeled using Wöhler curve. An effective modification technique using Dolphin Echolocation is established to enhance algorithm assortment and prevent premature convergence. The study employs a standard test system to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Simulation results demonstrate that the secure architecture facilitates improved microgrid scheduling through encrypted data packets, optimizing EV charge and discharge. The Energy System Digital Twin (ESDT) plays a crucial role in investigating this stochastic secure energy management architecture for microgrids, incorporating EVs and blockchain. The ESDT dynamically replicates microgrid complexities, integrating stochastic models for renewable energy, EV charging behaviors, and blockchain transactions. This digital twin enables simulations for optimizing EV integration, evaluating blockchain resilience, and strengthening cybersecurity measures. This comprehensive approach within the digital twin framework provides a platform for refinement and innovation, ensuring the development of sustainable, efficient, and secure microgrid ecosystems adaptable to the evolving landscape of renewable energy, EV adoption, and blockchain technology, as well as considering policy in decision making.}

abstract = {This research studied the effect of different combinations of government capabilities (innovation capability mix) on public value in smart city-framed innovation projects. The study drew on the public value theory, the collaborative public innovation approach and the dynamic capabilities theory to devise a conceptual framework that links government capabilities and public value. Insights from smart cities and literature on public innovation were also used to identify a range of intra-organizational and external collaboration capabilities of governments that should lead to valuable public sector innovation. These capabilities were combined inductively through factor analysis, which was applied to a sample of 143 innovation projects in Spanish municipalities, leading to four forms of innovation capability mix. A factor analysis regression was then estimated. Overall, the study found that ‘citizen-oriented management’ (i.e., outstanding innovation-oriented internal management coupled with strong collaboration with citizens) and ‘provider focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with providers) seem to have a positive influence on three dimensions of public value (i.e., efficiency, effectiveness and societal challenges). By contrast, ‘citizen and expert focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with experts and citizens) and ‘peer focus’ (i.e., outstanding collaboration with other governments) do not contribute to any of the three dimensions of public value. While project type was studied, it was found that its isolated effect was limited, although analyzing it provided some interesting findings.}

This paper identifies nine anticipated benefits/value proposition components of smart city activities, based on a literature review. It then uses a comparative multiple case study analysis to investigate how value proposition components are present in the SC activities of six cities with demonstrated excellence: Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, Helsinki, New York, Vienna; and three with emerging excellence: Berlin, Budapest, Moscow. The study reveals the distribution of the components in each city for different years, then these annual activity portfolios are clustered. Four different types of smart cities emerge from the analysis: (1) The Green City – in which years of activities, cities are focusing on environmentally related objectives; (2) The App City – in which years of activities, cities are focusing on developing and rolling out platforms and ICT applications to provide Quality of Life improvements directly for citizens; (3) The Socially Sensitive City - in which years of activities socially sensitive activities are prominent; (4) The Participatory City – in which years of activities citizen engagement is in focus. The findings provide a more comprehensive explanation to the mono-dimensional and holistic strategic approach of smart cities.}

A central administrator appointed by the government manages and maintains the security of each node. Smart City relies upon millions of sensors that are heterogeneous and do not support standard security architecture. Different manufacturers have weak protection protocols for their products and do not update their firmware upon newly identified operating systems’ vulnerabilities. Adversaries using brute force methods exploit the lack of inbuilt security systems on IoT devices to grow their bot network. Smart cities require a standard framework combining soft computing and Deep Learning (DL) for device fleet management and complete control of sensor operating systems for absolute security. This paper presents a real-world application for IoT fleet management security using a lightweight container-based botnet detection (C-BotDet) framework. Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server. The framework quickly updates the standard Linux-based operating system IoT device fleet without relying on different manufacturers to update their system security individually. The simulation and analysis of the C-BotDet framework are presented in a practical working environment to demonstrate its implementation feasibility.}

abstract = {Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for monitoring and remote control. Sensor networks are being integrated into all areas of the infrastructures of smart cities. The sensor network data stream contains information that can be utilized to model and control the activity of these infrastructures. However, SCADA systems are constantly exposed to a variety of diverse intrusions, making detection with traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) extremely difficult. Due to their unique specifications, conventional security solutions, like antivirus and firewall software, are unsuitable for properly securing SCADA systems. In addition, anomaly detection in industrial sensor networks (ISNs) should occur in real time. Therefore, effectively identifying cyberattacks in major SCADA systems is unquestionably essential for enhancing their resilience, ensuring safe operations, and avoiding expensive maintenance. We developed a novel hybrid ensemble model approach to address these issues. This paper's primary objective is to detect hostile intrusions that have already circumvented firewalls and typical IDS. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Ensemble Learning Model (ELM) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems with ISNs utilizing a tangible data gathered from a gas pipeline system given by Mississippi State University (MSU), the water system, and the high-dimensional University of New South Wales-NB 2015 (UNSW-NB15) data that reflects a typical attack in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The unity normalization method was adopted for data preprocessing, and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized for feature extraction of the high-dimensional datasets. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) was used for optimizing the bagging, stacking, Adaboost, and an ensemble of classifiers Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with a majority voting technique. Then, we utilized the proposed approach founded on the bijective soft-set approach for efficient ELM selection. The experiment was conducted in two phases: Initially, without PCA + GWO for feature extraction and selection on the ELM, and subsequently, with PCA + GWO for feature extraction and selection on the ELM. PCA + GWO on the ensemble of classifiers NB + SVM provided an accuracy of 99%, precision of 100%, recall of 100%, and detection rate of 99.90%, outpacing the ensemble of classifiers without PCA feature extraction and GWO optimization approaches.}

Water pipeline infrastructure is particularly important as it not only distributes water across the city but also carries waste water away. However, water pipelines are particularly vulnerable because they can cause severe leakage due to aging or man-made activities such as damage due to nearby road works. The consequences of water leakage range from soil erosion of roads to wastage of clean water or contamination of sewage. To address the challenge of maintaining the health of the water pipeline infrastructure, this article covers relevant technologies such as wireless sensing and the use of AI for preventive maintenance management of water pipelines to minimize water leakage and the risk of contamination across the water pipeline infrastructure.}

The paper maps, evaluates and analyses the strategic actions of the Greek Municipalities from an internal and external perspective of a public authority. Results show most local authorities try to formulate a coherent framework to efficiently utilize available resources and enhance productivity and quality of the services provided. Even though the majority of cities have embedded in their digital strategies various forms of smart projects, a rather partial implementation of relevant initiatives in their day-to-day operations is noticed. The challenges and prerequisites for an effective implementation of smart strategies have been explored. Furthermore, we assess their design, which may mitigate risks and lead to higher returns, at the earliest possible stage. This allows us to map the crucial factors that may open their “appetite” for a successful strategy towards a smarter future.}

To fully exploit the advantages of photovoltaic power generation and electric vehicles and to release the potential of electric vehicles as distributed energy storage facilities, this paper develops a multi-objective robust optimization framework that accounts for the benefits of multiple parties of smart charging and discharging systems and depicts a bounded uncertainty set based on partial statistical information from real data. The original model is scalarized and linearized using efficient methods such as max-ordering scalarization and the robust augmented weighted Tchebycheff to facilitate the solution. Moreover, a smart charging and discharging scheduling strategy based on a convergent demand response strategy is proposed to achieve better demand-side management. A case study, based on real data from Car2go and the solar radiation intensity in Portland, Oregon, shows that (1) The methodological framework effectively addresses the smart scheduling issue that considers the interests of multiple parties in complex systems with uncertainty, in contrast to conventional methods. (2) The designed convergent demand response strategy promotes photovoltaic power generation and charging demand synergy and achieves regulation effects such as peak shaving and valley filling. (3) The proposed method and strategy yield good results in multiple aspects, such as charging costs, load regulation, and clean energy utilization, while enhancing the economic and environmental benefits.}

abstract = {The real time Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading have ameliorated the smart city environment. Electric Vehicles (EVs) in smart cities have made it possible to balance the energy demand and supply without burdening the power grids. They also help in minimizing both the heap amounts of pollution and the greenhouse gas emissions. EVs not only charge their batteries from Charging Stations (CSs), but when the smart city faces energy deficiency, they supply their surplus energy to the power grids to fulfill energy demand as well. In addition, EVs also balance the energy demand and supply through energy trading at the local level during peak hours, which strengthens V2V energy trading. However, some issues, such as security threats and privacy leakage prevent EVs from participating in the energy trading process. In addition, the lack of incentives and knowledge about the cost of reaching the energy trading place within minimum time are also big challenges. Therefore, to solve the aforementioned challenges, a secure and efficient scheme for V2V and V2G energy trading is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme also helps in promoting environmental friendliness and making the smart cities sustainable and reliable. In the proposed scheme, energy trading transactions are secured using consortium blockchain, wherein the Local Aggregators (LAGs) are selected as authorized nodes. LAGs perform their role as energy brokers and are responsible for validating the energy trading requests using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a solution to find accurate distance with required expenses and time to reach the charging destination is also proposed, which effectively guides EVs to reach the relevant CSs and encourages energy trading. Besides, we propose a fair payment mechanism using a smart contract to avoid financial irregularities. An incentive provisioning mechanism is also given in the proposed work to prevent EVs from acting selfishly. The efficient power flow having minimized losses in the vehicular network is of much importance. Therefore, the energy losses incurred in both V2G and V2V are discussed in this work. Furthermore, Oyente is used for smart contract’s security analysis and for testing Ethereum’s resilience against different security flaws. Two attacker models are proposed and the security analyses of the models are also provided. The analyses show that the proposed system is robust against the double spending and Sybil attacks. Finally, the efficient performance of our proposed scheme is validated and analyzed. The simulation results proved that our proposed work outperforms existing work in terms of providing a secure and efficient energy trading platform for both V2G and V2V environments.}

The public value of having a higher municipal credit rating reduces borrowing costs and consequently lowers the cost to manage government programs. In this article, the relationship between credit ratings and local governments' decisions to utilize one of the first sets of information and communications technology (ICT) innovations is investigated—the 311 system (non-emergency versions of 911 that use phone, web, and mobile application interfaces)—the analysis pairs longitudinal financial data with information on the implementation of 311 systems. The results of our analysis demonstrate that access to 311 systems, particularly web/mobile-based 311, can positively influence a city's credit rating. Additionally, we find that the length of time since 311 was adopted is positively related to credit ratings. The effect is visible with phone-based and web/mobile-based 311. These results suggest that cities with 311 systems and those with 311 in place longer have higher credit ratings. These results could indicate that cities with 311 are better managed or simply more transparent to investors, thus posing lower risks.}

Specifically, we investigated Taiwanese citizens’ preferences for 35 SC services of seven dimensions classified in two domains, as well as their three perceptions of the usefulness of these SC services in the realization of human needs. The results show that most of our respondents clearly perceived SC services as both important and useful to their existence, relatedness, and growth needs, and that they expressed relatively higher preferences for such services to operate in the “hard” domain – e.g., smart energy, smart transport, or smart safety –than the “soft” one, e.g., smart living. Based on these findings, this study provides policy recommendations that, if implemented, could be expected to advance SC development by increasing citizens’ usage of SC services in both the hard and soft domains, and serve the wider aim of improving their well-being and quality of life.}

To address this question, a qualitative multiple case study was carried out across three city authorities in Ireland characterised by diversity in their ITG structural arrangements to govern portfolios of smart city initiatives. From this analysis three types of ITG structural implementation are proposed named: Detached, Integrated, and Traditional. These are compared and discussed in relation to: (1) orientation of each approach; (2) decision-making authority; (3) alignment with the IT function and the overall municipal organization; and (4) the challenge perceived by the SCFs under each ITG arrangement. This research contributes to the academic conversation on adaptive governance, smart cities as well as to the broader ongoing debate on ITG in the public sector.}

abstract = {This work proposes and develops a holistic framework for intelligent roadway lighting in largely ignored small cities using an unlit 1.1-mile section of Harney Street in Laramie, Wyoming, United States as a case study. The novel framework includes a technical analysis, an economic evaluation, and a public survey. Following the technical analysis, 21 streetlight units in a staggered pole arrangement are recommended to optimize illuminance levels for the minor arterial road as commonly found in cities like Laramie. Two energy source options are considered – a grid-only option and a hybrid option that utilizes solar power for lighting and grid electricity for electric vehicle (EV) charging. The economic and social aspects of this study reveal the need for public-private partnerships to fund smart street lighting projects in small cities. From a benefit-cost analysis standpoint, the grid-only option is currently more economically feasible; however, most residents prefer the hybrid system. Additional capabilities like EV charging, air quality monitoring, and weather sensing provide unique economic and social benefits for both residents and city authorities. This work provides a veritable framework that both private and public stakeholders can adopt for future implementation of smart street lighting projects in contemporary low-population towns and cities.}

Taking a South Korean smart city of Songdo as a point of departure, this paper offers a genealogical understanding of a smart city that situates the current technics and technologies of data-driven urban governance within the broader context of South Korean history. Given the scarcity of a historically informed understanding of a smart city in the existing literatures on smart urbanism, this paper argues that a genealogical method helps us to counter the sweeping binarism that obscures the complexity and diversity of actually existing smart cities today. Through genealogy, this study underscores the multifaceted nature of the smart city, which consists of a combination of multiple urban diagrams that grows out of distinct problems and objectives of urban management – mobility, security, environment, and futurity. This paper illustrates how a smart city emerged out of multiple strings of history and problematizations that are contingently interweaved at a given time and space in multiple and diffused forms.}

abstract = {Population growth and industrialization lead to a proportionate increase in cities' daily waste generation rates. Communities in developing cities often turn to waste disposal methods that have proven destructive to human health and the environment. Further, the disposal of waste is not treated and utilized for waste-to-energy (WtE)-based energy generation. To overcome this situation, many researchers proposed various solutions. However, the optimal utilization of this waste for power generation still needs to be solved. The proposed work discusses a self-powered garbage management system using a Convolution Neural Network and IOT for households in smart cities. The proposed system collects household wastes and segregates them into organic and inorganic wastes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The inorganic waste is sent to the recycling bin, and the organic waste is used for power generation. The residue of the organic waste after power generation is utilized as fertilizer for plants. The proposed system comprises five modules: a garbage collector, a segregation unit, a power generator unit, an inorganic waste collection bin with IoT-enabled sensors, and an electronic control unit. The garbage collector unit collects household waste. The CNN-based waste classifier in the segregator unit separates the waste into organic and inorganic, and the organic waste is sent to the power generation unit. The waste is grinded using a combustion unit in the power generator, producing biogas for electric power generation. The system is fully automatic, and a Raspberry Pi controller controls the complete process with the help of sensors and various motors. The system monitors the inorganic waste collection bin level using sensors. It sends a notification to the municipality's Garbage Collection Van operator using the IoT module once the bin is full and can be sent for recycling. The accuracy of the proposed CNN for waste segregation is 98%. While comparing with other pre-trained CNN models, such as InceptionV3 and Inception ResNet, the proposed method produces satisfactory results with 14% and 12% accuracy gains, respectively. The segregated and decomposed 50 kg of organic waste can produce 6 m3 of biogas which in turn can produce 114 MJ of electric energy, which can be utilized for street lights and also for the proposed smart self-power generating garbage management system to function. The proposed system is highly adaptable in smart cities for household municipal waste management with minimum routine monitoring and operational time requirements. Further, the system generates only a fraction of the required energy.}

abstract = {To address various urban issues such as fine dust, traffic congestion, and water shortage caused by rapid urbanization, a national pilot Smart City is planned in two Korean cities, Sejong and Busan. As weather data is crucial for improving the environment and operating future transportation while constructing a smart city, preparing for future weather disasters by analyzing the characteristics of various meteorological phenomena in the planned development area is necessary. This study analyzed the fog generation characteristics for the period of 2016–2020 at the automatic weather system sites of the Korea Meteorological Administration in Sejong and Busan, and the characteristics of the meteorological elements during fog were investigated. Additionally, three machine learning based models, including Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Network DNN-1 and DNN-2, were constructed for estimating visibility using meteorological input variables. In Sejong, approximately 50 fog days were observed annually for the analysis period, with the highest frequency of these days being during autumn. The fog hours were distributed from nighttime to before sunrise and 94.3% of the fog occurred when the wind speed was less than 1.5 m/s, showing the characteristics of radiative fog. Most of the fog occurred during summer in Busan, and the maximum number of fog days was observed in July. The average wind speed during fog was approximately 2.5 m/s, which was relatively large, suggesting that advection fog was likely to occur. As a result of estimating visibility from the ML-based models, the RF model had the highest R2 (0.66 and 0.53) in both regions, but the visibility estimated from the RF model had an over- and under-estimation for short and long visibility ranges, respectively. DNN-1 and DNN-2 models have lower biases. In the detection of fog-possible weather based on the estimated visibility from the models, the best precisions (0.85 and 0.84) and F1-scores (0.76 and 0.74) were from the RF model, but model recall was better in the DNN-1 model. The model recalls for the detection of the thick and dense fog were also better in the DNN models. ML-based models presented reasonable performance but revealed their weaknesses and strengths depending on performance indicators.}

An earthquake has some effect on the environment due to the sudden movement of tectonic plates known as Earthquake Environmental Effects (EEE). These changes can be divided into 2 categories namely primary (e.g. subsidence, surface faulting) and secondary effects (displaced rocks, tsunami, landslides). In this paper, the major contribution revolves around earthquakes and their analysis. Earthquakes occur due to the shifting of tectonic plates on the lithosphere. These movements occur due to the Frictional stress between gliding plate borders builds up and leads to fault line failure. This sudden shaking of the plates releases a certain kind of energy in the Lithosphere which creates seismic waves. Earthquakes are also categorized into different classes ranging from minor to great, depending on their magnitude.}

abstract = {As the globally increasing population drives rapid urbanization in various parts of the world, there is a great need to deliberate on the future of the cities worth living. In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions. We believe such rigorous analysis will provide a baseline for future research in the domain.}

We first measured the urban GTFP using the Luenberger productivity indicator derived from the directional distance function, and further investigated the impact of SCP on urban GTFP using the difference-in-differences (DID) model, and its heterogeneities, impact mechanism, and spatial spillover effect were examined using balanced panel data for 283 prefecture-level cities from 2004 to 2017. The study produced five key results. (1) SCP can significantly promote urban GTFP in China, and a series of robustness checks verified the validity of this finding. (2) There was a positive spatial spillover effect of SCP on GTFP in neighboring non-pilot cities, while the spillover effect on the neighboring pilot cities was poor. (3) There was heterogeneity among Chinese cities, with the promotional effect of SCP on GTFP being more significant in eastern cities, super cities, non-resource-based cities, and cities with high levels of human capital, financial development, and information and communication infrastructure construction. (4) The regression results of a mediating effect model showed that SCP can promote GTFP through technological innovation, upgrading the industrial structure, and resource allocation optimization. (5) Smart city policy improved urban GTFP mainly by improving technical efficiency rather than technological progress. These conclusions are of great theoretical and practical significance for the Chinese government, and can be used to transform the extensive urban development mode and achieve high-quality development.}

Designing the smart maintenance system is done by considering the findings from an extensive literature review and the feedback from structured interviews with bus service representatives. The system validation is performed as a case study with an industry partner. For conducting the case study, a concept demonstrator is designed according to the defined system and addresses the main problem causing downtime of the buses at the industry partner.

Whilst much theorizing and conceptualization have made concrete advancements in establishing the research agenda for this topic, case-based research on citizens’ perceptions of smart city initiatives is still scarce. Through examination of surveys and content analysis of plans and documents exploring smart city development in Saint Petersburg, this paper looks at differences between perceptions of authorities and citizens in local government initiatives towards smart city development in the referred city. Results suggest that there seems to be a gap in the way citizens and sponsors – authorities, in particular – understand smart city endeavors. In St. Petersburg, Russia, the gap compromises levels of participation and engagement in smart city initiatives despite high levels of engagement with traditional e-government technologies. Such circumstances may reflect an expectation-results divide that has been described in collaborative e-government literature, but is yet to receive empirical scrutiny in the context of smart city development. The paper ends by critically examining risks of ignoring perceptions from different stakeholders and not monitoring gaps such as the one examined in this practical case.}

There are still many questions regarding the effective implementation of these systems and their long-term viability. This study aims to offer and inspire sustainable options for the effectiveness and use of CWs by thoroughly evaluating their application and the most recent developments in their sustainable design and operation for wastewater treatment. First, a brief explanation of the definition, classification, and application of current CWs has been given. The relationship between the operational needs and design criteria of CWs, such as substrate types, hydraulic retention time, water depth, plant species, hydraulic load, and feeding mechanism, and the operation's sustainability for treating wastewater has then been examined. Growing knotweed plants, which bind dye particles in the soil and take up heavy metal ions for better growth, as well as reducing the detrimental effects of dyes and heavy metals, are some of the sustainability initiatives for those wetland technologies that are outlined in this paper. If employed, this approach can clean wastewater in smart cities and metropolitan regions that are polluted by industrial waste water very well with a single expenditure. Future research on improving the sustainability and stability of CWs is also emphasised as being crucial.}

A random selection of 44 articles in these journals was conducted based on the presence of words in titles, abstracts and keywords between 2012 and 2020. Four terms were revealed, namely, competitiveness, distinctiveness, urban forms and everyday lifestyles. The findings compiled 22 principles for creating singularity among smart cities. The three-step framework for creating the singularity of smart cities provides insights into how urban actors and stakeholders in the Global South can change traditional smart cities by aggregating the principles of placemaking (i.e. urban forms and everyday lifestyles) with the principles of the urban economy through urban competitiveness and distinctiveness.

abstract = {The topic of ensuring the safe and efficient operation of smart cities is currently highly topical. In general, cities are required to effectively manage a wide range of incidents-from routine activities such as repairs and road accidents to life-threatening crises such as terrorist acts and natural disasters. If the city wants to effectively manage these incidents, it needs the ability to understand what is happening, to share information quickly, to direct responses based on standardized procedures, and then to constantly improve these procedures according to the best experience so far. The object of the research is the method, which is the introduction of a new information system in the field of building smart cities in practice. We solved the assignment through: Analysis of faults and their consequences (FMEA), using the process type of analysis. When solving the security of the new information system in the area of smart city through the FMEA method was identified barriers / failures of individual steps that threaten the process. By designing and applying appropriate measures, we managed to reduce the residual risk of the information system so that all values were below the limit of risk acceptability.}

abstract = {Smart City technology is an attempt to improve the quality of life of its citizens by providing promising smart solutions for multiple applications. These applications include healthcare monitoring, resource utilization, city resource management, and various public services. Internet of Things (IoT) enables smart city applications to collect data from various sensors and process it for providing numerous smart services to the end-users with improved performance. The diverse nature of IoT network requires the use of multiple types of sensors which produce a huge amount of data. This data is highly vulnerable to multiple service-oriented attacks; therefore, it must be protected during the communication of IoT nodes. This research work has focused on the identification and detection of malicious nodes causing service-oriented attacks in smart city applications and networks. The direct experience of communicating nodes and recommendations from neighboring nodes are collected to formulate a total trust score. The adaptive weights assigned to direct observations and indirect recommendations ensure the effectiveness of the Context-Based Trust Evaluation System Model (CTES) in detecting On–Off attacks. Moreover, context similarity measure calculations filter out those bad nodes which are posing a Sybil Attack. The proposed CTES has also been simulated on Contiki Cooja. The results also validate the effectiveness of CTES in detecting the bad behavior of malicious nodes.}

The strong interaction between hearing and sight senses is the basis for this selection. The application of this system is in environments with ambient sound variation, including urban transportation, industrial settings, healthcare facilities, and so on. This system increases people's awareness regarding sound events and deals with individuals and the surrounding environment. The proposed method benefits from two types of warm white and cool white LEDs and their input power control to adjust the luminous flux and resulting correlated color temperature of light-emitting diodes. The simulation findings confirm the performance of the introduced method. This technique is recommended as a novel strategy, especially to meet the requirements of inhabitants of smart cities.}

abstract = {With the fast-expanding number of vehicles in smart cities, the management of road intersections and traffic congestion has grown to be major problems. Drivers often express their opinion that putting traffic lights on while taking traffic flows into account will have a significant impact on how traffic moves. This paper presents a smart Road traffic Control management system termed Urban Traffic Control (UTC) keeping real-time dynamic traffic flow in mind which helps in upgrading the level of road traffic network management. To provide an organized traffic arrangement, UTC presents methodologies such as vehicle counting, controlling process, and evaluation of lanes keeping status in mind, this whole procedure is implemented by taking the complete traffic network into an account instead of just considering intersections. The primary goal of our system is to lessen traffic jams by cutting down on the trip and waiting times vehicles spend at crossings and intersections. We need to assign a plan for traffic flow that has the least amount of traffic congestion and vehicle waiting time, for this purpose some indicators and models are introduced in this study. Lane weight, traffic jam indicator, and vehicle priority are among these models. As this work is an improvement on the current Road Network without much changing, we integrate our system on normal traffic lights which allow each lane a chance to move and we also considered the no-interference lane movement. To simulate our idea, we introduced a smart road traffic control system consisting of multi-agents, by using a NetLogo stimulator. To compare the fixed cycle traffic light, several vehicles (150 in total) with random behaviour were generated and scattered over 25 different intersections for the time duration of 9 h. This setting was used to test our smart traffic control solution on both lane flow and no interference movement flow. According to the obtained results, there was a 25.98% reduction in total average waiting time over simulation period for all vehicles and a reduction of 34.16% for no interference movement flow. These observations clearly state that suggested method is better suited for today's complex traffic conditions where change in infrastructure is minimal.}

Hence, the need to plan and develop smart cities based solutions for enhanced urban governance is becoming more evident. These solutions are motivated by innovations in Information and Communication Technology to support smart planning for the city and to facilitate enhanced services to its citizens. Important areas where smart city services can be offered include urban planning, transport planning, energy conservation, water management, waste management, environmental monitoring, public safety, healthcare, education, entertainment, and many other services. Hence, the enormous data collected from different networks and applications to facilitate the offering of smart city services requires efficient data scheduling, aggregation, and processing to ensure service quality (QoS). However, existing data scheduling approaches consider scheduling and processing data only in the cloud, while processing also in the data collecting devices is significantly essential. This paper first introduces the multi-layer network architecture comprising sensor/device networks and cloud. The paper then introduces a Multi-layer, Priority-based, Dynamic, and Time-sensitive data processing and Scheduling approach (MPDTS) in the proposed multi-layer networks. Simulation results show that the proposed MPDTS approach achieves lower latency and data processing time than existing traditional data scheduling approaches that work only in the cloud layer.}

The knowledge gain and analysis of the smart city environment improves response time. This paper introduces the dependable information processing (DIP) method for handling multi-attribute environmental information in a smart city application. Information sensed from the environment is categorized in the initial stage regarding how it meets application requirements. It helps to identify the need and response of the application through different interacting spans and previous trials. For attribute categorization and span validation, learning via K-means clustering is exploited to identify similar and dissimilar information attributes. This identification speeds up the process of successive responses with improved interaction sessions. The accuracy of user responses and latency-free assessment improves the reliability of DIP in smart city applications. The efficiency of the system is then evaluated using detection accuracy (97.34%), the response time (4.3 s), and interaction time (12.3 s), which is compared with other methods.}

ULLs aim to provide a space for different parties to research, develop, and test solutions to urban problems whilst engaging with local communities. Their experimental approach to urban innovation and to public-private collaboration makes flexibility, openness, and informality important. However, ULLs are also confronted with existing legal frameworks, responsibilities, and liabilities. Whilst they aim at shared decision-making and horizontality, they must navigate public and private interests, and interact with local government as well. To understand these dynamics, this article examines the legal and organizational structures of ULLs, the factors and trade-offs that influence it, and the role municipal government plays in in these structures. This article analyzes the different forms and trajectories of ULLs in practice, through semi-structured interviews held in four labs in Amsterdam. Through qualitative research, we found that 1) ULLs are partnerships that exist on a spectrum of formalization, from informal to highly formal; 2) the degree of formalization is influenced by financial, legal, and organizational factors that change over time; 3) each degree of formalization is associated to trade-offs, even if these trade-offs are not explicitly formulated by the people involved; 4) tensions arise from the municipality's double role as public authority and as partner. We conclude that ULLs could gain from clearly identifying the legal frameworks that condition their structure, actions, and future.}

Edge computing application into such an IoT network facilitates the distributed computing framework by bringing the computational application closer to the end-users in form of Fog sub-networks, comprising the local participating end-user IoT nodes as service requesters and specialized servers catering to the requests, modelled for the infrastructure category they are delivering (Smart healthcare, ITS, Smart architecture, etc.). Opportunistic-based last-mile connectivity between the Fog servers and participating nodes aides the dynamicity of the topology for efficient information. Aiding the same, the proposed edge computing enabled, sustainable, opportunistic IoT-based intuitive data exchange, collection and operation scheme that employs a dynamic routing procedure that considers human interactions, their movement patterns and their decision-making process. The proposed scheme employs probabilistic history-based parameters that keep track of node interactions. The interactions are modelled on the Firefly PSO, allowing exploitation of the social mobility. The Fuzzy logic is used for hop decision making based on the social and attribute-based parameters which mimic intuitive and pragmatic decision making of humans in terms of social interactions and mobility.}

GIS technology can also be used to visualise abstract spaces. The article deals with the application of GIS in different types of cities. The article is intended to be the result of an analysis of the direction of the use of GIS technology in public administration in Poland. For this purpose, a model was developed to examine the state of GIS technology application. Two criteria were used to determine the state: groups of factors influencing the use of GIS technology (organisational, functional, informational and technical) and the level of maturity of GIS tools. Four levels were distinguished (from zero, i.e. no application of GIS technology, to a third level indicating the strategic importance of the tools studied). To this end, an empirical study was developed to determine the level of maturity of the application of the tools in question. After analysing the results, it can be concluded that the systems studied are still evolving. From the perspective of the proposed model, it can be assumed that the development of GIS tools has reached the second level in most of the surveyed offices. However, it will still be difficult to develop the software if not all the currently available GIS software capabilities are used.}

A more holistic systems framing can ensure that ‘smart’ solutions better address sustainability broadly and extend to issues of equity, power, agency, nature-based solutions and ecological resilience. In this context, smart city infrastructure plays an important role in enabling new ways of measuring, experiencing and engaging with local and temporal dynamics of urban systems. We provide a series of examples of subsystems interactions, or ‘couplings’, to illustrate how a SETS approach can expand and enhance smart city infrastructure and development to meet normative societal goals.}

The purpose of this research is to minimize the cost needed to measure the HVAC energy consumption in educational and commercial buildings to save energy for energy efficiency strategies to serve the future smart and sustainable cities. These facilities are among the most energy-consuming loads, and this research proposes a technique to determine real HVAC energy consumption and cooling load using a single-sensor method. Calculating the as-built HVAC energy usage and real cooling load, especially in complex HVAC systems like VRV, which are some of the most challenging gaps, is achieved through a revolutionary and cost-effective approach. The proposed approach computes the actual HVAC energy consumption of each specific zone in the building using data from a single temperature sensor. Furthermore, the real and instantaneous cooling load of each zone was calculated, and the results show a promising agreement between the proposed techniques and the real measured consumption of the HVAC system. This approach can be integrated into the BMS building management system to determine the actual HVAC energy usage and cooling load for each zone individually in real time, enabling significant energy reduction decisions with optimal cost efficiency. Furthermore, it can be used by the BMS system as a real-time On-Board Diagnostic of the HVAC system.}

Smart City is a heterogeneous system consisting of a large IoT-based network, offering various applications for citizens by collecting and analyzing real-time information. As intelligent, efficient digital systems, smart cities manage data by digitalizing all information. Despite the potential benefits of smart cities for citizen convenience, this digital information service can give rise to security and privacy issues. In particular, the challenge of relying on the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is that it is difficult for individuals to manage large amounts of data in smart city environments. In this paper, we study blockchain and Secret Sharing to address personal information protection issues in external cloud services and improve data integrity and security by designing a distributed system. CSPs are connected in a blockchain to validate user data integrity and provide easy data access through Transaction. CSP uses the blockchain to store distributed users' information safely through the Secret Sharing algorithm as a distributed system with improved security of existing centralized systems. The proposed approach demonstrates improved security and privacy through security analysis and has faster transaction speed and data storage efficiency than existing research.}

Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies.

With the development of mechanical energy harvesting technologies like triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc., various mechanical energy harvesters with optimized structures and selected materials, including triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), electromagnetic generator (EMG), etc., have been demonstrated for efficiently extracting electric power from ubiquitous existed mechanical energy sources like wind, water waves/flows, raindrops, vibrations, human motions, organs, and so on. With a comprehensive review of energy harvesting-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) applications among smart environmental monitoring (wind, ocean, and agriculture), smart transportations (drivers, vehicles, ships, roads, and bridges), smart homes (windows, floors, accessories, and human-machine interfaces), smart healthcare (wearable/portable devices, and implantable devices), the concept of smart cities are being promoted to conform with requirements of carbon neutrality and environment-friendly. Moreover, by combining developed self-powered sensor nodes, self-sustainable wireless sensor nodes, and self-charging energy storage units, the concept of IoT will be reinforced by increasing 5G endpoints and accelerates digitalization in smart cities.}

According to the theoretical basis of DTs and the smart city construction, the five-dimensional DTs model is discussed to propose the conceptual framework of the DTs city. Then, edge computing technology is introduced to build an intelligent traffic perception system based on edge computing combined with DTs. Moreover, to improve the traffic scene recognition accuracy, the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm is optimized by the residual network, form the SSD-ResNet50 algorithm, and the DarkNet-53 is also improved. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effects of the improved algorithms and the data enhancement method. The experimental results indicate that the SSD-ResNet50 and the improved DarkNet-53 algorithm show fast training speed, high recognition accuracy, and favorable training effect. Compared with the original algorithms, the recognition time of the SSD-ResNet50 algorithm and the improved DarkNet-53 algorithm is reduced by 6.37ms and 4.25ms, respectively. The data enhancement method used in the present work is not only suitable for the algorithms reported here, but also has a good influence on other deep learning algorithms. Moreover, SSD-ResNet50 and improved DarkNet-53 algorithms have significant applicable advantages in the research of traffic sign target recognition. The rigorous research with appropriate methods and comprehensive results can offer effective reference for subsequent research on DTs cities.}

abstract = {Smart-cities research has established itself as one of the most dynamic fields in research today, accommodating scholars from diverse disciplines, including engineering and computer science as well as social sciences. Even if only tacitly, the resultant debate increasingly oscillates around how the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) might render cities and urban space better places. This article responds to this imperative by suggesting how to capture users’ views and perceptions of smart city services and applications and in this way enrich the decision- and policy-making processes. It is argued that by developing appropriate scales these otherwise subjective views and perceptions may be objectivized and hence made of great use to managers and policymakers. Accordingly, in this research, a process of scale development is conducted in four phases of both inductive and deductive methods. Following initial rounds of focus groups and assessment by experts, an international survey was conducted with 295 participants from Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Arab Peninsula, and other regions. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 and AMOS 20 tools. The study proposes a 20-item scale in five distinct dimensions: Technology anxiety; Work–life interface; Engagement orientation; Support orientation; and Quality of life. The significant theoretical and managerial implications are discussed to demonstrate how to manage information for the benefit of all stakeholders involved in the making of a smart city.}

As part of an evaluation of the EES, qualitative interviews (n = 14) with key informants demonstrate the importance of entrepreneurship for the development of smart destinations. To identify the relevant factors for this kind of smart city positioning, the following study aims to explore, test, and analyze smart city aspects among experts in terms of EES, residents, and tourists visiting Innsbruck. The present study uses both face-to-face interviews and surveys to explore initiatives and targets within the city's EES development as perceived by core stakeholders. It applies a questionnaire measuring local residents' and tourists' perceptions of important smart city attributes (n = 336). The data shows that residents believe Innsbruck has the potential to become a smart city. Furthermore, the data confirms that the EES approach benefits from the tourism industry in the region, with tourism found to improve the respective EES elements, consequently leading to enhanced entrepreneurial activity.}

Concerning the landfill scenario, it is a challenge for a human to monitor the air quality continuously due to the emission of stinky smells and gases from the landfill sites. In this study, we implement a UAV network based on IoT (Internet of Things) and a cloud server for the smart city for tracking the air quality of the landfill sites in real-time and alerting the UAV for capturing the visuals from the camera for detecting the exact cause of the pollutant in the landfill sites. The gas that causes the most air pollution is Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ozone, dioxins and furans, etc. In this paper, continuous monitoring of these harmful gases is done to alert the people to protect them from harm. The study is also carrying the discussion about the industry 5.0 perspectives using UAV long-range communication. The objective of this study is to record the sensory data and visuals of the various gases (NO2, VOC, CO2, SO2) of landfill sites using IoT & UAV and then visualized in a graphical user interface form. The concentration of each gas that is stored in the cloud server is presented in the graphical representation. Different parameters such as Eigenvalues, Correlation Coefficients, and Regression Parameter have also been analysed graphically for the recorded data. The visuals captured from the UAV camera are employed for estimating the cause of the rise in pollutants in landfill sites.}

The problem of scale variation is an ingrained and drastic challenge in crowd counting, and it severely degrades the performance of counting. To address this problem, many powerful models with complex network structures and tricks are built, but the constrained resources of embedded systems prevent the direct deployment of these models into an edge device. Thus, it is on high demand to design favourable lightweight models that require fewer parameters and a fast inference speed, while maintaining competitive counting performance. To this aim, we devise a lightweight network, termed as Ghost Attention Pyramid Network (GAPNet). Specifically, a lightweight GhostNet is adopted as the backbone to encode low-level features. Subsequently, a zero-parameter channel attention module is designed to select the discriminative crowd region efficiently. In addition, an efficient pyramid fusion module is built with a four-branch architecture to obtain multiscale hierarchy representations while reducing the parameters. Finally, a decoder generates the prediction by exploiting a series of transposed convolution blocks. Extensive experiments on crowd counting benchmarks have proved the superiority of the GAPNet in both accuracy and efficiency.}

Smart cities depend on a robust and flexible mobile network foundation, and yet, Thailand is leading the way in the ASEAN. Using Thailand as a case study, this paper presents a practical mobile network planning and optimization framework (PMNPO) that’s workable for the fourth-generation up to sixth-generation networks in smart cities, especially in an industrial estate. While theoretical frameworks play a vital role in optimizing network performance, such frameworks may not be practical enough. This study applies a mixed quantitative research method on actual applications (case studies) and qualitative research. The PMNPO is a management function of pseudo-codes. A workable cost-sharing model for mobile networks consists of CAPEX, OPEX, feasibility study, and site value management (mobile network operators). The fair factor (0.2), the payback (5 years), the NPV ($0.5 million), and the IRR (20%) reveal a promising financial prospect. The PMNPO is practical for Thailand, with a mean acceptance rate of 4.83. Therefore, the findings support stakeholders, policymakers, and decision-makers, in setting telecommunication policies. The results can apply to other developing countries or catalyze a similar research type.}

As recent research has argued, the spatial, material, and political contexts of cities have major influence over what smart urbanism looks like in practice. This paper adds analytical depth to, and broadens the geographical scope of, research on the variegated modes of making smart cities. Based on empirical research in multiple Australian cities we use three case studies to explore three different modes of smart urbanism, each one centred on the interests of a different key actor: corporate-centric, citizen-centric, and planner-centric. These different modes can, and do, co-exist in the same city. At times, they are competing logics that fight to pull the city in different directions. Yet, they can also work together to shape smart city initiatives. In describing these different modes, we pay particular attention to the ways that these projects and strategies must contend with the already existing spatial, cultural, and political contexts of each place.}

The device can initially up-convert the external vibrations with sub-Hertz into tens of Hertz, and further convert to hundreds of Hertz by the second FUC mechanism, which gives a high conversion ratio of 8400. A comprehensive dynamic model has been proposed and verified both from the theoretical analysis and COMSOL simulation to analyze the frequency conversion process and output voltage. When excited by a frequency of 0.2 Hz, an average output power of 75 μW could be obtained with a compact size. Benefiting from the non-contact design, the device could be applied in some sealed scenarios for smart city construction. Herein, a wireless humid-temperature sensor node in the pipeline was successfully powered by harvesting energy from humans walking with the proposed VEH, showing promising application prospects.}

Providing reliable interaction between the smart devices and maintaining the battery sustainability of smart devices are the major demand since most of the IoT devices are run by a battery source. Device sustainability is the prime concern in most the IoT applications such as smart cities, e-health, smart grid, etc. Thus, we have come up with a cross layer design that improves the device sustainability and lifetime of the IoT networks in smart cities. In the proposed design, physical layer and data link layer information is utilized by the network layer to explore the energy efficient communication among the IoT devices, since 70% - 80% of device energy is utilized for its communication. Cross-layer design can be an optimal solution to enhance the modalities of the wireless network. The Weighted sum approach is used in the proposed model which is an effective computation method to analyze and identify the routing metrics that are associated with energy efficiency. Based on the routing metric analysis (Table 2) it is found that a particular combination of routing metrics performs effective power utilization (by attaining optimal transmission power) and achieves sustained device lifetime. From the obtained results, it is noticed that the MTPM + ETP + ND routing metric combination outperforms all the other combinations, and designing the cross-layer mechanism with the weighted sum approach computation gives better network performance without compromising the device lifetime. In smart cities applications, the device scalability is huge, since frequent battery replacement is a very difficult task. Therefore, we come up with an efficient network model that is more suitable to maintain device sustainability in smart cities.}

Because of the large number of devices, three critical challenges come up: heterogeneity, privacy-preserving of generated data, and providing high-level services. The existing solutions cannot even solve two of the mentioned challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a three-module framework, named “Ontology-Based Privacy-Preserving” (OBPP) to address these issues. The first module includes an ontology, a data storage model, to address the heterogeneity issue while keeping the privacy information of IoT devices. The second one contains semantic reasoning rules to find abnormal patterns while addressing the quality of provided services. The third module provides a privacy rules manager to address the privacy-preserving challenges of IoT devices achieved by dynamically changing privacy behaviors of the devices. Extensive simulations on a synthetic smart city dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the existing solutions while providing affordability and robustness against information leakages. Thus, it can be widely applied to smart cities.}

This system can be used in indoor locations such as commercial settings, educational environments, health care facilities, and so on, especially places where due to the long-term presence of people, the effects of artificial lighting on the performance and efficiency of inhabitants are significant. This method is recommended for improving residents' well-being, particularly in smart cities.}

abstract = {In order to manage the energy cost of LEDs (light-emitting diodes), this study presents an innovative solution considering the price of electricity and the desired lighting levels as the input variables of the control system. When electricity prices decline, customers tend to consume more electrical energy. Conversely, with the increase in prices, there is a tendency to use less electricity. Also, lighting levels are another important factor in determining the energy consumption and associated costs of light-emitting diodes. By using the proposed system, lighting levels are adjusted as a percentage of the nominal light output of LEDs. The advantage of this method is controlling the energy cost based upon the simultaneous effects of electricity prices and the desired lighting levels. Therefore, unlike conventional lighting control systems that focus only on controlling the lighting levels, the introduced method provides a more effective control solution. The accuracy of this technique is supported by the results of system simulation and implementation. The proposed method is recommended as a novel strategy for meeting the requirements of smart grids, smart cities, and unregulated energy markets.}

A calibration process in the same environment as the sensor is crucial to enhance their accuracy. Furthermore, low-cost sensors deteriorate over time, necessitating repeated calibration for sustained performance. HypeAIR is a novel open-source framework for the management of sensor calibration in real-time. It incorporates two calibration methodologies: a combination of machine learning models (Voting Regressor and Support Vector Regression) and the Long Short-Term Memory deep learning model. To evaluate the framework, three extensive experiments were conducted over a 2-year period in the city of Modena, Italy, to monitor NO, NO2, and O3 gases. Both calibration methodologies outperform the manufacturer calibration and our baseline (i.e., a variation of the Random Forest algorithm) and maintain efficiency over time. The availability of the source code facilitates customization for monitoring additional pollutants, while shared air quality datasets ensure reproducibility.}

However, the MEC can only provide limited number of IoT services because of its finite computing resource. How to deploy VNF instances and route data packets for IoT services in the MEC has been considered as a nontrivial problem. The problem becomes more complicated when taking Quality of Service (QoS) into consideration. In this paper, we study the VNF placement and service chaining problems while considering multi-attribute-based QoS in smart cities. We first formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and utilize randomized rounding technique to calculate a solution to the problem. Considering IoT services have different QoS requirements, we design an unsplittable flow based heuristic algorithm to deploy computing resource for each type of IoT service. Finally, large quantities of simulations prove that our algorithms outperform their counterparts.}

Cloud computing (CC), which possesses large capacity in terms of computing and storage resource, may not be suitable for many vehicular applications like safety and emergency services due to high bandwidth requirement and large response time. Edge or fog computing can be a promising technology that can be integrated with vehicular networks to meet the requirements of less bandwidth usage and lower response time. Vehicular cloud network (VCN) extends cloud computing concepts among the vehicles in the vehicular networks to enable vehicles with excess computing, storage or bandwidth capacities to share the resources with other vehicles, who are willing to use that extra resource to fulfill their service requirements. Security poses a great challenge in a vehicular network due to high mobility, dynamic and frequent changes in topology and sudden variation in vehicle density in the roads. Privacy of the vehicular users must be ensured to encourage mass participation for making the system trustworthy. Both security and privacy are pre-requisites of a sustainable smart city. For secured service provisioning, before transmitting a message, connected vehicles must be authenticated. In this paper, we have proposed a system to authenticate vehicles for secured service provisioning in edge-enabled vehicular cloud networks. A novel technique has been developed to avoid redundant authentication to validate a vehicle successively across various RSUs (road side units). Extensive simulation works have been done and the outputs demonstrate efficacy of the proposed algorithm.}

The research focus is on developing countries and cities not yet fully aligned with smart city standards. The methodological approach of examining citizens' readiness was based on an analysis of crowdsourcing models, such as crowd wisdom, crowdfunding, crowdvoting and crowdsensing, and their application in various fields, such as traffic, environmental conservation, utility services and health. The data was gathered in the city of Belgrade, Republic of Serbia, for two years through a survey that included a sample of 210 citizens. The results indicate that citizens are ready to accept crowdsourcing services related to environmental conservation (crowdfunding services that support solar energy development and environmental protection) and public transportation (crowdvoting and crowd wisdom services that can improve the state of the public transport). The proposed methodological approach and obtained results could serve as a good basis for initiating the implementation of smart city projects in Serbia and other cities and governments.}

The programmable network SDN centrally manages different smart devices connected in the networks. These smart devices are facilitated by Internet of Things (IoT) and collect real time data for network devices. One of the emerging applications of IoT network is Smart City which purpose is to manage the city without human interventions. The rapid growths of IoT devices like actuators and sensors in smart city are generating large amount of data and increasing the traffic in network. To maintain the quality of services (QoS) of smart city IoT networks, the SDN characteristic is one way to provide better services to network users. Traditional IoT network having the challenges like, access delays, security and reliability issues. The SDN enabled IoT networks are capable to overcome these challenges and improves the network performance. One single controller is not sufficient to manage all IoT devices in smart city networks. So, multiple controllers are required to handle Software Defined-IoT Networks (SDN-IoT). Different metaheuristic algorithms are implemented to overcome controller placements problems (CPP) but as the number of controllers increases the performance of approaches degrades due to premature conversions. To better balance the exploration and exploitation features an intelligent Hybrid Differential Evolution and Whale Optimization (DEWO) Algorithm is proposed that optimizes the controller placements in SDN-IoT enabled smart city networks. The algorithm searches the optimal locations of controllers and balance the switch loads in respect of minimum latency. The algorithm also minimizes the link failure and evaluate the minimum end to end delay. The proposed hybrid algorithm is evaluated up to 40 controllers with other state of art method and able to achieve better results in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms.}

First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME.}

Thus, the paper elaborates upon an alternative mode of person-environment-interaction based approach towards placemaking: Empathic Cities. This approach implies embracing a shift from efficiency to sufficiency and wellbeing embedded regenerative perspective for conceiving the built environment. First, the variable dimensions of urban growth and governance, which gave rise to the smart city, are contextualized. The embedded neoliberal operational agenda of smart cities are established. On this basis, the underpinnings of an empathic city are established by acknowledging the shift from techno-centric to human-centric and from product-based to context-based smart city and wellbeing perspectives. Strategies toward urban development are proposed, such as embracing a regenerative perspective wherein the city and its constituents need to be understood as interdependent systemic elements while embracing a human-centric and ethical approach. Additionally, a transition from efficiency to sufficiency-oriented practices and a shift towards inclusive modes of participatory governance are proposed as fundamental principles for an empathic future of the built environment.}

Since assessment of these barriers must be handled by considering many different perspectives, assessment of the critical barriers for SEC can be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This study aims to identify possible critical barriers hindering Turkey from becoming an SEC and prioritize these barriers based on an integrated MCDM methodology. This methodology consists of fuzzy Decision Making Trail and Evaluating Laboratory (DEMATEL) and cognitive mapping methods. The integrated methodology has been constructed with hesitant fuzzy Z-numbers, which allows not only to state the impreciseness of the evaluations but also to consider the hesitancy of the decision-makers to evaluate barriers concerning SEC implementation in Turkey. While the relations between the barriers have been determined via the hesitant fuzzy Z-DEMATEL method, their weights have been obtained through the hesitant fuzzy Z-cognitive mapping method. For Turkey, policy, economic, and social barriers are determined as the essential main barriers, respectively. Besides, the following five sub-barriers: the lack of successful past experiences/projects, social/political conflicts, inadequate regulatory framework, lack of regulatory norms, policies/directions, the lack of technical knowledge among planners, and information on new technology are deserved to be more attention since they have high weights. The research should help policymakers and businesses better understand the barriers to smart energy city projects in order to improve effective action and policy interventions that lead to more successful projects.}

Smart cities collect data from various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and manage the resources and provide service to the public. Emergency Vehicle Priority/Pre-emption (EVP) is one of the major IoT components in smart cities which saves many lives by giving right of way green signal to the Emergency Vehicles (EVs) such as ambulances and fire engines. The existing EVP system gives green signal to the EVs immediate by stopping the conflicting movements. The sudden stoppage of normal traffic as well as the sequence change generates confusion to the road users and drivers. This needs an optimal control strategy which gives green signal to EVs as well as it should not affect the normal traffic flow. This paper proposes an optimal control strategy for EVP using edge computing and IoT sensor for smart cities. The experiment was conducted using a GPS based IoT sensor which keeps on sending the Location Information (LI) to the edge server. The edge server computes the optimum timings based on the proposed control strategy algorithm and clears the emergency vehicles. Waiting time of other road vehicles before and after implementing the system have been studied at a traffic junction at Thiruvananthapuram, India. The comparison result shows that the average waiting time of vehicles on the other road is reduced by 73.23% in the proposed system when compared with the existing system. Since, edge computing has been deployed the latency in communication has been reduced less than 100 ms. So, the proposed solution reduces the waiting time of other road vehicles and reduces the latency in communication simultaneously.}

Consequently, today's cities require integrated policies and new innovative ways to manage and improve the complexity of urban living conditions. The growing volume and variety of data produced in the urban ecosystem are crucial for obtaining the city's insights and building knowledge-based solutions for a smarter and more sustainable urban development. In this paper, we look at the open data impacts on these complex ecosystems and its crucial enabler role for the generation and analysis of contextual and actionable data aimed at understanding, managing, and planning the city. Despite the importance of open data, the literature is scarce in systematic and structured research that evaluates its impacts on the smart city context. This paper explores this gap by proposing a theoretical framework, composed of a model and an experiment grounded on the use of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT), designed to give a more detailed view concerning the context and characteristics of the impacts of open data initiatives on smart cities' sustainable development. This work will contribute to open data management and smart city development, providing boundaries and theoretical insights for further research and experimentation on how open data can be leveraged to develop better smart cities.}

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, has enabled transforming urban areas into smart cities. Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.}

In this research, we proposed an IoT based Dynamic Food Supply Chain for Smart Cities which not only ensures the food quality but also provides intelligent vehicle routing as well as tracing sources of contamination in FCM. Furthermore, a smart sensor data collection strategy based on IoT is utilized which would improve the efficiency and accuracy of the supply chain network with the minimized size of dataset and vehicle routing algorithm is introduced and tracing the contamination sources of infected food in the markets. Our proposed model is evaluated with the comprehensive evaluation and used various performance metrics such as tracing accuracy, delay, execution time, and traveling time.

The optimal management of energy resources is of key importance, and with mobile EVs playing a pivotal role in smart city power flows, the coordination of energy management systems (EMSs) at their parking locations can bear global benefits. In this study the coordination between home energy management systems (HEMSs) and EV parking lot management systems (PLEMS) is proposed, modeled, and simulated, as a new contribution to earlier studies. The EMSs coordinate through partially sharing individual EV schedules and without sharing private information. Missing information is completed through public cloud repositories and services. The HEMS and PLEMS are implemented using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The proposed coordination framework is computationally implemented and simulated based on a real-life case study. The results show that the proposed EMS coordination framework is both technically beneficial for power grids and economically beneficial for EV owners.}

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not a comprehensive review of the state of the art on recommender systems for smart cities. For this reason, in this paper we present a taxonomy of smart city features, dimensions, actions and goals, and, according to these variables, we survey the existing literature on recommender systems.

Buildings and electric transport systems, especially subway systems and Plug in Electric Vehicles (PEVs), are among the major energy consumption systems in a smart city. In this paper, a linear model is proposed for the co-optimization planning and operation of distributed energy resources and transportation systems in an interconnected system that analyzes the interactions of such an interconnected system. The idea of Regenerative Breaking Energy (RBE) is deployed to improve the operation of the subway system through the interconnected subway system in the smart city. For the optimal operation of the smart city, an optimization formulation is devised to minimize the total cost of the city in the presence of subway RBE. In this paper, the traffic and length of the routes are modeled considering Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Subway (V2S) located in the parking lots. Furthermore, the degradation model is developed to increase the PEVs’ battery life. An unscented transformation (UT) approach is utilized to construct a stochastic framework based on the uncertainty method, to handle the uncertain behaviors of PEVs and distributed energy resource and loads in the smart city. Finally, the proposed model is implemented and its performance is analyzed in both the stochastic and deterministic frameworks.}

Smart city projects may fail if citizens do not actively participate in their design. In smart cities, this participation often occurs through dedicated participation platforms where citizens can vote, discuss, and submit ideas. However, current platforms are not always aligned with the requirements of citizens in a representative way. Furthermore, they are neither always aligned with the reality of the administration and the requirements of public servants. In this paper, we examine what characteristics a participation platform should possess to be aligned with the requirements of citizens and public servants. A quantitative survey of citizens and qualitative interviews of several public servants are performed to elicit those requirements. The most important requirements for citizens are free access, user friendliness, and government usage of the ideas while the most important for public servants are the representation of the city's identity, back-end functionalities, and inclusivity. Afterwards, a guiding framework, following Design Science Research, is composed based on the requirements and applied to the platform LeuvenMaaktHetMee. Furthermore, the framework updates the founding framework of Macintosh and Whyte from 2008, allowing to guide the development and implementation of participation platforms.}

The results show that the construction of smart cities improves residents’ health status. This relationship is achieved by reducing the use of outpatient services and increasing the utilization of inpatient services. Furthermore, compared with urban residents, rural residents show more significant behavioural changes in their use of medical services under the influence of smart city construction.}

This study identifies the priority areas of large Polish cities with regard to SC and the extent to which social infrastructure and human capital inform development objectives. Work involved content analysis of official documents and websites profiling SC strategies of six Polish cities (Warsaw, Cracow, Łódź, Wrocław, Poznań and Gdańsk) and their metropolitan areas. This was complemented by targeted interviews and seminars. Moreover, an exploratory study of Gdańsk and Gdynia was also carried out. Our evidence suggests that Polish experience with SC represents gradual processes of adaptation and emergent forms of urban politics that reflect tensions between new and more traditional forms of governance and economic, environmental and social goals. Our results indicate that Institutional change has in fact taken place in terms of participatory governance, digitalization in service provision, addressing social needs and linking SC agendas to wider urban development objectives.}

Firstly, we consider the influence of item attributes on user scoring. Naive Bayesian classifier is used to score unrated items, which can effectively fill in the missing values in the score matrix and solve the problem of data sparsity. Secondly, to ensure sustainable recommendations for uncertain goals, the three-way decisions is introduced into the collaborative filtering recommendation system, three-way recommendation rules are formulated, and 3NBCFR is constructed. Finally, the model is applied to the movie recommendation system. The experiment on Movielens shows that compared with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, 3NBCFR algorithm reduces the recommendation cost and improves the recommendation quality. At the same time, it lays a foundation for promoting the construction of smart city.}

The smart services of cities like smart buildings, smart hospitals, smart traffic, smart factories, and smart transportation are vital to energizing resilient, reliable, seamless energy and electrical flow. One of these smart services' critical challenges is anticipated to run without disruptions using smart energy and smart electrical grids. Hence, in this research, the Internet of Things (IoT) role in green energy resources incorporation into smart electrical grids has been introduced using the Multi-Objective Distributed Dispatching algorithm (MODDA). Efficient energy management includes a tradeoff between the cost linked with utility function and energy consumption. The utility function can be the living comfort of the consumers or the utility firm's gross income. The interchanges between utility and energy consumption must, therefore, be recognized. The algorithm is intended to transmit the renewable green energy available to the battery, thermal, and load storing while preserving a thermal and battery storage limit. The experimental results at the lab-scale show the proposed dispatching algorithm minimizing the system cost and energy consumption. It is shown that substantial energy waste can be reduced by equipping a smart building with the proposed IoT system for effective green energy management.}

Therefore, it is urgent to design an universal and robust multi-object tracking(MOT) algorithm. MOT is a challenging problem with numerous significant applications, including robot navigation, autonomous driving and pedestrian behavior analysis. Among the existing MOT approaches, MOT models which joint learning detection and Re-ID are attracting increasing attention. Subsequently, there is competition between these two tasks jointly in a network inevitably leading to performance degradation. To address these difficulties, we propose an adaptive joint learning approach, called UnionTrack, for MOT in this paper. It handles with the problem of uniform learning between tasks in online MOT system. Firstly, UnionTrack introduces a scale-aware attention network that aggregates features from different scales for object localization and learning of the corresponding discriminative embeddings. Secondly, a cross-correlation module is designed to construct task-relevant feature maps and interact adaptively during training detection and Re-ID. Then, we perform inter-frame correlation at different stages by using high and low confidence detection to avoid occlusions and backgrounds. UnionTrack is trained in an end-to-end manner to better accommodate the training between detection and Re-ID tasks. Finally, our proposed UnionTrack is compared with state-of-the-art methods in extensively experiments and detailed performance analysis is performed in MOT15, MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 which are all urban scene to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Looking forward to playing a role in the Smart City systems.}

This research investigates attack attempts on smart home environments, focusing on firmware, brute force, and DoS attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) network which were successful in bringing down the device in less than a minute. Weak passwords were cracked using Brute Force techniques related to HTTP, SSH, Telnet, and FTP protocols, and an unknown service port to reveal backdoor access. Cross-site scripting vulnerability was detected on IoT devices that could allow running malicious scripts on the devices. The authors also exploited the unknown services to reveal backdoors and access sensitive device details and potentially exploited them to add new ports or rules to turn the IoT devices into a router to attack other devices. To detect and mitigate such attacks, the authors present an IoT-based intrusion detection and prevention system to secure smart home network devices. The authors compared the proposed framework with other similar research based on Precision, Accuracy, F-measure, and Recall. The proposed model outperforms all the other known models reporting a high of 95% for identifying malicious attack packets, while others reported 58% and 71% detection percentage.}

The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) uses the roadside unit (RSU) and nearby techniques to conduct different vehicle requirements. Since the number of vehicles and traffic delivery is growing asymmetrically, the service provider should implement innovative download strategies to increase efficiency and provide customers with high-quality service. Nevertheless, the lack of national knowledge and time-various IOVs make it extremely difficult for the roadside unit long-term energy restrictions to take successful offloading or discharging. Hence in this paper, the Optimized energy-efficient sensible edge processing (OEE-SEP) model for IoV in smart cities has been proposed for vehicle activity discharging with the estimated amount of time with less energy consumption. The sensible edge processing model comprises undirected activity discharging and similar activity discharging protocol, concerning the number of duties per unit time and the estimated time of completion for the same amount of information imported. An optimized energy-efficient model is formulated to reduce the total transmission delay and reduce the energy consumed during discharge. OEE-SEP leads to less energy consumption during activity discharging when the IoV processes and information loading activities are considered. The experimental results show that the suggested model enhances the performance rate of 97.45% with less transmission delay, less energy consumption for vehicle automation systems in smart cities.}

In this work, we propose a framework for energy consumption forecasting that exploits adaptive learning, federated learning, and edge computing concepts. A central server aggregates numerous long short-term memory (LSTM) models that users at various locations train with their energy consumption data to create a generalized model that uses adaptive learning to detect data drifts and enhance forecasting at the edge layer. Our findings show that adaptive federated learning performs better than centralized learning while preserving privacy, reducing communication overhead, lowering the forecast error rate by 8%, and decreasing the training time by approximately 80%.}

abstract = {Management of emergency vehicles can be fostered within a Smart City, i.e. an urban environment in which many IoT devices are orchestrated by a distributed intelligence able to suggest to road users the best course of action in different traffic situations. By extending MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation Software), we design and test appropriate mitigation strategies when traffic accidents occur within an existing urban area augmented with V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) capabilities and Advanced Driving Assisted cars (ADAS). Further, we propose traffic congestion models and related mechanisms for improving the necessary time for emergency vehicles to respond to accidents.}
