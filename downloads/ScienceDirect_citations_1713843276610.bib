abstract = {The internal core temperature of cells is required to create accurate cell models and understand cell performance within a module. Pack cooling concepts often trade off temperature uniformity, vs cost/weight and complexity. Poor thermal management systems can lead to accelerated cell degradation, and unbalanced ageing. To provide core temperature an internal array of 7 thermistors was constructed; these in conjunction with cell current, via bus bar mounted sensors, and voltage sensor measurements, we have developed instrumented cells. These cells are also equipped with power line communication (PLC) circuitry, forming smart cells. We report upon data from these miniature sensors during cell cycling, demonstrating successful operation of the PLC system (zero errors compared to a reference wired connection) during typical cell cycling (C/2 discharge, C/3 charge) and the application of automotive drive cycle, providing a transient current test profile. Temperature variation within the cell of approximately 1.2 °C gradients, and variation of >2.8 °C during just 30 min of 2C discharging demonstrate the need for internal sensing and monitoring throughout the lifetime of a cell. Our cycling experimental data, along with thorough cell performance tracking, where typically <0.5% degradation was found following instrumentation process, demonstrate the success of our novel prototype smart cells.}

To understand the impact of surging housing prices on the low-to-moderate income group, this study uses transit smart card data to explore whether and to what extent increasing housing affordability pressure impacts the pattern of residential spatial distribution. This analysis is based on the facts that most public transit commuters are in the low-to-moderate income group and that transit smart cards continuously record individual spatial choice behaviors. Compared with conventional approaches using census data or survey data, our approach can more quickly detect residential changes. Experimental results indicated that most low-to-moderate income dwellers lived in low-housing-cost areas with high accessibility to public transportation. Three relocation patterns were discovered based on significant changes in residential spatial distribution. The overall pattern is to move from the inner city to suburban areas or to the urban periphery, where housing costs are much lower. Specifically, these commuters moved along traffic corridors (metro lines), which indicates that their residential choices were constrained by employment locations and public transport facilities. Finally, these commuters presented a jumping relocation pattern along metro lines due to the search for low-rent housing. Our findings provide some insights into urban dynamics, as well as urban and housing policies.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 global pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to nations and cities worldwide. Governments have adopted Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to rapidly control the spread of a novel coronavirus. As an innovative but controversial ICT-based tool, health QR code plays a vital role by assisting rapid contact tracing. Yet, whether and how citizens accept this policy tool remains an unknown theoretical and empirical question. In this paper, we study the sources that determine citizens' acceptance of health QR code in city governance. Based on a nation-wide online survey covering 28 major provincial-capital cities in China, we find that individual experiences and political identities affect citizens' acceptance of QR code. Even though public opinion regarding this issue is diverse, the government's responses to citizens' requests play a critical role in enhancing their acceptance of using QR code both in the current and future stages. Specifically, as the citizens perceive a higher level of city government responsiveness, they are less worried about privacy leaks and more likely to perceive the effectiveness of health QR code in improving public health, thus resulting in a higher acceptance. The results offer broad policy implications for smart cities and urban governance.}

abstract = {Purpose
The COVID-19 outbreak has substantially altered residents’ training activities. While several new virtual learning programs have been recently implemented, the perspective of urology trainees regarding their usefulness still needs to be investigated.
Methods
A cross-sectional, 30-item, web-based Survey was conducted through Twitter from April 4th, 2020 to April 18th, 2020, aiming to evaluate the urology residents’ perspective on smart learning (SL) modalities (pre-recorded videos, webinars, podcasts, and social media [SoMe]), and contents (frontal lessons, clinical case discussions, updates on Guidelines and on clinical trials, surgical videos, Journal Clubs, and seminars on leadership and non-technical skills).
Results
Overall, 501 urology residents from 58 countries completed the survey. Of these, 78.4, 78.2, 56.9 and 51.9% of them considered pre-recorded videos, interactive webinars, podcasts and SoMe highly useful modalities of smart learning, respectively. The contents considered as highly useful by the greatest proportion of residents were updates on guidelines (84.8%) and surgical videos (81.0%). In addition, 58.9 and 56.5% of responders deemed seminars on leadership and on non-technical skills highly useful smart learning contents. The three preferred combinations of smart learning modality and content were: pre-recorded surgical videos, interactive webinars on clinical cases, and pre-recorded videos on guidelines.
Conclusion
Our study provides the first global “big picture” of the smart learning modalities and contents that should be prioritized to optimize virtual Urology education. While this survey was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak, our findings might have even more impact in the future.

To this end, we empirically compare a standard reactive deadband control to two new smart thermostat HVAC control methods: (1) a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach and (2) a novel model predictive control (MPC) method, whose solution is optimal with respect to its data-driven linear model. We evaluated the controls with 500 unique energy models of houses located in the United States. The models were modified to facilitate the short-term performance simulation required for residential HVAC systems. Overall, we found the MPC controller offers three distinct advantages over the RL and deadband methods: (1) MPC had the lowest average cost (defined as a custom weighted combination of runtime and comfort) of the evaluated controllers; (2) the MPC control’s linear model was able to reliably extrapolate from the sparse sample of training observations, thus enabling it to adapt quickly to recent data; and (3) in contrast to RL methods, MPC did not subject the houses or occupants to the discomfort of system exploration.}

Today, with the internet of things, smart healthcare through digital sensors, nanotechnology, fog computing, cloud computing, and telemedicine innovations produces and exchanges data across different stakeholders. In addition to building platforms that run on this data in Smart Healthcare, this improvement in information management creates the way for better data collection and improves Healthcare Services through the application of the technologies. However, Security and privacy in smart healthcare systems (SHS) require adequate attention against unsuspecting assaults, security attacks, and threats. The escape of private data can impact negatively on the individual life, including abuse, high insurance rates, and loss of jobs resulting from medical information leaks. As a result, information protection and safety are critical, and if not curtained can raise the likelihood of privacy violations, vulnerability, and risk breaches. Although the different SHS is still growing and evolving, existing privacy and security analysis reveals that there is no concrete convergence and consolidation of security and privacy that encourages the acceptance of the SHS by consumers due to fear of personal data exposure. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a detailed discussion on the state of the art of SHS, with a special emphasis on what has been achieved in the areas of privacy and security, threats, and protection mechanisms. It also describes and addresses the user’s basic security and privacy needs and concerns about SHS specifications and problems. The chapter recommends an attack nomenclature to approach defense criteria from a greater perception. As a result, infuses the new privacy and security advances in SHS addresses open problems, and discuss areas for future study.}

Accordingly a questionnaire survey, key informant interview and focus group discussion were used to collect data from various sources. Binary logistic regression and descriptive statistic were applied to analyze the quantitative data collected from 368 randomly selected sample households. Findings revealed integrated soil fertility management, crop diversification, crop rotation, and intercropping found to be highly adopted CSA practices in the study area. Factors including farming system, farm size, access to irrigated farm, access to extension service, distance to market places, and access to weather information were identified as determinants for the CSA practices. The result shows that though respondents’ participation was encouraging, the rate of adoption of CSA was low. Therefore, we suggest that the extension program should give attention for the introduction of context and site specific CSA technologies and support farmers with relevant skill and knowledge training as well as input provisions. Further, policy and support programs should also focus on dissemination of CSA best practices and lessons learnt elsewhere to smallholder farmers.}

abstract = {ABSTARCT
A common policy challenge across many countries is how to accommodate an increasingly ageing and vulnerable rural population. Everyday challenges include proximity to services, transport, and fuel poverty. Policies aimed to tackle rural poverty have learned to look beyond agri-food productivity and that the ‘top-down’ approach must be met with local knowledge. We use random effects binary logit models to investigate how people's health and social isolation are affected by socio-economic characteristics, as well as by the different rural policies. Thus, this paper extends the evaluation of rural policies contributing to tackling rural poverty and social isolation by measuring the impact of a nationally funded rural development initiative. Our case study investigates the Maximizing Access in Rural Areas initiative (2012–2014), a ‘smart’ rural development programme within Northern Ireland that married local knowledge with government objectives to mitigate poverty and isolation. Results indicate that, although men's health deteriorated from 2012 to 2014, the MARA programme countered levels of deprivation. The most successful intervention was improving access to local services. However, this result is strongly dependent on a robust rural transport support network. Moreover, when considering rural poverty, health and isolation are two primary metrics, both dovetail to create what is truly rural poverty, and rural development is only effective when it tackles both.}

This paper mainly studies the coupling mechanism and development prospect of the innovation ecosystem of clean energy under the smart agriculture based on blockchain. This paper first analyzes the coupling mechanism between the blockchain smart agriculture and the clean energy innovation ecosystem; secondly, it establishes the evaluation index system of the clean energy innovation ecosystem, and measures the development efficiency of the clean innovation ecosystem by using the SBM model, super efficiency SBM model and the global principal component method; thirdly, it uses the development efficiency of the clean energy innovation ecosystem through coupling and coordination The model calculates the coupling coordination of clean energy innovation ecosystem in different regions, and analyzes the spatial-temporal differences, regional differences and spatial agglomeration of the coupling coordination degree. The calculation results show that the average coupling coordination degree of green innovation development in the East, the middle, the West and the whole country is consistent with the development trend of provinces, autonomous regions and cities, showing an upward trend. The results show that the eastern region increases from 0.62 to 0.70; the average coupling coordination degree of the central region is lower than the national average coupling coordination degree, and the distance is gradually increasing; the western region has been in a serious maladjustment level, the global Moran index I value of the coupling coordination degree of clean energy innovation ecosystem is greater than 0, and the Z statistics are greater than the critical value of normal distribution function at the level of 5 %, P values are all less than 0.05 Local Moran index I and Z statistics have been growing steadily, and the significance of spatial positive correlation is getting higher and higher. The research results of this paper can provide a useful reference for the development of clean energy innovation ecosystem under the smart agriculture based on blockchain.}

Standardization efforts of extreme industrial relevance, such as the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), have recently emerged to support session control and interoperability in all-IP next generation networks. At the same time, recent advances in wireless communications have motivated the development of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for low-cost and easy-deployable environmental monitoring. However, the IMS potential for new classes of ready-to-use, energy-efficient, and highly integrated services, including also WSNs, is still widely unexplored. The paper proposes an original solution to opportunistically use client devices, that roam in geographically sparse environments (such as a smart city), as WSN data harvesters. The primary design guideline is to exploit IMS and the recently released IMS presence service to effectively coordinate harvesters, by saving energy via minimization of unnecessary communications. The reported experimental results point out that our solution, compliant with standards and thus easily deployable, can significantly increase sensor battery lifetime with minimum impact on the freshness of harvested data.}

To start with from the fundamental principles of E-B theory, a Lagrange equation of motion is obtained both for the regular beam element as well as for the PZT & PVDF sensor actuator pair. Following which, a dynamic equation of motion of the smart intelligent structure developed using the smart materials consisting of PZT& PVDF is obtained. Smart materials have got some special properties that react to the changes in their environmental conditions. This means that some of their special properties can be changed by using an external condition, such as temperature, light, pressure, electricity, voltage, pH, or chemical compounds, which could be considered as the special characteristics and this change is reversible, which can be repeated many times. The dynamic equation is transformed into a state space model with 2 inputs and 2 outputs using the concepts of state space theory in the advanced control engineering. The model is developed considering the first 2 modes of vibration, which are the most dominant modes in the vibration theory. The developed state space model is used for active vibration control. An external force of 1 N is applied at the end of the smart flexible multivariable multimodel cantilever beam after which the beam is subjected to vibrations. A Periodic Output Feedback controller can be designed and put in loop with the plant, after which the plant vibrations decays to zero in no time. The work done can also compared with others to show the authenticity or the profoundness of the methodology that is being developed by us.}

The laws of quantum physics have ushered novel properties of quantum states to unravel the mystery of the subatomic world. The innovative properties of quantum systems have achieved ultrahigh sensitivity and nonlocal correlation that have wide application to the development of supercomputers, faster communications systems, high-quality sensors, and sophisticated metrological devices. In search of greater sensitivity, high-precision measurement, and superresolution imaging, there are fundamental limits imposed by the laws of classical physics. The discovery of quantum tools described in this review (qubit system, quantum tunneling, single electron state, entangled states, supercooled atoms, single-photon or multiphoton states, etc.) explores the technological advantages of sensors over classical systems showing their unique characteristics. The application of this novel quantum sensor system has shown incredible precision in various fields harnessing the fundamentally quantum mechanical nature of both the system being measured and the devices that are used to measure the system. The emergence of atomic clocks, quantum computers, atomic magnetometers, quantum tunneling composite, single electron imaging, etc. has revolutionized the nanotechnology/nanophononics industry.}

These are highly energy efficient residential urban areas, powered entirely through renewables. PED creation is to be guided by principles of quality of life, sustainability, and inclusiveness (specifically focusing on affordability and energy poverty prevention). Although there is research into the decarbonization aspects of PEDs, there has been little focus on the guiding principles, and their potential to reduce energy vulnerability. Using energy vulnerability factors and an energy justice framework, this article examines how the topic of energy vulnerability mitigation is perceived by professional PED stakeholders. Stakeholders from multiple countries were interviewed in order to determine how and to what extent they approached the topic of inclusivity and energy vulnerability. The contribution of this paper to academic research is in helping to frame energy vulnerability in European smart city urban areas, focusing on the perceptions of key stakeholders. This contributes to research on the identification and evaluation of innovations such as PEDs which offer a potential model for an inclusive transition. Furthermore, this article offers a contribution for policymakers, informing PED replication policies with a focus on the synergistic aims of decarbonization and energy vulnerability mitigation.}

This paper develops a coordinated expansion planning of transmission and active distribution systems via a stochastic multistage mathematical programming model. In the transmission level, in addition to lines, sitting and sizing of utility-scale battery energy storage systems and wind power plants under renewable portfolio standard policy are planned. Switchable feeders and distributed generations are decision variables in the distribution level while the impact of demand response programs as a sort of behind-the-meter technologies is accommodated as well. Expansion of electric vehicle taxi charging stations is included as a feasible option in both transmission and distribution levels. In order to deal with short-term uncertainty of load demand, renewable energy sources output power, and the charging pattern of electric vehicle taxis in each station, a chronological time-period clustering algorithm along with Monte Carlo simulation is utilized. The proposed model is tackled by means of Benders Dual Decomposition (BDD) method. The IEEE RTS test system (as the transmission system) along with four IEEE 33-node test feeders (as distribution test systems) are examined to validate effectiveness of the proposed model.}

We leverage local differential privacy to protect the data provider's privacy against data consumers, as well as against system operators, and we build a blockchain-based solution for ensuring fair exchange, and immutable data logs.

Based on an extensive original dataset involving expert interviews, site visits to retailers, and a comprehensive review of the literature, this study critically examines the promise and peril of smart home technologies. Drawing on original data collected in the United Kingdom, which has access to European markets, the study first examines definitions of smart homes before offering a new classification involving 13 categories of smart technology covering 267 specific options commercially available from 113 companies. It situates these different technology classes alongside six degrees or levels of smartness, from the basic or traditional home to the fully automated and sentient home. It then elaborates on the 13 distinct benefits smart homes may offer alongside potential 17 risks and barriers, before introducing seven policy recommendations from the material. It lastly suggests three areas of future research on the demographics and behavior of actual smart home adopters, rethinking the duality of “control,” and looking beyond “homes” towards socio-technical systems, practices, and justice.}

Thermochromic glazing has been thoroughly advanced from a materials perspective, with many kinds of thermochromic coating techniques developed thus far, however, a far smaller body of work exists to investigate how these kinds of glazing would perform within buildings. This paper presents a systematic review of these thermochromic films, coatings and glazings that have been used to analyse primarily energy saving capability in buildings, using computer simulation as well as full-scale models. Research from 2009 to 2019 was obtained from architecture and engineering databases, identifying window types modelled, energy savings found, and comfort analyses conducted. Thermochromic windows were reported to have the potential to save heating and cooling energy demand from 5.0 to 84.7%, in comparison to plain glass and dependent on climatic conditions. Differences in energy saving capability were analysed based on location and glazing type. Thermochromic window energy performance was found to vary significantly between different cities using the same film type (up to 73.4%), but far less so between different films types used in the same city (up to 21.6%). Few studies were shown to have explored thermochromic windows from a visual and thermal comfort performance perspective. This paper highlights areas of guidance for future studies of thermochromic glazing for energy-efficient building applications to better forecast energy saving performance of thermochromic windows for real building application.}

However, these elements are shaped by social and ecological factors that influence its distribution and diversity, which in turn affects ecological functions and human wellbeing. Here, we analyzed neighborhood tree distribution - trees in pocket parks, squares and along streets – in Lisbon (Portugal) and modelled tree abundance and taxonomic and functional diversity, at the parish and local scales, considering a comprehensive list of social and ecological factors. For the functional analyses, we included functional traits linked to dispersal, resilience to important perturbations in coastal Mediterranean cities, and ecosystem services delivery. Our results show not only that trees are unevenly distributed across the city, but that there is a strong influence of social factors on all biological indices considered. Both at the parish and local scales, abundance and diversity responded to different factors, with abundance being linked to both social and ecological variables. Although the influence of social factors on urban trees can be expected, by modelling their influence we can quantify how much humans modify urban landscapes at a structural and functional level. These associations can underlie potential biodiversity filters and should be analyzed over time to inform decisions that guarantee long-term ecological resilience, maximized trait functional expression, and equity in ecosystem services delivery.}

abstract = {As the energy demand for multiple purposes increases, smart multi-energy systems have become the trend in the development of cities. In such an intelligent environment, it is possible and imperative to consider the traffic flow guidance for electric and non-electric vehicles in the urban transportation network. However, this has not yet been considered in the challenges of planning multi-energy systems. Based on these considerations, a novel optimal planning framework is proposed in the present study, that takes into account the coupling of transportation, natural gas and active distribution networks. Firstly, a novel structure of integrated energy stations is proposed, which serves as coupling components where various sources of energy can be converted, distributed, and stored. The model optimizes the investment and operational strategies of renewable energy generation, energy converters, storage devices and charging facilities in a coordinated way. To capture the impact of traffic flow, a mixed user equilibrium state was established. Thus, the route selections for non-electric vehicles and the navigations of electric vehicles to charging facilities could both be incorporated into the model. Since the proposed planning model is a mixed-integer nonlinear program problem, convex relaxation was conducted to transform the model formulations into a mixed-integer second order cone program version. Finally, four cases were designed and tested in a practical urban area. The quantitative comparison revealed that unguided traffic flow will increase the traffic costs by more than 23%. Moreover, when both charging and routing guidance are considered the energy losses will decrease by at least 5.6%.}

Based on interviews and document analysis, we argue that a specific logic, which we call anti-politics, is now being enacted through the creation of policies and technologies that aim to reduce and remove human agency from energy systems. Analyses based on post-politics do not fully capture the extent to which politics—the continual process of disagreement and deliberation—has been purged from the ideologies and institutions that govern energy and society. In addition to the technocratic evolution beyond politics, we are witnessing the neoliberal elimination of politics.}

However, such SNLS resources are characterized by complex coupling relationships; their control authority may belong to different stakeholders. Challenged by the above, the laminar flow structure from the communication field is introduced for distributed optimal dispatching in SDNs. A day-ahead laminar dispatching method considering the effective interaction of SNLS resources is proposed. First, the applicability of the laminar flow structure is analyzed. An upper-layer dispatching model for the SDN and a lower-layer dispatching model for users with DG are established. Then, by introducing intermediate variables, the lower dispatching model is transformed into a quadratic programming problem and the upper dispatching model is transformed into a second-order cone relaxation programming problem. Selecting the tie-line power flow as the exchanged information in the boundary, the upper- and lower-layer models are alternately solved until the convergence criterion is met. Finally, an improved IEEE 33-bus system is experimentally analyzed. We find that the SNLS flexible resource dispatching scheme can be obtained with only a few iterations, and the DG consumption can be significantly improved.}

A sample of 818 youth citizen scientists in Saskatchewan, Canada downloaded the app to provide information on victimization, subjective health, internalizing problems (symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression), externalizing behaviours (cannabis use, alcohol, smoking), and suicide ideation. Binary regression models were used to estimate associations and controlled for gender, age, perpetration, and ethnicity. From our sample, 23% of youth reported suicide ideation (i.e., thoughts) in the past year. Three types of victimization (cyberbullied, made fun or teased, or bullied via being left out) are associated with a two-times higher risk of suicide ideation. Although certain risk factors (anxiety, poor subjective health, and cannabis use) were associated with higher suicide ideation risk, they did not moderate the association between victimization and suicide ideation. Symptoms of depression were found to be protective against suicide ideation. Suicide ideation is high among this sample of youth in Canada. Certain types of victimization, internalizing and externalizing risk factors, and poor subjective health are associated with a higher risk of suicide ideation. However, our findings confirm that the pathway from victimization to suicide ideation is complex and is potentially moderated by factors other than the ones explored here.}

This article presents the work in the design, test and performance evaluation of a low-cost, machine learning based, solution for distributed monitoring of the use of public transit in small communities. The proposed solution utilizes a low-resolution infrared array, that provides non-personally identifiable information coupled with a low-power deep learning module. We also compare the machine-based solution to a traditional algorithmic approach. We believe the solution allows small communities, with limited resources, to collect near real-time data that can be employed for evidence-based decisions of coverage and frequency in public transit. The successful collection of this kind of mobility data is vital for small communities as this is needed to support grant applications that are increasingly commonly used to improve public transit or other mobility modes.}

abstract = {Nowadays, COVID-19 is spreading at a rapid rate in almost all the continents of the world. It has already affected many people who are further spreading it day by day. Hence, it is the most essential to alert nearby people to be aware of it due to its communicable behavior. Till May 2020, no vaccine is available for the treatment of this COVID-19, but the existing technologies can be used to minimize its effect. Cloud/fog computing could be used to monitor and control this rapidly spreading infection in a cost-effective and time-saving manner. To strengthen COVID-19 patient prediction, Artificial Intelligence(AI) can be integrated with cloud/fog computing for practical solutions. In this paper, fog assisted the internet of things based quality of service framework is presented to prevent and protect from COVID-19. It provides real-time processing of users’ health data to predict the COVID-19 infection by observing their symptoms and immediately generates an emergency alert, medical reports, and significant precautions to the user, their guardian as well as doctors/experts. It collects sensitive information from the hospitals/quarantine shelters through the patient IoT devices for taking necessary actions/decisions. Further, it generates an alert message to the government health agencies for controlling the outbreak of chronic illness and for tanking quick and timely actions.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart applications, which are considered essential in today’s computerized world, are improving the quality of life in both urban and rural environments through their efficient services. Cloud-based IoT can communicate with a physical object having various sensors (including IR, accelerometer, and ultrasonic sensors) to access required information. Automobile manufacturers, who explore the features of vehicles and implement them in a way that is useful to their customers, are increasingly interested in IoT applications, as they help to deliver more sophisticated and useful products. Therefore the number of vehicle users is constantly increasing day by day. Traffic congestion is usually caused by two main reasons: (1) increased use of vehicles and (2) lack of proper parking in congested areas. IoT devices are now being used in many real-time applications, such as medical care, agriculture, as well as transportation and other industrial uses, and the emerging technology of the IoT can also offer solutions to many congestion problems, using the Arduino microcontroller and sensors. In some cases, if a vehicle is not parked properly in the parking lot, traffic may be congested due to incorrect information provided by the system. Typically, in a smart system, IoT sensors and radio frequency identification (RFID) are trusted to monitor traffic in a parking area and are also used to check whether a vehicle is in a particular slot. The most important function of RFID tags is to read the information when the vehicle enters the parking area; data storage and update can then be handled automatically at the exit, allocating new space for other vehicles looking for a spot, as requested. Of course, the IoT offers many benefits to improve quality of life. However, smart vehicles make use of much confidential and restricted information to operate their smart system. Due to the smart structure, this data can be easily monitored by third parties. Therefore this chapter addresses three key issues related to automated parking systems, namely: (a) detecting parking availability; (b) traffic reduction; and (c) data security management. To overcome the problems and mitigate the security issue, we have proposed a secure parking detection algorithm called e-VirtualParking to search for a smart parking slot using RFID and Arduino. Furthermore, this chapter also discusses the role of WSN and cryptography in tackling the security issue of secure data management.}

abstract = {With the penetration of smart homes in distribution systems, and due to the effect of their schedulable load on reducing the peak load of the network as well as their comfort index, microgrid's scheduling in the presence of smart homes has become an important issue. In this regard, this paper presents a tri-objective optimization framework for energy management of microgrids in the presence of smart homes and demand response (DR) program. The model is implemented on an 83-bus distribution system with 11 microgrids. The uncertainties of renewable energy resources (RESs) output power and load demand have been taken into account and the objective function is modeled in the form of bi-objective and tri-objective models using the max-min fuzzy method. The objectives include the operating cost, emissions, and peak-to-average ratio (PAR). The results indicate that an increase in DR penetration reduces the PAR and operating costs and leads to a decrease in the customers’ comfort. Besides, the simulation results show that the best results are obtained from the tri-objective model, and in this model, three goals, including the operating costs, emissions, and PAR index are close to their optimal values, while the customers’ comfort index is also satisfactory. Finally, the results show that considering smart homes in the network reduces the operation cost and emission by about 16 % and 17 %, respectively.}

This paper focuses on the intelligent detection of anomalies in warning bells through non-intrusive acoustic monitoring by: (1) introducing a new concept for autonomous monitoring of level crossings; (2) generating and sharing a specific dataset collecting relevant audio signals from publicly available audio recordings; (3) implementing and evaluating a solution combining deep learning and transfer learning for warning bell detection. The results show a high accuracy in detecting anomalies and suggest viability of the approach in real-world applications, especially where network cameras with on-board microphones are installed for multi-purpose level crossing surveillance.}

Infection prevention and control (IPC) is essential to prevent nosocomial infections. This manuscript aims at investigating the current use and role of robots and smart environments on IPC systems in nosocomial settings
Methods
The systematic literature review was performed following the PRISMA statement. Literature was searched for articles published in the period January 2016 to October 2022. Two authors determined the eligibility of the papers, with conflicting decisions being mitigated by a third. Relevant data was then extracted using an ad-hoc extraction table to facilitate the analysis and narrative synthesis.
Results
The search strategy returned 1520 citations and 17 papers were included. This review identified 3 main areas of interest: hand hygiene and personal protective equipment compliance, automatic infection cluster detection and environments cleaning (ie, air quality control, sterilization). This review demonstrates that IPC practices within hospitals mostly do not rely on automation and robotic technology, and few advancements have been made in this field.
Conclusions
Increasing the awareness of healthcare workers on these technologies, through training and involving them in the design process, is essential to accomplish the Health 4.0 transformation. Research priorities should also be considering how to implement similar or more contextualized alternatives for low-income countries.}

To reduce the latency, mobile edge computing has been considered for offloading a part of the workload from mobile devices to nearby edge servers that have sufficient computation resources. Although there has been significant research in the field of mobile edge computing, little attention has been given to understanding the placement of edge servers in smart cities to optimize the mobile edge computing network performance. In this paper, we study the edge server placement problem in mobile edge computing environments for smart cities. First, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective constraint optimization problem that places edge servers in some strategic locations with the objective to make balance the workloads of edge servers and minimize the access delay between the mobile user and edge server. Then, we adopt mixed integer programming to find the optimal solution. Experimental results based on Shanghai Telecom’s base station dataset show that our approach outperforms several representative approaches in terms of access delay and workload balancing.}

The real-time machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions (e.g., in unmanned vehicles and the underpinning infrastructure within the smart city ecosystem) in the intelligent transportation sector, for example, contribute to the potential utility of Tactile Internet in this particular sector (and the broader smart city). In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground) vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, in BEST, blockchain is used to validate EVs’ requests in a distributed manner; thus, ensuring resilience against the single point of failure. The miner nodes are selected to validate the requests on the basis of energy requirements, time of stay, dynamic pricing, and connectivity record, as well as other factors that are crucial for the operator at the time of operation. Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network’s backbone to transfer EVs’ requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the potential deployment of BEST in energy trading.}

However, in real life, users’ reserved consumption requirement loads sometimes deviate significantly from the optimal consumption loads obtained from models, which results in overloaded power systems or even power cuts. To address this issue, an engineering process control strategy has been proposed in this paper to minimize the difference between the optimal and the users’ reserved consumption requirement loads. We proposed an exponential weighted moving average model to predict the load difference in future time slots, and also developed a novel quadratic function based demand response mechanism to adjust the power price for power providers. The demand response mechanism can be used to adjust the price in the future time slots when the predicted demand exceeds the upper or lower boundary. Simulation results indicate that the quadratic function adjustment strategy has excellent performance in a practical power market in Singapore. Compared with the linear function based adjustment method, the proposed quadratic function based adjustment method decreases the adjustment times and standard errors of residuals, and increases the social welfare and power suppliers’ profits under the same boundary conditions. In addition, the performance of the proposed strategy demonstrated its competency in peak-cutting and valley-filling and balancing energy provision with demands.}

When viewed from both, the design and planning standpoint, as well as financial perspective, it reinforces the importance of transit-oriented development in urban environments. This is realized through the analysis of two “smart cases”—one is a proposed Smart Central Business District in Wadala, Mumbai, and the other is part of the 100 Smart Cities supported by the Smart Cities Mission of the Government of India currently being implemented in Bengaluru. Connectivity, mobility, and public transportation are crucial to both these urban developments. Through these two examples this essay reinforces that effective long-term value of mobility and transportation is better realized when they are not viewed as isolated entities. Mobility and transport's value is better captured when placed within the larger ecosystem of Urbanization and Urban Planning. It is imperative that all developments address comprehensive master planning of cities and go beyond the innovative technologies that provide smart infrastructure. This may be accomplished by inclusive design, integrating land use, and transport planning, emphasizing on best practices that minimize a city's carbon footprint and providing services such as energy efficiency, equitable transport, opportunities for livelihood improvement, etc. Only then can true long-term value be realized and our cities achieve ecological sustainability and socioeconomic equilibrium.}

The algorithm trains a regression model on SH-only hours and predicts SH for all other hours with potential DHW use. Data from smart water meters were used to identify hours with only SH. Assessing 13 regression models, an untuned random forest was identified as the best-performing regression model with an acceptable computational cost (median: 7.4s per building). Furthermore, using one year of data from over 2400 single-family homes, it was shown that the best result (median CVRMSE: 0.13) can be obtained using only smart heat meters based regressors, increasing the applicability of the developed method. Furthermore, two tests were implemented, and it was successfully demonstrated that they identify situations where the regressors are distributed differently for hours with SH only and hours with SH and DHW, to identify possible training bias; thus, buildings where the disaggregation is potentially unreliable. Validation against data from three single-family houses with known SH and DHW use confirmed the good performance of the method and that the performance can be estimated without ground truth data via nested cross-validation.}

Conducting regional impact assessments has been a trending research topic, but not without its challenges; especially, foreground data acquisition and temporal dynamics consideration. This study integrates City Information Modeling (CIM) and Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment (DLCA) to develop a new regional carbon impact assessment model, including five parts: goal and scope definition, CIM module, foreground elementary flows analysis, dynamic assessment, and interpretation. In the integration model, CIM is used to extract the geometric and semantic data of the physical elements and geospatial information of built environment. Temporal variations in foreground elementary flows, background inventory datasets, characterization factors, and weighting factors were quantified and involved. A university campus was used to verify the CIM-DLCA integration model, and the impact results were visualized and analyzed from temporal and spatial dynamic perspectives. The influences and sensitivity of dynamic factors were quantified and compared. In addition, the uncertainty issues, data acquisition advantages, and CIM-DLCA integration strategies were discussed. Some valuable future research directions were proposed. This study takes an exploratory step and demonstrates that combining CIM with DLCA is both feasible and operable. This provides a theoretical foundation for intelligent assessment and can be used to promote low-carbon city management.}

Time-of-use tariffs and other methods of time-dependant pricing can be mutually beneficial, realising a cost reduction for both energy companies and customers if the customer responds to the price signalling. However, such tariffs are likely to create positive and negative financial outcomes for individuals because of customer engagement and potential peak shifting capacity. Identifying potential reducers or non-reducers beforehand can optimise a time-of-use programme design, in turn maximising the outcome of the programme. This paper provides a statistical model to identify the characteristics of so-called winners and losers - or households that would be better or worse off under a time-of-use tariff - using only ex ante information. The model's accuracy reaches a reliable level using historical electricity load and basic household characteristics. This accuracy can be further improved if online activity data is available - providing justification for digital interaction and gamification in time-of-use programmes. This paper also publishes a new public dataset of 1423 households in Japan, including historical smart meter data, household characteristics and online activity variables during the time-of-use intervention period in 2017 and 2018.}

abstract = {With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), its uses have been growing enormously in the smart healthcare sector. IoT devices in smart healthcare range from simple wristband devices capable of monitoring the heart rate, sleep pattern, and blood pressure to connected inhalers, ingestible sensors, glucose monitoring, and remote patient monitoring systems. To fulfill the requirements of smart healthcare, these devices need to have reliable connectivity and must comply with the security and privacy regulations. To resolve the connectivity issue in healthcare, 5G networks are being deployed. Implementation of 5G in blockchain-based smart healthcare will bring many advantages such as faster and seamless data transfer of patients’ medical records, real-time monitoring of patients at remote locations, 5G-powered telesurgery, and monitoring of smart IoT devices. This chapter provides a detailed literature review in this field to understand concepts of blockchain in the healthcare industry. Blockchain technology, its mechanisms, 5G technology, and Blockchain 5.0-based smart healthcare are described. Applications of Blockchain 5.0 in healthcare informatics are discussed in detail. A comparative analysis of existing models on electronic health records is performed and one case study is considered to understand the application of blockchain in healthcare. The challenges for 5G-enabled blockchain technology in the healthcare sector are also addressed, which provides an opportunity for researchers to resolve these issues for better performance of the system.}

The paper focuses on two cities, Milan and Seoul, that are internationally considered to have a conscious and tailored approach that lies in the vanguard of this effort. The paper seeks to understand how local authorities govern the sharing economy in order to shape a real sharing city, taking insights from the sharing paradigm concept and looking to the collaborative version of the urban governance paradigm. The paper uses a mixed method approach to develop case studies of the governance models employed. The analysis shows that both cities work along the three dimensions (economic, technological and human) of the sharing paradigm to create a sharing city, with slightly different governance approaches, but both lack institutionalized mechanisms of collaboration. Nevertheless, both are pioneering examples of engagement with the sharing economy. The paper proposes a graphic conceptualization of the two governance models to better highlight their contribution to knowledge.}

Since water systems in the United States are largely run by public sector agencies, this study conducted a national survey with officials in water utilities and agencies to understand what kinds and capabilities of smart green infrastructure are desired for stormwater management. Analyzing the stated preferences of these users using a discrete choice model, our results indicate that these officials are willing to invest more upfront in smart technologies if they lower the costs associated over time with construction, maintenance, and labor. For example, in a typical rain garden, water agencies are willing to pay 12.1% more for construction to reduce maintenance costs by 20% and would pay 12.9% more to add self-irrigating capabilities. Preferences for smart green infrastructure among agencies are also affected by their characteristics. Agencies with large service areas or prior experience with green infrastructure are more likely to adopt smart green infrastructure. These results should assist in the further design and development of smart technologies and green infrastructure in stormwater management.}

Since the reports are conveyed by means of the web, it can be ensured that the legitimate information reaches the authentic individuals. The essence of Internet of Things (IoT) lies in documenting and sharing of crucial information of the network-connected devices via secure service layer. In straightforward terms, IoT is characterized as the wireless connection of devices linked to each other to transmit information for storage and future analysis. IoT gains maximum capacity by utilizing special objects, that is, smart objects that use multiple sensors and actuators that are able to detect parameters in the environment and communicating this to other linked devices through networking capabilities and helps in smart energy management in green cities.}

This study proposes a validation process with five criteria – geographic coverage, origin-destination match, demographic match, distance–duration distributions, and route match – to assess different representativeness aspects of mobility data. The validation process is demonstrated using a crowdsourced data on bicycling in Sydney, Australia, compared with Census Journey to Work data. Results indicate a good overall fit of the sample against the population, but variations across the five criteria. Implications of these variations on the suitable uses for the crowdsourced data are discussed, and current limitations of the proposed approach are identified.}

Modern IoT-based smart agriculture systems use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to gather information from an ecosystem that regulates the quantity of water in agricultural fields could be one of these activities. The WSNs remained a challenge to transfer data to drones for analysis purposes. These are composed of tiny sensory architectures organized together to bring efficiency and scalability features to a network. WSN nodes are controlled and managed by a cluster. It is quite difficult to design an efficient leader election protocol. The computation power, storage space, and energy supply of sensor nodes make them unable to frequently switch to a different cluster. The WSN cluster-head election process requires a lot of energy (evaluation and computational process to select the most appropriate node with the least impact on network fragmentation in energy consumption of selected node). Then it is necessary to formulate a mechanism where WSNs utilize the least energy to coordinate with the remote sensing sources. This study presents a cluster election algorithm using the fuzzy logic inference system. It uses a coordinates system to map network nodes and map them based on prioritized scheduling. Lifetime augmentation in wireless sensor networks has always been of great interest. During data transmission from normal sensor nodes to the base station (sink), excess energy is dissipated. Optimizing the energy dissipation of WSNs through the selection of cluster heads is a powerful way to increase the lifespan. By electing more efficient nodes as cluster heads, the proposed method extends the network's lifetime by reducing the number of unimportant communications between nodes. With the utilization of network resources efficiently, the network's lifetime is extended. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Structure) algorithm and FCA method based on the remaining energy and the number of active nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm utilizes less energy for communication with remote sensory equipment for intelligent agriculture. The performance of the method improved for remaining energy by 9%, the number of active nodes rate by 24%, and indirectly network resource utilization than other states of the art solutions.}

To further clarify local patterns of the spatial effect, this paper subsequently analyses the spatial effects within and between three sub regions in Guangdong. The results show that first, the port city coordination has a habit persistence; second, the digital economy development may be mainly due to the local policy; third, the digital economy has a positive spatial spillover effect on the port city coordination, and the effect will increase over time; forth, the spatial effects in the Pearl River Delta and in the western and eastern areas present different patterns. The quantitative research enriches the port city theory under the new circumstances of digital economy, and brings new insights into regional integration and sustainable development.}

This paper describes the results of an assessment of these equity issues in the context of lower-income areas of Portland, Oregon, based on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research. The study found that by lowering costs and improving service for public transit, ridesharing and active transportation, smart mobility systems could address many of the needs of transportation disadvantaged communities. Similar to those found in other case studies, significant barriers prevent smart mobility technologies from benefiting all communities. For example, lower income survey respondents and respondents of color had significantly lower access to the “smart mobility ecosystem” including bank accounts and credit cards, they rely more heavily on paying cash for transit tickets, had lower access to internet at home and work, and were more likely to reduce data use or cancel cell plans because of cost or data restrictions. Respondents were also concerned about information security, as the impacts of loss or theft, especially identity theft can be devastating for lower-income residents. Since integrating payment systems and relying on internet and cell data for mobile applications is a core feature of smart mobility ecosystem, these disparities are significant barriers to the equitable transition to smart mobility. Policy recommendations to address barriers include expanding free and public WiFi, better real-time transit information, improved training, and language translation for phone applications, among other things.}

In this constantly changing context, what is the most appropriate delimitation of a “neighborhood”, defined as a small and relatively homogeneous area in a certain (and temporary) urban configuration? This paper contributes to the growing literature on the use of data analytic tools in urban studies and neighborhood delimitation in housing sub-markets, exploiting big data on real-estate transactions in England and Wales during a long period of time. The results shed light on the importance of organic urban features and the drawbacks of rigid geometric definitions. They also highlight the importance of the usage of deep Machine Learning (ML) tools such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), alongside with traditional methods. The paper's contribution to urban governance is the suggestion of a smart and dynamic system aimed at defining the most appropriate areas for urban management given a specific period and situation. The suggested framework can be implemented periodically, helping to define homogeneous spatial units (neighborhoods) with large variances among them, allowing for designing urban policies tailored to each one of them.}

Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) can access patients inaccessible to traditional rescue. Just-in-time remote telementoring (RTM) of naïve users to self-care could potentially address challenges in salvaging exsanguination in remote environments.
Methods
An exsanguination self-application task was established in a wilderness location. Three volunteers-initiated distress calls to prompt RPAS precision delivered STOP-THE-BLEED kits, after which a remote mentor directed the volunteers how to self-care.
Results
Limited connectivity prevented video, however each volunteer delivered images and initiated conversation with the mentor pre-RPAS arrival. Thereafter, all subjects were able to unpack and deploy hemorrhage control adjuncts under verbal direction, and to simulate self-application. All subjects were able to successfully apply wound-clamps, tourniquets, and pack wounds although one had insufficient pressure.
Discussion
RPASs can deliver supplies long before human rescuers, and communication connectivity might allow remote mentoring in device application. Further development of technology and self-care paradigms for exsanguination are encouraged.}

In this work, we have studied the driving physical mechanisms, the control of which makes possible operating, in real-time, on the set of band gaps formed in 3D metamaterials based on magneto elastomers. In such acoustic structures, the stiffness of the medium in which unit cells are immersed, as well as the stiffness of the shells surrounding multi-particle cores depend on the induction, B(t), of an external magnetic field. The results obtained are systematized through the qualitative analysis of diversе scenarios for the evolution of the frequency characteristics of the metamaterial and summarized in the following complete physical picture of their dynamics. Variation of the stiffness of the medium/shells changes the wavelength of the shell's surface waves at characteristic frequencies of the core vibrations and, as a result, the level of coupling between the vibration modes of the flexible shells and cores. Consequently, with an increase/decrease in the stiffnesses of the shells/medium, the dispersion surfaces of the entire acoustic system shift up/down along the frequency axis with noticeably different ‘mobilities’ that reversibly lead either to the formation of the band gaps in initially dense frequency spectrum or to the transformation of the band gaps formed into pass bands. The tuning of the set of dispersion surfaces depending on the range of changes in the magnetic field induction can be carried out in dynamic, quasi-stationary, and over-critical regimes when some of the dispersion surfaces degenerate into planes. In anisotropic metamaterials, simultaneously with creating full band gaps, it is possible to create tunable directional band gaps with adjustable frequency and angular widths. The results obtained, within the framework of the idealized discrete mass-spring model, are in good agreement with the data presented in the available experimental works and can be useful in the design of acoustic systems with desirable properties.}

However, although Stakeholder Value Creation (SVC) has been widely explored in sustainable organizations, little attention has been given to SVC in Urban Sustainability. Thus, this research explored the conceptual connections between SVC and Urban Sustainability using a new methodological protocol based on a Sequential Mixed Method Research design. The main findings revealed that the social, economic, and institutional dimensions of Urban Sustainability are fully integrated into the SVC framework; however, better integration of the Environmental Dimension is needed. Therefore, this dyadic phenomenon can currently be classified as unsustainable or weak sustainability. Additionally, the critical characteristics of SVC with Urban Sustainability are: stakeholder engagement; stakeholder cooperation; ethics of capitalism; satisfaction of stakeholders' needs by self-organization and learning capacities, diversity, trust, common meaning, and consensus; sustainable economic development; innovation ecosystems; sharing economy; circular economy; technical resources; social capital; smart sustainable cities; and energy efficiency. Finally, we proposed a framework for Sustainable SVC in Cities, in which SVC is a means for achieving Urban Sustainability and better integrating the environmental dimension. Environmental issues, environmental management, social entrepreneurship, non-human stakeholders, and stakeholder proximity are promising perspectives in the framework.}

abstract = {Smart connected environments as well as digital contents are more and more present in our daily life. The former monitors various data produced by sensors, while the latter contains valuable additional information (e.g., technical data sheets, maintenance reports, employee register). When an event occurs, users generally want to figure out why this event happened. Unfortunately, most information systems in connected environments do not combine sensor network data with document corpora. Consequently, users have to look for an event explanation by querying both complementary sources with different systems, which is indeed very tedious, time consuming and requires a huge compilation effort. In this article, we apply the 5W1H model (”What? Who? Where? When? Why? How?”), commonly used in question-answering, to bridge the gap between sensor networks and document corpora. Our framework entitled ISEE (Information System for Event Explainability) offers an original approach that (i) defines events along four dimensions, (ii) interconnects semantic information coming from sensor networks and documents with 5W1H connections, and (iii) provides to the user a set of preliminary event explanation according to 5W1H answers. A real motivating use-case based on a smart-building is presented and experimental results are discussed.}

Digital twin cities are “digital mirror images” or symbionts of physical cities, and thus, they form a complex adaptive system. Unlike the reductionist practice of urban informatization and digitalization, digital twins are expected to enable human beings to enjoy the complex beauty of the city for the first time, capable to perceive more information of city and deal with more complex urban problems. Some practical misunderstandings have emerged, however, as a result of simple technical stacking, which is not able to solve urban problems from the root of the problem; has biased thinking about digital twin cities, which treats them as technical tools; and has slowed development of digital twin innovative applications. To solve these problems, we need to draw on basic urban theory. On the basis of complex system theory, in this study, we comprehensively analyzed the characteristics and mechanisms of digital twin cities and constructed a system framework for digital twin cities. We further elucidated the digital twin city and deconstructed it from the perspective of system theory into four subsystems: the planning system, infrastructure system, industrial system, and public service facility system. We then analyzed the subsystem rules and changes in the digital twin city, as well as the principles and development trends that conform to the self-organization and self-adaptive laws of the city.}

The reasons may vary but there are two main factors which could be considered as key reasons of water shortages. Fresh water sources in Saudi Arabia are very limited and water desalination plants can't cover the high demand. omeowners should pay higher attention to their faucet’s leakages, not only to reduce water wastage but leakages could also impact their own water expenses in addition to our environment and economy. This project presents two tiers (homeowner / national water company) water shortage solution, we can't control the sources in our technical field, but we can improve water distribution system and develop a water monitoring system for clients. Our prototype consists of two parts. A web site to display statistical information and illustrations of different types of estimates and calculations, for national water employees to make water distribution decision more efficient besides clients to monitor their consumption rate and notice alerts of any leakages. The second part of our project focuses on hardware which well be sensing the water level and consumption then send the readings to the server to be presented on the website. It has an ultrasonic sensor installed in water container to detect water level, also there are three faucets each one is connected to a flow meter sensor to detect amount of dispensed water. All sensors are connected to a microcontroller where we embedded functions contains algorithms to calculate consumption rate, leaks detection and tank level to be sent through the Ethernet shield to the website. Finally, our monitoring approach is inexpensive and will reduce shortages by guiding the water pumping only to most needed districts; also, it will take care of water wastage issue approximately around 40% water can be stored using this developed technology.}

abstract = {The ongoing electrification of mobility comes with the challenge of charging electric vehicles (EVs) sufficiently while charging infrastructure capacities are limited. Smart charging algorithms produce charge plans for individual EVs and aim to assign charging capacities fairly and efficiently between vehicles in a fleet. In practice, EV charging processes follow nonlinear charge profiles such as constant-current, constant-voltage (CCCV). Smart charging must consider charge profiles in order to avoid gaps between charge plans and actual EV power consumption. Generally valid models of charge profiles and their parameters for a diverse set of EVs are not publicly available. In this work we propose a data-driven approach for integrating a machine learning model to predict arbitrary charge profiles into a smart charging algorithm. We train machine learning models with a dataset consisting of charging processes from the workplace gathered in 2016–2018 from a heterogeneous EV fleet of 1001 EVs with 18 unique models. Each charging process includes the time series of charging power. After preprocessing, the dataset contains 10.595 charging processes leading to 1.2 million data points in total. We then compare different machine learning models for charge profile predictions finding that XGBoost yields the most accurate predictions with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 126W and a relative MAE of 0.06. Simulations show that smart charging with the integrated XGBoost model leads to a more effective infrastructure usage with up to 21% more energy charged compared to smart charging without considering charge profiles. Furthermore, an ablation study on regression model features shows the EV’s model is not a necessary attribute for accurate charge profile predictions. However, charging features are required including the number of phases used for charging.}

Here we analyse the effects that charging a large electric vehicle fleet would have on the power network, taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of vehicle use, electricity demand, and network structure. A conditional probability based method is used to model uncontrolled charging demand, and convex optimisation is used to model smart charging. Stochasticity is captured using Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that for Great Britain’s power system, smart charging can simultaneously eliminate the need for additional generation infrastructure required with 100% electric vehicle adoption, while also reducing the percentage of distribution networks which would require reinforcement from 28% to 9%. Discussion is included as to how far these results can be extended to other power systems.}

The popularity of travel route development has resulted in tourists using cities’ infrastructure to enable travel from areas with well-structured accessibility to more inaccessible areas. Despite the importance of the accessibility of travel routes to enhance travel experiences, the tourism literature lacks an understanding of how travel routes should consider not only the physical distance between tourist destinations but also accessibility using mobility within smart tourism cities. Therefore, this research aims to examine the importance of considering accessibility in assessing a travel route. Drawing on the distance decay theory and the concept of the effective tourism exclusion zone (ETEZ), we argue that a travel route can be adopted when every part of the route is accessible in terms of time cost. To achieve the objective, this research adopted a multi-method approach. We explored how much developers consider accessibility when generating a travel route via a case study in study 1. An experiment, study 2, strengthened the results of study 1, presenting cause-and-effect relationships. This study provides theoretical and practical implications for developers of travel routes.}

Using a social practice perspective, we explore how California's Shelter-in-Place (SIP) order impacted household energy activities. To do so, we conducted an online survey of California residents (n = 804) during active SIP restrictions (May 5–18, 2020). We asked respondents about changes to home occupancy patterns and household energy activities (e.g., cooking, electronics usage) due to SIP restrictions, as well as perspectives toward smart energy technologies. Households reported increased midday (10am–3pm) occupancy during SIP, and this increase is related to respondent and household characteristics, such as education and the presence of minors in the home. Examining change in the frequency of household activities during SIP, presence of minors and increased midday occupancy proved important. Finally, we considered relationships to intention to purchase smart home technologies, with the presence of minors and increased activity frequency relating to greater intention to purchase. These findings demonstrate how household activities and occupancy changed under COVID restrictions, how these changes may be related to energy use in the home, and how such COVID-related changes could be shaping perspectives toward smart home technology, potentially providing insight into future impacts on household practices and electricity demand.}

Meanwhile, the value-added of the projects is not easy to evaluate due to the non-market nature of the public services provided. This study intends to investigate the attitudes of potential users of a Crowd Management System (CMS) to help with the decision-making on smart city projects. The CMS studied in this paper is applied in large-scale events to enable safe and efficient dissipation of event participants as one of the pilot Smart City projects in Hong Kong. It does so by providing real-time information on public transport for their return journeys when a large number of participants all finish their activities within a short time span. Reducing injuries of pedestrians can be achieved in major gatherings to improve safety. This paper presents an experimental analysis of users’ attitudes towards the CMS with the Contingent Valuation (CV) method. A marathon event in Hong Kong was chosen for an on-the-spot survey of actual users as part of an experimental study. Subsequently a similar survey was carried out off-site among marathon runners not participating in that event (as a control group) for data reliability comparison. The Willingness-to-Pay value is also derived from the pooled samples to evaluate users’ attitudes. Besides, the results indicate that runners’ perceived usefulness and online payment habit significantly influence the stated Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) for the CMS in question.}

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are considered as an enabling communication technology for effective SG management. How well the target region is covered by a WSN indicates the service quality of the relevant implementation. Since effective monitoring is key to exploiting the benefits of the SG, maintaining the desired coverage level is critical in WSN for SG applications. However, some uncovered regions (coverage holes) might emerge due to several reasons such as improper localization or sensor malfunctioning. In this paper, we propose using a mobile sensor to cover such blind regions in a timely and hence energy-efficient way. First, we present a novel 0–1 mixed integer programming model without restrictive assumptions about the mobility pattern to find the shortest trajectory for the mobile sensor. Then we show that the problem is NP-hard with a polynomial reduction to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Consequently, we present an optimization-based heuristic, two heuristic-based algorithms, and a hybrid algorithm. We show that our heuristics are efficient as they find high quality solutions in a few seconds. We also observe that assumptions about the starting point of the tour and the potential set of stops significantly affect the final tour’s length.}

abstract = {Various technologies for harvesting energy have emerged to substitute the conventional energy sources. The environmental issues, such as global warming, greenhouse effect and others, associated with non-renewable energy sources have instigated the development of technologies to harness power from vibration, solar, and thermal energy. The energy can be converted to power using small electronic devices. Vibration is a common energy source in our surroundings and can be transformed into electrical energy using different transduction mechanisms: electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and triboelectric generators. A piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) are two electrical power harvesting devices for converting the vibration from the surrounding to electrical energy. Several eco-friendly and biocompatible components have been employed in the fabrication of the PENG and TENG for multiple application including chemical sensors, pressure sensors, and biomedical appliances. This review elaborates the application of different smart materials as the TENG and PENG for the conversion of mechanical or vibrational energy to electrical energy for varied applications.}

abstract = {Data literacy is gaining importance as a general skill that all citizens should possess in an increasingly data-driven society. As such there is interest in how it can be taught in schools. However, the majority of teaching focuses on small, personally collected data which is easier for students to relate to. This does not give the students the breadth of experience they need for dealing with the larger, complex data that is collected at scale and used to drive the intelligent systems that people engage with during work and leisure time. Neither does it prepare them for future jobs, which increasingly require skills for critically querying and deriving insights from data. This paper addresses this gap by trialling a method for teaching from complex data, collected through a smart city project. The main contribution is to show that existing data principles from the literature can be adapted to design data literacy activities that help pupils understand complex data collected by others and form interesting questions and hypotheses about it. It also demonstrates how smart city ideas and concepts can be brought to life in the classroom. The Urban Data School study was carried out over two years in three primary and secondary schools in England, using smart city datasets. Three teachers took part, providing access to different age groups, subject areas, and class types. This resulted in four distinctive field studies, with 67 students aged between 10–14 years, each lasting a few weeks within the two year period. The studies provide evidence that when engaging with data that has not been personally collected, activities designed to give the experience of collecting the data can help in critiquing it.}

Generally referred to by the literature as occupant-centric controls (OCC), a subset of these technologies focus on sensing and/or managing systems based on occupant feedback, preferences, or perceptions. While past reviews have documented OCC applications in commercial and industrial building types, residential applications have been rarely distinguished as their own unique application of OCC. This article critically reviews the state-of-the art research in both simulation and field-experiments – neither of which fully align with existing commercial smart home OCC technologies. Study demographics, location, building systems, implementation objectives, and experimental methods are compared and critiqued to understand where research, through simulation and field-experiments, needs to be focused. Key identified shortcomings include: low diversity of studied building systems, overly simplified simulation scenarios, short durations of field testing, inappropriate choices of occupant types, and non-standardized implementation performance metrics and test cases. Furthermore, innovation is hampered by limited standardization in technology communication protocols, the inability to integrate systems from different manufacturers, missing technology transfer protocols to translate researched implementations into commercial applications, and a lack of vision and planning for future policies and technologies that enable effective and comprehensive smart home implementations.}

One of the leading causes of climate change is the emissions of harmful gases, particularly CO2. In 1997, the Kyoto protocol was signed by 192 countries, creating a system that monetizes CO2 emissions with an aim to control them. Most countries signed a carbon trading scheme, but the scheme fell short of its goals due to manipulation, lack of integrity, and multiple other challenges. This work presents an improved blockchain-based approach to achieve the objective of monitoring the reduction of carbon emissions. Blockchain's distinct features such as security, immutability, transparency, traceability, and trust, make it a robust and reliable solution for the carbon trading market. Previous Blockchain-based proposals were not comprehensive, practical, applicable, or efficient enough to form an effective solution. This research addresses the current gaps and proposes a comprehensive three-stage hierarchical blockchain framework that employs smart contracts in Blockchain of Things (BoT) to ensure integrity in the system and reach fair trade status that favors the environment over companies' cost reductions and profit-making. The result is an optimized carbon emission trading framework, fully transparent with automated trading and control mechanisms.}

GNSs-MTX@CD-Pol NPs possess excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and dual FI/CT imaging properties, which are attributed to the strong NIR absorption and high atomic number of gold elements. Moreover, it is demonstrated that GNSs-MTX@CD-Pol NPs are effectively responding to tumor acidity. With the PTT, the growth of cancer cells can be remarkably ablated in vitro. The results of the cell cycle, apoptosis, real-time PCR, and western blotting test on MDA-MB-231 cells revealed antitumor effect of GNSs-MTX@CD-Pol NPs caused by combination Chemo-Photothermal Therapy. Based on their high stability and excellent biocompatibility, GNSs-MTX@CD-Pol NPs have great potential for the treatment of various types of tumors.}

This means steering measures to ensure that the benefits of innovative technologies contribute towards a sustainable mobility system and avoiding the risk of increased attractiveness and use of private motorized transport, such as private cars. New technologies, largely accelerated by the ongoing digital transformation in mobility, have the potential to disrupt existing market structures entirely. Existing legal and regulatory frameworks may not be prepared for accommodating new and innovative services. It is therefore critical to gain more a thorough understanding of how new smart mobility services need and may be governed through regulatory frameworks. This paper looks into approaches and experiences in Finland and Norway, focusing on the role the public authorities have adopted in the two countries with respect to smart mobility solutions and emerging Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offerings in particular. The paper first presents a typology of new mobility services and a review of emerging services. An analysis is then presented of the interplay between the government as a regulatory authority and the new MaaS initiatives, drawing on the frameworks by Docherty et al. (2018) on elements and challenges related to the transition to smarter mobility. Our main finding is that the services available on the street and challenges faced by the authorities in the short run are surprisingly similar, but that the toolbox available and the long run challenges may prove more diverging.}

To provide the best facility to the air travelers, most of the airports have enhanced their infrastructure using smart automation and Cloud Services (CS), etc. which play a significant role in increasing the revenue of the aviation industry. As the use of digital technology at airports is increasing, they are becoming progressively vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches. The data collected by the airports is stored in specialized cloud databases, which ensures the availability of the data at any time. However, cloud servers have been compromised several times which leads to a lack of trust by the consumers. To meet the privacy and security objectives of the data collected at the airports and stored in the cloud, this research proposes a Searchable Encryption (SE) scheme based on Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE). The proposed scheme allows users to search on the encrypted data stored in the cloud hence enhancing the usability of the encrypted data. In this paper, a Single Keyword Searchable Encryption (SKSE) scheme is presented which is implemented using Paillier Cryptosystem. The proposed scheme comprises of two variants (a) Secure SKSE (b) Efficient SKSE. The Secure SKSE scheme exploits the probabilistic properties of the Paillier cryptosystem, whereas, the Efficient SKSE scheme is lightweight as it is based on the deterministic properties of the Paillier cryptosystem. Both variants of SKSE scheme are deployed on a public cloud platform “Contabo” and tested on the real-world aviation data to assess the performance of both approaches. The security and performance analysis illustrates that the proposed Secure SKSE maintains a high-security level by providing probabilistic encryption and trapdoors. On the other hand, the Efficient SKSE is 84 times faster in terms of performance.}

This study proposes the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to address the spatial autocorrelation and nonstationarity of metro ridership at the station level. Different from the Euclidean distance (ED) commonly used in the traditional GWR, the Minkowski distance (MD) metric is introduced into the study to measure geographical distance and improve weighting matrix calibrations. This study provides useful insights in adaptive model settings based on selections of spatial range and distance metric parameters. A case study is conducted in Nanjing, China, by utilizing large-scale metro smart card data and POI data obtained from the Gaode map by a web crawler written in Python. The comparative analysis indicates that MD-GWR achieves better goodness-of-fit than the global ordinary least squares (OLS) and traditional GWR in the case of modeling metro ridership. Finally, this study quantifies the impacts of built environment at both spatial and temporal scales, under the proposed modeling structure. We examine the existence of job-housing separation and corresponding areas in spatio-temporal ridership analysis. Impacts of non-commuting activities and intermodal connection on boarding and alighting ridership differ in spatial and temporal ranges. The proposed modeling structure promotes modeling precision and thus enhances the understanding of the relationship between station-level ridership and surrounding built environment, which can provide useful guidance for planning departments and transit agencies to implement targeted policies and create accessible, livable and vibrant communities.}

An adaptive reference value has been designed and used instead of a constant reference signal to improve the system's steady-state performance, e.g., total harmonic distortion (THD), peak value, and effective value in the voltage control mode. The presented adaptive reference is changed based on the error between the reference signal and the output voltage signal to tend the error to zero. Compared to the classical backstepping controllers, the reference signal is pursued with a fast response and a low steady-state of loads alternations. To demonstrate the efficiency, authenticity, and compatibility of the proposed control strategy, offline digital time-domain simulation studies are carried out on a master-slave organized inverter-based microgrids in various load variations like linear and nonlinear loads in MATLAB/Simulink software environment. The obtained results are compared with previously reported techniques. Moreover, the obtained simulation results are verified by performing laboratory-based experimental tests based on digital signal processing (DSP), which validate the proposed control strategy's accuracy, authenticity, and effectiveness under different conditions.}

In the present study, the significant techniques of smart manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing, and additive manufacturing are combined to make a unified term of sustainable and smart additive manufacturing (SSAM). The paper aims to develop framework by combining big data analytics, additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart manufacturing technologies which is beneficial to the additive manufacturing enterprises.

Finally, an application scenario of the additive manufacturing industry was presented to demonstrate the proposed framework. The proposed framework is implemented on the BOL stage of product lifecycle due to limitation of available resources and for fabrication of AlSi10Mg alloy components by using selective laser melting (SLM) technique of AM. The results indicate that energy consumption and quality of the product are adequately controlled which is helpful for smart sustainable manufacturing, emission reduction, and cleaner production.}

Since, some of the environmental issues may be addressed by recycling thermoplastic reinforced with thermosetting polymers followed by 3D printing route, a case study was performed in which a composite prepared by blending of recycled thermoplastic material and thermosetting polymer i.e., polyamide6 (PA6) and bakelite respectively, was investigated for rheological, mechanical and thermal properties of the composite material. The results of case study suggest that as regards to rheological property, melt flow index (MFI) 30.947 g/10 min with 15% by weight bakelite reinforcement in PA6 was attained for ensuring recyclability of composite matrix. The selected proportion is acceptable from mechanical strength view point (Young’s modulus: 817.20 MPa). The corresponding heat capacity for the selected composition/ proportion was observed as 17.01 J/g. The proposed composite material can be used on fused deposition modeling (FDM) setup for 3D printing of structural components (like: heat sensors, heat retarding tiles etc.).}

Effective integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into the design of smart homes is an actively growing area in the construction industry. The ever-increasing demand and cost of energy require a smart solution in the design stage by the construction industry. It is possible to reduce household energy consumption by utilizing energy-efficient sustainable materials in infrastructure construction. Building Information Modeling (BIM) can provide a solution to effectively manage energy. The integration of the IoT further improves the design of comfortable smart homes by utilizing natural lighting. BIM aids in determining energy efficiency and making decisions by presenting the user with several design options via the 6D method. The present study considered a sample home design following the National Building Code (NBC) and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standards for implementation. Natural lighting analysis is carried out with the tool Insight 360 to analyze the energy consumption of the building. Some of the outputs obtained from the analysis are wall-to-window ratio (WWR), window shades, design options for window glass, energy use intensity (EUI), and annual energy cost (AEC). The results of the outputs are compared to find the energy-efficient optimum natural lighting of the proposed building. The lesser EUI (16%–21%) and AEC (23%–28%) are identified with the utilization of low emissivity glass in window panels compared with other types of glass. The proposed IoT-based BIM integration model proves that the effective utilization of natural lighting reduces overall household energy consumption.}

In such a context, this goal becomes essential to achieve sustainable development of territory and human activities. This paper discusses a theoretical model and its practical application which relates energy consumption and solar energy supply with urban parameters, challenging the concept of energy efficient city. In contrast with the dominant approaches to energy efficiency at local scale, the energy efficient city reflects a cellular model of self-reliant city based on the redesign of existing urban areas and the planning of new urban expansions conducted with the effort to reduce electricity use and promote widespread integration of solar energy and smart grids. The application of this model aims to improve the global energy performance of city making previsions of energy consumption patterns and solar energy potential, in new strategic expansion areas and exiting ones. In turn, a detailed framework of guidelines for urban planning is presented to support the optimization, adaptation and development of energy efficient cities. The promotion of adequate urban planning practices is a key point to create opportunities for both reducing energy consumption and supporting the integration of solar energy systems and smart grid technologies in urban context.}

This study delves into the spatial dimension of energy consumption, focusing on urban areas' physical and functional parameters. The goal is to define a model to support decision-making for formulating public policies that contribute to promoting strategies for energy efficiency. The theoretical rationale is to consider energy consumption as a space-based process that needs to be legible for policymakers and planners. The spatialization of energy consumption relating to urban morphologies, densities and uses is pivotal to understanding the territory as a multidimensional system in transition. The methodology addresses a Geographic Information System-based approach that delimits morphological patterns to classify urban areas according to energy consumption zoning. The “morpho-energetic analysis” presented is an approach that could provide policy guidance to decision-makers and planners. Using a municipality in Portugal as case study, results indicate that urban morphology permits identifying where and how energy efficiency can be improved, providing a strategic framework to support the definition of energy policies, which leads to the construction of regulations and urban planning measures for dealing with the sustainable energy transition in cities.}

abstract = {Providing a comprehensive view of the city operation and offering useful metrics for decision-making is a well-known challenge for urban risk-analysis systems. Existing systems are, in many cases, generalizations of previous domain specific tools/methodologies that may not cover all urban interdependencies and makes it difficult to have homogeneous indicators. In order to overcome this limitation while seeking for effective support to decision makers, this article introduces a novel hybrid simulation framework for risk mitigation. The framework is built on a proposed city concept that considers the urban space as a Complex Adaptive System composed by interconnected Critical Infrastructures. In this concept, a Social System, which models daily patterns and social interactions of the citizens in the Urban Landscape, drives the CIs demand to configure the full city picture. The framework's hybrid design integrates agent-based and network-based modeling by breaking down city agents into system-dependent subagents, to enable both inter and intra-system interaction simulation, respectively. A layered structure of indicators at different aggregation levels is also developed, to ensure that decisions are not only data-driven but also explainable. Therefore, the proposed simulation framework can serve as a DSS tool that allows the quantitative analysis of the impact of threats at different levels. First, system-level metrics can be used to get a broad view on the city resilience. Then, agent-level metrics back those figures and provide better explainability. On implementation, the proposed framework enables component reusability (for eased coding), simulation federation (enabling the integration of existing system-oriented simulators), discrete simulation in accelerated time (for rapid scenario simulation) and decision-oriented visualization (for informed outputs). The system built under the proposed approach facilitates to simulate various risk mitigation strategies for a scenario under analysis, allowing decision-makers to foresee potential outcomes. A case study has been deployed on a framework prototype to demonstrate how the DSS can be used in real-world situations, specifically combining cyber hazards over health and traffic infrastructures. The proposal aims at pushing the boundaries of urban city simulation towards more real, intelligent, and automated frameworks.}

abstract = {A distinct wave of self-proclaimed ‘eco-cities’ has emerged over the past two decades, claiming to pioneer sustainable urban solutions to a range of environmental challenges by building new cities from scratch. Despite little evidence that such projects succeed in achieving their green aims, a burgeoning awards industry is recognizing eco-city developers for their leadership in sustainable urbanism. In this article, we examine Forest City, a new eco-city project in Malaysia, to make three main arguments. First, we introduce the range of awards Forest City has won, showing how the developer uses these awards to generate publicity and push back against criticism. Second, we outline the damage that Forest City has caused to nearby ecosystems and livelihoods to demonstrate the blind spots of awards committees. Third, we argue that awards for projects like Forest City suggest a troubling conflation of sustainable design with spectacular eco-cities, lending credibility to unproven projects that are far from realizing their stated goals. We suggest that the urban awards industry deserves greater critical scholarly attention regarding the ways in which awards-granting agencies and urban prizes contribute to the circulation of normative eco-city ideals, which are often profit-driven and highly damaging to local environments and social sustainability.}
