abstract = {Despite the theoretical benefits of utilizing technology to support resilience in smart cities, however there is a need to validate its application on heritage buildings and communities to transform the traditional preservation process into a smart monitoring and maintenance process. Thus, this paper aims to develop and validate a novel framework for resilient preservation that integrates resilience with innovative technology then design a smart solution to work as a tool for transforming heritage buildings into smart buildings. To achieve this, number of research methods have been adopted: Firstly, literature of theoretical background, to identify the value of heritage buildings and the characteristics of resilience technique to preserve smart buildings. Secondly, defining the roles of specific technologies to practically implement resilience by providing the results of an interview survey of the observations of 54 professionals working in related fields. Thirdly, propose a solution for smart monitoring of several factors that influence degradation of heritage buildings and increase the efficiency and adaptability of the resilient preservation process, through the help of an extensive discussions that were held with staff members of the second-largest software company worldwide. The results are a novel validated framework for smart heritage buildings that integrate resilience technique with historic building information modeling and internet of things to work as a tool for the practical implementation of resilience in the preservation process, then applying the framework attributes to work as inputs for the proposed solution to maximize the benefits and automatically apply the theories with high accuracy and long-term efficiency.}

However, in the analysis of mobility patterns, the use of only one data source (i.e., road sensors) without considering other contextual data sources, limits the understanding of the process. To address this gap, we propose a pipeline that integrates multiple data sources, providing valuable information for pattern extraction, mainly based on vehicle mobility behavior and provenance. Our research also highlights the critical role of selecting the appropriate normalization algorithm to scale input features from heterogeneous data sources, which has not received sufficient attention in the literature. We conducted our analysis using data from four License Plate Recognition (LPR) cameras, spanning nine months, and incorporating several databases that include provenance, gross income, and holiday information, resulting in a dataset of over 50,000 vehicles. Using this data and our clustering pipeline, we identified various traffic patterns among residents and visitors in a rural touristic area. Our findings assist data analysts in choosing algorithms for analyzing heterogeneous datasets. Moreover, policymakers could use our results to adjust the resources, such as new parking zones.}

abstract = {With the increase in urbanization in modern cities, major roads and highways are built nearer to residential areas. Due to some inconsiderate driving behaviors, like accelerating and racing; illegal tailpipe modification; and aging vehicles, traffic noise is creating a nuisance to residents staying near highway, especially during late night or early morning. Unfortunately, these noisy vehicles often cannot be caught on the spot, unless traffic police is stationed at a certain place with their sound pressure level meter and camera. This latter approach is often not sustainable and incurs costly manpower resource. An automatic Noisy vehicle surveillance Camera (NoivelCam) system, which can be deployed in overhead structure across major highways near residential buildings, is being designed to capture noise level generated from passing vehicles and triggers a high-speed camera to capture the number plate of offending vehicles that exceed a certain noise level. Therefore, the proposed system provides time stamp, number plate, sound pressure level, audio, and video evidence of the offending vehicle and a means to issue an inspection notice to the owner of the vehicle. This paper provides a description of the NoivelCam, and some of its features to pinpoint noise generated from passing vehicle. An initial in-situ deployment of this system has been carried out in Singapore to test out its effectiveness in monitoring vehicle noise pressure level in a single lane on a highway.}

abstract = {The interaction between society and the environment is everchanging, in turn leading to changes in both environmental and social systems. Population growth, namely, is far from homogeneous: there has been a shift in the centre of gravity of the population’s living places, with almost half of the world’s population living near coasts. This it leads to significant changes in both land use and landscape characteristics. Among the sensitive areas of the planet, the Mediterranean is one of the most critical because of the high environmental load generated by the settlement weight of urban and metropolitan systems, by infrastructures, and by industries along on its coasts. If we consider the state of this basin, we can say that it is currently under pressures because of growing urbanization, growing population, productive activities, and tourism. Among the problems, the strong disparities between North and South of countries leads to an impending risk, namely that the use of advanced technologies and of smart governance methods could be limited to the North of Mediterranean Sea with the slightest chance of reducing the pressures on the whole basin. Mobility represents a primary sector in the evolution processes of man-made systems, and the implementation of new mobility systems is a challenge in the direction of the efficiency of urban and metropolitan structures, and of ever-increasing sustainability of transport services. Territorial load, environmental condition, and climate change are closely related. Hence control and innovative management of the functional parts of the metropolitan systems (mobility, dwellings, production, tourism, and so on) are a necessity, and a technical and organizational challenge that the countries of the northern and southern coasts will have to tackle with great determination and attention. The paper explores the issue of the metropolitan mobility within the Mediterranean territorial system, analysing its current situation and its potential evolution. Quantitative data are correlated with the contribution of the European cooperation policies. The first part is a recognition of the state of metropolitan mobility in the main cities of Mediterranean basin. The paper continues deepening the concept of smart city and the main Euro-Mediterranean policies directed at public mobility. The lesson from the paper is that a better use of public mobility can improve the state of Mediterranean cities and it can help the achieving of more sustainable environmental conditions.}

In this sense, the investigation has advanced an integrative conceptual model by studying the antecedents of electric car sharing adoption, based on two general attitudinal influencers environmental consciousness and technology embracement and two mediators – the perceived benefits of car sharing and the importance attached to smart mobility. The empirical undertaking relied on a questionnaire-based survey with 399 Romanian respondents from generation Z. According to the findings, the proposed model has confirmed a substantive effect of environmental consciousness and technology embracement on smart mobility and a less powerful effect of the latter on electric car sharing adoption. The results have both theoretical and practical implications given that achieving a paradigm shift towards smart mobility and electric car sharing adoption requires substantial changes in social habits and orientation, as well as attitudinal transformations in terms of environmental and technological dynamics. The study originally contributes to the extant literature by interrelating different attitudinal factors as relevant drivers for car sharing adoption within a comprehensive framework. From a practical perspective, while focusing on electric car sharing from a context-driven angle, the investigation adds knowledge about the behavioral intentions for car sharing usage in a country where the phenomenon is yet to develop. In this sense, the findings support providers of car sharing services and authorities in their promotion strategies regarding car sharing services as a form of sustainable transportation apposite for smart cities.}

Critical findings are summarized for each part, i.e., the advances and trends in physical energy generation, transmission, consumption, and storage processes of cities for energy interventions, the cyber process chain of energy sensing, modeling, forecasting, scheduling, coordinating, and adapting for enhancing the “smartness” of power and urban energy systems, and the social energy processes of understanding, protecting, engaging, and governing human to be a new smartness dimension. Second, the process-based framework provides insights on the design and implementation of SG and SUES for engineers, planners, and policymakers, such as optimizing the system performance by upgrading individual processes and exploring new links among identified physical, cyber, and social energy processes. The upscaling barriers and strategies of sustainable energy technologies in the development and deployment stages are also summarized to scale up sustainable energy processes to a higher level. Finally, future research directions are envisioned, including developing data markets, privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics for urban-scale energy modeling, refining policy and standards for safety, privacy, cybersecurity, and interoperability issues, assessing technology maturity and energy system success factors, and removing regulatory and structural barriers.}

This research study focuses on enhancing the healthcare system using a cognitive-based cloud framework. We employ the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect patient data and utilize a cloud-based cognitive framework for real-time patient monitoring. We aim to achieve cost-effective and high-quality healthcare. Deep learning techniques are applied to assess the health status and obtain experimental results. Specifically, we conduct pathology detection and classification using Electroencephalography (EEG). Multimodal patient health data, including EEG signals, are recorded using an EEG sensor. Intelligent IoT devices transmit the EEG signals from patients to the cloud, where they undergo processing and are forwarded to a cognitive module. The system tracks various sensor readings, such as facial expressions, speech, EEG, movements, and gestures, to determine the patient's condition. To classify the EEG signals as pathological or normal, our proposed method employs a Transfer Learning-based Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods on the same dataset, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95.13% in identifying EEG pathologies.}

Whilst sustainability is often used to justify the need for smart cities, smart cities are often undermined by the neoliberal logics of digital governance. Moreover, because the intersection of digital technologies and society is a negotiated one, smart solutions often fail to provide adequate solutions to social problems. This is especially true when smart solutions are used to augment or replace hitherto human-centred processes, like caregiving. Parallel regimes of sustainability are an outcome of these failures. Drawing on an analysis of a trial of in-home smart eldercare technologies in Singapore, four binary pairings – public-private, individual-community, remote-proximate and passive-active – are used to define the parallel regimes of sustainable eldercare that emerged in response to smart technologies. To conclude, the need for urban paradigms to evolve in conversation with society is emphasised.}

The findings suggest that institutional context does indeed affect how smart governance actualizes in cities. These empirical insights result in a heuristic framework for understanding smart governance in diverse urban environments. The framework exhibits a multi-layered influencing mechanism: institutions co-existing on multiple spatial scales interact and modify – reinforce or dissolve – each other's impact on smart governance. This study opens the door to a different approach to understanding smart governance and sheds new light on how this is interrelated with the institutional context.}

Traffic congestion and air pollution continue to be serious concerns, especially in large cities, and going forward, this is not sustainable. Urban transport around the world is facing challenges, such as air pollution and inefficient use of resources, that often inhibit economic development. Simply building more roads cannot address such challenges. There is a need to integrate the urban infrastructure through smart connectivity. Smart mobility, as a vital cornerstone of a smart city, will potentially reduce traffic jams, commuting times, and road crashes and create an opportunity for passengers to customize their journeys. In fact, planning smart mobility solutions is among the top challenges for large cities around the world. It involves a set of deliberate actions backed by sophisticated technologies. The different elements and dimensions that characterize smart mobility are investigated to depict the overall picture surrounding the smart mobility domain. Additionally, the trends, opportunities, and threats inherent to smart mobility are addressed. There are four segments of smart mobility that are highlighted in this paper: intelligent transport systems, open data, big data analytics, and citizen engagement. These segments are all inter-related and play a crucial role in the successful implementation of smart mobility.}

Moreover, the impact of industrial waste heat on the DH supply was also assessed. In the reference year (2013) two out of four interconnections proved to be economically viable. The results for the future energy system (2029) showed that interconnecting geographically distributed DH grids reduces primary energy supply by 9.5%, CO2 emissions by 11.1% and total system costs by 6.3%. Inclusion of industrial waste heat in the fully interconnected DH grid reduced primary energy supply for an additional 3%, CO2 emissions for an additional 2.2% and total system costs for an additional 1.3%. The case of the future energy supply system with interconnected DH grids and installed industrial waste heat recuperation results in the lowest primary energy demand, emissions and costs. Finally, the benefits of the interconnected DH grid, in terms of system flexibility, CO2 emissions, total costs and energy efficiency, proved to be much greater in the future energy system.}

One of the fundamental building components of AMI for information sharing is wireless communication networks. Wireless communication networks are prone to a variety of security threats, which causes issues when developing the AMI system in smart city projects. Confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy are the primary criteria of cyber-physical systems such as AMI. To meet the needs of cyber-physical systems, we worked on a wireless communication protocol that solves data transmission dependability and data security while consuming little power and overhead. We proposed a novel Secure and Reliable AMI (SRAMI) protocol in this paper using a lightweight cryptographic technique and trust-based mechanism for reliability for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-assisted AMI. The trust-based approach presents a trustworthy data transfer technique between two communicating AMI entities. In this regard, the next-hop is chosen based on trust-evaluation characteristics such as energy expenditure, geographical distance, and bandwidth availability. Furthermore, a lightweight hybrid approach based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is introduced to meet the data integrity and privacy requirements in the AMI network. SRAMI's performance was improved compared to state-of-the-art protocols in terms of throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), average energy consumption, latency and communication overhead.}

These substations are placed near by road in order to immediately respond to nearby crimes. We attempt to optimize the average minimum distance to a crime from its nearest substation. This distance is found by the underlying road network. We are locating these substations in an infinitely large set of points in the given region. Case study has been done on real-world crime data from Lahore, Pakistan to show the efficiency of these methods. We also explored what are trends in crime data with respect to years, seasons and day/night and where to place substations accordingly. We evaluated the placement of substation by our model through comparing the average time taken to report to a crime against random substations placed within the same area.

Since building is the key facility in the city, smart building (SB) plays an important role in smart city. With the development of new AI technology and expansion of clients’ demand, smart buildings spread gradually in cities. Thereby, amounts of edge devices are accessed to the City IoT leading to the computation resources explosion and security issues in the smart environment. Here, we study the security of the data sensing in smart IoT and propose a novel data aggregation scheme, named Fog-based Anonymous Reward Data Aggregation scheme (later referred to as FARDA), to preserve the user privacy for developing a sustainable City IoT system. Specifically, this proposed scheme merges the AI based blockchain for enhancing the security on the edge devices and fog computing for the energy sustainability. More, FADRA attracts mobile sensing users and fog nodes by an anonymous reward mechanism in the blockchain framework. The framework leverages the provable Monero’s blockchain to endow two privacy requirements: (i) unlinkability between the payer’s address and the payee’s address and (ii) the non-traceability of the transaction sources. Moreover, two PKCs in the blockchain guarantee the benefits of sensing data participants theoretically. We verify the security properties of FARDA in theory and evaluate the efficiency for data sensing in smart environments on smartphones by experiments. Our study paves a way for broad researches on sustainable IoT in smart scenarios.}

Instead, they focus their energy on stringing together the range of mobility options available to them, optimizing for cost, time, and comfort. The new era of mobility management will align policymaker concerns with the needs of their constituencies in order to develop a transportation network that allows public and private entities to share data, develop new payment and tracking systems, foster dynamic routing services, and provide better user interfaces.}

That scholarship views platformisation as the latest incarnation of neoliberal urbanism, with the profit-maximising tendencies of the private sector driving the proliferation of platforms throughout everyday life. Notwithstanding, there remains a need to consider alternative models of platformisation. Drawing on 31 interviews with architects of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, we consider the state-led platformisation of financial services. We argue that state-led platformisation can open up marketplaces to new forms of innovation, customer value creation, and competition through the creation of data ecosystems that are built on openness, trust and transparency. This flattens the distinctions between regulator and regulated, and between competitor and collaborator, and foregrounds the role of platforms in driving the transformation of industry.}

We think that the topic of SMART solutions should not be a significant priority only for large cities. For this reason, we decided to analyze the needs of small cities in terms of implementing SMART solutions, identify problems as well as requirements to speed up this process. We collected data for our analysis in the Slovak Republic, which with its structure of cities and municipalities is a suitable candidate for such research. In the process of data collection, we addressed request for information more than 2,744 small towns and municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants, while 547 representatives of towns and municipalities responded to the questionnaire. The results of the research show an interesting and unambiguous finding. Small towns and rural areas also want to be SMART.

In response, this paper investigates the discursive frames shaping life in the Singaporean Smart Nation, which is used as an example of an intelligent technology-focused urban environment, and explores the links between this rhetoric and the quality of life of inhabitants. First, ongoing research is outlined, using the Foucault-inspired obliged freedom framework for qualitative discourse analysis, to tease out the expectations created of citizens by the smart nation project. Through interviews, an online survey, and government documents, this work demonstrates the individualizing and neoliberal nature of the rhetoric that reaches inhabitants. This highlights the potential of the techno-social process of development, creating new and deeper means of ensuring compliance in smart cities, which may not be beneficial to the populations within. It then considers how these expectations could interact with the wellbeing of the inhabitants to question the current form that the digitally enhanced urban environment is taking in Singapore, and sets up avenues for future research.}

The abuse detection model is constructed in the light of the decision tree learning-iterative dichotomise 3(DTL-ID3) and is assembled by utilizing the gathered data based on anomaly detection model executed by one class-support vector machine(OC-SVM). In recent years, people have paid more attention to ID/intrusion prevention system (IDS / IPS), which is closely related to the protection and utilization of system management. A few machine-learning standards including neural system, direct hereditary programming, and advanced support vector machines(ASVMs), Bayesian system, multivariate versatile relapse splines, fluffy derivation systems(FIS) and other analogical systems have been researched for the outline of intrusion detection system. In this paper, we build up an amalgam method based on DTL-ID3 and OC-SVM(A-DT and SVM) and evaluate the performance of the projected methodology by using a specific dataset and a crossover method in order to enhance the accuracy of IDS/IPS when contrasted with a singular support vector machine.}

To this end, we used a survey design and collected data from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou. A total of 500 responses from different industries and companies were obtained and then empirically analyzed using ridge regression and intermediary effect models. We found that the perception of smart governance enhances investment due to strong governance and abundant business opportunities. Natural sustainability attracts investment directly because, when cities become smart, they tend to improve their sustainability and attract talent and capital inflows. This external participation has a direct impact on enterprise investment because it creates more business opportunities. An improved social credit system represents the comprehensive progress of the business environment and positively mediates smart governance and investment. This is the first study to combine the key elements of smart governance, the development stage of smart governance, and various dimensions of the business environment to analyze the influence of smart governance perceptions on commercial investments.}

Just like 19th century industrial innovations, the new tools of the information age appear to be largely centripetal forces that boost the demand for urban proximity. But also like earlier industrial innovations, information technology has also disrupted shared urban spaces, such as downtown commercial districts that have lost customers to electronic vendors. Both this essay, and this special issue of Land Use Policy, emphasize the ways in which information technology can complement good land use policy and address both longstanding urban challenges at the nexus of digital tools and urban life as well as the new difficulties that have emerged during the information age.}

Problems related to parking in the city are a common challenge that can affect the comfort of living of residents, traffic, natural environment and transport efficiency. Many cities lack parking spaces in relation to the number of vehicles, leading to difficulties in finding a parking space. This can lead to traffic jams that increase the time it takes to find a parking space, increase traffic-related emissions and reduce the quality of life for residents. The research method to solve the problem related to the management of parking spaces is focused on the analysis of the city's problems and guidelines resulting from the sustainable development of the European Union. In the application part, open data resources were used to carry out the simulation in the proprietary application solution. The result of the article, which is a scientific research, is the presentation of the author's application in the Digital Twin concept for the simulation of parking space management. The simulation is the result of research conducted using open data published on the Internet. The conclusion of the research is that in the process of effective management of parking spaces, simulation in the Digital Twin concept can be used. There is great potential in this approach.}

The routing protocol used the Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol, which was designed to collect data in Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLN) efficiently and reliably. The RPL rank property specifies how sensor nodes are placed in Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) based on an Objective Function (OF). The OF includes information such as the Expected Transmission Count (ETX) and packet delivery rate. The rank property aids in routing path optimization, reducing control overhead, and maintaining a loop-free topology by using rank-based data path validation. However, it causes many issues, such as optimal parent selection, next-hop node selection, and network instability. We proposed an Enhanced Opportunistic Rank-based Parent Node Selection for Sustainable and Smart IoT Networks to address these issues. The optimal parent node is determined by forecasting the expected energy of each node using Received Signal Strength (RSS) and an enhanced reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed method addresses the issue of selecting the next-hop neighbor node and improves routing stability. Furthermore, when a large number of new nodes try to join the sustainable IoT-based smart cities, the proposed technique provides optimal load balance.}

Recent findings in neurobiological research confirm that environmental factors can change the way DNA is folded, affecting such things as mood regulation and impulse control. In turn, emotional factors affect our capacity to shape our environment. But is each citizen afforded with the same opportunities and capacity to shape the city and the same susceptibility to being shaped by it? This paper suggests, following Michel de Certeau, that although even the apparently powerless can change cities, those who are emotionally robust are more effective. The paper presents a collaborative creative installation in Melbourne between one of the authors and a group of homeless and socially isolated women, and contrasts it with the work of graffiti artists to demonstrate the effect that emotion has on the capacity of the marginalised to shape the urban fabric. The second author provides evidence from neurobiology to support the claims.}

In order to ensure the atomicity of goods and confirm the atomicity of delivery, this paper proposes a secure e-commerce payment protocol based on the fourth party, which includes master protocol, customer return protocol, customer exchange protocol and customer merchant transaction dispute resolution protocol.

However, existing solutions usually suffer from high communication cost, which may cause serious packet interference and long time delays. In this paper, we design a new algorithm to realize intersection control via vehicular ad hoc networking. We basically adopt the approach of mutual exclusion, which can let vehicles at an intersection compete for the privilege of passing via message exchange. Different from existing works, we adopt a group based privilege competition design. By letting only group head handling requests from other lanes, message cost can be significantly reduced. Reducing communication cost is a significant issue in IoV based intersection control because high communication cost will cause packet interference and packet losses, which further result in safety problems. The key challenges lie in deterring group size and recognizing group head. Compared similar works, our new algorithm can conduct intersection control with much less message cost, and its advantage is validated by simulations using ns3.}

At the same time, while AI generally has been extolled for contributions to urban resilience, less attention has been paid to the other side of the equation — i.e., to the ethical, governance, and social downsides of AI and big data that can operate to hinder or compromise resilience. With particular attention to relevant institutional dynamics and features, an encompassing and systemic conception of smart and resilient cities is delineated as a critical lens for viewing and analyzing complex instrumental and intrinsic aspects of the relationship between AI and resilience. As a broader contribution to the literature, a set of structural, process, and outcome conditions are offered for engaging and assessing linkages inherent in the use of AI relative to urban resilience in terms of absorptive capacity, speed of recovery, over-optimization avoidance, and creative destruction, especially as regards impacts on relevant practices, standards, and policies.}

Maintenance involves different methods and technologies that extend life by slowing the rate of deterioration. Currently, the structural conditions of the road network are assessed in the traditional way, that is, it is done manually by technicians using specialized tools. Thus, to measure deflection, for example, we use a deflectometer or a Benkelman beam. If you want to assess the deterioration of the road surface or count the vehicles passing on a road, then technicians must make a visual analysis of the road. In the same vein, most of the available research evaluates the results of data extraction and does so mainly visually. So, when a frame of reference is available, an adjustment is made to modify the database. This is where IoT (Internet of Things) comes in place by creating a simple automation process to standardize the data and transform them in information to create a database and measure the quantity and quality of the deformation with a Neural Network. The data set has been categorized manually into different types of deterioration, allowing it to be measured quantitatively and qualitatively. The sample comes from images collected by a GoPro camera, on a 60-degree angle, at 15 FPS. 4 different types of deformation were present in the data set; our model predicted with a precision ranging between 50% and 90% the different types of deformation.  The validation of the results of the model shows 71% of true positive. This process automation provides standardized information for a road qualification and quantification system.}

It is expected that issues related to smart cities will continue to dominate urban planning discourses in science and policy circles in the coming decades. By investing in smart solutions, planners and policy makers aim to solve societal challenges and improve the overall quality of life of people. One major challenge that cities have always dealt with is disaster risk management. In fact, given the high concentration of people and assets in urban areas, disaster risk management has always been high on the agenda of planners and urban authorities. Accordingly, the concept of urban resilience has received significant attention over the past 2–3 decades. Literature on urban resilience is vast and rapidly expanding. However, actual and/or potential contributions of smart city solutions and technologies to urban resilience are relatively underexplored in the literature. This chapter fills this gap by discussing how smart technologies can be deployed in different sectors to improve urban resilience. This is done by providing examples of various systems and sectors such as early warning systems, social media, water, energy, and transportation sectors. Overall, results show that smart solutions contribute to resilience through enhancing different characteristics such as robustness, modularity, efficiency, agility, and diversity.}

Thus, information plays a crucial role in Smart Cities, enabling the smart governance, under the precepts of good governance, highlighting the participation and transparency. In addition, Geoinformation turns the Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre into a decision support informational source that is of great relevance in the context of Smart Governance. Based on this context, the present study investigates the geotechnology scenario applied by the governments of the Brazilian capitals, observing the availability of Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre on the Internet and considering the Geoinformation, Transparency and Collaborative participation aspects. In this sense, this paper proposes an exploratory research, with quantitative and qualitative analyzes. In the first stage, it was identified the cities that offer access to territorial information via the Internet, i.e., quantifying cities with active geoportals. Next, the second step qualifies the geoportals of cities according to their existence and access to certain information. The types of information selected for the survey, considered the evolution of the Cadastre, observing three aspects: (i) cadastral information; (ii) thematic information; and (iii) collaborative interface. The results showed that just over half of the capitals keep active geoportals and almost 1/3 of the capitals make available on the Internet a Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre. In terms of Transparency, it was noted that open access data is still lower than non-available or restricted access data. Moreover, the aspect of Collaborative participation is meaningless. Analyzing the results, it can be noted the need to improve both the availability of data and open access to information regarding the aspects of Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre in the geoportals, mainly the cadastral information. These actions could promote the transparency and collaborative participation that, consequently, will improve the effectiveness of smart governance in the Brazilian capitals.}

abstract = {While the last decade has seen increasing interest in the smart city phenomenon from both scholars and practitioners, little attention has been paid to what extent retailing might be considered as part of smart cities, with benefits for all the actors involved in the process. In fact, retailing is subject to a radical innovation force that makes available several technologies that can be successfully applied. The extensive use of advanced systems gives rise to new questions concerning the smart use of technologies. Moreover, the application of advanced technologies is part of a trend towards the creation of smart cities for a better urban society. In this scenario, the idea of smartness goes beyond the concept of application of new technologies by also including more important dimensions, such as organizational structure. Hence, our work aims at identifying what can be considered smart for retailing, in terms of features of smart technology for retailing, and the challenges emerging from the adoption of such smart technologies.}

Necessary changes are required to the regulatory frameworks of our cities. This paper proposes an application of blockchain technology for planning governance purposes. This new cutting-edge technology, currently under-exploited in applications for smart cities planning, may represent a fundamental building block for the digitalization of the sector. We propose blockchain-based management systems (BMSs) as new governance tools to improve traceability, transparency, and decentralization of transactions in the sharing economy. We build a BMS prototype for the management of co-working spaces (CWSs). In particular, we show how a blockchain can be used to track transactions between users (e.g., rent payments), and to advertise or store information about a given space (e.g., building specifications, IP conceived within the space). A large amount of data will be permanently and securely stored on ledger and made available to both institutions and corporations, providing a wide range of new governance tools and services to local authorities of the future. Similar BMSs can be developed for different types of buildings or public services purposes.}

The smart grid is a system that facilitates the two-way flow of information between utility service providers and customers. Smart meters, integrated into the smart grid infrastructure, enable automated monitoring of electricity usage for billing and accounting purposes. Customers can access their electricity consumption data through web interfaces or smartphone apps. Security concerns arise as cyberattackers can exploit continuous data transmission to manipulate billing information and gather user transaction data without detection. Ensuring user data protection becomes crucial as smart meters play an essential role in smart city development. Complex cyberattacks pose a significant threat to modern metering installations, and a large-scale attack could disable numerous smart meters, affecting urban centers. The most vulnerable areas in smart meter infrastructure include the distributor's servers, linkages, the remote management network, and the network hub. To prevent such attacks, detecting mechanisms and robust security measures need implementation.}

Conventional systems usually require huge storage space and bandwidth, subsequently causing a bottleneck for the development of streaming systems. To resolve such problems, this study proposes a cooperative mechanism for mobiles that can make full use of local storage space and uploading bandwidth to relieve the computational load for streaming servers. Firstly, a statistical distribution of the life cycle of devices is dynamically established based on the analysis of random arrival and departure of mobile users. Secondly, an adaptive sliding-window technology based on Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is proposed in this study to change the size of windows in real time. Thirdly, an adaptive streaming solution is introduced in the OPNET environment, which cooperatively integrates the strategies of overlay formation, quality adaptation, and data scheduling. Simulation results showed that the proposed mechanism saved power consumption of devices and ensured the video quality for networks with limited resources.}

There are several types of forgery in digital media transmission, especially digital image transmission. A common type of forgery is copy-move forgery (CMF). The CMF may be encountered in streets, railway stations, underground stations, or festivals. This type of forgery may lead to hugger-mugger in some cases. Therefore, there is a need to find a sufficient countermeasure mechanism to detect image forgeries. This paper presents a new CMFD approach that depends on deep learning for IoT based smart cities. Two well-known deep learning models, namely CNN and ConvLSTM, are adopted for CMFD. The proposed models are tested on MICC-220, MICC-600 and MICC 2000 datasets for validation. Several tests are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models. The simulation results reveal that the testing accuracy reaches 95%, 73%, and 94% for MICC-F220, MICC-F600 and MICC-F2000 datasets. In addition, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 85% for a combined set of all datasets.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the use of drones as a fundamental element of smart cities has attracted the attention of many researchers to monitor and control the traffic of vehicles. Because of the high flexibility of multi-drone systems, like flying ad hoc networks (FANETs), they provide various services and improve modern life in smart cities. However, due to the unique features of FANET, especially the high speed of drones and rapid changes in network topology, communication reliability is a serious challenge in this network. Hence, traditional routing protocols, such as optimized link state routing (OLSR) scheme, cannot work well in these networks. In this paper, a smart filtering-based adaptive optimized link state routing (SFA-OLSR) scheme is proposed in FANETs. To increase adaptability to the FANET environment, SFA-OLSR provides a new solution to adjust the hello broadcast period so that each flying node specifies its broadcast period based on a new scale called cosine similarity between real and predicted positions. Furthermore, in SFA-OLSR, each flying node develops a filtering algorithm based on two parameters, namely link lifetime and remaining energy. The purpose of this algorithm is to reduce the size of the single-hop neighboring set of each flying node and minimize the search space when finding multi-point relays (MPRs). This increases the convergence speed of the algorithm. Then, SFA-OLSR exploits the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to single out the best MPRs. This algorithm introduces a multi-objective function by focusing on three components, including energy, link lifespan, and neighbor degree. Lastly, the simulation process of SFA-OLSR is performed by the NS3 simulator. This process evaluates the performance of the proposed method and three schemes, namely Gangopadhyay et al., P-OLSR, and OLSR-ETX. These evaluations show that SFA-OLSR has a good performance in terms of three scales, namely packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput, but its overhead is more than other methods.}

Smart parking systems (SPS) aim to address these challenges by offering real-time information on parking availability, optimizing parking space utilization, and providing convenient payment options. This study seeks to comprehensively examine the academic research conducted on SPS to contribute to a deeper understanding of the current research landscape in this field. The research involved an extensive analysis of 124 published research papers, journals, and articles and revealed an intriguing trend: the proliferation of IoT-based SPS in urban settings is revolutionizing decision-making processes and elevating user experiences. Among the diverse range of SPS options, wireless sensor networks have emerged as a popular choice, as they not only eliminate the hassle of extensive wiring but also significantly reduce deployment expenses. Computer vision or image processing systems for vehicle detection require fewer sensors but come with substantial installation costs due to the necessity of a camera network. Conversely, SPSs based on vehicular ad hoc networks are experiencing slower adoption rates, mainly due to the high costs associated with installation and the requirement of on-board units in vehicles. The findings of this study will help researchers identify areas that require further investigation and city planners integrate smart parking systems into their overall smart city initiatives.}

In this paper, we question the transformative credentials of smartness and argue that it is better understood as a partial fix for the economic, environmental and social challenges faced by cities. Drawing on the urban sustainability and smart city literatures, we develop the concept of the urban smart-sustainability fix. This concept focuses on how smart-sustainable city initiatives selectively integrate digital and environmental agendas via entrepreneurial forms of urban governance. We develop this concept by examining how the urban smart-sustainability fix is constructed in the European Commission’s flagship smart cities and communities lighthouse projects, focusing on the Triangulum initiative. Our research reveals three elements of the urban smart-sustainability fix: (1) the spatial development of smart-sustainable districts; (2) the digitisation of urban infrastructure to reveal hidden processes; and, (3) collaborative experimentation with low-carbon and digital technologies. We argue that this has produced urban districts that are attempting to reduce their carbon emissions while promoting green economic growth. The main aim of the urban smart-sustainability fix is to make the urban realm more manageable resulting in amplification, rather than transformation, of the dominant ecological modernisation agenda of sustainable development.}

abstract = {Nowadays, many communities are emerging towards smart environments, requiring the communication and collaboration of diverse Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. A smart environment exploits the use of IoT technology to share and process data among such devices for a better living. However, this comes with additional costs, such as the exponential growth of IoT devices, the heterogeneity of IoT use cases, and the new complex features encountered by IoT data, which complicate their processing and analysis using the traditional techniques. This causes a dramatic performance degradation of the used processing resources, which directly affects the overall efficiency and performance of IoT-based systems. Although different studies have presented resource utilization approaches for IoT systems, but they were not evaluated from different resource utilization perspectives. Besides, no efforts have been directed to investigate their effectiveness to process the unprecedented IoT data features that inevitably impact the accuracy and efficiency of resource utilization. In this paper, the Triple Phases Resource Utilized Data Fusion (TPRUDF) framework is proposed as the first IoT-based cost-aware resource utilization using data fusion. It exclusively considers different IoT data features by employing three phases of data fusion: (1) data in – data out, (2) data in – feature out, and (3) feature in – decision out. TPRUDF fuses the raw IoT data by maintaining the complex IoT data features, independent of the IoT domain or the computing model, using the spatiotemporal data fusion (STDF) IoT-based data fusion approach. TPRUDF then fuses the uncorrelated data features via the Principal Component Analysis. Finally, it employs two different resource utilization techniques: (1) Genetic Algorithms and (2) Particle Swarm Optimization, fusing their results using the voting logic fusion technique. A public edge-computing simulator is used to evaluate TPRUDF via three real-world smart cities datasets. The experimental results of the proposed TPRUDF framework indicate that it: (1) achieves an average accuracy level of resource utilization equal to 91%, (2) increases the resource utilization throughput by an average of 40% and eventually minimizes the processing delay, (3) boosts the resource utilization availability by 60%, and (4) decreases the energy consumption by 35%.}

Ongoing scholarly discussions often focus on how sustainability and ‘smartness’ relate to each other conceptually, to which extent smart city technologies contribute to making cities more sustainable, and calls to prioritise social issues over technology. The questions of how this ‘shift to smart’ has unfolded, and how it has reshaped strategies and interventions to make cities and their energy infrastructures more sustainable, have however been much less investigated. The aim of this article is to zoom in on the dynamics of such a shift from sustainable to smart. The cities of Malmö and Graz have strong profiles as sustainable cities and have both begun to use smart city branding. We build our analysis on argumentative discourse theory and the concept of socio-material assemblages. Along with a discursive shift from sustainable cities to smart cities, we also observe changes in institutions and socio-material practices. We identify appropriation and colonisation as two dynamics that characterise the relations between assemblages of sustainable and smart cities. We conclude that even when smart city discourses are appropriated by actors in existing sustainable city assemblages, the discursive shift might eventually allow smart city assemblages to colonise existing institutions and socio-material practices. But the shift does not take place through explicit controversy between two discourse coalitions, and it therefore remains important to further investigate the conditions that allow for a change in dynamics from appropriation to colonisation.}

This paper proposed a deep learning algorithm-based solution to tighten the security level in the IoT-Smart environment network. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) considered in this paper is Network IDS, which investigates the manufacturer usage description, digital twins, and deep learning-based user behavior information. IoT devices' communication and the users in smart buildings are automatically connected in the Intelligent Communication system. Since many devices and users are interconnected in smart buildings, the probability of cyber-attack is high. Thus, better security is needed in smart buildings and smart environments. It should focus on securing IoT devices, users, and their communication. Hence, this paper developed a deep learning-based anomaly detection framework to dynamically monitor the issues and problems with MUD profiles and detect the anomaly behavior.

In addition to physical access to smartphone use, this study contributes a new perspective from the privacy concern on (motivational access) and lack of knowledge (skill access) in using location-based service (LBS) to the understanding of unequal access to transport information during the transition to a smart city. Using a two-stage modelling approach to a dataset collected from two Chinese cities, the study found that women are vulnerable to restricted access to smart transport information due to the privacy concern on and lack of knowledge of using LBS. People aged over 50 tend to be restricted to the traditional source of transport information due to the lack of knowledge of using LBS. Moreover, city-sensitive factors should be considered. Muslims in Urumqi are vulnerable to restricted access to smart transport information compared with Han Chinese because of the lack of knowledge of using LBS. In Wuhan, manual workers/attendants are vulnerable to restricted access to smart transport information compared with those working in offices for the same reason. The lack of knowledge affects the transformation from a traditional source user to a smart source user, whereas the privacy concern restrains individuals from using multiple smart sources. From these findings, policy recommendations for mitigating the smartness-induced unequal access to transport information are proposed.}

abstract = {With the sustained and rapid development of the social economy and the rapid growth of urban vehicles, urban expressway has developed rapidly. As the roadmap of urban traffic, the urban expressway has a relatively high and stable driving speed, and also bears a large amount of urban traffic. However, in recent years, with the expansion of the city scale, the congestion of urban expressways has become increasingly severe. In various areas of the merged area, due to various factors such as mismatched traffic capacity and reduced driving speed, it is easy to cause deterioration of road conditions in a short period of time and cause more secondary accidents. In order to reduce the incidence of expressway traffic accidents and to avoid as much as possible the casualties and property losses caused by accidents, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by information technology, data communication transmission technology, control technology and traffic engineering were introduced. With the rise of artificial intelligence and the continuous development of ITS, the video acquisition methods of real-time traffic flow data and the image recognition ability of video sequences continue to improve, providing theoretical basis and technical support for the research of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional pattern recognition methods, such as weak anti-interference to complex traffic environment and low correct recognition rate, this paper studies the pattern recognition method based on image processing, and selects the fuzzy C-means clustering in the currently used clustering methods (FCM) algorithm Because the FCM algorithm cannot obtain the global optimal solution and need to determine the number of cluster categories in advance, this paper uses ReliefF algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to compare the feature weight and number of clusters of traditional FCM algorithm. Make improvements. Through the experimental analysis of the acquired video images, the results show that the improved FCM algorithm based on the proposed method has better real-time and accuracy in the application of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition.}

I present three reasons: 1) problems with the technocratic, corporate-led ‘smart’ governance require a smart urban governance; 2) the theoretical focal points of smart urban governance show its transformation potential in handling urban challenges; and 3) brief descriptions of two illustrative cases demonstrate the practical capabilities of smart urban governance.

abstract = {Pervasive computing aims to simplify our lives by efficiently managing information in different fields such as transportation, and healthcare. Smart transportation has become an integral part of our modern society and is attractive for pervasive computing. Head-Up Display (HUD) assists users in locating and identifying objects and humans by establishing volatile contact with them. HUD is aided by computer vision (CV) techniques and used in smart transportation for human assistance. An Adaptable Recommendation System (ARS) using an analytical CV (ACV) in smart transportation is introduced to improve the swiftness in detecting objects in a multi-layer smart city environment. The proposed system is backhauled using deep, short-term memory networks to identify and verify the layers' correctness in detecting the target with a reduced time factor. The application's design concentrates on enlightening HUD for end-user recommendations. The HUD applications with the recommended system achieve less time, error, and computations.}

In recent years, several governments have initiated numerous smart city and smart infrastructure programs aimed at enhancing the quality life of the people and helping town managers improve the public infrastructure activity and management. The usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) for infrastructure system enables the gathering, storing, incorporation, and analysis of large quantities and varieties of information relating to the status and output of infrastructure systems together with public activity through Cloud-based asset management systems, mobile apps, and Big Data analytics. In this paper, a master data management (MDM) approach has been proposed to unlock the importance of comprehensive network data for efficient, safe, and robust community development. In the market field, MDM is implemented for the organization of big data organizational and research applications. The proposed method includes an effective MDM solution for safe, efficient, and functional community design, commercial and open source MDM platforms, city development principles, smart city concept models, adaptive shared network backgrounds, semantic cloud technology, and specialists responsible for designing development, scalable platform technology for evaluating the input.}

Despite of being a city holding important hydric resources, the lack of strategies, technological innovation, user-centered service design, consistent data acquiring, and optimization tools have led to a poor water management that maintains the metropolis with a constant scarcity of the resource. Therefore, the aim of the current paper is to present a conceptual service design for smart rainwater harvesting in urban settlements that provides an alternative source for citizens to reduce the local hydric stress, diminish aquifer overexploitation and increase water well recovery contributing to more sustainable cities.}

Previous studies on dominant mobility models (i.e., gravity and radiation models) rarely describe the refined spatiotemporal process of human mobility flow forces especially within city. To address this gap, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal flow force model (FFM) of sink/source human mobilities within city, which is derived from Navier-Stokes equation in the field of fluid mechanics. The FFM model outperforms the gravity and radiation models in modeling the refined spatiotemporal flow force process of source/sink human mobilities, in the aspect of intensity and direction of mobility flow force. Comparison results show that the gravity and radiation models in the source mobility scenario can give a rough force estimation about the total outflow from source mobility areas while without the capability of explaining the specific directions of mobility flow from source mobility areas. Pearson correlation coefficient between the intensity results of the two models and those of FFM range from 0.65 to 0.90 and direction differences between the results of the two models and FFM respectively show no clear regularity. In the sink mobility scenario, the direction of mobility flows can be estimated well by the gravity and radiation models while the intensity of mobility flow between small-scale areas within cities is susceptible to inaccuracies. Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from 0.13 to 0.59 and direction differences follow a stepped distribution from high to low within the range of 0° to 180°. In addition, the potential field of human mobility flow force provides a powerful tool for visually analyzing mobility flows within cities. This proposed model enriches human mobility models and is generalizable in supporting smart cities, urban planning, and constructions of resilient environments in terms of the refined spatiotemporal process of mobility flow force.}

However, there is still lack of discussions on this concept with the background of developing countries. With serious challenges of urbanization and energy, China can provide a prominent case to further deep the understanding of this concept in the background of a rapidly developing country. This manuscript aims to propose and define a new concept of smart energy towns (SET) according to recent theoretical progress and China's practical experience on SEC. First, we reviewed the connotations of smart city, smart energy systems, and smart energy city, and then derive a definition of SET according to China's national conditions. Second, we introduced the status quo of SET projects in China, and identify the gaps and barriers to development SET as compared with the definition. Finally, from the view of four stakeholders, including China's central government, international organization, China's regional government, and enterprises, we put forward some actions recommendations for the development of China's SET. The main findings are that compared with SEC, SET emphasizes the importance of overall planning of energy and urbanization, as well as promoting business model innovation to support economic development. The main barriers to the development of SET in China lies in the lack of planning and policy support for local projects by regional governments, as well as the lack of funds and capacity of local enterprises to carry out project construction. To this end, stakeholders must work together to help cities and towns strengthen project planning and policy research, as well as jointly strengthen investment and explore practical business models suitable for each region to promote the development of SET in China.}

Following the two approaches of smart city development from Kuk and Janssen (2011), the study proposed a synergetic framework for understanding the relationship between information architectures and business models. Since community is a basic unit of a city, the development goals of a smart city are needed to be implemented at the level of communities. The development path of smart community is a configuration set including both information architecture factors and business model patterns. Based on the cases of 69 communities from Beijing, China, we explored successful configurations based on the framework. Using the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method, we found that a successful smart community depends on the integration between information architectures and business models, and different business models rely on different information architectures elements. Networking, terminals, and sensors are key information architecture elements that are used more frequently in business models.}

In the design of public buildings and shaping our modern built environment, we come across certain issues. These are influenced by the geographical context, human behaviour, culture and practice of a region. However, time and technology has been two masters in shaping such spaces with the modern pace of development.In the later part of last century the concept of “barrier free architecture” was generated that quickly escalated to “Universal design” concept, which today is established with a broader horizon as “Inclusive design”. Several audits are designed and tool-kits established to check the accessibility or universality of a particular built space. Hand in hand, with the increasing population and increasing criminal demography, another issue that planners and architects are facing now is “crime prevention” and hence, a field of “design against crime” has also emerged prominently. With the hands of Crowe as in Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED), Oscar Newman's Defensible space, Jane Jacob and so many others, architectural design directives and architectural solutions have been suggested. Green urbanism is a term that embraces “urban ecology” where the city dynamics is dependent on the city dwellers and their involvement in the urban environment. Thus an ecological city can be interpreted as a city the allows people to be involved, reducing dependency on fuel guzzling urban solutions and thus emerging as an Inclusive and sustainable city. In light of the given background, aim of the research is to study the authenticity of the hypothesis that “promoting women's safety in public spaces promotes inclusive design in urban area and consequently makes its Urban ecology more productive”. Thus, the main objective is to find a relation and applicability of the Universal design audit check-lists with the design directives for safer city-designs- both being two important components of a “Inclusive and sustainable City”. This study has been done mostly based on literature study and comparative study of secondary data. Application of this concept has been done on the data obtained from a Study conducted by INTACH in Shahjahanabad area, New Delhi, India inApril 2010. The unsafe criteria obtained from the study has been analyzed and incorporated in this present study.}

Our framework is inspired by the extant strands of literature on smart cities and smart home technology adoption, but also contributing to them as smart energy applications reveal specificities that need to be incorporated; the latter include, for instance, the distinction between adoption and frequency of use, or the consideration of additional determinants such as privacy or environmental concerns. For our study, we build an original survey and rely upon citizen-level data, testing a Zero-Inflated Ordered Probit (ZIOP) model which allows to differentiate between adoption of the smart energy app and its frequency of utilization. Our empirical findings reveal how the drivers related to smart city characteristics mainly affect the decision of adoption of energy tracking apps. Conversely, the more individual characteristics related to the perceived benefits of using energy tracking apps, dwelling type, and privacy concerns, primarily affect the frequency of utilization. Our results bear policy implications on the issue of privacy, premising additional research on energy challenges in the utilization of energy apps in smart versus non-smart environments.}

To reduce sparse estimates, the transformation of historical demand data is added to the linear regression model. Secondly, some general methods are proposed to deal with demand patterns that we cannot clearly capture. Thirdly, we propose optimized model specifications to select optimal model and reduce redundant variables to avoid underfitting or overfitting. In the last, some numerical experiments are carried out based on the model we propose and some completive models in the actual demand data set.

However, one of the main challenges for the successful implementation of digital twins is combining data from multiple sources in a homogeneous format so they can be operationalized together to generate more accurate, comprehensive, and valuable information. This chapter thoroughly describes the implementation of a digital twin of a smart space using different technologies from the FIWARE ecosystem that help combat data fusion and homogenization problems. This process involves several steps, including data selection, preprocessing, integration, and interpretation. In addition, a case study on low-emission zones is presented, which can be easily replicated in different scenarios within a smart city. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of using FIWARE as the underlying technology in our implementation to overcome the data fusion and homogenization challenge.}

abstract = {This paper adds to scholarship on policy mobilities by borrowing a typology and set of ideas from political science about the different stages of the policy making process, namely agenda-setting, policy formulation, decision making, implementation, and evaluation. To date policy mobilities scholarship has mostly not been explicit about which stage of the policy process is being examined. We therefore provide a structure for analysing mobile policy inflows to, and outflows from, a policy over time, across the different stages, allowing the analysis of policy mobilities to be aligned more closely with government decision making processes. To test out our ideas we trace the policy mobilities associated with two Australian smart grid policies over their lifetime, i.e. in the lead up to the policy being implemented, and subsequently. The policies are the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) program in the State of Victoria, Australia (2009–2013) and the Australian federal government Smart Grid Smart City program (2010–14). We analyse a combination of codified and tacit forms of knowledge sharing, including through policy and industry reports, and interviews with policy practitioners. Key findings include a peak in policy mobilities during the implementation stage, and policy mobility inflows (learning from elsewhere) continuing even in later policy stages. In conclusion we advocate for greater attention to policy mobilities at different stages of the policy process, in order to broaden the scope of policy mobilities research and to develop a stronger understanding of the temporal dimensions of policy mobilities.}

Besides several reference models/architectures have been developed, a framework to structure and understand the implications and to identify I4.0 action fields is still needed. A harmonized model would allow guiding the developments on how to organizationally prepare for the change. This paper attempts to clarify the implications and action fields of the I4.0, trying to reveal its mostly alleged dimensions and the main planes in which they intervene in the industrial ecosystem. Through the analysis of the most relevant architectures for I4.0, IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and the consequent awareness of which components are missing, the paper proposes a framework for digital factories towards smart cities that stresses the expansion of the I4.0 horizontal integration into human, cities infrastructural, and societal dimensions.}

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city services have paved the path for complex network architectures including edge and fog layer resources in order to meet such services’ Quality of Service (QoS). Such services should also be energy efficient for sustainable cities. Though energy efficiency has been widely studied over the past decade, yet most such solutions have focused on device or sensor level solutions or alternatively on cloud/datacenter level solutions. With the prominence of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) in recent times owing to its flexible and scalable network management features, SDN based fog level resource management has become an attractive alternative. This paper addresses fog level energy-aware resource management with the goal of minimizing energy consumption while QoS fulfillment by means of Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation through live migrations. Since any decent sized smart city would have millions of devices and large numbers of edge/fog instances, it would lead any solution mechanism to a NP hard problem. This paper proposes a novel set based Differential Evolutionary (S-DE) algorithm. Simulations have been carried out to test the efficacy of the proposed S-DE solution and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Recently, smart communities are heeded to in Japan as a solution to community issues. To properly evaluate the underlying concept, it is necessary to analyze smart cities in terms of local energy and environmental aspects, as well as disaster resilience. This research aimed to summarize the requirements for Japanese smart communities, and provide this information to municipalities, city planners, and regional developers in warmer climates, or countries where few precedents exist. Nine cases were reviewed in Japan, and four in Europe and the US to organize smart community requirements into three areas: environment, social, and safety-security. Additionally, bottom-up simulations were used to quantitatively evaluate the effects of energy technology introduction, emergency Life Continuity Plans (LCPs), and changes in energy performance owing to household compositional differences. The results showed that a typical Japanese smart community (containing Fuel cell, PV, and battery) has the capacity to become a positive energy district, generating 1916 ​GJ ​yr−1, and maintain power throughout a one-week power outage if shared within the community (save for the highest temperature week in August). Conversely, Japanese smart communities lacked consideration of residential diversity and creative landscapes.}

One of these contributions is undoubtedly the transport industry along with a truck, cars, or other on-road driven vehicles. A SMART monitoring system could be a solution able to measure the pollution levels in busy crossroads and garage spaces that can depict over-reaching values of pollutants such as carbon dioxide, sulfuric oxides, or dust accumulation above health-recommended levels. The study aims to evaluate the air quality levels in garage spaces in the district of Žilina. The results have shown a proof-of-concept of a wireless monitoring emission system run solely on batteries providing active feedback within confined underground spaces. The entire garage ventilation fulfilled norm STN 73 6058 with respect to CO and CO2 values, however, PM values exceeded recommended concentrations. Further scientific experimentation and prototyping will validate the concept in practice, making sure the cities of Europe have accurate, just-in-time data to meet the 2030 emission targets.}

The nonexplaining nature of AI makes it less useable in various fields especially in healthcare, smart cities, autonomous mobility, financial management, etc. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is the next advancement in the field of AI where the humans can rely upon the decisions taken by the AI algorithm. Society 5.0 has the motto of building a super-smart society wherein humans can lead a very comfortable life in terms of smart governance, smart economy, smart transportation, smart healthcare, etc. The main goal of XAI is building trust among the users with advanced ML algorithms. So undoubtedly XAI can be used to build the components that are required for making a society to be a super-smart society. However, more surveys and comprehensive literature works are not done regarding the application of XAI in building Society 5.0. This chapter work aims to provide a detailed view of implementing society 5.0 using XAI.}
