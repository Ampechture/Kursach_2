abstract = {The assessment of risk posed by climate change in coastal cities encompasses multiple climate-related hazards. Sea-level rise, coastal flooding and coastal erosion are important hazards, but they are not the only ones. The varying availability and quality of data across cities hinders the ability to conduct holistic and standardized multi-hazard assessments. Indeed, there are far fewer studies on multiple hazards than on single hazards. Also, the comparability of existing methodologies becomes challenging, making it difficult to establish a cohesive understanding of the overall vulnerability and resilience of coastal cities. The use of indicators allows for a standardized and systematic evaluation of baseline hazards across different cities. The methodology developed in this work establishes a framework to assess a wide variety of climate-related hazards across diverse coastal cities, including sea-level rise, coastal flooding, coastal erosion, heavy rainfall, land flooding, droughts, extreme temperatures, heatwaves, cold spells, strong winds and landslides. Indicators are produced and results are compared and mapped for ten European coastal cities. The indicators are meticulously designed to be applicable across different geographical contexts in Europe. In this manner, the proposed approach allows interventions to be prioritized based on the severity and urgency of the specific risks faced by each city.}

abstract = {Recent deployments of Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in Japan and some other earthquake-prone regions provide the vital warning signals prior to the arrival of destructive ground motions. The EEW system uses the different traveling speed of seismic P- and S-waves to achieve the goal of earthquake warning. This technology is primarily used to produce warning signals to alert the public to avoid potential risks, such as to evacuate from buildings. It is also used to mitigate other risks such as reducing train speed of Shinkansen trains. The present study suggests a new seismic-risk mitigation technique by connecting a base isolation system with the EEW. Base isolation is a mature technology which decouples structure from its base and lengthens its natural period of vibration. However, existing base isolation devices must possess certain lateral resistance to withstand service lateral forces such as wind, and such stiffness hinders the effectiveness of vibration isolation. In addition, supplementary damping devices are sometimes added to control excessive displacements in isolation level. This paper proposes a smart system which changes the property of a base isolation system upon EEW signal. In normal times when earthquake risk is not present, the base isolation system is locked by shear keys. When an earthquake is signalled by the EEW system, a mechanical system releases the base isolation system. When the earthquake ceases, the system resets and base isolation is locked again. On-board vibration sensors are added to activate the system in case of EEW fails to detect incoming waves. A crucial benefit of the system is that supplementary damper is no longer required to control excessive isolator displacements, and elastic stiffness of base isolation is no longer required to re-enter the base isolation system. The result is that it maximizes the vibration isolation effectiveness. A conceptual framework of proposed system is described and demonstrated by laboratory-scaled experiments. A 6-storey test frame is excited on a shake table subjected to historical earthquakes. Results indicates that the proposed system is effective in reducing earthquake responses on the building. It is an IoT-enabled earthquake-risk mitigation system.}

This paper describes certain accidents related to soil investigation in Qatar and their consequences, as well as the lessons learned from these accidents. In order to meet the challenges of soil investigation in urban areas, this paper presents a solution based on smart technology, which includes: (i) a geotechnical information system with update data concerning the soil profile, soil surface, utilities locations, and water table level; (ii) tools for data management, analysis, and visualization; and (iii) a user interface that allows authorities, companies, and citizens to access authorized data via a graphic interface, update data, and send messages and alerts in the case of any incident occurring. Finally, the paper presents a promising perspective for the development of smart drilling devices, which record data related to the functioning of a drilling machine and transmit data to the smart soil investigation system.}

A full analysis was performed in three locations representative of as many climatic conditions (Aswan, Brindisi and London). The results obtained showed that the overall impact due to the production of a PVCC cell is considerably lower than the one of traditional technologies offering the same performances. Reductions of impacts spanning between 41% and 44% were obtained. Moreover, all impact categories benefited from smart windows' building integration in the operational phase, especially in the Mediterranean climate. If in Aswan the reduction of impact is mainly ascribable to energy demand for cooling, in cold climates savings in lighting energy dominate.}

abstract = {With the explosive growth in wireless data traffic, it is difficult to support the massive consumption of backhaul link bandwidth. Mobile edge computing (MEC) uses edge caching to store content closer to the end user in case to reduce the computational overhead and latency. Caching decisions depend on user demand, which is associated with user behavior. Popular content shows the preferences of user behavior. Combining user context behavior to benefit caching, our optimization objective is to maximize the hit rate of contents within limited time. This optimization problem can be modeled as a knapsack problem. Even if the context and content popularity are known for all circumstances, it is still NP-hard. We thus propose a heuristic Smart caching algorithm (Smart-caching) within the MEC paradigm. Smart-caching constructs the user behavior preferences to reflect different user demands for content. Based on this construct, Smart-caching employs contextual zoom caching to find the context-aware content popularity with diversity via partitioning and exploring the context space. Our experiments are implemented with a real large-volume dataset, i.e., China Mobile User Detail Record (UDR). The results show that Smart-caching achieves a better cache hit rate and stability with low overhead compared with other related caching algorithms.}

abstract = {Background
Smart devices including sensors and smartphones have grown exponentially during the past few years due to rapid growth in wireless sensor network (WSN) technology under IoT. In addition with smart city, concepts of smart traffic systems and smart health are also being developed. It enables remote connectivity of smart devices (i.e., mobiles, sensors) and medical smart software with the internet for monitoring. The availability of smart devices plays a remarkable role in the new era of mobile health (mHealth) monitoring. mHealth software is mostly used for humans who suffer from any chronic disease and need remote monitoring. In this case, such human needs smart medical software for careful monitoring from a distance due to their continuous movement and distance from any medical support.
Existing Limitations
Nowadays, due to the frequent use and development of intelligent software for medical still, this domain has several limitations such as (i) not rescuing timely, (ii) no mechanism to assure that medical condition is abnormal or due to any other reason i.e. environmental effects, (iii) not a decision taking medical software for selection of multiple ontologies simultaneously, (iv) no acknowledgment process for enlisting the medical centers which can provide the medical facilities and (v) issues with assessing the environmental factors. These limitations make smart medical field less effective particularly for users who have severe situations.
Proposed Solution
Therefore, this work has proposed a framework and developed medical software for humans. For the development of the software, we used the hardware including Arduino UNO board, for pulse values used a pulse sensor and for its connectivity with the mobile software used a Bluetooth module HC-05 module. Arduino and Android based software are linked via a Bluetooth module.
Implementation
For testing the software, case studies are used with different scenarios. This study has revealed more valuable results in respect of human rescue and ensuring the severe condition of the human with current activities, examining the effects of the environmental factors on the health, preventing the system from false alert generation, and timely receiving of medical facilities.
Conclusion
The developed software as per the suggested framework's features has overcome the mentioned challenges from remote monitoring. It potentially outperformed with easiness and in a better way towards smart health monitoring services.}

To address this issue, a precise registration algorithm based on pole-like targets is proposed. The core steps include registration primitive extraction: a cylindrical spatial neighborhood is established based on the distinctive key points, and precise extraction of pole-like geospatial point cloud data is performed using the Euclidean clustering method with the normal curvature constraint. Achieving optimal spatial transformation: a circle center fitting method with additional Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function constraints was developed based on the stable elemental unit which was utilized to accurately construct homonymous feature point pairs. Validation results from multiple real urban point cloud datasets collected from different experimental areas and platforms demonstrate that our method achieves superior registration performance, with mean residuals below 5 cm in both the planar and elevation directions. The proposed method exhibits strong universality and registration robustness for multi-temporal point cloud data of the homologous or cross-sources.}

To reduce the danger related to natural disasters, crucial services should be furnished with an unfailing alert system. Nonetheless, traditional sensors that are detecting the natural disasters (e.g., seismic vibrations, earthquakes, etc.) use an external power that may not be positioned in several buildings because of the limits in the electricity source. Thus, substituting the electronics battery frequently continues a substantial challenge particularly in a remote area. Therefore, this chapter reports on the current development in nanogenerators, which can provide viable self-adequate micro/nano-power energy sources for future sensor systems. It further focuses on the wind-driven hybridized energy harvester that is fabricated to rotate the energy harvesting, which could be integrated with wireless sensors network (WSN) technology by developing a self-powered sensor for natural disaster detection devices. Besides, the chapter further discussed the self-powered seismic-based sensor utilizing the 3D printing technology. This technology is based on characteristically friction-free properties, which can be utilized as a self-powered sensor for detection of earthquake disasters. These findings showed that in the designed self-powered sensors could be vital to deliver a viable solution for power supply for long-term sensing devices for natural disaster detection in suburban or remote areas.}

However, in the IoT environment, an exact match is an extreme requirement because of the diverse and large environment and generation of various forms of Smart data. Therefore, semantically similar events must be considered and returned to subscribers as a possible match. However, matching events approximately to subscriptions is a much more complex task that negatively affects the efficiency of matching. Our proposed algorithm, semantic matching using the tree structure (SMT), provides efficient communication to support time-critical applications. SMT achieved linear time in terms of throughput compared with exponential time achieved in previous work. Combining SMT with taxonomy clustering improved the effectiveness in terms of the F-score, which is an indication of the recall and precision of the results, particularly when 100% of subscriptions were to be semantically matched.}

With this information, along with the available space per parcel for boreholes, the percentage of the energy demand that could be supplied by geothermal energy is calculated. The potential reduction in CO2 emissions should all possible geothermal energy be utilised, is also calculated. The method is applied to Ludwigsburg, Germany. It was found that CO2 emissions could potentially be reduced by 29.7% if all space heating and hot water requirements were provided by geothermal energy, which would contribute to the sustainability of a city. The method is simple in execution and could be applied to other cities as the data used should be readily available. Another advantage is the implementation into the web based Smart City Energy platform which allows interactive exploration of solutions across the city.}

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are being introduced by different manufacturers as an environment-friendly alternative to vehicles with internal combustion engines. The number of EVs is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years which will act as distributed loads in the demand side of the smart grid. On the supply side, an aggregator has to predict a load schedule 12–36 h in advance to charge the EVs and purchase energy accordingly from the day-ahead market. The goal of the aggregator is to schedule the EVs at different charging stations along the route of the EVs for charging so that the energy imbalance between the energy purchased and the energy consumed by the EVs is minimized while maximizing the number of EVs charged. In this work, we refer to this problem as the Bounded Maximum Energy Usage Maximum EV Charging Problem where mobile EVs communicate their charging preferences to the aggregator and the aggregator schedules EVs to different charging stations in their route so as to maximize both the purchased energy utilization (and therefore, minimum energy imbalance) and the number of EVs charged. We first prove that the problem is NP-complete. A pseudo-polynomial algorithm is proposed for a restricted version of the problem that can act as an upper bound for the energy usage. We also give an upper bound for the number of EVs charged. An offline and an online heuristic are then proposed to solve the problem. Detailed simulation results in different city traffic scenarios are presented to show the performance of the algorithms.}

Therefore we are trying to develop a behavior-based user authentication system to continuously check the user activities after login. The developing system can extract many operational and behavioral features characteristic of user by multiple sensors; for example, touch screen, accelerometer, microphone, and GPS sensor. And then it can combine the authentication results from the multiple sensors because a single sensor may produce poor authentication accuracy. In this paper, we report the ongoing results of our system, that is, the experimental results from user authentication using touch operational features, and some features extracted from accelerometer.

Our findings suggest that GIs demonstrate potential for post-growth transformations and that intermediary support and leadership are key to strengthen their transformative capacity. However, we also find that as GIs develop to influence regimes, they may face trade-offs that compromise their autonomy. If considered, we argue that the transformative capacities of GIs can be supported, to enact economic transformations toward a post-growth economy.}

The characteristics of heterogeneity, constrained resources, scaling requirements, an uncontrolled environment, and so on make security and privacy concerns far more difficult to tackle than they are today. The high availability required by IoT networks may risk the integrity and security of data carried over the network. Because the majority of security threats occur during data routing activities, developing a safe routing protocol for IoT networks has emerged as the most important research subject. The efficient procedures required to allow secure data transfer for autos enabled by IoT technology are detailed here. Using a novel cryptography-based routing mechanism, this study demonstrates how to protect V2V and V2I communications in the context of the VANET against a wide range of cyber threats. It is a data encryption and decryption technology based on attributes and identity that has been designed to have the lowest computational overhead while retaining the best level of security. To provide efficient message authentication and integrity while ensuring vehicle privacy and safeguarding vehicular communications, a hybrid cryptography system integrating ABS and IBS, named AIBS (Attribute-Identity Based Signature), was created. The recommended cryptography-based solution is tested in the presence of prospective attackers on the network while using the NS2 tool. The simulation results have been measured in terms of average throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), communication delay, and communication overhead.}

The SM are connected to a SCADA system (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) that supervises a network of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). The SCADA system/PLC network integrates different types of information coming from several technologies present in modern buildings. The developed control strategy implements a hierarchical cascade controller where inner loops are performed by local PLCs, and the outer loop is managed by a centralized SCADA system, which interacts with the entire local PLC network.

This paper presents an iterative approach, which integrates a PEV electricity demand model and a power system simulation to reveal potential bottlenecks in the electric grid caused by PEV energy demand. An agent-based traffic demand model is used to model the electricity demand of each vehicle over the day. An approach based on interconnected multiple energy carrier systems is used as a model for a possible future energy system. Experiments demonstrate that the model is sensitive to policy changes, e.g., changes in electricity price result in modified charging patterns. By implementing an intelligent vehicle charging solution it is demonstrated how new charging schemes can be designed and tested using the proposed framework.}

abstract = {Background
Limited information is known about the storage conditions of medicinal products post-dispensing in Saudi Arabia (SA). The particularly hot and humid climate in the region may lead to the loss of essential performance specifications.
Objective
To investigate the conditions in which medications are held after being dispensed, and up until administration by households in SA. In addition, storage practices adopted by households in the region, as well as their knowledge and awareness are explored. This study also discusses the opportunity of utilising Time-Temperature Indicators (TTIs) in the pharmaceutical industry in SA as a quality-assurance enhancement solution.
Methods
A cross-sectional questionnaire targeted at households in SA was designed to explore storage practices, background knowledge and awareness of factors that can influence drug stability. Additionally, temperature and relative humidity mapping of 35 different rooms in various homes and cities in SA, as well as car interiors, was performed.
Results
More than 1000 households have participated in this study from all regions of SA. Approximately, 95% have claimed to take part in storing medications at home. First-aid and supplemental purposes were two of the reasons 80.9% have claimed, while 43.2% claimed treatment for chronic conditions. Just over 35% claimed that not knowing how to dispose of medications, is the reason behind their storage. More than 35% of participants could not identify most suitable storage conditions, and >10% were unaware of the effect storage conditions may have on shelf-life. Many were found to store medication in inappropriate areas, liquid dosage forms for example were stored in freezers by more than 3%. Upon monitoring temperatures of all room types, 25ºC was exceeded throughout a 24-hour duration in bathrooms, kitchens and limited use rooms. Temperatures in parked car interiors exceeded 70ºC.
Conclusions
A significant percentage of households in SA lacked knowledge and awareness of good storage practices. However, due to high temperatures observed in the region, increasing knowledge and awareness is not enough, as medicinal cabinets with basic temperature control (e.g. designated secure fridge) are needed. Additionally, the use of TTIs to provide consumers with accumulated thermal history may enhance quality-assurance of thermally sensitive products.}

A key challenge that needs to be faced in this respect is the ability to automatically discover and integrate heterogeneous sensor data streams on the fly for applications to use them. To provide a domain-independent platform and take full benefits from semantic technologies, in this paper we present an Automated Complex Event Implementation System (ACEIS), which serves as a middleware between sensor data streams and smart city applications. ACEIS not only automatically discovers and composes IoT streams in urban infrastructures for users’ requirements expressed as complex event requests, but also automatically generates stream queries in order to detect the requested complex events, bridging the gap between high-level application users and low-level information sources. We also demonstrate the use of ACEIS in a smart travel planner scenario using real-world sensor devices and datasets.}

Despite the academic discussion, farm factors remain detached from urban planning theories and practices. This study used a cross-sectional survey and remote sensing data to investigate farm factors influencing farmers’ cropland-use decisions. To measure human farm factors, a structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from a randomly selected 300 farmers in Jimma peri-urban areas while an unstructured questionnaire was used to gather views of conveniently recruited participants. Landsat-8 and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were employed to extract the physical factors. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model was used to determine significant farm factors of cropland-use decisions and the Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) model was applied to map the spatial variation in cropland-use decisions along the rural-urban continuum. The results revealed that farm factors influenced the cropland-use decisions of farmers. Cropland-use conversion rates increase with distance to the urban center due to greater access to social services. The conversion rates also increase with decreasing slope gradients and good soil quality. Farmers with higher farm income, labour, and extension have lower cropland-use conversion rates while those with higher non-farm income and labour, family size, farm size, and education have higher conversion rates. The findings of this study suggest that government policies aimed at restricting urban growth and sustaining ecosystem services should adopt farm factors to preserve prime cropland-use along the rural-urban continuum. Considering farm factors in urban land-use planning also promotes synergistic rural-urban planning integrations to bring balanced rural-urban development, poverty reduction, slow urban migration, and smart urban growth.}

In this manuscript, a pervasive controlled access method with privacy delegation (PCA-PD) is introduced to improve IoT application users’ security and privacy. The proposed method permits differential access control depending on the application usage and information request. The delegation of access is ensured based on trust and a shared keying model valid within the access session. In this method, information and time-based classification are performed to differentiate the access instance and information shared between the applications and IoT services. This helps to prevent security backtracking and request regeneration and also a failure in responses. The classification is performed independently, depending on the previous behavior of the application with the service provider. The proposed method’s experimental analysis shows that it can achieve high access control level, less delegation time, improved application classification, and success rate.}

Intercity connections or regional context influence city branding strategy adoption, a topic that has been neglected by previous research on city branding. The spatial relationships of city branding strategy adoption is a worthy topic due to preliminary signs of the relevance of such connections or relationships. This paper explores the spatial relationship of city branding strategy adoption in megacity regions from two perspectives: patterns and its influencing factors. Regarding patterns, megacities regions have shown spatial relationships in different city branding strategy adoption in both within and cross-regional comparisons. Considering influencing factors, this study finds that city branding strategy adoption in the three megacity regions has spatial correlations by using the spatial analysis method, while city branding strategy adoption in the same region tend to be influenced by economic or urban factors in similar ways. Thus, policymakers need to consider these spatial relationships in city branding designs and pay attention to the factors influencing city branding strategy adoption in their own regions.}

The nanofibers were responsible for the formation of well-dispersed curcumin (Cur) micro/nanoparticles in the nanocomposite films. The release of Cur from the films were affected by CNF and the sizes of Cur particles formed in situ. The Cur particles reduced tensile strength and increased water vapor permeability of BCNF film. However, CNF improved the mechanical strength and barrier property of the Cur/BCNF/CNF composite film. Moreover, the multi-nanoﬁbers composite film showed excellent dynamic antioxidant capacity and antibacterial activity, as well as was capable to monitor pH change and trace amount of boric acid. Results of this study suggested that the Cur/BCNF/CNF composite film can be used as a smart and active food packaging material.}

abstract = {The spatial dimension of the transition to a decarbonized power system becomes increasingly apparent with more than 1.5million renewable energy sources of electricity (RESE) plants operating all over Germany. The information regarding the spatial distribution of RES-E generation and power demand is still divers and not yet systematically used for the strategic planning of the energy transition and energy system modelling. The objective of this study is therefore to analyse the current power demand and RES-E supply spatially highly explicit with regard to their local interplay, annual balances and the share of volatile to flexible RES-E. This is achieved through the development and implementation of a general framework to analyse spatial patterns of the power system at different scales. The area of study is the Federal State of Germany, with the assessment of different spatial resolution ranging from federal state to community level. The resulting patterns are evaluated for their statistical significance through a hot spot analysis, followed by a correlation analysis to find possible reasons for their formation. The study shows a spatial dissonance between power demand and RES-E supply. This suggests that the design of the policy framework, focused on the levelized cost of electricity, led to a spatial distribution not oriented on local power demand but rather on economic optimality for the single power plant owner. By additionally differentiating between the RES-E technologies in terms of their intermittency characteristics, conclusions on the ability of regions at different scales for Smart Renewable Power Provision are drawn, measured by a set of proposed low carbon indicators. The spatially most detailed level reveals the diverse state of the regions with, on the one hand, already around 10% fulfilling the indicator limit of Smart Renewable Power Provision and, on the other hand, regions with no RES-E capacity installed. An algorithm for finding desirable trajectory pathways to a decentralized energy system is introduced, build on the knowledge of the current state of the local power system. Finally, the correlation analysis indicates that for the RES-E extension not only socioeconomic but also land use characteristics are important factors to consider.}

abstract = {Prior research on traffic event detection has encountered two problems: limited sample numbers and unbalanced datasets. Moreover, the real-time properties of event detection models must be enhanced to meet traffic management demands. To solve these issues, suitable measures must be implemented, like developing an intelligent algorithm for incident detection employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Automated Incident Detection (AID) methods are the focus of current Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology. Modern vehicles can connect with one other and with Roadside Infrastructure Units (RSUs) to improve road safety thanks to advancements in wireless connectivity and sensor technology. Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision issues involving complicated feature associations. This work proposes a Hybrid Deep Learning-based Automated Incident Detection and Management (HDL-AIDM) system to identify traffic incidents and improve traffic management. In the suggested model, a Temporal and Spatial Stacked Autoencoder (TSSAE) is used to collect temporal and spatial associations of traffic conditions and identify events. At the same time, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is employed to improve the number of samples and equalize datasets. The proposed model is assessed from many perspectives using the dataset from real-world situations. Based on the HDL output for AID, an efficient and intelligent traffic management algorithm has been accomplished using Road Side Units (RSUs) to gather traffic information. The suggested incident management algorithm considers lane shifts and the fluctuation in vehicle speed over time, which are heavily influenced by traffic incidents. These developments in ITS enable traffic management systems to use information gathered from HDL-based AID methods using TSSAE and GAN. The proposed strategies have been devised to notify drivers about traffic issues and help them avoid congestion. The suggested method provides higher incident detection rates with an accuracy of 94.1%, a 3.9% false alarm rate, and an incident classification rate of 93.3%.}

Moreover, we hypothesised and found that positive evaluations of the symbolic attributes are more likely to promote the adoption of sustainable innovations when people expect that few significant others would consider adoption. These findings suggest that weak adoption norms that are typical in the early adoption stage may both inhibit and promote adoption of sustainable innovations, via different routes.}

In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management.}

The existing grids cannot bear that load and also do not provide the interface with Distributed Renewable Energy Sources (DRES). Building new lines and substations alone do not serve the purpose of overcoming energy shortfall. Thus a major transformation in electricity infrastructure is need of the hour to meet the ever growing demands of electricity. Converting current power management system to a smart autonomic system is pertinent to achieve an increasing amount of renewable energy generation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of advances in control of smart grids. Various robust and adaptive strategies are spotlighted with a detailed description of control of overloads and power smart grids. Also, power generation, storage and management techniques and development of operational schedule of sources and loads are elaborated. Recently reported systems and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) techniques in smart grid are highlighted. Renewable energy has potential to eliminate the current electricity crisis in Pakistan's energy sector. The solar, wind, hydro and biogas/biomass are the alternative energy resources found abundantly in the country, which have tremendous potential to offer environment-friendly energy solutions. This in-depth study reveals that a lot of opportunities and potential of smart grid technology exist in developing countries like Pakistan that need to be exploited so as to cope with energy crisis.}

abstract = {This article focuses on the development of a general energy management system (EMS) design methodology using on model-based predictive control (MPC) for the control and management of microgrids. Different MPC-based EMS for microgrids have been defined in the literature; however, there is a lack of generality in the proposed that would facilitate adapting to new architectures, energy storage system technology, nature of the bus, application, or purpose. To fill this gap, a novel general formulation that is parameterizable, simple, easily interpretable, and reproducible in different microgrid architectures is presented. This is the result of the development of a novel methodology, which is also presented. It considers the state space formulation of the controller from the initial modelling phase, from the dynamics of the energy storage systems represented by their models to the subsequent definition of the optimisation problem. This is developed through the design of the general cost function and the formulation of constrains, by means of general guidelines and reference values. To evaluate the performance of the developed methodology, simulation tests were carried out for four different microgrid architectures, with different applications and objectives, also considering different generation conditions, demand profiles, and initial conditions. The results showed that, with some simple guidelines and regardless of the case study, the developed MPC controller design methodology can address the technical-economic optimisation problem associated with energy management in microgrids in an easy and intuitive way.}

They are linked to places, where various aspects of past events are projected and expressed by means of personal memories and narrations (urban memory), representing a promise for future: a vision of freedom, creativity, opportunity and prosperity. At the same time, technology is currently promoting unprecedented changes in urban areas, which are often marked as smart city developments. This paper studies the history of cultural and creative industries, bringing forward the dedicated digital storytelling strategies that promote active audience engagement in urban cultural heritage. A collaborative model is proposed and analyzed (in multiple perspectives), aiming at providing an integrated manner for heritage documentation, management and dissemination. The development deals with the Digital City of Thessaloniki, Greece, a big city, not a boundless one, rich in culture, but with rather poor heritage management mechanisms. The research focuses on theoretical and practical aspects for the citizens’ collection and interpretation of “digital heritage” documents (artifacts, places, etc.), resulting in a model that fuels audience engagement and collaboration of cultural organizations. Model-design is validated through state-of-the-art review and formative evaluation processes (both qualitative and quantitative), with an associated SWOT analysis that points out strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Although the proposed methodology has been adapted to the needs of a particular (digital) city, the current paper goes beyond a case study, as it brings forward novel technological and methodological guidelines, which could be successfully deployed in districts with similar cultural, geographical, and technical features.}

Such functionality, however, requires the constant collection of electricity data that can be used to undermine consumer privacy. In this work, we address this problem by proposing two decentralized protocols to securely aggregate the measurements of n smart meters. The first protocol is a very lightweight one, it uses only symmetric cryptographic primitives and provides security against honest-but-curious adversaries. The second protocol is public-key based and considers the malicious adversarial model; malicious entities not only try to learn the private measurements of smart meters but also disrupt protocol execution. Both protocols do not rely on centralized entities or trusted third parties to operate. Additionally, we show that they are highly scalable owning to the fact that every smart meter has to interact with only a few others, thus requiring only O(1) work and memory overhead. Finally, we implement a prototype based on our proposals and we evaluate its performance in realistic deployment settings.}

This emerging paradigm is called participatory sensing or mobile crowdsensing that is a viable alternative if the community finds incentives (good services) for urbanites to participate in context sharing. In this chapter, we present a generic framework built upon the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol for mobile participatory sensing–based smart city applications. Moreover, we illustrate its usage via two use-case application scenarios, namely a live transit-feed service and a smart campus scenario, which have been implemented on top of this framework.}

abstract = {In the realm of smart cities, understanding citizens' activity patterns is essential for effective urban planning and development. Weather condition plays a crucial role in shaping citizen's activities. This study investigates the impact of weather conditions on activity patterns by examining variations in visitor numbers at three types of sites in Guangzhou, China: parks, pedestrian streets and shopping malls, representing outdoor, semi-outdoor and indoor urban environment, respectively. Mobile phone signaling data and meteorological data were collected over two months, July and January 2022, representing the typical summer and winter conditions. With hourly visitor counts for the selected locations scaling to the magnitude of millions, the dataset offers significant representativeness. Our findings underscore that, predominantly temperature, exerts a marked influence on the choice of activities among Guangzhou's populace. As temperature rose, even during the hot summer month, the total number of visitors across the three types of locations increased. However, the frequency of park visitors exhibited heightened sensitivity to meteorological variations in comparison to their counterparts in pedestrian streets and shopping malls, with park visitor numbers in winter oscillating over a six-fold range due to climatic shifts. In contrast, the trend of visitor number to pedestrian streets and shopping malls tends to be less affected by weather conditions. Notably, the impact of weather on activity patterns varied among different groups. Males appeared more attuned to external conditions than females, with their presence in parks surging more noticeably with temperature increments—a gender ratio surpassing 1.7 in summer, further accentuating in winter. This starkly contrasts the gender ratios in pedestrian streets and malls, which aligned closely with the city's overall demographic distribution. Age emerged as another differentiating factor. Younger individuals (19–29 years) demonstrated a higher adaptability to the local high-temperature weather conditions, while during the winter season, a significant decrease in the number of visitors from this group was observed as the temperature dropped. Remarkably, within a narrow temperature bracket of 27 °C to 27.5 °C, the hourly count of visitors aged 19–29 on pedestrian streets experienced a six-fold variance, ranging from just over 0.1 million to nearly 0.7 million. This suggests that factors beyond weather play a significant role in influencing the mobility choices of young adults. In contrast, the 30–39 age bracket showcased more robust correlations with weather patterns. The number of older visitors remained relatively stable and did not change significantly with weather changes, especially those aged 60 and above. Drawing on robust evidence from large-scale mobile phone signaling data, this study can inform local policy-making in smart city development.}

The analysis of human speech and audio signals plays a crucial role which indicates physical and psychological well-being. Selecting appropriate features is very important and can greatly impact the overall signal processing and computation when developing these models based on speech applications. In the audio signal processing field, many features are available in the time, frequency, and statistical domain, and selecting proper features is a tedious task. But after feature selection, the stability analysis of these techniques is also equally important. This study considers these two problems by applying swarm intelligence-based feature selection techniques with higher stability. The optimized selected features are used for remote detection of voice-based pathological diseases, environmental sound detection in smart cities, acoustic sound quality assessment in amusement parks, and its impact on human psychological health. The proposed feature selection techniques are observed to perform comprehensively better than the standard speech features-based models in terms of both performance and computational complexities.}

Specifically, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices are used for converting various resources into smart manufacturing objects (SMOs) and their interactions thus are able to real-time reflect the production operations and behaviors. By innovatively using a laser-scanner in the shopfloor, iVTP is able to real-time display the movements of various SMOs and twin the real-time RFID data to show their states. A Cloud-based system architecture which enables all the services packaged and deployed in a Cloud allows typical end-users to easily define their production logics, download useful services, and develop their customized services. Several demonstrative scenarios are presented to show how iVTP can facilitate the typical decision-making, production and logistics operations in a smart factory.}

This study examines a method for providing adequate ventilation in homes while reducing energy consumption and peak demand: “smart” control of ventilation through sensing of occupancy and modulation of ventilation fans. We first conducted a detailed simulation study of advanced California homes with several occupancy-based ventilation control strategies. We then look at how general these results are nationally through a second simulation campaign in 15 ASHRAE climate zones. All simulations compared equivalent indoor air quality situations and assessed energy savings benefits. A key difference from previous demand-controlled ventilation strategies is that our study includes the effects of building related contaminants that are continuously emitted, irrespective of occupancy status, consistent with the requirements in ASHRAE Standard 62.2–2016. Under this new assumption, it is very difficult to extract substantial energy savings using only occupancy sensing. For the baseline strategy, savings were less than 10% of ventilation energy and sometimes negative in all cases analyzed other than leakier 2-story homes. Addition of a pre-occupancy flush period increases savings somewhat, but savings are still less than 15% other than in 2-story leakier homes.}

The paper identifies 13 different roles of the state: observer, warner, mitigator, opportunist, facilitator, lead-user, enabler of societal engagement, gatekeeper, promoter, moderator, initiator, guarantor and watchdog. The conceptualization of these roles serves to understand that the transformative agency of the state is leveraged/constrained by the modes of governance, and that it is also ultimately exercised through specific mixes of roles.}

Based on the case study, CP technologies can result in significant benefits to the economy, environment, and society. A cost-benefit analysis shows that benefits can be more than 7 times the costs in terms of present values. Social benefits can amount to more than $77M in the period of study when only 3 % of the truck population uses smart GPS technologies. Environmental benefits of 1 % CP technologies penetration in the truck industry are equivalent to GHG emissions savings from 46,930 passenger vehicles driven for one year. Benefits become more significant with higher penetration rates. For example, at 5 % usage rate of GPS technologies in the trucking industry in Tennessee, CO2 emissions will decrease by more than 1 million metric tons per year.}

We use the concept of energy signatures, a scatter plot with outside air temperature on the x-axis and electricity consumption on the y-axis, which condenses each building’s electricity use into one highly informative graph. Using a Support-Vector Regression model we extract the shape of each signature and cluster them subsequently. Dynamic time warping is used to align the signature shapes of all buildings. In two case studies, consisting of smart meter data sets from 408 and 480 buildings respectively, we show that our clusters correlated well to the heating system type and the building type by comparing to building-level metadata or demographic data.}

abstract = {A low-carbon pilot city bases its economy on energy efficiency, demonstrating an environmentally friendly development model and establishing a sustainable energy ecosystem. Establishing low-carbon pilot cities exerts both actual and exemplary effects in decreasing its CO2 emissions. However, research in the field of low-carbon measures has frequently bypassed their particular effects on sectors with high emissions, such as the hospitality industry. This study seeks to fill this void by assessing the influence of low-carbon city pilot policies (LCCP) on the hotel sector's carbon footprint. The analysis uses a PSM-DID model to review emission data across 49 prominent tourist cities in China over the period 2010–2020. It contrasts emission patterns between pilot and non-pilot cities. Findings reveal that LCCP markedly cuts CO2 output in hotels. This cutback stems from sectoral change, the growth of higher-rated hotels, and enhanced hotel occupancy rate. The policy's effects are especially strong in affluent regions and international tourist cities. These results point to LCCP's crucial contribution to sustainable hotel practices. The study emphasizes the necessity for precise environmental regulations in energy-intensive industries to meet wider sustainability objectives.}

The smart devices worn everyday by everyone let the users be projected into the so called IoT world, whose main aim is to provide tools and strategies to solve problems of everyday life as well as to improve well-being and quality of life. Such a goal can be achieved in several ways, but consumer specific services should be provided according to their daily habits, as well as temporary needs. This can be made possible by current mobile devices and their built-in sensors, which can infer the context where the owner operates and the performed activities to build up a user profile. In this work, an architecture for cloud services supply is proposed, based on subject continuous authentication and context (status/activity) recognition. A subject and the context are authenticated/recognised by means of the cyclic recognition of signals captured by the sensors of his/her smartphone, e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope. In order to test the accuracy of the proposed context recognition, the H-MOG dataset has been used, which provides joint acquisitions of status data (Sitting or Walking) related to the activity performed (Reading, Writing, or Navigating Map).}

abstract = {Smart home energy management (SHEM) with residential photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems is a complicated issue with different facets. An integrated SHEM model covering the essential functions is missing. Meanwhile, residential PV-battery systems' optimal operations with renewable energy exchanges and imperfect forecasts are still open challenges. In this study, the research activities in SHEM are firstly organized by a pyramid with four functional layers: (i) Monitoring; (ii) Analyzing and forecasting; (iii) Scheduling; and (iv) Coordinating, which can serve as a standard pathway for developing SHEM. Second, guided by the pyramid taxonomy, an integrated SHEM model is developed for residential houses with PV-battery systems. Assuming a perfect Monitoring layer, we obtain the probabilistic load/PV forecasts and user preference vectors of shiftable appliances based on historical data. Then, we develop a two-stage stochastic programming model for optimal scheduling of single houses with a grid-connected PV-battery system, incorporating the probabilistic forecasts and user preference vectors. A retail electricity market with day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) markets is employed for leveraging imperfect forecasts. Finally, we design a distributed coordinating algorithm - Asynchronous Scheduling and Iterative Pricing for PV power-sharing among multiple prosumers based on the single-house scheduling model. Numerical simulations based on realistic loads and PV generation data validated the two-stage stochastic programming model's economic superiority and the distributed PV power-sharing approach compared with the rule-based dispatching and selfish scheduling strategies. We concluded that 1) the modeling of load/PV forecast uncertainties is valuable than averaging or ignoring them, 2) the two-stage stochastic programming model and the DA-RT retail electricity market are beneficial for utilizing imperfect forecasts, and 3) coordinating multiple prosumers could benefit each household by sharing PV and battery investments for revenue or trading with local small prosumers for cost reductions.}

IoT brings intelligence to critical aspects like transportation, industry, payments, health and many others. The interaction between embedded devices and Cloud based web services is a common scenario of IoT deployment. From the security point of view, both users and smart devices must establish a secure communication channel and have a form of digital identity. Most of the times, the usage of IoT devices requires an already existing infrastructure which cannot be controlled by the device owner, for instance in a smart home. This scenario requires a security stack suitable for heterogeneous devices which can be integrated in already existing operating systems or IoT frameworks. This paper proposes a lightweight authorization stack for smart-home IoT applications, where a Cloud-connected device relays input commands to a user’s smart-phone for authorization. This architecture is user-device centric and addresses security issues in the context of an untrusted Cloud platform.}

To achieve the goal, global/local trip pattern indices and a hot-spot analysis were applied for the validation test as a comparison method in this study. Using those methods, the public traffic demands predicted by the simulation in the study area were evaluated comparing with ones in the smart-card data. As a result, FEATHERS Seoul shows the enough performance in predicting the global pattern of the public traffic demands, but a low performance in a local pattern, particularly in some areas with a mixture land-use type and/or a frequent public transit. This is because the current model does not handle such a complicate type of land-use and also a multi-modal trip in the simulation process. In conclusion, this study addressed the limits of the current model through the validation test using smart-card data and suggested some solution to the improvement in the specific models As a future work, we will apply smart-card data for the validation of the models operated in FS, such as a location choice model and a trip mode choice model.}

Traditional group technology (GT) focuses on whether a part has been operated on by a machine, but this study focuses on the sequencing of operations for a part, the volume (batch) of a part, and repeatable machines. This study proposes two algorithms based on the close-neighbor concept and takes into account these three factors. One of the algorithms considers volume (batch); the other does not. A GT efficiency measurement is proposed that considers part movement, machine movement, part volume, and group size, the last three being factors commonly excluded from the literature on GT efficiency calculations and operation sequence. Six numerical examples, which demonstrate the algorithm’s implementation, are compared with solutions generated by other algorithms from the literature, and the proposed algorithm is shown to have superior GT efficiency. Although increasing the number of groups can increase the GT efficiency, it can also, due to the effect of group size, increase the movements of the parts and/or the machines. All the resolutions can be used by managers making plant layout decisions.}

The drug was sensitive only to degradation with NaOH with the formation of the carboxylic acid derivative, identified by IR and 1H NMR analyses as 2-((1S,12bS)-1-ethyl-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b-octahydroindolo[2,3-a] quinolizin-1-yl) acetic acid, (DEG). In this study five simple, smart and univariate stability indicating spectrophotometric methods were developed and validated for simultaneous determination of VNB and DEG for the first time. The developed methods include; Dual Wavelength Method (DWM), Dual Wavelength Resolution Method (DWRM), Factorized Absorbance Difference Method (FADM), Advanced Absorbance Subtraction Method (AASM), and Derivative Amplitude Factor Method (DAFM). These methods were capable of determination of VNB and DEG over the ranges of 1–30 and 3–50 µg/mL, respectively. The proposed methods were simple, smart, specific, and could be applied for analyzing synthetic mixtures of VNB and DEG and were successfully applied for determination of the drug in commercially available capsules. The obtained results of these methods were statistically compared with the reported HPLC one using student's-t and F- tests, where no significant difference was observed. Validation of the developed methods was applied according to ICH recommendations and all the results were within the acceptable limits.}

In this transition, technological advancement and institution quality has emerged as viable solutions to ensure sustainable city development. However, urban inequality, economic conditions, and institutional quality across cities have produced mixed yet controversial outcomes. By dividing the Italian cities into three economic levels, this article uncovers the relationship between technological advancement, institutional quality, and environmental and social sustainability using data from 2010 to 2019. The GLS model results show that a city's economic development rate significantly influences the potential impact of technological advancement and institutions on environmental and social sustainability, also suggesting that technological advancement is associated with environmental and social sustainability in the longer run. At the same time, institutional quality is not an effective variable in the Italian context. The results produce policy and academic implications concerning the current trend in the institutional capacity to ensure environmental and social sustainability and support the current debate concerning the role of technological advancement in cities in supporting environmental conditions and socially sustainable societies.}

Use case results confirm that blockchain will disrupt urban networks, like Cybernetics did in 1948, Ekistics a decade later, and the Metabolists and Webbists in the late sixties. The Ubiquitous Computing arrived later, in the seventies, and disrupted all the previous network efforts, lasting until the current Internet of Things (IoT) and its sister concept Smart Cities, when IoT is used in an urban context.

abstract = {Recent advances in information and communications technology (ICT) have initiated development of a smart electrical grid and smart buildings. Buildings consume a large portion of the total electricity production worldwide, and to fully develop a smart grid they must be integrated with that grid. Buildings can now be ‘prosumers’ on the grid (both producers and consumers), and the continued growth of distributed renewable energy generation is raising new challenges in terms of grid stability over various time scales. Buildings can contribute to grid stability by managing their overall electrical demand in response to current conditions. Facility managers must balance demand response requests by grid operators with energy needed to maintain smooth building operations. For example, maintaining thermal comfort within an occupied building requires energy and, thus an optimized solution balancing energy use with indoor environmental quality (adequate thermal comfort, lighting, etc.) is needed. Successful integration of buildings and their systems with the grid also requires interoperable data exchange. However, the adoption and integration of newer control and communication technologies into buildings can be problematic with older legacy HVAC and building control systems. Public policy and economic structures have not kept up with the technical developments that have given rise to the budding smart grid, and further developments are needed in both technical and non-technical areas.}

Tourism destinations' websites play an important role in the communication of sustainable tourism products and behaviors and have been receiving increasing attention in research on sustainability communication in tourism. However, the development of a holistic approach to online sustainability communication at the destination level remains challenging and requires further research. This study introduces a text-mining approach based on the creation of an ad-hoc dictionary to provide insights into how 10 European tourism cities communicate sustainability on their websites. Based on this approach, an assessment of online sustainability communication in these cities is performed through the definition and measurement of specific indicators relating to presence, depth and dispersion. The results show how this approach can be used to automatically assess the depth and the relative balance of communication across the environmental, socio-cultural, economic, and general dimensions of sustainability. Based on a large-scale, comparable analysis of sustainability-related online content, the proposed approach provides a tool to assist the design and improvement of websites for promoting sustainable tourist behavior and supporting sustainable destination management towards the green transition.}

This paper employs a multi-level perspective approach to socio-technological transitions to examine why the Canadian province of Ontario has seen a relatively smooth transition of smart meter technologies from the niche to regime levels as compared with other Canadian provinces, and other jurisdictions in the United States, European Union, and Australia. The paper also examines the reasons for Ontario's advanced legislative and policy framework around Smart Grid development, relative to those of other provinces. The complex institutional landscape around electricity that has emerged in Ontario since the break-up of the province's monopoly utility Ontario Hydro in the late 1990s emerges as a significant factor in both outcomes. The role of the province's municipally-owned LDCs spell out "local distribution companies (LDCs) as the primary agents for smart meter deployment, as opposed to a dominant vertically integrated utility, appears to have had an important mediating effect on public opposition to smart meters. With respect to Smart Grid policy, the diversity of high capacity institutional actors that now define the province's electricity policy landscape has facilitated the emergence of several interagency policy development niches. In a manner consistent with the concept of technological niches in the socio-technical transitions literature, the interagency status of these policy niches has shielded them from the regime level selective pressures that would likely have existed in a more unified institutional structure, and empowered new policy ideas to move from the niche to regime levels. These outcomes have significant implications for the understanding of socio-technological transitions, particularly around the role of institutional complexity in the emergence of niches for technology and policy development purposes and in niche to regime level transitions.}

We contrast a Smart City approach and a urban computing one, and we argue that the latter is more fruitful in the long run, since it entails elements for the establishment of forms of recursive engagement of users, who co-produce digital commons together with technology designers as a response to their matters of concern. Applying our framework to the design of urban technologies, we conclude that design should support collaborative practices starting from the articulation of matters of concern to designing in a participatory way.}

Besides the fact that these messages can suffer delays that cause rendering inconsistencies, they also represent an overhead on the network. This overhead can be significant, as the number of MMOG players is very large, but reducing the number of messages is not trivial. The classic strategy to predict movement avoiding message exchange is based on the Dead Reckoning algorithm, which has several limitations. Other strategies have been proposed more recently that improve the results, but rely on expert knowledge. In this work we propose Smart Reckoning, a movement prediction strategy based on machine learning. The strategy consists of two phases. In the first phase, a learning model classifies whether the classical Dead Reckoning algorithm is able to predict the new avatar position correctly or not. In case the conclusion is negative, another learning model is used to predict the new direction. The proposed strategy was applied to the World of Warcraft game. The learning models were implemented with the Weka tool using real game trace data, and results are presented for the accuracy of multiple algorithms.}

abstract = {Wireless capacities and battery energy of smart mobile devices (SMDs) are constrained, and therefore, only limited tasks of applications can be executed in SMDs. To solve this problem, some computation tasks in SMDs can be partially offloaded to edge servers with larger processing capacities. Nonetheless, communication latency is caused for offloaded tasks because of channel bandwidth limits between SMDs and edge servers due to the task offloading. This work designs an energy-efficient task offloading approach to achieve energy consumption minimization for edge servers and SMDs by comprehensively specifying a task offloading ratio, SMDs’ processing speeds and transmission power, and channel bandwidth allocation. Specifically, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is formulated for a smart edge provider. Then, it is solved by using a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm with genetic operations for obtaining a close-to-optimal task offloading strategy for edge servers and SMDs. It is evaluated by adopting real-life data from Google production cluster, and simulation results demonstrate that it achieves less consumption of energy for the smart edge provider in a faster way compared with its two state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms.}

abstract = {Although smart grid technology has been extensively accepted, social factors influence the performance of smart grid systems. This smart technology will enable the automated monitoring and control of the power delivery system, increase the capacity of the power delivery system, and enhance the performance and connectivity of end users. However, the perceptions of end users are a key factor for adoption of this technology. When end users do not fully accept the smart grid, the operation of the smart grid is not satisfactory. Most literature has concentrated on the technological aspects of smart grids; a technological solution may be defined as one that requires a change only in the developed technology, demanding little or no change in human values or ideas of morality about the usage of electrical energy. However, the solutions to the problems of implementing smart grid technology are not to be found only in technological aspects. This paper presents experimental scenarios that use signal detection theory (SDT), a well-known tool in psychology research, to capture the perceptions of end users about smart grid technology. If the perceptions of end users are positive, the performance of the smart grid is improved. End user criteria can be analyzed using SDT. In addition, fuzzy logic type 2 is suggested as a way to increase the descriptive power of fuzzy signal detection theory. To obtain end user perceptions, several experimental scenarios were created using a didactic smart grid system designed by Delorenzo Group Italy. End users were faced with real situations that enabled determination of their perceptions about the smart grid technology. Experimental results of end users׳ perceptions of smart grid technology are shown using SDT, fuzzy detection theory, and fuzzy detection theory type 2. The results show that end users have a conservative criterion because they are not entirely confident in the intelligent technology provided by the smart grid; this conservative criterion limits smart grid performance.}

But due to unintended urbanization, which contributes to increased impervious surface areas with several environmental issues. There was a requirement to assess and map the urban built-up impervious areas for solving various socio-environmental issues. This work attempts to evaluate and implement machine learning (ML) based supervised classifiers to semi-automate the process for extraction, quantification and mapping of urban built-up impervious areas. The work emphasised on the usage of freely available open-source high-resolution satellite datasets acquired from Sentinel-2 mission. Three different machine learning-based supervised classification techniques were evaluated for a better understanding of feature extraction methods along with suitable classifier for classification of urban impervious areas. It is a well-known phenomenon that an increase in the impervious surface contributes to declining of green cover. Also, a zonal analysis of extracted built-up impervious surfaces was conducted to understand the spatial configuration of the pilot study area. This zonal assessment of urban built-up impervious surfaces can be used as a worthy tool for better sustainable smart cities development. These can serve as a valuable resource for restoring the required urban green cover for better sustainable urban development.}

Drawing on desktop research and semi-structured interviews, this paper has two major findings. First, the development of smart grids in Korea has been shaped by various factors including macroeconomic policy, the role of the government, and experimentation. The complex interactions between these factors at the landscape, regime and niche levels has impacted on the development of smart grids. Second, while Korea's government-led approach has its strengths in driving change, it has also exposed weaknesses in the country's ability to mobilise the private sector and consumer participation. Major obstacles including partial electricity market reform and public distrust exist. A systemic perspective is needed for policy in order to accommodate the changes required for smart grid development. Regulatory reforms, particularly price-setting mechanisms, and consumer engagement are priority areas for policy change.}

Add to this the damage to over 100,000 homes and the impact on the lives of the 436,000 residents of Greater Christchurch. The Canterbury Earthquakes have provided an unprecedented opportunity to rethink, revitalise and renew Central Christchurch. Aided by an investment of greater than NZ$40bn, sourced via insurance, central and local government contributions and topped up by commercial and private investment, with construction at its peak, we are experiencing a spend rate exceeding NZ$100M per week. Out of the rubble is emerging a well-formed and vibrant city centre that produces economic and social benefits by bringing together people for business, cultural or social activities. The “new Christchurch” is being built upon the principles of resilience, sustainability and connectedness, whilst also reflecting our history through the retention and enhancement of key heritage buildings and infrastructure assets framed by green spaces and accessible pathways. This paper introduces some of the initiatives put in place as building blocks to drive the recovery of the new City Core, and indeed greater Christchurch and Canterbury Area. These initiatives range from improved building structural standards and codes, to ‘Green’ building rating tools, to Energy Design Advice Grants and “Smart City” development principles. The new Christchurch can be (and is being) defined by its accessible, connected, resilient and high performing building stock. Only time will be the ultimate judge, however after just over 5 years, the city is going from strength to strength and Christchurch continues to provide a significant contribution to the national economy.}

We address this gap by taking China's national big data comprehensive pilot zone (NBD-CPZ) as a quasi-natural experiment, and evaluating its impact on city eco-efficiency using data for 284 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2020. The study found that the NBD-CPZ significantly improved city eco-efficiency, and this impact increased gradually over time. A mechanism analysis shows that the NBD-CPZ impacted city eco-efficiency by reducing mismatched resources and promoting green technology advances. A heterogeneity analysis indicates that the NBD-CPZ's effect on city eco-efficiency was more significant in old industrial cities, resource-based cities, and cities with high energy intensity. This study provides empirical evidence and highlights policy implications for narrowing the ecological civilization disparities between regions from the perspective of a digital economy.}

IoT itself is a complex and heterogeneous network that allows access to the cloud that raises numerous privacy and security challenges. When devices access the cloud for storage or services that are provided by other cloud services, it is important to identify and eliminate malicious service providers. Different encryption approaches have been proposed, however, these cause more energy consumption. In the IoT scenario, several nodes are located in a remote area where a consistent supply of energy is impossible. To address this challenge, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based autonomic trust management approach, named AutoTrust, is proposed in this paper, which can predict the malicious behaviors of nodes and eliminate them. The proposed mechanism maintains a set of standards provided by the trustors offering an additional tier of security. A novel dataset consists of 70,000 values has been utilized to train and test the model. The AutoTrust is evaluated and compared with the existing mechanisms, where the results show that the proposed mechanism can provide better privacy and security.}

abstract = {Sustainable urban logistics is imperative to meet urban sustainability goals. In the European context, the European Union (EU) set an ambitious target in 2011 of essentially CO2-free urban logistics by 2030. However, it is unclear how effectively such EU targets for urban logistics have shaped national- and urban-level policymaking. This paper investigates whether there is evidence of localization of these supranational goals for urban logistics at the national and local levels. Drawing on the ‘steering effects’ framework, we seek such effects across four dimensions—institutional, discursive, relational and resources. Empirically, we conduct a thematic analysis of transport-related documents across three governance levels—the EU, the national level of Norway and the local level comprising four Norwegian cities. Our findings show that the EU's urban logistics goals are reflected in changing policy behaviour at the national and local levels over time. Yet this is more evident in some areas than in others: the discursive effect is most evident at both the national and local levels, whereas the institutional effects at both these levels remain fragmented and weak. Therefore, the EU's goalsetting does matter, but we have yet to see strong effects beyond the discursive.}

This paper investigates why this relationship exists for fourteen small and mid-sized cities across the U.S. (seven with high bicycling rates and seven paired comparison cities) using ten years of data and hierarchical negative binomial regression models. Findings confirm that higher-bicycling cities are significantly associated with better overall road safety outcomes. In terms of mode choice differences, pedestrian ‘safety in numbers’ as well as reduced driving activity had a positive impact on pedestrian safety. Results from hierarchical negative binomial regressions also suggest that more compact cities were significantly associated with better road safety outcomes for all road users. In terms of socio-demographic and socio-economic factors, the results reveal equity concerns with areas with lower incomes and more non-White residents seeing more overall road fatalities.}

The new model specifically considers (i) the availability of Smart Grid technologies improving the performance of the distribution system, and/or (ii) the availability of the technologies shifting the demand from peak hours to off-peak hours. Multi-objective multi-period generation expansion planning problems are solved to determine the electricity generation technology options to be added, and where in the grid they should be constructed to simultaneously minimize multiple objectives such as cost and air emissions, e.g., CO2. Unmet demand is also considered as a cost in the objective function so that the proposed approach considers the reliability of the system. The approach used here explicitly considers availability of the system components and operational dispatching decisions. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate component availability scenarios, and then, the mixed-integer optimization problem is solved to find optimum expansion solutions considering these scenarios.}

abstract = {With rapid industrialization and urbanization, the risk of summer heat exposure for urban dwellers has increased. The use of air conditioners (ACs) has become the most common personal cooling strategy, but further increasing fossil fuel consumption. As sustainable and affordable cooling strategies, urban parks can reduce heat exposure and substitute a part of air conditioners use. This study evaluates the heat exposure reduction from personal cooling to urban parks based on satellite images, questionnaire surveys, and network analysis in Liuzhou, one tropical city in China. We found that residents with lower income had a higher risk of heat exposure. Among the respondents, 85 % of residents chose to use ACs to alleviate high temperatures in summer, and 81.8 % among them were willing to access park cooling area (PCA) to cool off instead of using ACs. About one third parks could serve as potential alternatives (with temperatures <28 °C) to air conditioning, reducing carbon emissions by 175.93 tons per day during the hot summer and offsetting 2.5 % of urban fossil fuel carbon emissions. The design of parks should give more consideration to elder people and provide a good cooling platform for various social income groups. Future planning should also focus on accessibility to enable residents to fully utilize the parks. Building parks within 34.10 ha would provide a more efficient use of land. This research guides sustainable, high-quality growth in industrial cities and might contribute to promotion of low-carbon cities and social equity.}
