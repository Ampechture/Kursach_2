abstract = {Recently, the concept of the smart city has gained growing popularity. As cities worldwide have set the aim to harness digital technologies to their development, increasing focus came to lie on the potential challenges and concerns related to data-driven urban practices. In the existing literature, these challenges and concerns have been dominantly approached from a pragmatic approach based on the a priori assumed ‘goodness’ of the smart city; for a small group of critics, the very notion of the smart city is questionable. This paper takes the middle-way by interrogating how municipal and civil society stakeholders problematize the challenges and concerns related to data-driven practices in five Dutch cities, and how they act on these concerns in practice. The lens of problematization posits that the ways of problematizing data-driven practices contribute to their actual enactment, and that this is an inherently political process. The case study shows that stakeholders do not only perceive practical challenges but are widely aware of and are (partly) pro-actively engaging with perceived normative-ethical and societal concerns, leading to different (sometimes inter-related) technological, legal/political, organizational, informative and participative strategies. Nonetheless, the explicit contestation of smart city policies through these strategies remains limited in scope. The paper argues that more research is needed to uncover the structural-institutional dynamics that facilitate and/or prevent the repoliticization of smart city projects.}

Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks. The benefits due to the expanded network access and enhanced connectivity between devices also intrinsically increase cybersecurity risks. Cyber attackers will be provided with additional digital targets; in addition, wireless and mobile network including the access channel infrastructure will be shared between independent services. To address these cybersecurity issues, this article presents the Blockchain Random Neural Network for Cybersecurity applications in a holistic digital and physical cybersecurity user and channel authentication methods. The user identity is kept secret as the neural weights codify the user information, although in case of cybersecurity breach, the confidential identity can be mined and the attacker identified. The proposed method therefore enables a decentralized authentication method. The validation results prove that the addition of the Blockchain Random Neural Network provides a user access control algorithm with increased cybersecurity resilience and decentralized user access and connectivity.}

abstract = {A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation’s companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies.}

Currently, a number of smart devices employ face, fingerprint, and voice modalities for user verification. However, the biometric data acquired by these devices can be digitally manipulated or tampered with, that can compromise the security of the smart environment. Further, the preponderance of biometric data such as face and voice in social media applications, necessitates the validation of their integrity.

Many Ambient Assisted Living systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes. Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for Android Apps. The proposed algorithms can improve the privacy protection of Ambient Assisted Living App users in smart cities and relieve them through cognitive offloading.}

Large amounts of superior services can be provided by analyzing the information. However, lots of IoT devices generating the information do not have sufficient resources to resist malicious attacks so that the devices deliberately upload the tampered data, which reduces quality of service. To solve the problem, we propose a data source trusted proof mechanism based on the node security measurement and threshold ring signature method. The mechanism firstly judges whether a node is in a trusted domain based on the proposed Distributed Sub-domain Networking (DSN) method to reduce energy consumption and avoid single point failure. Then, it quantifies security value of the nodes in the trusted domain based on the proposed three-dimension security measurement method. Finally, it confirms authenticity of the nodes using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based threshold ring signature scheme.Simulation results show our proposed mechanism can distinguish all malicious nodes among trusted nodes, the loss rate of trusted nodes is reduced to less than 5% and the false report rate is reduced to less than 10%.}

By considering wireless signal transmission from various mobile nodes in a simulation testbed mean square error analysis and probability of error are obtained in matrix laboratory(MATLAB)software. Simulation results show that mean square error analysis of LOS is by far improved in 3 dB in comparison to NLOS environment for single antenna technology specified by single input single output(SISO) and multiantenna technology represented in the form of multiple input multiple output(MIMO) technology. Further, probability of error (Pe) of SISO and MIMO systems are also analysed and similar improvement in performance is also obtained for baseband analysis of smart cities.

In the water sector, smart water metering infrastructure has been positioned to alleviate key water management and water access challenges. To date, there has been little empirical investigation into how it is deployed, implemented and experienced by end-users in urban Global South contexts. This study uses a socio-technical lens to address this evidence gap with a mixed-method empirical case study from urban Ghana. Results show smart meters as a utility-centric socio-technical infrastructure, with the water utility having designed the customer out of its current rollout approach. The utility's approach is an incremental one that is responsive to the existing context yet provides limited upgrades and impacts to existing systems and actors. We demonstrate how smart meters are much more than neutral, often shaped through everyday realities but have also become new junctions of friction, mistrust and scepticism between the utility and users. In exploring these issues, we raise questions about the smart metering agenda and related digital transformation policies of utilities, highlighting directions towards more customer-centric design and implementation in the design and deployment of digital water infrastructure.}

Therefore, considering the significance of sensor data in this guided vehicle environment, this article introduces Responder-dependent Additive Information Fusion (RAIF) scheme. This scheme observes the responding sensor information for determining the achievement level of the target endorsed for the guided vehicle. The multi-instance sensor information is gathered from the Internet of Things (IoT) based connected devise. The timely responding sensors and its data are correlated with the previous history for improving the precision of navigation of the guided vehicles. This scheme relies on classification machine learning for identifying remitting and un-remitting instances based on correlation for information fusion. This helps to identify the error causing sensor information and to mitigate them from fusion to improve the precision of achieving the target.}

On the other hand, the term “floating city” has been studied for just only a few years as alternative living spaces for humanity across the world since land scarcity has already begun. Therefore, in this research, we propose multi-objective optimization algorithms to obtain the Pareto front solutions for the cuboid open traveling salesman problem (COTSP) in a “smart floating city” context. Given n nodes and the distances between each pair of nodes, the COTSP in this paper aims to find the shortest possible tour with a traveling distance that starts from the depot (i.e., node 1) and visits each node exactly once without needing to return to the depot. As known, a cuboid has height, length, and depth and the COTSP defines its x, y, z coordinates as a cuboid corresponding to height, length, and depth. In addition to the traveling distance, the platform (building breakwaters) cost is measured by the z coordinates (depths) of the nodes/platforms that represent both the platforms below the sea level. Note that unlike the traditional TSP, it has a variable seed number and a variable number of nodes/platforms in each solution. The paper aims to find the Pareto front solutions by minimizing the traveling distance and platform cost of the infrastructures below the sea level simultaneously. We develop a multi-objective self-adaptive differential evolution (MOJDE) algorithm, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII), and a harmony search (MOHS) algorithm to solve the problem in such a way that we minimize the traveling distance while minimizing the platform cost simultaneously. All algorithms are compared to each other. The computational results show that the MOJDE and NSGAII algorithms outperform the MOHS algorithm in terms of commonly used performance measures from the literature.}

New Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) are changing the way in which the world works. These technologies provide new tools to face the issues of contemporary society (poverty, migrations, sustainable development challenges, governance, etc.). Among them, blockchain emerge as a disruptive technology able to make things in a completely different and innovative way. They can provide solutions where before there were none. Recently, these technologies have become subject of intense research and development by industry and academia. In consequence, a large amount of interesting works is published in many areas, proposing solutions, services, frameworks and applications based on these technologies. The research focusing on the previous challenges are especially interesting in current society. However, the proposals arrive at higher speed than society can assimilate them, and sometimes they are not properly exploited. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the blockchain technology to identify what are its key attributes that enable to successfully address the social challenges. The review has been conducted from three point of views: service-delivery, resource-management and city-administration, and has been focused on the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, in order to cover the full agenda of current social issues. The contributions of this work are an exhaustive compilation of the existing research on blockchain technology to tackle the social challenges from several angles, and the identification of the key features and the conditioning factors of the practical applicability of the technology.}

Discourses on “smart urbanism” are being discussed and lead to the proposal of changes to urban models and reference systems through local anchoring, a rethinking of governance, the participation of citizens, and the strengthening of their capacities (“smart citizens”). In this contribution, we observed the path of learning cities promoted by UNESCO, which, as the French examples (Clermont-Ferrand) have shown us, is decisive for the “good life”. We can see the emergence of a coexistence between “smart city” and “learning city”, which contributes to the management of urban transitions and can lead to functional complementarities and increase the capacity for adaptation and resilience. Hybridization creates tensions and controversies but also helps with regulations and coordination. It encourages citizen participation, collective dynamics, and lifelong learning but also new forms of local anchoring, relationships with the environment and social interactions favorable to the quality of life.}

abstract = {The amalgamation of Internet of Things (IoT) and communication systems within Smart Grid Control Systems (SGCS) has amplified their susceptibility to cyber-attacks, posing a significant threat. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs), originally designed for securing IT systems, exhibit limitations in SGCS due to reliance on predefined structures and training on specific cyber-attack patterns. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework to establish balanced representations for the inherently asymmetric SGCS datasets. These representations are seamlessly integrated into a dedicated DL-based model for attack detection within the SGCS environment. Utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), the model identifies novel cyber-attack representations. Performance evaluation through 10-fold cross-validation on two real SGCS datasets reveals the proposed approach's superiority over traditional methods like Random Forest (RF) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Additionally, the generalized method can be effortlessly implemented in existing SGCS infrastructures with minimal complexity. This study introduces a novel cybersecurity enhancement method for Smart Grid Control Systems by integrating a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin with a deep learning-based IDS. This approach intricately models both physical and cyber components, facilitating real-time training and fine-tuning of the intrusion detection model using synthetic cyber threats. The digital twin undergoes rigorous testing to assess the model's effectiveness, employing scenario analyses to identify vulnerabilities and formulate response strategies. The adaptive digital twin fosters a proactive cybersecurity stance by implementing security measures such as access controls and cyber range simulation. Real-time monitoring, analytics, and stakeholder collaboration enhance incident response readiness. The lifecycle simulation, spanning from model development to deployment, ensures alignment with regulations. This integrated approach not only detects but proactively responds to cyber threats, fortifying Smart Grid Control Systems against evolving risks.}

abstract = {The current economic growth model has changed from efficiency development to innovation development. Ecological environment and other problems are still very prominent, the industry is lack of close integration, universities and scientific research institutions lack a sound science and technology service system. The purpose of this study is to explore the functions of eco-innovation ecosystem based on smart city blockchain, put forward relevant policy recommendations, and provide theoretical and practical guidance for the development of an innovation ecosystem. Through the methods of network survey, macro cluster analysis and typical case analysis, present study analyzes the development of derivative products and the research status of an innovation ecosystem. Blockchain can be regarded as a trusted distributed database. Four core mechanisms, namely P2P network communication mechanism, blockchain account book storage mechanism, password mechanism and consensus mechanismare used to ensure the distributed, tamper-proof and non-repudiation characteristics of the system, which makes the blockchain system “honest” and “transparent”. It has the characteristics of a wide range, cross-subject, high efficiency and low cost in application. Taking the city as an example, this paper investigates the development of the green building industry and the relationship between the innovation ecosystem. The results showed that the α coefficient reliability index of all variables was above 0.8 in terms of ecological reliability and validity, which proved that all the scales in this study had good reliability, KM0 values were more than 0.7, and the degree of freedom was high, and all the scales had high convergence validity. Among the research objects associated with the ecosystem, “technological innovation” accounts for the largest proportion of 28% in the region, and the lowest proportion is 5% of high-tech enterprises.}

abstract = {There has been a surge in telecommunication network deployments across the globe to facilitate advanced communication infrastructure which is necessary for smart cities. This has in turn increased the power consumption of telecommunication networks, thus motivating the need to adopt green energy solutions like solar energy to power them. Base stations (BSs) are the primary entities contributing to the power consumption in the telecommunication network. To efficiently deploy solar powered base stations, it is imperative to optimally provision them with appropriate Photo Voltaic (PV) panel and battery resources. The ultimate goal of such dimensioning is to provide best possible quality of service (QoS) to the consumers while maintaining an optimal cost of deployment and operation. Both PV panels and the batteries are major contributors while calculating the overall cost of deployment and operation for a solar powered BSs. Therefore an accurate calculation of battery lifetime with respect to different PV panel dimension and battery sizes is an important step in cost optimal resource provisioning for the solar powered BSs. This issue is addressed in this paper by presenting an analytical scheme to estimate the battery lifetime for a particular resource provisioning of PV panels and batteries. This is then used for evaluating the cost-optimal photo-voltaic panel dimensions and battery size for the base station with acceptable limit of outage probability. The proposed methodology would find great relevance in developing energy efficient sustainable telecommunication networks for upcoming smart cities.}

The cities are surrounded by forests, agricultural land, or open areas, where fire incidence can occur threatening human life and causing many resources to become extinct. This article aims to design an early fire detection system to get rid of fire events using the concept of senor network and UAV’s technology. The architecture proposal is based on sensors for monitoring environmental parameters and to process the information through sensors and IoT application. The proposed fire detection system is the combination of wireless sensor technologies, UAVs, and cloud computing. Some image processing techniques are also integrated into the proposed fire detection system to identify the fire event with better accuracy and used as an integrated solution. To improve the true detection rate, rules are also designed. The simulation results of the proposed fire detection system are compared with several existing methods. It is observed that the proposed system has a higher fire detection rate to improve the true detection of forest fire from 95 to 98 percent.}

abstract = {This research aims to represent a novel approach to detect malicious nodes in Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) within the next-generation smart cities. Smart city applications have a critical role in improving public services quality, and security is their main weakness. Hence, a systematic multidimensional approach is required for data storage and security. Routing attacks, especially sinkholes, can direct the network data to an attacker and can also disrupt the network equipment. Communications need to be with integrity, confidentiality, and authentication. So, the smart city and urban Internet of Things (IoT) network, must be secure, and the data exchanged across the network must be encrypted. To solve these challenges, a new protocol using CLustering Multi-Layer Security Protocol (CL-MLSP) with AODV has been proposed. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is aligned with the proposed protocol for encryption and decryption. The shortest path is obtained by the clustering method based on energy, mobility, and distribution for each node. Ns2 is used to evaluate the CL-MLSP performance, and the parameters are network lifetime, latency, packet loss, and security. We have compared CL-MLPS with ECP-AODV, Probe, and Multi-Path. The proposed method superiority rates in energy consumption, drop rate, delay, throughput, and security performance are 6.54%, 12.87%, 8.12%, 9.46%, respectively.}

More precisely, data-driven smart applications that efficiently manage sparse resources are offering a futuristic vision of smart, efficient, and secure city operations. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the limitations of existing smart city deployment; hence; the development of systems and architectures capable of providing fast and effective mechanisms to limit further spread of the virus has become paramount. An active surveillance system capable of monitoring and enforcing social distancing between people can effectively slow the spread of this deadly virus. In this paper, we propose a data-driven deep learning-based framework for the sustainable development of a smart city, offering a timely response to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through mass video surveillance. To implementing social distancing monitoring, we used three deep learning-based real-time object detection models for the detection of people in videos captured with a monocular camera. We validated the performance of our system using a real-world video surveillance dataset for effective deployment.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the main component in the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities to sense our environment, gather essential and meaningful data, and forward it to the base station (BS). Nowadays, IoT utilizes WSN as a necessary platform for sensing and communication of the data. One of the main strategies to minimize consumption of energy in a WSN with highly dense sensors is to maximize sleeping sensors at each time. This way implies to schedule the activity of sensors, i.e. determining when a sensor node is kept idle (sleep mode) and when a sensor node is activated to sense environment (active mode). Due to heterogeneity of the sensor nodes in WSNs-based IoT for smart cities, one approach for scheduling the sensing activity is clustering the sensors into K mutually different subsets, so that every subset of sensors alone can cover all targets of the network. In this case, we can solve finding the maximum number of sensor subsets, or equivalently sensor covers problem, by conversion it to SET K-COVER problem. In this paper, an energy aware Grouping Memetic Algorithm (GMA) is proposed for solving the SET K-COVER problem. The proposed GMA varies in four general ways from any of the other evolutionary algorithms for solving the SET K-COVER problem. First, to transform solution structures linked to the SET K-COVER problem into chromosome genes, a new encoding scheme was being used. Second, specific genetic operators appropriate for the chromosomes are used, based on the encoding used. Third, to direct the search process in the solution space of the SET K-COVER problem, a novel proper fitness function is proposed. Fourth, a local improvement algorithm which uses a sensor dominance rule is proposed. This study, carried out detailed experiments of different numbers of targets and different numbers of sensors in WSNs to assess the proposed algorithm. In several instances of the problem, the experiments demonstrate that the algorithm works considerably better in terms of solution quality than many other heuristics and evolutionary algorithms and significantly outperformed the evolutionary algorithms in terms of runtime, suggesting the usefulness of the proposed algorithm to increase the lifetime of WSN in IoT and smart cities.}

To address this challenge, we propose an Efficient and Traceable IoT Data Sharing method (ETDS), which strives to solve the accountability problem of IoT data in multiparty sharing scenarios. The ETDS consists of a blockchain-based decentralized access control system and a commutative encryption and fingerprint system. ETDS not only implements data access authorization in a decentralized environment but also implements an efficient accountability mechanism for data leakages. Unlike other accountability solutions, the data accountability mechanism of ETDS is implemented in scenarios where the data and the applications are decoupled. This paper demonstrates the security and availability of ETDS through security analysis and an efficiency evaluation.}

This systematic review explores the recent literature concerned with new ‘smart city’ security technologies and aims to investigate to what extent these new interventions correspond with traditional functions of security interventions. Through an extensive literature search we compiled a list of security interventions for smart cities and suggest several changes to the conceptual status quo in the field. Ultimately, we propose three clear categories to categorise security interventions in smart cities: Those interventions that use new sensors but traditional actuators, those that seek to make old systems smart, and those that introduce entirely new functions. These themes are then discussed in detail and the importance of each group of interventions for the overall field of urban security and governance is assessed.}

abstract = {Modern cities currently face numerous challenges related to mobility, waste management, access to resources, etc. Smart Cities integrate information and communication technologies (ICT) to develop innovative solutions that can solve such challenges and create a higher quality of life for their citizens. Two elements need to be considered for smart cities to be successful. First, citizens must participate in the design of the smart city to take advantage of their ideas so that the smart city answers their real needs. Secondly, each city has its own unique characteristics that need to be considered to design a citizen participation strategy truly tailored and adapted to their respective context. In line with these two considerations, the goal of this paper is to identify the context factors that impact citizen participation strategies in smart cities. In order to reach that goal, we performed a qualitative case study of two cities that strive to be smart: Namur (Belgium) and Linköping (Sweden). This analysis allows us to understand how participation is implemented in two different cases and to infer the context factors that impact the respective strategies. Five context-factors have been identified in this study: the smart city consideration, the drivers for participation, the degree of centralization, the legal requirements, and the citizens’ characteristics. By identifying these factors, we can derive context-dependent recommendations about citizen participation for smart cities. These recommendations are then applied to the case of Brussels in Belgium.}

Two distinct smart energy systems are proposed: electrified and hydrogen cities, in which electricity and hydrogen are used to transfer energy from a variety of renewable sources to different energy demands (electricity, thermal energy, and hydrogen). The proposed optimization model includes minimizing the total annual cost as an objective function subject to various constraints that represent the features of the smart energy cities, such as different types of communities (urban and rural) and energy distribution methods (electricity and hydrogen grids). We then applied the proposed model to the design problem of a 100% RES energy network in Jeju Island, Korea. As a result, we identified the optimal system configuration and energy flow in each smart energy system and analyzed the major cost drivers in the levelized cost of energy of 0.43–0.65 $/kWh. Based on the results of the case study, we investigated the sensitivity of crucial factors such as the cost of the technology, the quantity and structure of the demand, and renewable sources potentials on the system configuration and economics. The global sensitivity analysis study provides comprehensive solutions for the design and operation of two smart energy systems in different locations and types of city.}

abstract = {Efforts aimed at addressing climate change have gained significant momentum in the past few years and following the Paris Climate Agreement. Recent data show that global temperatures are already about 1.1°C above preindustrial levels and the window to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C is rapidly closing. Cities account for over 70% of global CO2 emissions, indicating their significance for achieving climate stabilization targets. Recognizing this, many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and strategies to contribute to climate change mitigation. In the meantime, smart technologies are rapidly becoming ubiquitous in many cities around the world and governments and local authorities have used this as an opportunity to develop and implement smart city programs. While the impacts of smart city programs on urban CO2 emissions are not yet fully examined, it is hoped that they can contribute to meeting climate change mitigation targets. Through text mining of bibliometric data archived in the Web of Science, this chapter seeks to provide an overview of existing research at the intersection of climate change mitigation and smart city solutions and technologies. The chapter aims to discuss actual and potential contributions of smart city solutions, related to various urban systems, to climate change mitigation. Based on outputs of bibliometric analysis (term co-occurrence) obtained from the VOSviewer software tool, issues related to urban planning, buildings, transportation, waste management, energy and water resource, economy, urban infrastructure, and urban governance are discussed. It is argued that smart solutions and technologies have high potential to contribute to climate change mitigation. They can also provide co-benefits for climate change adaptation and sustainable development. However, appropriate planning and regulating measures are needed to avoid potential trade-offs and rebound effects. Such effects and trade-offs have also been discussed. Further, the need for integrated systems that accommodate different urban sectors is highlighted.}

The search revealed that social media and smart tourism are the themes with the greatest potential; sustainable cities, local destination development, changes in tourist behavior, and tourists’ risk perception are underdeveloped streams with enormous relevance and growth in the new normal. Research on the effects of COVID-19 on citizen health and its economic impact on the tourism industry and cities are intersectional and highly developed topics, although of little relevance. The current study also identifies the challenges of destination research for planners and proposes future research directions. Consequently, this paper contributes to the existing literature on COVID-19 and sustainable cities, as it develops a critical examination of the extant research and points out the research gaps that must be filled by future studies.}

The Chinese government has been devoting to the promotion of smart cities for many years. However, it is unconfirmed whether the city is more resilient with all the modern technologies provided when unexpected predicaments like climate changes or disasters occur. Therefore, it is urgent to consider resilience in the smart city. This paper provides a MCDM approach to assess and rank the resilience of 187 smart cities in China. The results demonstrate that the overall resilience of smart cities is at a relatively low level. There is also a significant unbalance of resilience between smart cities due to different infrastructural, economic, social, institutional, and environmental conditions. The potential links between urban smartness and resilience were also explored, and the results showed significant positive relationship between the smartness of a city and its resilience. Evidence also proved that developing smartness is more or less useful for improving urban resilience. Suggestions such as strengthening the development of infrastructure and economy, and enhancing the multi-stakeholders’ cooperation are proposed to further promote the smart and resilient development in China.}

Despite the enticing trend of public private partnerships (PPPs), city governments should evaluate the available options using an objective approach such as Multi-Attribute Utility Analysis (MAUA). The technique takes into account prioritized assessment criteria (which are tailor-made for smart city projects) and the relative utilities of the procurement options in meeting the criteria. The methodology of MAUA is demonstrated through a questionnaire survey and a focus group meeting involving public and private sector practitioners, and applied to 8 types of common smart city projects in Hong Kong, which is one of the metropolises earmarked to become a smart city by putting concepts into practice. Results show that not all projects are best suited to PPP and that there may be divergent views between the public and private sectors, with possibilities for a compromised decision which both sectors would accept.}

It is seen as a possible remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of the current common smart city practice.}

Mega cities in the rapidly urbanising economies develop a plethora of urban policies and plans cultivated by various state and local agencies. These are often overlapping or conflicting and as a result do not produce desired outcomes. Prospective smart cities tend to add a new layer of plan and devise extra institutional instrument in to this already complex environment. We challenge this idea of smart cities being another stand-alone initiative and explore how integration of plans and unification of smart city visions with the overarching city development goals can better support effective urban transformation and local innovation. This research addresses the complex planning and governance mechanisms in the world's fastest growing economy – India - which has initiated an ambitious mission to transform 100 urban areas across the country into “smart cities”. The federal program involves the provision of centrally devised guidelines for smart city development. These combined with local level policy and institutional initiatives in designated smart cities in India shape a multiplicity of policies and programs. A two-level case study is presented in this paper as a critical polemic on this policy landscape. Investigation along these lines provide opportunities for identification of underlying patterns and challenges of smart city developments in India. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for building sound smart city policy frameworks in emerging economies.}

Fog Computing (FC) is a paradigm that has been envisioned to mitigate the bottlenecks in traditional IoT networks with respect to latency by bringing storage and processing resources close to the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a complete set of Topology Control (TC) techniques for constructing and managing a large-scale smart city IoT network. We approach the problem of TC in two phases: Construction Phase and Maintenance Phase. In the Construction Phase, we build a cost-effective IoT network consisting of fog gateways, and in the Maintenance Phase, we optimize the resource utilization in the system. We propose efficient algorithms in each of the phases to realize our objectives, and with extensive simulation based on real and experimented IoT data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms by comparing with existing algorithms. In the Construction Phase, compared to the existing NewIoTGateway-Select (NIGS) algorithm, our Hungarian based Topology Control (HTC) algorithm performs 45% and 42% better in terms of overall system cost and the number of required gateways, respectively. In the Maintenance Phase, our Vacation based Resource Allocation (VRA) algorithm enhances the utilization of processing resources by 12x without adversely affecting the latency constraints of the applications. Similarly, our Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) algorithm enhances the utilization of storage resources by 4x without adversely affecting the latency constraints of the applications.}

Furthermore, the article examines the implications of the different understandings of the smart city concept for cities' abilities to be innovative. Building on existing scholarly contributions on the smartness of cities and innovation literature, the article develops a typology of smart city initiatives based on the extent and types of innovations they involve. The typology is structured as a smart city continuum, comprising four dimensions of innovation: (1) technological, (2) organizational, (3) collaborative, (4) experimental. The smart city continuum is then utilized to analyze empirical data from a Norwegian urban development project triggered by a critical juncture. The empirical data shows that the case holds elements of different dimensions of the continuum, supporting the need for a typology of smart cities as multifaceted urban innovation. The continuum can be used as an analytical model for different types of smart city initiatives, and thus shed light on what types of innovation are central in the smart city. Consequently, the article offers useful insights for both practitioners and scholars interested in smart city initiatives.}

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) proposed method for organizing, collecting and fusing spatio-temporal data of the road’s entire life cycle, based on extended COBie standard to facilitate the linking and interoperability of multi-source heterogeneous data; (2) new Road Operation and Maintenance Functional Requirements (ROMFR) from the perspective of smart cities, which provide a complete definition of road intelligent O&M functional requirements; and (3) based on ROMFR and a new generation of information technologies, the design and implementation of a system named RIOMS (Road intelligent operation and maintenance system) that supports the intelligent functional requirements. The proposed solution has been applied to Yanggao Road (Pudong New Area, Shanghai) as a case study to demonstrate its feasibility and validity. Specifically, the proposed ICT artifact has been utilized in handling typical scenarios of road O&M and its effectiveness has been assessed through survey questionnaire and smart city assessment system.}

In smart cities, low-frequency oscillations are a serious concern to the power system as they adversely affect system’s stability. Moreover, power system stabilizers are inefficient due to their fixed-parameter architecture. Flexible ac transmission system controller performs effective damping of low-frequency oscillations when provided with suitable supplementary damping control like a Static synchronous series compensator. In this context, the paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control for smart cities that uses the recurrent Gaussian membership function and recurrent wavelet neural network in antecedent and consequent parts respectively. The paper applies the gradient descent optimization with a back-propagation algorithm to update the parameters of suggested adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control. Simulations are performed on two test systems, both showing the effectiveness of the recommended control scheme as compared to traditional lead-lag control and artificial neuro-fuzzy Takagi Sugeno Kang control. Calculations of performance index for various fault scenarios lead to the conclusion that the control scheme can damp oscillations effectively and enhances the power system’s transient stability.}

Urban big data and data-driven technologies have played an increasingly important role in building smart and resilient cities that can respond rapidly to these perturbations. However, many existing approaches had limited capabilities for processing big data, which has led to time-consuming and costly decision-making. Thus, we develop a real-time data-driven analytical and geo-visual system to enable smart and rapid responses to urban extreme events. The system is built on ArcGIS’s GeoEvent Server and Apache Spark and processes streaming data from social media with high speed, massive volume, and multiple modalities. The system employs online topic modeling and domain-adaptive sentiment analysis to track small-scale, undefined events, visualizes their spatial and semantic dynamics, and provides early alerts for crises and emergencies via an interactive online GIS platform. The proposed system has been applied during a large-scale hurricane and demonstrated effectiveness and agility in tracking and reporting emerging small-scale crises. The developed system can be applied in various urban scenarios to enable timely situation awareness and rapid response. This research contributes to the smart city safety and building rapidity of resilient cities.}

Contingency planning frames conditions for displaced persons in emergency situations but also affects the design of everyday urban spaces. Thus, the spatial output of emergency preparedness can encourage wellbeing and placemaking in both emergency and non-emergency situations. This article explores the built environments of contingency planning in Norwegian cities, paying particular attention to emergency reception. Furthermore, this article outlines the relationship between the policies of reception in displacement management and the spatial policies of placemaking. A study of Norwegian contingency planning history shows that the former evacuation shelter typology is being replaced by the more loosely defined concept of places of protection, similar to the retrofitted spaces commonly used as asylum centres. Newspaper clippings and document reviews are used to study two emergency reception structures: a Cold War multipurpose mountain hall close to the Norway–Russia border and a transformed 1970s warehouse near Oslo that currently houses the Norwegian national arrival facility for asylum-seekers. Comparing these two cases outlines the interaction between displacement management, contingency planning, and urban planning and contributes to conceptualising what we call contingency urbanism. We suggest that contingency urbanism can be useful in re-spatialising emergency architecture, re-linking contingency and urban planning, and pointing to placemaking opportunities in the duality of everyday life and a state of emergency.}

abstract = {In recent years many initiatives have been developed under the Smart City label in a bid to provide a response to challenges facing cities today. The concept has evolved from a sector-based approach to a more comprehensive view that places governance and stakeholders' involvement at the core of strategies. However, Smart City implementation requires lowering the scale from the strategy to the project level. Therefore, the ability of Smart City initiatives to provide an integrated and systematic answer to urban challenges is constantly being called into question. Stakeholder involvement in both the projects and the city strategy is key to developing a governance framework that allows an integrated and comprehensive understanding. This can only be done if Smart City strategies take the stakeholders' opinion into account and seek a compromise between their views and the implementation of the strategy. Multiple attempts have been made to analyse Smart Cities, but tools are needed to understand their complexity and reflect the stakeholders' role in developing Smart City initiatives and their capacity to face urban challenges. This paper pursues two objectives: (A) to develop a conceptual model capable of displaying an overview of (a) the stakeholders taking part in the initiative in relation to (b) the projects developed and (c) the challenges they face; and (B) to use this model to synthesise the opinion of different stakeholders involved in Smart City initiatives and compare their attitudes to the key projects implemented in a corresponding SC strategy. The methodology combines project analysis with surveys and interviews with different groups of key stakeholders (governments, private companies, universities and research centres, and civil society) through text analysis. The conceptual model is developed through discussions with different European stakeholders and is applied to the case of the Vienna Smart City strategy.}

Among them, smart city services are the foundation of 5G-enabled smart cities. As an emerging and informational city service model, crowdsourcing has been widely used in our daily life. However, in the existing crowdsourcing systems, the requesters and the workers are usually required to use the crowdsourcing platform as the trust center, and the payment depends on the third-party central payment institutions, which have a massive security risk. Once these centers are attacked or do evil, it will bring higher losses to the crowdsourcing parties. These problems will negatively affect the further development of 5G-enabled smart cities. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain-empowered and decentralized trusted service mechanism for the crowdsourcing system in 5G-enabled smart cities. In the proposed mechanism, the crowdsourcing service process is divided into nine stages: initialization, task submission, task publication, task reception, scheme submission, scheme arbitration, payment, task rollback, and service compensation. The smart contract controls the execution of each step in each stage, and the payment is completed by blockchain without the involvement of third-party central institutions. Finally, we develop smart contracts to conduct experiments based on Ethereum and compare it with the existing crowdsourcing system. The experimental results show the effectiveness and applicability of the crowdsourcing system service mechanism without the central institutions.}

Human Gait Recognition (HGR) is an important application of smart cities in which a person is recognized with the help of walking styles. The main advantage of HGR is an individual’s inconspicuous distant gait data acquisition. It is being utilized to mitigate security threats at airports, banks, embassies & various corporate vicinities. In this paper, a deep learning method is proposed for HGR. The proposed methodology utilizes a large Multiview gait database CASIA-B comprising video sequences. Initial video processing in frames precedes the implementation of the pre-trained deep model DenseNet-201. Reutilizing the same for gait recognition using Transfer Learning (TL) yields the target model, which further acts as the source for feature extraction from the global average pool layer. Feature extraction as a dominant step is responsible here for accurate gait recognition. Poor lighting, varying view angles, diverse clothing conditions, carrying luggage, etc., are some constraints that adversely affect systems’ efficiency. To tackle this situation, we use two parallel techniques in the process as- improved BAT algorithm (IBAT) and Entropy selection. We use a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CAA) to fuse these carefully selected features into a matrix finally. Final gait recognition is achieved by passing these fused features from the Softmax classifier. The proposed technique reaches 96.13% and 95.2% accuracy by utilizing all angles of the CASIA-B and CASIA-C datasets. The authenticity of this work is cross-examined with the existing methods.}

However, the leasing transactions between government departments and drone leasing companies are faced with problems such as distrust, price disputes, and increased costs caused by third-party participation. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a multi-party secure and convenient transaction framework based on alliance blockchain, which helps to build trust between drone leasing companies and government departments without worrying about privacy leakage and transaction data tampering. In addition, an intelligent pricing strategy based on contract theory is designed, which can not only maximize the utility of government departments, but also encourage drone companies to actively participate. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed drone services transaction mechanism based on blockchain and intelligent pricing strategy is very effective.}

Nonetheless, the notion of smart cities is ambiguous, and there are limited conceptual frameworks to assist cities and their administrations in understanding the big picture view of this urban development paradigm. The aim of this paper is to generate a clear understanding on the making of successful smart city practices. This is done by elaborating the smart cities notion through a multidimensional conceptual framework, examining smart city best practices across the globe—i.e., Songdo, Masdar, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Brisbane—, and providing insights of smart city approaches from these cases.

This study contributes to filling this gap. We start by identifying the potential sources of entrepreneurial opportunities that a medium-sized smart city may offer based on the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship. We then provide empirical evidence that the Smart City label has positively influenced the effective creation of new businesses. To this end, we examine 44 Spanish Smart City initiatives included and classified in the Smart City Index according to their smartness level. Our results confirm the relation between the Smart City label and the entrepreneurship rate. Moreover, they allow us to present some relevant considerations and implications concerning the maturing process of Smart City initiatives.

Many studies have incorporated technical and non-technical enablers to better control the growth of smart cities. However, despite considerable achievements, the direct and indirect effects of smart city enablers on urban performances have not been quantified comprehensively. Thus, due to this lack of in-depth understanding, smart city leaders encounter difficulties in establishing proper development strategies. To address this issue, the present study has used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to identify the critical enablers of smart cities and to quantify their dynamic effects (i.e., direct and indirect effects) on the performances of such cities. More specifically, the authors applied SEM to test and estimate the relationships between four enabler clusters (i.e., technological infrastructure, open governance, intelligent community, and innovative economy) and four performance objectives (i.e., efficiency, sustainability, livability, and competitiveness) using the actual data of 50 smart cities. The statistical results demonstrated that non-technical enabler clusters, as well as the technical drivers, have significant impacts on the performances of smart cities with their highly interrelated, synergetic dynamics. Based on those findings, urban leaders can enhance strategic planning for smart city transitions through proper policy management.}

abstract = {Nowadays, deep neural networks are widely applied in sustainable smart cities and societies, including smart manufacturing, healthcare, industries, agriculture, surveillance, and various artificial intelligence-based real-life applications. In this regard, the human detection system has gained notable attention since it is recognized as a crucial task in intelligent surveillance applications. Researchers practiced a variety of computer vision and deep neural networks-based techniques for human detection-based applications; however, they often focused on the frontal view camera perspective. Thus, in this work, we have introduced a human detection system for intelligent surveillance in smart cities and societies with a completely distinct perspective, i.e., an overhead perspective that can provide sufficient visibility and coverage of a scene in congested and obstructed environments. However, human appearance can be difficult from such an extreme point of view, as there are significant variations in humans’ poses and appearances. Therefore, in this work, leveraging the deep neural network-based object detection technique, the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm is used for human detection. The algorithm determines the bounding box uncertainty by modeling its coordinates as a Gaussian parameter, improving accuracy and reducing false positives. A Gaussian YOLOv3 is combined with channel attention and feature intertwine modules to improve specific feature maps. The channel attention module is combined with the feature map to learn each channel's weight autonomously, improve the key features, and enhance the network's ability to discriminate between humans and background. At the same time, different channels of the feature map are intertwined to obtain more representative features. Finally, the features obtained from the attention and feature intertwine modules are fused to form an improved feature map. In addition, to further increase the detection accuracy of the algorithm for human detection, transfer learning is adopted. The experimental outcomes reveal that training improves the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm's potential for human detection with an overall detection accuracy of 94%.}

These characteristics are challenged in the academic literature, especially the technocentric approach and the central position of private companies. Moreover, the lack of proper conceptualisation pushes cities to claim themselves ‘smart’. Finally, there are few rigorous analytical or statistical analyses of the concept and its application to territories. Therefore, this paper studies how Belgian municipalities understand the concept of Smart Cities in 2016. Based on the groundwork of literature on Smart Cities and the results of a survey of 113 Belgian municipalities, a typology of four understandings of the Smart City (technological, societal, comprehensive and non-existent) is elaborated. The results also show that municipalities with no understanding of the Smart City concept or with a technical understanding are mostly located in small and rural municipalities. This could be a sign of rejection of the phenomenon in this context. Conversely, medium and large-sized municipalities mostly develop a societal or comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this study highlights a dichotomy of understanding and acceptance of the concept of the Smart City between peripheral (rural and small size municipalities) and central municipalities (urban, medium and large size municipalities).}

Here, the concept of tribophotonics represents a new research direction by using the electrostatic induction brought by triboelectric charges to tune or generate the optical or electromagnetic wave transmission, as coupling the triboelectricity with photonics. Triboelectricity brings the capabilities of energy harvesting and self-powered sensing from the mechanical motions, addressing the challenge of the power supply, and photonics can be modulated to transmit signals wirelessly without using cables, addressing the challenge of the wireless signal transmission. With the unified design of tribophotonic devices, an emerging fully-self-powered wireless sensing and transmission solution can be achieved through multiple technological routes following the general trends of functionality, miniatured integrability, wireless portability, and self-power-ability.

This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold. As for now, however, there seems to be insufficient social trust to exploit this on a wider scale without creating even more scepticism and distrust.}

abstract = {The current study is a preliminary approach to develop a structural framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) adoption barriers that exist in the waste management systems of smart cities in developing economies such as India. To attain this aim, the present study uses hybrid Multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) and has identified 15 adoption IoT Barriers (IoTBs) from literature review obstructing the IoT implementation in smart cities of India. The IoTBs are further analyzed through the Total Interpretative structural modeling (TISM) approach, the Fuzzy Matriced’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquéan Classement (MICMAC) model, and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The TISM approach is used to develop a structural framework of IoTBs in smart cities’ waste management (SCWM) projects. The literature shows that several bottlenecks exist. Such bottlenecks may include operational cost and payback; a lack of standardization, regulations, directions, and policy norms; incomplete technical knowledge among policymakers; internet connectivity, privacy, and security issues; or problems with mobility, transparency, and a lack of IT infrastructure; all of these issues influence IoT adoption in SCWM. The present work discloses that the lack of regulations, directions, and policy norms, and the lack of standardization and Internet connectivity are the most critical IoT barriers hindering the development of smart cities, particularly in their waste management practices. The Fuzzy-MICMAC approach is useful in calculating driving and dependence powers of the IoTBs, and the DEMATEL method helps reveal the influence/strength of IoTBs that affect SCWM. This study will help policymakers, stakeholders, and government to understand the significant IoTBs affecting waste management practices, and it will definitely assist them to undertake decisions for eradicating these barriers for a more efficient IoT implementation in SCWM projects.}

An empirical analysis is carried on based on a survey among 193 Belgian actors active in the domain. The results show that the Instrument theory is relevant to analyse the actors' appropriation, which do not follow a homogeneous trend. In fact, each actor follows his own logics which will be interesting to study.}

abstract = {Big sensor-based data systems and the emergence of large-scale wireless sensor networks (LS-WSNs), which are spatially distributed across various geographical areas in smart cities (SCs) have thrown new challenges for energy-efficient data collection. The traditional approach utilizing IoT-based techniques for data collection and transmission for waste management applications is not energy-efficient and currently infeasible for such LS-WSNs, thus necessitating the need for a transformation to an IoV-based technique, where vehicular networks can be opportunistically exploited for efficient data collection for waste management strategies in SCs. This paper gives two contributions to research in waste management for SCs. First, a comprehensive study of the various IoT-based techniques for waste management in SCs is presented. Survey studies present energy consumption of the sensor-nodes due to high routing/transmission/control overheads as a major challenge. Several IoT-based techniques have been used to optimize the energy efficiency of the sensor-nodes. However, none has effectively addressed the challenges of energy consumption and optimization. The second contribution proposes an IoV-based technique for data collection for waste management in SCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of such a proposed scheme for SC waste management strategies. Thus, this paper is the first attempt to propose a novel IoV-based model for SC waste management strategies. This technique involves the use of vehicles as opportunistic MDCs to optimize energy efficiency. The paper also proposes using swarm-intelligence-based methods to increase energy efficiency and data collection for SC waste management application. An energy-efficient routing model is very critical to IoT-based applications. Hence, the paper presents an energy-efficient opportunistic model utilizing the ant-based routing algorithms for LS-WSN SC waste management applications. The paper also provides some analytical approaches to determine the energy consumption of the network model. The final part presents experiments in different application scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results present the proposed approach in good performance in terms of the performance metrics compared to the conventional techniques for waste management strategies.}

A novel conceptual framework with different solar radiation indexes was developed to investigate and evaluate the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) energy production by comparing predicted and actual results for energy acquired from the reference project. The trend of potential energy production was predicted from solar radiation data as the basis for further calculations to evaluate PV system efficiency through a techno-economic analysis of project development. A mathematical model was developed to predict the obtained electrical energy by considering the suitable location-specific solar radiation indexes including direct normal radiation, All-Sky insolation incident on a horizontal surface, direct normal irradiation and global horizontal irradiance. The developed model was tested with three existing Smart City projects at various locations in Thailand. The All-Sky index was determined as the most suitable option to evaluate new PV development projects. Highest energy production from the PV projects occurred in March and April. Energy production efficiencies of the PV systems were estimated in the range of 3.97–4.32 kWh/kWp. The techno-economic analysis suggested that the PV project had an internal rate of return of 14.30–15.75% and payback period of 6.18–6.74 years. The proposed conceptual framework was a promising tool for decision-making regarding Smart City PV projects.}

Although the urban digitization program of smart city sounds promising, the implementation is lacking since there is neither specific national standard nor guidance to assist local government undertaking the smart city initiatives. With respect to the smart governance dimension that serves as an important foundation for delivering government-related services, there is limited indicators and the related formula to measure its performance. This research fills the gaps by modelling indicators and formula in the smart governance dimension to support the smart city program. The research was conducted by identifying the smart governance purposes, mapping the current related governance indicators, and developing a model for smart governance performance. The model was then validated by three experts of smart city and e-government evaluation and implemented in Surabaya City as a case study. The proposed model results in 29 indicators in three different domains and seven aspects of assessment. The model can serve as a reference for smart governance performance evaluation to support smart city initiatives in Indonesia.}

We employ a language analysis of the (geo-tagged) Twitter data in combination with a social network analysis. We show that creative migrants contribute to the smart city discourse by relating technology to common good. They broadcast globally information about innovative projects, social initiatives and environmental issues, setting the basis for the experimental city. We conclude that a social media analysis, based on the innovative methodology proposed, provides valuable knowledge that can inform urban planners on a more socially driven use of (digital) technology in the development of smart cities.}

To support high-speed IoT devices, wavelength division multiplexed passive optical networks (WDM-PON) is one of the most promising and most commonly used technology in optical distribution network (ODN). With the exponential growth of WDM-PON and its applications, energy consumption, operational expenditure (OPEX), communication latency between different users, reliability of service etc. are becoming the most challenging issues to implement the WDM-PON networks in the smart cities. In this paper, we propose a ring based latency aware and energy efficient PON architecture which is capable of providing point to point downstream, upstream, inter-ODN, intra-ODN and inter-ODN broadcasting transmission. Proposed architecture reduces the significant amount of transmission latency, energy consumption, operational expenditure and reduces the emission of Green House Gases (GHGs). The architecture also reduces the downstream and upstream bandwidth consumption by avoiding the transmission of the inter-ODN signal to optical line terminal (OLT) and back to destined ODN. The architecture seems appropriate for supporting various real-time high-speed ICT and IoT applications of a smart city.}

Instead, we understand smart cities to be a broad framework of strategies pursued by urban actors, and ask whether and how smart city projects catalyze urban energy sustainability. We use case studies of three cities (Nottingham, Stavanger, and Stockholm) funded by the Horizon 2020 Smart Cities and Communities program and examine how urban energy sustainability was advanced and realized through the smart city initiatives. We find first that while sustainability is not always a major objective of local implementation of smart city projects, the smartness agenda nevertheless increases the ambition to achieve energy sustainability targets. Second, the sustainability measures in smart cities are rarely driven by advanced technology, even though the smart city agenda is framed around such innovations. Third, there is significant sustainability potential in cross-sectoral integration, but there are unresolved challenges of accountability for and measurability of these gains.}

While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real’ smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings’.}

Different kinds of Smart City APIs enable smart city services and applications, while their effectiveness depends on the architectural solutions to pass from data to services for city users and operators, exploiting data analytics, and presenting services via APIs. Therefore, there is a strong activity on defining smart city architectures to cope with this complexity, putting in place a significant range of different kinds of services and processes. In this paper, the work performed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city project on defining a smart city architecture addressing a wide range of processes and data is presented. To this end, comparisons of the state of the art solutions of smart city architectures for data aggregation and for Smart City API are presented by putting in evidence the usage semantic ontologies and knowledge base in the data aggregation in the production of smart services. The solution proposed aggregate and re-conciliate data (open and private, static and real time) by using reasoning/smart algorithms for enabling sophisticated service delivering via Smart City API. The work presented has been developed in the context of the Sii-Mobility national smart city project on mobility and transport integrated with smart city services with the aim of reaching a more sustainable mobility and transport systems.

A wide range of definitions surfaced over the last decade characterising the smart city, primarily pushed by the global elite corporations and influential academics. Simultaneously, a series of urban development expressions, such as digital city, knowledge city, eco-city is used interchangeably with the smart city, significantly mystifying the reading of the concept. This paper, first argue that smart city interpretation needs and requires the input and contribution of the local stakeholders. The aim of this research is to provide an evidence-based framework to capture the perception of local urban actors in India vis-à-vis their interpretation of smart cities given the existing urban conditions and the proposed developments under the 100 Smart Cities Mission. This research also examines the underlying linkage between the smart city and its conceptual relatives and highlights the ones with a significant convergence with the emerging urban agenda in India's Smart Cities Mission. The analysis presented in this paper show that to emerge as a holistic concept, smart cities definition models should engage with the sustainability and community issues, beyond the use of digital technology. The research reveals that the Indian urban stakeholders strongly associate the smart city concept with sustainable city and eco-city, much more than the technology-loaded phrases such as ubiquitous city and digital city. The first-of-its-kind inclusive approach developed in this paper to define smart city takes on the monopolies of top-down smart city definitions and support the democratisation of the rapidly proliferating concept.}

There is an exponential demand for efficient, secure, reliable, and uninterrupted electricity supply, so there is a need for an intelligent grid, which uses Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to optimize the generation, circulation, and ingestion of electricity. Thus, Smart Grid (SG) acts as an intelligent grid, which plays an important role in the overall growth of any smart city. Further, the Big Data (BD) generated from SG, provides noteworthy information that could significantly benefit different applications of SG, such as demand response and load profiling. However, an insecure technique for decision-making may lead to the breach of SG data where hackers gained full access to consumer data. On the contrary, a secure technique for decision-making can provide satisfaction to all the stakeholders, including consumers and utility providers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents a comprehensive literature survey and analysis of state-of-the-art proposals for Secure Data Analytics (SDA) in the SG system. However, to achieve SDA for the SG systems is one of the critical tasks. The existing research and development endeavors not fully exploited the SDA in the SG system. In this paper, we discuss the distinctive nature of SDA and its complexity over the SG data. A detailed taxonomy abstracted into a novel process model, which highlights various research challenges such as secure data collection and preprocessing, secure load data processing and storage, load prediction, load management and analysis, data security and privacy issues, and data communication. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the process model.}

It involves establishing an inclusive transportation system to address many issues, like traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond environmental concerns, robust mobility management has social and economic advantages, fostering improved access to vital services like healthcare, education, and employment. Software-defined networking (SDN) presents a viable solution for enhancing MM within networks. Unlike traditional setups, SDN merges MM through a programmable control plane, streamlining network configurations and enabling features like handover, load balancing, and quality of service (QoS). The utilization of SDN technology extends to various facets of sustainable city networks, encompassing areas like network security, performance optimization, big data processing, energy efficiency, emergency management, carbon emissions reduction, intelligent services, and MM in vehicular networks. Despite the advantages of SDN-based mobility management, it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges and limitations posed by traditional MM methods that SDN aims to overcome. The paper explores SDN's potential in sustainable cities, focusing on how it can transform mobile device management, support various networking technologies, and evaluate the impact of SDN methods on existing MM systems, considering factors like scalability and compatibility. The paper asserts that SDN-based MM has substantial potential for promoting sustainable urban development. By centralizing control, adapting to changing conditions, and optimizing resource allocation, SDN can contribute to reduced energy consumption, lower carbon emissions, and more efficient urban mobility. It emphasizes the importance of addressing potential drawbacks to ensure successful implementation in sustainable cities.}

Simultaneously, people are no longer relying on traditional news channels to enlighten themselves about the epidemic situation. Alternately, smart cities citizens are relying more on Social Network Service (SNS) to follow the latest news and information regarding the outbreak, share their opinions, and express their feelings and symptoms. In this paper, we propose an SNS Big Data Analysis Framework for COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction in Smart Sustainable Healthy City, where Twitter platform is adopted. Over 10000 Tweets were collected during two months, 38% of users aged between 18 and 29, while 26% are between 30 and 49 years old. 56% of them are males and 44% are females. The geospatial location is USA, and the used language is English. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is deployed to filter the tweets. Results demonstrated an outbreak cluster predicted seven days earlier than the confirmed cases with an indicator of 0.989. Analyzing data from SNS platforms enabled predicting future outbreaks several days earlier, and scientifically reduce the infection rate in a smart sustainable healthy city environment.}

It can provide many benefits for people’s daily life, but is also susceptible to many security threats in practice. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), especially signature-based IDSs, are one of the most commonly adopted security mechanisms to safeguard various network environments like IoT-assisted smart city against cyber attacks. The process of signature matching is a key limiting factor for a signature-based IDS, and the exclusive signature matching (ESM) was designed based on the observation that most network packets would not match any IDS signatures. However, exclusive signature matching like the single character frequency-based ESM may be vulnerable to some attacks in a hostile environment. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose a blockchain-enabled single character frequency-based ESM, which can build a verifiable database of malicious payloads via blockchains. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of our approach under flooding and character padding attacks in both a simulated and a real IoT network environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the robustness of single character frequency-based ESM against malicious traffic.}

Early fire detection is necessary to overcome these losses and disruption. Fire detection using vision sensors is a promising research area that has gained significant attention from computer vision experts. Traditionally, low-level colour features were used for fire detection but they have now been superseded by effective deep learning models that achieve higher accuracy. However, these models also suffer from a higher false alarm rate, due to the fact that they treat fire detection as a classification task where the entire image is classified into a single class and the region of the proposal stage is ignored. Furthermore, the time complexity and model size limit these models from real-world implementation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a modified YOLOv5s model that integrates a Stem module in the backbone, replaces larger kernels with smaller ones in the SPP (Neck), and adds the P6 module into the head. This model achieves promising results with lower complexity and smaller model size, and is able to detect both small and large fire regions in images. Moreover, we contribute a medium-scale fire dataset that consists of three classes (i.e. vehicle fire, building fire, and indoor electric fire), with manual annotation according to the object detection model, where the dataset is publicly available for the research purposes. Finally, for fair evaluation, we re-implement 12 different state-of-the-art object detection models, including the proposed model, and trained them over a self-created dataset. We found that the proposed model achieved better detection performance and applicable in real-world scenario. Our codes and dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/Hikmat-Yar/Modified-YOLOv5-Code.}

It underpins a variety of essential and significant tasks in the development of smart city including face recognition, landmark retrieval, pedestrian detection, person/vehicle re-identification, and so on. Traditional pair-based DML methods try to make full use of the data-to-data relations within a (mini-)batch, but they cannot grasp the data distribution information due to the batch size limitation. On the other hand, proxy-based DML schemes use different proxies to approximate the data distribution. However, the proxies are too sample to represent the intra-category variance. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, named soft-instance-label proxy, for embedding learning. It can capture the globe data distribution information while depicting the detailed intra-class data structure. The state-of-the-art empirical results on three public image retrieval benchmarks and two backbone networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our Soft-instance-label proxy method can have a Recall@1 improvement of 2.4% with Googlenet, largely surpassing the current state-of-art-methods while demonstrating great potential in the development of smart city.}

Cities on a global scale continuously launch new digital services and smart solutions in order to become places that are more resilient, efficient, and attractive. While digitally-driven urban development has become a new paradigm for cities, the digital divide is emerging as a serious concern when it comes to the goal of making cities accessible and inclusive for everyone, especially the most vulnerable. Issues such as digital inclusion and access to key urban services, information, and experiences by people with disabilities (PwD) are critical areas in which cities face important challenges related to ethical and responsible governance. The aim of this paper is to provide conceptual and empirical insights into the culture of digital accessibility of PwD on an urban scale.

The term “smart cities” is classified into Systems Theory, particularly focusing on Cyber-Physical Systems. This classification is further elaborated to define a new term, so-called Smart City Agent (SCA). The SCA is considered as the main building block for modelling smart cities. The approach within this paper however stresses the interconnection of different systems within a city. Its’ strength is in better exchange of data and among heterogeneous agents. This information management approach is the missing key in the growing market of partial smart city solutions as it will allow simulation of solutions in complex systems such as a city. The suitability of usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a use case dealing with charging of electrical vehicles.

It is projected that by 2050 around 68 % of the world’s population shall live in urban areas. As a result, many city development initiatives are proposed by various research centers or through academia to aid in managing the process. One of the most evolving concepts through the past two decades is Smart Cities. The concept of smart cities has been defined and formulated by many research efforts and organizations. However, most of these definitions and initiatives focus on the operation stage of the city. This paper proposes an inclusive framework for integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographical Information System (GIS) to plan and forecast the utility infrastructure needs for expanding and emerging cities to highlight the concept of “smartness” during the planning stage. The considered infrastructure needs are freshwater consumption, sewage capacity and electrical energy requirements. Firstly, the city is broken down into several districts, lands and plots. Afterwards, through the assignment of relevant land use, building type information and various other information, an interactive tool is originated to allow for the formulation of different city development schemes and the representation of their respective resulting infrastructure needs. The framework is targeted to be flexible enough in order to be applied to any city, not just a single case as smart city solutions need to adopt to diverse cities’ needs. The proposed framework is advocated to enforce the concept of both smart and sustainable cities by taking a closer look at the city’s planning and development stages and infrastructure requirements which shape a sizable part of the city’s performance throughout its expansion and development. It can also serve as a decision support tool for better planning and management of smart city infrastructure requirements. Finally, a case study is represented to demonstrate the practical features of the proposed framework.}

abstract = {The development of more efficient communication technologies and the affordability of powerful hardware platforms have brought the smart cities prospects to a more realistic setting. Actually, this promising scenario has fostered the development of different monitoring and control applications aimed at improving the quality of life in modern urban areas, often implemented through sensors and actuators networks. Nevertheless, multiple concurrent sensing applications may have different levels of criticality according to the impact of the performed tasks for the protection of people’s integrity and thus they should be treated in different ways. This article then proposes a prioritization approach to guide the development of sensors-based applications in smart city scenarios, which will be differentiated based on their monitoring objectives, some contextual prioritization parameters and the detection of critical events. This approach will also define security mechanisms to ensure that all sensor nodes will follow the defined prioritization policies for the considered smart cities. Besides simulation results, the proposed definitions and mechanisms were completely implemented for additional validation, resulting in a set of codes to facilitate the construction of practical sensor applications based on the proposed approach.}
