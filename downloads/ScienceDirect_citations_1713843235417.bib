abstract = {Smart spaces are supported by a variety of cyber-physical systems and services that collect, deliver, store, and primarily process data, and that extract knowledge and generate managerial impacts. The viability of these services can be subject to the destructive effects of various kinds of negative factors. In this regard, the problem of protecting the smart space from threats in the information sphere becomes relevant. One of the ways to identify destructive impacts on smart space services is to monitor software and hardware parts of the information environment. Monitoring the state of the information environment of the smart space will ensure the vitality (health) of its services. In this chapter we propose a methodology aimed at the timely detection of hazards in the information environment to support the functioning of the smart space. The methodology is based on periodic monitoring of the main software and hardware characteristics of its components. It is experimentally shown that such characteristics are the number of bytes sent and received through the network adapter, the percentage of processor load, the operating time of the computer medium, and the bytes of RAM used. Monitoring and processing these data are sufficient to detect most information security threats. Health control is implemented using artificial intelligence methods by clustering time series and predicting the state of the processes occurring in the hardware and software parts of the computer system. The previously mentioned characteristics are selected in such a way as to reflect the state of the smart space in the most informative way. Processes are evaluated by analyzing the time series of information flows by finding the most similar sample. The sample search is based on the Holt-Winters model. The basic idea of the model is that history develops in a spiral, and the stages are repeated, but with changing properties. If there is seasonality in the time series and a sufficiently large amount of available data, the model is likely to find two intervals, expressed by the formula, that are maximally similar to each other. We propose an original model of smart space information security with three levels of control: reactive, active, and proactive. The analysis of the current state of the space in the model is carried out by indirect signs, both the information data flows of the space and the functional characteristics of the security system. In order to assess the state of the space and the hidden, not explicit, patterns of its behavior, in addition to the basic methods of data analysis we propose to apply the characteristics of the rate of change of the data in the flow, as well as their acceleration. The information system uses three models of behavior in the construction of the information security model of the smart space. The proposed methodology is implemented in a software product that issues appropriate signals to decision centers to prevent information threats to the smart space.}

We specifically quantify infrastructural demand and simulate the travel and charging behaviors of SEV users, utilizing spatiotemporal and behavioral data extracted from a SEV trajectory dataset. Our findings indicate that the most cost-effective strategy is to deploy slow chargers exclusively at rental stations. For SEV operators, the use of TOU and V2G strategies could potentially reduce charging costs by 17.93% and 34.97% respectively. In scenarios involving V2G, the average discharging demand is 2.15 kWh per day per SEV, which accounts for 42.02% of the actual average charging demand of SEVs. These findings are anticipated to provide valuable insights for SEV operators and electricity companies in their infrastructure investment decisions and policy formulation.}

So government needs new ways to listen to its citizens. The paper comprises three components. Firstly, we build on the growing discussions in the literature focused on smart cities, on one hand, and social media research, on the other, to capture the diversity of citizen voices and better inform decision-making. Secondly, with the support of the Australian Federal Government and in collaboration with the local government partners, we collect citizen voices from Twitter on selected urban projects. Thirdly, we present preliminary findings in terms of quantity and quality of publicly available online data representing citizen concerns on the urban matters. By analyzing the sentiments of the citizen voices captured online, clustering them into topic areas, and then reevaluating citizen's sentiments within each cluster, we elaborate the scope and value of technologically-enabled opportunities in terms of enabling participatory local government decision making processes.}

New technologies are gaining ground in various disciplines, and road safety is not an exception. The objective of this paper is twofold: (1) to review the state-of-the-art technologies implemented in bicycles to improve cyclists’ safety, and (2) to propose a classification for the levels of smartness of emerging “smart bikes”. This paper defines six levels of smartness for bicycles based on their functionality and evaluates the Technology Readiness Levels of bicycle technologies. Furthermore, areas for future research were identified and discussed. To achieve these, we conducted a literature review which employed two academic databases –Scopus and Web of Science– and the Google Scholar search engine, following the framework of the systematic literature review methodology for the search and selection process. A total of 36 studies that met the inclusion criteria were investigated. The majority of these studies focus on warning systems aiming to forestall an imminent collision, mostly by using accelerometers/gyroscopes, LIDAR, sensors and networking communication. These systems, despite their preliminary state, demonstrate a positive effect on cyclists’ safety. The review concludes that there is a need for further deployment and testing of such systems with field trials to gain concrete evidence regarding their impact on cyclists’ safety. It also highlights that advanced technologies are scarcely implemented in bicycles and that most smart bicycle systems are based on smartphones. Thus, the question is: what lies in the future of smart bicycles from today’s perspective?}

abstract = {Energy is directly related to the economy and its demand would increase with development in the industrial, residential, transportation, and commercial sectors. It is projected that by 2050, the global energy demand will experience a two-fold increase. Currently, almost 85 % of the consumed energy globally is generated by burning non-renewable sources like oil, coal, and gas. Open car parking areas at universities, shopping malls, hospitals, etc. are unexploited areas that have enormous potential to generate renewable energy without disturbing the flora and fauna of the region. This study analyses the techno-economic feasibility of generating grid-connected energy using solar photovoltaic, PV panels on the parking lots of academic institutions and utilizes a part of it for charging the parked EVs . The best system is found to produce energy at a cost of 0.0529 USD/kWh, almost 54 % less compared to the grid. In the proposed design, 69 % of the total energy is produced by solar PV and almost 52.5 % is sold to the grid. The capacity factor of the PV system, at this location, is 19.8 %. The annual utility bill saving is around US $ 798,100. The internal rate of return and simple payback period are 7.35 % and 10.9 years. The proposed system architecture also caters to an EV charging capacity of 195 MWh, about 1.5 % of the total energy consumption, and a charging load of 578 kWh/day. This proposed PV energy system, for the parking areas, can be adopted in any other region with similar climatic conditions.}

EVs, particularly through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, including Vehicle-to-Building (V2B), are recognized as key enablers for achieving nearly-zero energy buildings (NZEB). This research presents an advanced Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) with a novel V2B strategy, offering precise one-hour resolution to reduce grid reliance and optimize peak load management. The SEMS coordinates building energy and EV charging while harnessing the potential of renewable energy resources and battery storage systems. By carefully scheduling EV charging and discharging activities, it maximizes the efficient use of available energy resources. Importantly, the algorithm integrates real-world EV parking patterns, accounting for factors such as fleet composition, parking durations, and charging priorities. Economic evaluation encompasses not only direct EV battery degradation costs but also external expenses associated with environmental impacts. Simulation outcomes underscore a remarkable reduction in building grid power demand (65%) and a substantial decrease in carbon emissions (64%). The PV+V2B Scenario emerges as the preferred choice, striking an optimal balance between initial investment costs, energy savings, and carbon footprint reductions. This study holds great academic and practical significance, contributing to the advancement of smart, sustainable, and economically viable net-zero cities.}

abstract = {In the context of smart grids, bidirectional transmission of electricity information enables real-time electricity generation tailored to consumer needs. However, ensuring user privacy during data collection has emerged as a significant concern with the proliferation of data collection and transmission capabilities. Existing solutions such as group signature and pseudonym systems have limitations, such as a lack of trustworthiness in group signature administrators and increased system costs associated with pseudonym storage. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a certificateless ring signcryption scheme with conditional privacy protection based on the SM2 algorithm. The scheme efficiently enables users to ring signcryption-transmitted messages, thereby concealing the sender’s identity from the message receiver. This approach resolves the privacy concerns mentioned earlier. In addition, tracking algorithm and batch verification algorithm have been designed to improve computational efficiency while also providing the ability for trusted parties to track malicious users. This scheme achieves conditional privacy preservation while avoiding substantial storage costs for power resources. Compared to the latest available programs, our proposed scheme offers enhanced efficiency and lower communication costs.}

This study has investigated whether deep learning can determine if the garbage containers are full or not based on the camera images. For this purpose, experiments were carried out for automatic classification processes by applying DenseNet-169, EfficientNet-B3, MobileNetV3-Large, and VGG19-Bn deep learning algorithms on the CDCM dataset, which contains images of trash cans or containers labeled as clean and dirty.

abstract = {Smart cities are conceptualized as a vehicle for sustainable urban development and a means to deliver high quality of life for residents. One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city’s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring.}

Here, we frame our discussion with what has recently been termed the “mind-technology problem”. We define and characterise ASE systems, present some examples, and briefly survey some existing theoretical work. After introducing the essential CST terminology, the paper goes on to apply CST to explain developmental adaptation to continuously changing (smart) environments. Understanding the ASE’s navigation in terms of a dynamic geometry between attracting and repelling points (or local minima/local maxima), allows us to develop neurotechnology that can augment clinical interventions by predicting upcoming shifts for good symptomatic outcomes, i.e. when a preventive intervention (i.e. destabilisation) should take place. We further offer clear directions for the development and design of such neurotechnology.}

abstract = {As the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) has grown rapidly in recent years, the stability and safety of electric grids are inevitably affected. Uncontrolled EV charging can reduce electric grid efficiency and increase greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). This occurs when EV charging aligns with peak demand, requiring the activation of fossil fuel-powered plants to meet the electricity demand. The time-of-use (TOU) price is a traditional management strategy for smoothing the demand power curve, but it does not consider carbon emissions. This study proposes a smart charging strategy based on an improved local search genetic algorithm (LS-GA) that considers both the TOU price and marginal emission factors (MEF). Over 47,000 charging events from 45 charging stations in Tianjin, a major city in North China, were used to simulate the charging pattern and demand. Four different charging strategies are considered in the study. The results indicate that the proposed smart charging strategy can reduce the cost and carbon emissions by up to 27% and 16% compared with uncontrolled charging, respectively. This study demonstrates the significant potential of using optimization methods in the EV smart charging problem.}

This study investigated public perception of “smart” retention ponds that had changing water level as controlled by smart systems and varied in the following microscale landscape elements determined by planning and design choices: land use context, basin slope, and surrounding plants. Using visualizations that showed pond landscape design alternatives at typical, low (draining water), and high (retaining water) water levels, we surveyed residents in three American cities for their perceptions of smart ponds (n = 974). Our results suggest that water level manipulation by smart systems negatively affects perceptions of stormwater ponds; both low and high water were perceived as significantly less attractive, neat, and safe than the typical water level condition. Furthermore, these effects of water level were moderated by other design elements. Perceptions of high water level were more positive for ponds in greenspace than in residential or commercial contexts. Perceptions of low water level were more positive for ponds in residential contexts than in greenspace or commercial contexts, as well as for ponds surrounded by woody or unmaintained plants than those surrounded by mown turf edge. In both high and low water conditions, ponds with steep slopes were perceived more positively than those with shallow slopes. These findings can support successful planning, design, and management of smart NBS.}

While such approaches have either been resisted or condemned by affected households, state and city authorities have defended them as the most appropriate remedies. Have flood events been properly understood? Are flood management approaches aimed at addressing the problem? What are the actual effects of current flood management practices? In responding to these questions, this study seeks to: (i) examine the contours and politics of managing flood vulnerability in the city (ii) understand the factors that have shaped city government's responses to flood events; and (iii) explore the challenges within the current institutional and legal arrangements for flood management. Using Agbogbloshie and Old Fadama – the largest slum communities in Accra - as cases, the study adopts mixed qualitative methods including: interviews of flood victims, focus group discussions, institutional consultations and review of government documents in gathering relevant empirical data. The study reveals that flood management approaches have been shaped by a complex network of actors with entrenched interests. Two levels of smart flood risk and vulnerability management have been proposed.}

Under the combination of IoT and traditional Mobile ad-hoc network, the developers could design the communication model for smart city. The increased deployment of IoT devices in smart environment also raised the security and Quality of Service (QoS) related issues. The proposed, Secure approach for Smart city Environment by Accusation based List management (Secure SEAL) primarily explores the various chances of disruption in IoT network caused by co-operative attacks at the edge nodes. The internal co-operative attack is a type of attack which is jointly performed by a group of nodes in IoT network. There is no fine-grained technique to defend against co-operative attacks. To this end, a fuzzy based trustworthy environment is established for reducing the security threats in smart cities with the help of Edge Computing. The trustworthy environment ensures the timely identification of malicious entities and the detection of co-operative attacks. In Edge Computing, the computations required to perform at the end devices can be placed at Edge servers. This will reduce the expected latency and bandwidth utilization required for traditional cloud access. Secure SEAL uses a fuzzy based approach to avoid and isolate the presence of malicious nodes in IoT network. The suspected nodes are re-analyzed based on the reputation value obtained by reaction based trust evaluation. Eventually, the performance of the proposed trustworthy environment has been validated. The proposed work’s efficacy in minimizing the impact of co operative attacks (more than 90%) is comparatively high.}

This paper presents a review of the system architecture of DESs for building decarbonization, including hybrid energy systems, energy storage technologies, building flexible loads, and electric vehicles. The uncertainties from both the environment and human interventions challenge the energy management due to the asynchrony between energy generation and energy consumption. Thus, the system should be optimally designed and operated to enhance the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of the DES. The paper highlights the adoption of optimization approaches.

abstract = {Context
Food security is highly reliant on agricultural activity to drive the world economy. However, this activity is in great danger due to climatic changes and improper use of irrigation techniques. Consequently, the lives of numerous individuals worldwide are in jeopardy. In light, this paper investigates the promise of smart irrigation systems based on new technology.
Objective
To meet the growing demand for water in agriculture, this study presents an intelligent irrigation system that uses cutting-edge technologies of (1) cloud computing, (2) embedded systems, and (3) Internet-of-Things (IoT). The main objective is to demonstrate how this innovative strategy can effectively manage water resources, supporting food security through cutting-edge agricultural technology.
Methods
This paper proposes a smart irrigation system based on cutting-edge technologies like the embedded system, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing as a groundbreaking strategy to improve food security through the implementation of advanced agricultural technology. This system supervises real-time monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as (1) moisture, (2) humidity, (3) temperature, and (4) water levels, in smart agriculture practices. In addition, this system employs the latest sensors, including the module (DHT22), water level sensor, and moisture sensors, which are connected to the widely used embedded system (ESP32). The system uses the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm owner, enhancing their interaction. The automated control of the two water pumps is based on the readings of various environmental factors. Moreover, this will also present a mathematical-driven function known as linear interpolation to calibrate the water level sensor in percentage. This system was created using the V-model software development approach.
Results and conclusion
Farmers can access comprehensive farm data from anywhere in the world as the sensor data is transmitted in real-time to both the ThingSpeak cloud and the ThingView. This capability allows for more precise crop irrigation and increased production. The study's findings demonstrate a striking 70% reduction in water consumption for soil irrigation when utilizing the proposed smart irrigation system. This paper underscores the significant promise of smart irrigation systems, driven by IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing, to conserve water resources and advance food security.
Significance
This article proposes an innovative solution that reduces soil irrigation water consumption by 70% compared to traditional methods. It explores how smart irrigation can improve the sustainability of agriculture and positively influence food security.}

A review of relevant literature has shown that telecare supported by smart environments is an under-researched topic and that a central gap includes the lack of research on the integration of telecare services into the healthcare and long-term care systems. In the numerical example we also show how it influence a possible reduction of human resources in rural areas.}

SLE research has grown over time, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2021, which fundamentally altered the “landscape” of technology use in education. This study aims to discover how the stages of SLE transform from time to time by applying two bibliometric analysis approaches: publication performance analysis and science mapping. The dataset was created by extracting bibliometric data from Scopus, including 427 articles, 162 publication sources (journals and proceeding), and 1080 authors from 2002 to 2022. Three kinds of SLE research subjects were identified by keyword synthesis: SLE features, technological innovation, and adaptive learning systems. Adaptive learning and personalized learning are consistently used interchangeably to demonstrate the significance of supporting the diversity of student and teacher conditions. Learning analytics, essential to employing big data technology for educational data mining, is a new theme being considered increasingly in the future to achieve adaptive and personalized learning.

abstract = {Background
COVID-19 prompted widespread transition of face-to-face mutual-help groups to virtual delivery. Current understanding of the experience of virtual mutual-help groups is limited to 12-step approaches or asynchronous groups (e.g., forums). This paper explores participant and facilitator perspectives regarding the benefits and challenges of accessing SMART Recovery mutual-help groups virtually via videoconference.
Methods
A self-selected convenience sample of participants (n = 29) and facilitators (n = 15) from SMART Recovery mutual-help groups in Australia were enrolled. Participants and facilitators were sampled to reflect experience of virtual groups delivered via videoconference (‘online’), face-to-face groups (‘face-to-face’) or both types of groups (‘both’). Telephone qualitative interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using iterative categorisation.
Results
Participant and facilitators discussed their experience across eight interconnected themes benefits were typically discussed with regard to the (1) availability, (2) ease of access and (3) value add of the chat feature in online groups. Challenges largely pertained to (1) in-group engagement, (2) group size, (3) non-verbal cues, (4) social interaction and (5) technology problems. The impact of these challenges on participant and facilitator experience varied, and neither modality was consistently identified as superior.
Conclusions
SMART Recovery mutual-help groups provided participants with another option for accessing mutual-help and appealed to different people under different circumstances. Depending on the needs and preferences of the individual, online SMART Recovery mutual-help groups may help to mitigate a range of barriers to help seeking and may also engage people otherwise unable or reluctant to engage in treatment. To inform training, practice and policy, improved understanding of the individual and contextual factors that enhance participant engagement, experience and outcomes is needed.}

The sustainable development scenario (SDS) shows a switch to clean fuel and increased electrification, resulting in a decrease in primary energy (PE) demand at an average annual rate of 0.9% from 41.7 TWh in 2016 to 30.3 TWh in 2050 corresponding to a total PE saving of 40% compared to the BAU scenario. The SDS results will achieve the set targets of SCWFS reflected in decreasing the final energy (FE) consumption per capita to 48% by 2050 compared to 2005, increasing the share of renewables in FE consumption to 73% by 2050, and doubling the share of renewable energy production within the city boundary by 2030 compare to 2005. The result of 1.86 tCO2/cap by 2030 is close to the set target of 1.76 tCO2/cap, whereas the 1.16 tCO2/cap fails to reach the set target of 0.53 tCO2/cap by 2050.}

Shortening the fallow period due to high temperature through cooling in a smart greenhouse during summer, extending the crop harvest period, and improving productivity can help achieve this goal. Cooling during summers requires excessive cooling energy for maintaining optimal crop growth conditions. Therefore, for effective decision-making in introducing and controlling the cooling system, a greenhouse model that accurately predicts the process of mass and energy change, including the effect of crops, and an adequate evaluation tool are necessary. In this study, three cooling packages applicable to smart greenhouses were proposed, and a greenhouse energy model realizing plant transpiration was developed using EnergyPlus. Subsequently, 1,296 simulation datasets were constructed based on the developed model and a combination of four design variables: installation area, scale, crops, and covering materials. Therefore, a cooling package applicability and performance evaluation tool was developed based on the simulation datasets through three evaluation indices: temperature control, humidity control, and energy cost. The developed evaluation tool can enable to select an efficient cooling package for sustainable crop production.}

One critical factor is the need of spatio-temporal demand data, but, increasing use of smart card (SC) fare collection systems has provided big data for free, and become a major PT data source and enabled deep analyses of PT-based mobility helps local authorities to manage PT operations. As SC data for bus PT systems mostly records transaction location with coordinates rather than the boarding stop (BS), there is a need to associate the coordinates with the boarding stop, which is the aim of this paper. To overcome with this issue, two different algorithms were developed as i) ground truth algorithm and ii) spatial temporal stop assignment algorithm supported by kinematic models which are the scope of this paper. As there was no shift or trip information in SC data, in the first algorithm, shift and trips were determined for each bus lines which were later used to assign transactions to BS. In the second algorithm, the speeds of vehicles were calculated using GPS data, and SC transactions were assigned to the stops spatially and temporally. One of the major problems faced during the BS determination was the precision/scattering of GPS points showing the location of transaction. Thus, the conditions of the assignment results were grouped as i) on stop and ii) en-route (while vehicle moving between stations) and iii) not assigned. For the application of these algorithms, one-month SC data of Konya City (Turkey) with 4.9 million boarding transactions was used as an example. The statistics on BS assignment by two algorithms were presented and their performance in terms of running times were compared. Besides the general limitations and problems in the assignment procedures were discussed in detail.}

Based on a number of theories including the Technology, Organization, and Environment framework (TOE), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and Technology Acceptance Models (TAM), the study established an integrated conceptual research model. Online survey questionnaires were sent to 2060 employees in four ministries and after the second reminder a total of 427 completed answers were received, of which 419 (22% response rate) were deemed useable for the analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to analyze the data and results indicated that 51% of the variance (R2 = 0.51) of employees' perceptions of smart government systems is explained by independent determinants. Findings show that security concerns (t (419) = 2.051, p < 0.041), ICT strategy (t (419) = 4.215, p < 0.000), managerial support (t (419) = 5.027, p < 0.000), incentives (t (419) = 5.263, p < 0.000), and trust (t (419) = -1.957, p < 0.050) are significant predictors of smart government systems acceptance.

IoT systems have many benefits in the smart city, such as controlling and reducing energy consumption. Therefore, governments can save a lot of money. In the current study, IoT sensors are used to collect data from home appliances. There was a particular trend in the amount of energy consumed by each home appliance. Moreover, we investigate the potential to integrate machine learning-based anomaly detection approaches to improve the maintenance of the power systems and control as a fundamental part of the smart city concept. The models were selected to catch trends and changes in energy consumption at an early stage. Based on the results, the Prophet and LightGBM models outperform vector autoregressive (VAR) models in point anomaly detection. Furthermore, the Prophet and LightGBM models predict how much energy will be used in the future based on weather and time information.}

Agricultural production is increasingly incorporating intelligent robots for various farming activities. This paper investigates the task allocation and scheduling for multiple agricultural robots operating in a smart farm. For addressing this problem, a collaborative discrete bee colony algorithm (CDABC) is introduced to provide a viable solution, aiming to optimize the system efficiency in smart farms. To enhance the global search ability, several solution neighborhoods are designed based on a single robot and multi robots, and a problem-oriented dynamic neighborhood strategy list is given for the collaborative employment bees stage. Additionally, the neighborhoods based on the critical robot are constructed to enhance the local exploitation capability. A novel collaborative following bee strategy is also integrated to help individuals trapped in the local optimum move to more ideal areas in the scout bee stage. Finally, comprehensive design experiments are carried out to determine optimal parameter configurations and demonstrate that CDABC has the better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

Smart space datasets are critical to design, deploy and evaluate systems and applications under issues of heterogeneity, scalability and robustness, leading to cost-effective operation which improves the safety, comfort and convenience experienced by space occupants. However, many challenges exist in obtaining realistic smart space datasets for testing and validation, from a lack of fine-grained sensing to privacy/security concerns. SmartSPEC is a smart space simulator and data generator that leverages a semantic model augmented with user-defined constraints to represent important attributes, relationships, and external domain knowledge for a smart space. We employ machine learning (ML) approaches to extract relevant patterns from a sensorized space, which are used in an event-driven simulation strategy to generate realistic simulated data about the space (events, trajectories, sensor observation datasets, etc.). To evaluate the realism of the generated data, we develop a structured methodology and metrics to assess various aspects of smart space datasets, including trajectories of people and occupancy of spaces. Our experimental study looks at two real-world settings/datasets: an instrumented smart campus building and a city-wide GPS dataset. Our results show the realism of trajectories produced by SmartSPEC (1.4x to 4.4x more realistic than the best synthetic data baseline when compared to real-world data, depending on the scenario and configuration), as well as sensor data derived from such trajectories which adhere to the underlying semantics of the smart space as compared to synthetic sensor data baselines, even under hypothetical changes.}

Since early 2020, researchers have made efforts to study various issues related to cities and the pandemic. Despite the wealth of research on this topic, there are only a few review articles that explore multiple issues related to it. This is partly because of the rapid pace of publications that makes systematic literature review challenging. To address this issue, in the present study, we rely on bibliometric analysis techniques to gain an overview of the knowledge structure and map key themes and trends of research on cities and the pandemic. Results of the analysis of 2,799 articles show that research mainly focuses on six broad themes: air quality, meteorological factors, built environment factors, transportation, socio-economic disparities, and smart cities, with the first three being dominant. Based on the findings, we discuss major lessons that can be learned from the pandemic and highlight key areas that need further research.}

abstract = {The worsening energy crisis, growing environmental consciousness, and the detrimental consequences of climate change, prompted governments to reduce carbon footprints. One of the approaches involved is adopting green energy technology to charge electric vehicles (EVs). The US Department of Energy estimates that EVs may effectively use 60% of the input energy while driving, twice as much as traditional fossil fuel-based vehicles. Although EVs are tremendously efficient, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they can reduce relies on the source of electricity needed to power them. To summarize the role of RE as a viable charging alternative, in this study, we analyze four essential elements of EV charging infrastructure, RE-enabled smart charging approaches, utility interest and associated challenges and opportunities. First, the existing RE sources employed for EV charging are discussed with their global adoption, advantages and drawbacks and the leading countries. Second, we presented a thorough investigation of energy storage technologies, charging systems, related power electronics, and smart grid integration to facilitate the adoption of RE in EVs. Third, we discussed in-depth the many industry-implemented smart charging approaches with RE in light of the most recent global trend in EV energy usage. Finally, given the inherent challenges associated with realizing the sustainable transition, we discuss the technological challenges and opportunities related to grid integration, renovation, standardization, maintenance, network security and resource optimization.

abstract = {Pervasive and mobile sensing is an integral part of smart transport and smart city applications. Vehicle-based mobile sensing, or drive-by sensing (DS), is gaining popularity in both academic research and field practice. The DS paradigm has an inherent transport component, as the spatial–temporal distribution of the sensors are closely related to the mobility patterns of their hosts, which may include third-party (e.g. taxis, buses) or for-hire (e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles and dedicated vehicles) vehicles. It is therefore essential to understand, assess and optimize the sensing power of vehicle fleets under a wide range of urban sensing scenarios. To this end, this paper offers an optimization-oriented summary of recent literature by presenting a four-step discussion, namely (1) quantifying the sensing quality (objective); (2) assessing the sensing power of various fleets (strategic); (3) sensor deployment (strategic/tactical); and (4) vehicle maneuvers (tactical/operational). By compiling research findings and practical insights in this way, this review article not only highlights the optimization aspect of drive-by sensing, but also serves as a practical guide for configuring and deploying vehicle-based urban sensing systems.}

The customized definition of data distribution, which is determined by underlying device type, operational condition, control logic and healthy status, is presented. The dataset of HVAC system is analyzed to obtain its characteristic of in-distribution and out-of-distribution. The C-score based self-assessment strategy is presented to evaluate the prediction of AI model for those out-of-distribution scenarios. To solve the performance decreasing issue under out-of-distribution, knowledge-infused neural network is developed to diagnose various faults of screw and centrifugal chillers. With experimental tests, the models of machine learning, deep learning and knowledge-infused deep learning are compared. Although all of the models show satisfied performance for in-distribution datasets, only knowledge-infused neural network shows the acceptable generalization performance for out-of-distribution datasets. The self-assessment strategy using C-score illustrates the reasonable online evaluation, which matches the real accuracy metrics well. The visual interpretation of original and knowledge-infused residual features gives explanations of its performance improvement.}

This study proposes a novel smart energy-comfort system for green roofs in housing estates that utilises integrated machine learning (ML), DesignBuilder (DB) software and Taguchi design computations for optimising green roof design and operation in buildings. The optimisation process maximises energy conservation and thermal comfort of the green roof buildings for effective parameters of green roofs including Leaf Area Index (P1), leaf reflectivity (P2), leaf emissivity (P3), and stomatal resistance (P4). The optimal solutions can result in a 12.8% increase in comfort hours and a 14% reduction in energy consumption compared to the base case. The ML analysis revealed that the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system is the most appropriate method for predicting Energy-Comfort functions based on effective parameters, with a correlation coefficient greater than 97%. This novel smart framework for the optimal design of green roofs in buildings offers an innovative approach to achieving energy conservation and thermal comfort in urban areas.}

At the same time the advancement of technologies such as electric cars and solar cells, incredibly transparent solar cells for generating electricity are being witnessed. In this research, based on building energy simulation techniques, a commercial-office building has been investigated based on green building standards, considering the presence of electric cars and transparent solar cells. This research shows that the building with two scenarios of solar panels on the roof will be reduced by 9% and with transparent panels for electricity production by 18%. Also, the return rate of the first scenario is five years and nine months. The return rate of the second scenario is approximately six years and two months, which will decrease to 2 months and 20 days for the first scenario and three years and three months for the second scenario with the implementation of government incentive policies. Another finding was obtained through the intelligentization of electric car charging costs. It showed that if electric car charging stations are used in the building in three different states, including buildings without solar panels, building with the presence of solar panels only on the roof, and building with solar panels on the roof and transparent solar panels on the windows is 10%, 20% and 30% less than the cheapest commercial electric car charging station.}

A novel thermochromic material, P(NIPAm-co-AA) microgels, was synthesized and used to construct a tough double-network hydrogel with polyacrylamide (PAAm). A-DN hydrogel, with a high solar transmittance of 87.2% at 25 °C but gradually decreased to 0% with increasing temperature to 40 °C, can intelligently select the appropriate solar transmittance according to the ambient temperature. In addition, due to the special double network structure of A-DN hydrogel and small characteristic size of microgel, A-DN hydrogel has no volume change after phase transformation and has excellent mechanical properties and high response speed. Energy Plus simulation software was used to construct the application form of simulated Smart-Shield in buildings. Simulations suggested that A-DN shield can cut off 21.04% energy consumption compared with the normal glass, and its energy saving efficiency is higher than that of commercial low-E glass (10.89%).

However, most of the access mechanisms cannot be applicable to the industrial application as it is based on a centralized architecture. This architecture has a complexity of computation overhead to deteriorate the performance of device-to-device (D2D) communication. In the industrial sectors, security and privacy preservation are majorly concerned to perform expensive operations and to prevent malicious cloud servers. Moreover, the real-time objects should be coordinated to optimize communication efficiencies.

Nowadays, IoT is assimilated into various medical devices and equipment, leading to the progression of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Therefore, various IoMT-based healthcare applications are deployed and used in the day-to-day scenario. Traditionally, machine learning (ML) models use centralized data compilation and learning that is impractical in pragmatic healthcare frameworks due to rising privacy and data security issues. Federated Learning (FL) has been observed as a developing distributed collective paradigm, the most appropriate for modern healthcare framework, that manages various stakeholders (e.g., patients, hospitals, laboratories, etc.) to carry out training of the models without the actual exchange of sensitive medical data. Consequently, in this work, the authors present an exhaustive survey on the security of FL-based IoMT applications in smart healthcare frameworks. First, the authors introduced IoMT devices, their types, applications, datasets, and the IoMT security framework in detail. Subsequently, the concept of FL, its application domains, and various tools used to develop FL applications are discussed. The significant contribution of FL in deploying secure IoMT systems is presented by focusing on FL-based IoMT applications, patents, real-world FL-based healthcare projects, and datasets. A comparison of FL-based security techniques with other schemes in the smart healthcare ecosystem is also presented. Finally, the authors discussed the challenges faced and potential future research recommendations to deploy secure FL-based IoMT applications in smart healthcare frameworks.}

abstract = {Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is widely recognized as a safe option for household cooking. However, in settings like Nigeria, within sub-Saharan Africa, hazardous events related to LPG are not uncommon, often resulting from inadequate handling and utilization practices. Despite LPG's growing popularity for its sustainability and efficiency, safety concerns persist. This study introduces a smart system tailored to boost gas cylinder safety and efficiency. This system incorporates a compact and robust smart platform that integrates various smart components, provides real-time LPG level information, a load cell is available to continuously monitor LPG levels within the cylinder and issues alert upon reaching predefined thresholds. Furthermore, the system can detect gas leaks, promptly alerting users via a buzzer and LEDs. It is recommended for deployment in households, offices, and industrial environments, ensuring safety, convenience, and effectiveness in LPG usage. This research makes a notable contribution to LPG utilization, presenting an innovative solution to the challenges intrinsic to its application.}

abstract = {Japan has an increasingly ambitious and well-integrated smart city industrial policy. This policy regime provides ample and growing fiscal, regulatory, and administrative support for the deployment of smart communities, the modular ecodistricts that are the components of the smart city. In addition, Japan also positions its smart communities within a broader paradigm. This paradigm deliberately integrates energy and environmental policy, spatial planning, disaster resilience, export promotion, and a range of other policy areas. Not surprisingly, Japan's smart community projects number in the hundreds and rank alongside the world's best (Amari, 2016; DeWit, 2016a, 2017b). This chapter explores why Japan has an abundance of smart communities as well as extensive policy integration. After introducing Japan's generalized approach to smart communities, we present the representative example of Higashi Matsushima City Smart Disaster Prevention Eco Town. This case exemplifies how Japan's smart communities changed after the March 11, 2011 (3-11) natural and nuclear disasters. Before turning to consider other case studies, the chapter examines the role of crises, policy entrepreneurs, and policy integration in the central and subnational governments. This study of policy making is necessary. The key to understanding Japan's smart communities is in studying how policy entrepreneurs used 3-11 to formulate and implement a pragmatic, collaborative response to a number of challenges. We will see that policy makers believe that smart and compact cities can help resolve a wide range of problems.}

Smart initiatives are implemented on the university infrastructure to preserve our ecosystem. It is important to create sustainability awareness in the students and implement these initiatives in universities' infrastructure. There are limited studies on these initiatives' implementation, which creates a research gap. The research question is whether the University of Delhi (DU) is implementing these initiatives for creating sustainability awareness among students to put them on a sustainable path. The research objectives are to assess whether the DU colleges are implementing these initiatives; highlight new definitions of sustainability agendas into Go-Brown, Go-Green, and Smart categories pertinent to the education system and study them step-wise; study sustainable environment indicators: water, waste, air, land and energy; and conceptualize the “Educational Institutional Environmental Sustainability Stars” Theory and Rating System. This study selected Go-Brown, Go-Green and Smart parameters from water, waste, air, land and energy and conducted an assessment survey in 30 colleges on their sustainability compliance and evaluated them through a statistical analysis. It recommends implementation of these initiatives by the Government of India to develop futuristic smart universities, inculcate the “Educational Institutions Environmental Sustainability Stars” Theory and Rating System in the Indian educational system and to frame regulatory sustainability laws. Limitations are whether the outcome of this study conducted on 15 parameters in 30 DU colleges can be applied to all India's educational institutions; and whether the implemented initiatives have influenced the students to take them forward. The smart university modelling features inclusive of smart environment, smart infrastructure and smart education solutions with their interdependent relationship and various stakeholders can lead to future research.}

While previous studies have made valuable contributions to this field, the current state of literature reviews still requires a comprehensive examination to construct the knowledge map for future research. This study employed scientometric analyses, including collaboration network analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and co-citation network analysis, to examine 1133 previous articles conducted between 2015 and 2023 concerning the research topic of AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing. The findings reveal that the academic communities in this field comprise influential authors affiliated with leading academic institutions in China, India, and the USA. The key research topics of AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing show evolutionary trends during different research periods. Existing research on AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing is supported by classical references, which can be divided into four significant co-citation clusters, including the theory of security and privacy in CPS, DL-based IDS, DDoS attacks on CPS by botnet, and FL method for privacy-preserved data sharing. Finally, this study predicted four potential future research directions for the research field of AI application in secure CPS-enabled smart manufacturing: the well-structured and representative dataset for model training, methods for resisting PUF attacks against ML techniques, DL-based methods for detecting and resisting botnets, and lightweight FL-based methods for privacy-preserved data sharing. The findings of this study can guide researchers in this field for future collaboration and work.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated with Blockchain distributed ledger technology (BDLT) has become the most attractive research area in the domain of renewable energy and related power automations. However, the increased use of renewable energy-enabled devices raised various challenging problems, such as smart grid-based control management, power distribution, and automations. In this manner, the collaborative approach of blockchain, AI, and wireless sensor networks (WSN) provides a secure platform for control centers to estimate state, which helps to detect and analysis of bad data movement. There are various emerging issues in the field of Blockchain-AI in a renewable environment that poses a serious impact on the technological evaluation, for example, monitoring of contingency, optimal power flow, network reconfiguration, and the commitment of security-constrained units, and control auto-generation. So, in this paper, we perform a systematic review of the state-of-the-art integrated artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled scheduling, management, optimization, privacy, and security of the smart grid and power distribution automation. One of the focusing aspects of this research is the real-time analysis of the physical layer of the smart grid. However, in this paper, we design a framework of a unified and abstracted state-space, in which the system analysis involves malicious attacks and maintain an effective generalized defense hierarchy in real-time. The current mechanism of analysis of smart grid-enabled physical layer-based malicious attacks is categorized into their associative and targeted components. Thus, we present three different pseudo-smart contracts and digital signatures with consensus policies; that provide an understanding of the new registry of renewable smart grids details, participating stakeholders and their roles, and an updated power distribution automation ledger. We then highlighted the list of emerging power distribution automation-related limitations along with the informational management approaches that present the existing state-of-the-art in this domain, including data-driven, target defense, computation, preservation, etc. Finally, we discuss open research issues and future directions of the smart grid and automation of power distribution security and privacy.}

First, smart nanoparticles were prepared through ionic gelation and optimized using Design Expert® software where daclatasvir (DAC), chitosan (CS), and gelatin (GL) amounts were selected to be the independent variables. DAC was used owing to its reported Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, CS was chosen due to its antimicrobial activity and GL was used owing to its sensitivity to be hydrolyzed upon exposure to Papain-like protease enzyme (PLpro). The optimum DAC-CS/TAN NPs possessed 109 nm size and 94.44 % entrapment efficiency in addition to sustained drug release for 14 days. Furthermore, upon exposure to PLpro, smart DAC-CS/GL NPs released the whole DAC amount within 3 h. Then, DAC-CS/GL NPs were incorporated within PLLA NFs through electrospinning. Swellability was found to increase gradually reflecting the controlled release of DAC from nanofibers within 3 weeks. Cell viability assessments using human fibroblasts showed that the developed nanofibers possess high biocompatibility. An in-vivo animal model for skin irritation was carried out for two weeks where visual inspection and histopathological investigations showed that neither edema nor erythema were observed.}

In the study area, full of tangible and intangible heritage, technological tools, can revitalize and reuse examples of architecture, especially monumental, whose main problem is a deep rising damp affecting the masonry. That is particularly critical for the historic/traditional architectures. This research implements, in one of the villages of the enclave, a new technology system, namely Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tool, like Charge neutralisation Technology (CNT), in contrast to the usual application of the classic and well-known resolution systems. This kind of methodology has been already applied in many monumental buildings in Italy with brilliant results and supporting the protection, enhancement, and promotion of cultural heritage. In Sicily it was never used and represents, in line with the smart village approach, a viable technology to be applied. The smart village model is one of the increasingly popular research topics globally and provides technologies aimed at preserving the identity of the territory and the historical buildings. Culture, if usable and accessible to all, results as an economic resource, a tourist attraction, and a factor of identity. The goal is to develop these inner areas through the smart villages approach by implementing smart technologies and establishing a synergic union of centers to be more competitive in the Sicilian hinterland, but also at the national level, with respect to the wise use of administrative, political, and governmental strategies. Cultural heritage and innovation, together, retrace the past with a view to modernity. The country's cultural heritage recovered and enhanced is a virtuous strategy to safeguard the identity and value of historic places such as that one of ancient villages and a way to find smart resilient strategies and a sustainability assessment for future communities.}

Therefore, this study proposes a method that integrates multiple models into an SPSS with three steps: (1) Collect data and construct an appropriate object detection model. (2) Develop smart PSS solutions. Then, (3) Optimize the system based on feedback through Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide customers with personalized services. An attraction recommendation case study with experiment is designed to verify the proposed method. The results show that proposed SPSS can optimize the system in time according to the feedback of users, and provide better personalized services.

Furthermore, the decision-making result is just derived according to the given objective and subjective information, without considering the DM’s subjective evaluation and the environment’s dynamic influence. Unlike the previous studies, this paper tries to address them from the deep learning viewpoint. To this end, we first define the non-equidimensional HFS (NHFS) and then introduce the equidimensional and classification characters into the NHFS to further develop the equidimensional HFS (EHFS) and the EHFS with the optimal classification result. Then, the equidimensional hesitant fuzzy-generative adversarial network (EHF-GAN) model is proposed to transform the hesitant fuzzy information from the non-equidimensional to the equidimensional form. The generalization and the convergence of the new model are proven to show the models’ reasonability. In addition, the double-learning algorithm of the EHF-GAN model is designed, which can fuse the DMs’ dynamic judgments and derive the optimal decision-making results. Lastly, this paper applies the proposed model and algorithm to an illustrative example of the new smart city enterprises and then shows their feasibility and effectiveness.}

This is aligned with an overarching goal of smart and sustainable living. The overall travel journey is usually composed of a trip from home to the airport, called the connecting trip, and a trip in the air, which is composed of one or more flights. Currently, in the United States, millions of travelers drive in excess of 100 miles to reach overcrowded airports. The connecting trip not only magnifies the driver's carbon footprint, but also creates traffic congestion in cities that have airports—further increasing CO2 generation in areas surrounding the airports and worsening road safety. The model proposed here identifies a suitable airport location to directly reduce total driving miles. Indirectly, congestion on roads connecting to the airport and the traffic intensity at the airports in the hub-and-spoke network will also be reduced and passengers’ comfort levels will be improved. We will employ a case study from the state of Missouri, United States, to illustrate our model and its concomitant analysis.}

Is a city employing algorithmic decision-making perceived as friendly and controllable? Will algorithms assisting city officials be more accepted than those making a decision without human supervision? And, is a city in which algorithms make decisions with city officials perceived as more friendly and controllable than a city in which algorithms make decisions unadvised? To address these questions, we have conducted two studies in Poland, representative for the population’s age and gender structure. The first study results (N = 753) showed that individuals who perceived cities using algorithms as resident-unfriendly, were also more reluctant to accept algorithmic governance. The perceived controllability of the city was not related to the acceptance of algorithms. The second, experimental study (N = 1047) demonstrated that the acceptance of algorithms increased when they were presented as collaborating with humans (vs. making decisions unadvised). Cooperation between algorithms and humans also increased the perceived friendliness and controllability of the city. The studies provide evidence that implementing algorithms into urban governance can lead to a sense of alienation and lower the city’s friendliness; however, collaboration between humans and algorithms may diminish this feeling and increase the overall acceptance of algorithmic decision making in the city.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely adopted in many smart applications such as smart cities, healthcare, smart farms, industry etc. In recent few years, the greenhouse industry has earned significant consideration from the agriculture community due to its ability to produce fresh agricultural products with immense growth and production rate. However, labour and energy consumption costs increase the production cost of the greenhouse by 40–50% approximately. Moreover, the security and authenticity of agriculture data, particularly for yield monitoring and analysis, is also a challenging issue in current greenhouse systems.The greenhouse require optimal parameter settings with controlled environment to produce increase food production. Therefore, slight advancement can bring remarkable improvements concerning the increase in production with reduced overall cost. In this work, we contributed blockchain enabled optimization approach for greenhouse system. The proposed approach works in three steps to provide optimal greenhouse environment that are; prediction, optimization, and finally controlling. Initially, the Kalman filter algorithm is employed for predicting the greenhouse sensor data. In next step, the optimal parameters are computed for the indoor greenhouse environment. Finally, the optimized parameters are utilized by the control module to operate and regulate the actuator’s state to meet the desired settings in the indoor environment. To evaluate the performance of our proposed greenhouse system, we have developed an emulation tool. The proposed system has been investigated and compared against baseline approach concerning production rate and energy consumption. The obtained results reveal that the proposed optimization approach has improved the energy consumption by 19% against the prediction based approach and 41% against the Baseline scheme. Furthermore, the proof-of-concept based on the Hyperledger Fabric network is implemented on the top of the proposed greenhouse platform. For experimental analysis, we have conducted a series of experiments using Hyperledger calliper concerning throughput, latency, and resource utilization. These results advocates the efficiency of the proposed optimal greenhouse system.}

abstract = {Urban areas are becoming increasingly crowded, and as a result it is challenging to ensure that these areas remain liveable and accessible. Municipalities need to make strategic long-term decisions regarding urban planning, which is often a difficult and time-consuming task. Digital twins of cities can assist policy makers during this process, providing an integral view on e.g. traffic intensities, air quality and noise. Furthermore, a digital twin enables policy makers to simulate ‘what if scenarios’ in a scenario-based analysis. Digital twins connect data, analytics and visualizations, which requires a system which integrates all these aspects in a single framework. This paper presents the Inter Model Broker framework, which is a scalable framework based on which large-scale digital twins can be built. A key property of our framework is that all connected system modules hold the relevant data locally in memory, which means that no central database is required. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated in a case study based on the city of Amsterdam in The Netherlands.}

However, the growing number of cyberattacks against CPSs can badly affect their reputation and wide-scale acceptability. The Ukrainian smart grid attack and Jeep hack are true testimonials for the financial impacts and extensive service disruptions caused by such attacks. They also justify the immediate requirement to secure the smart CPS environment. This chapter explores two popular smart CPSs—smart grids and smart cars. Smart grids play a critical role in the energy management of Smart Cities, and intelligent transportation is achieved using smart cars. After examining the current general architecture of these CPSs, we examine the security in these domains by listing different attacks reported against them and various countermeasures proposed to secure these systems.}

This research aims at providing optimized collection systems to accommodate various housing levels and considering the available resources. As a case study, the collection routes in Al-Mostakbal City, are optimized by selecting the appropriate location and containers order. Meanwhile, the pick-up time is optimized using the appropriate vehicle type, fleet size, and rounds. In addition, dynamic routing is applied using developed production models. A simulation model is developed to assess various improvement scenarios and recommend the effective one for various schemes.

The current development of such communities is focused mainly on urban areas and can be a key solution for the rapidly growing population of older adults. We highlight some key issues, such as digital illiteracy among older adults, the inadequacy of smart technology for older adults and the exclusion of vulnerable marginalised social groups.

Large-scale integration of various electric vehicle (EV) types into a distributed renewable energy system has not been studied before, and their systematic integration method and quantitative impacts are still unclear in academia. Therefore, this project converted an existing net-zero metro railway network into a smart charging EV hub by transforming the stations to smartly charge all types of EV intersecting at a station, such as public EV charging stations, electric shuttle buses and metro-owned EV cars. Accordingly, the methodology begins with the multiobjective analyses of integrating a public EV charging station into a swappable battery-powered metro station. Secondly, an electric shuttle bus is integrated into the stations without and with bidirectional energy sharing and evaluated for the impact of driving patterns, parking time, and schedule coordination. Thirdly, the metro-owned EV cars are incorporated into the stations and analysed for the number of journeys without and with bidirectional energy sharing. Finally, the importance of control priority while designing the smart charging EV hub is examined. Overall, converting a metro railway into a smart charging EV hub significantly increases the renewable energy consumption from 0.58 to 0.76, improves the net present value from 71.35 × 106 HKD to –35.02 × 106 HKD, and reduces the annual maximum grid import from 1099 kW to 777 kW. The success of vehicle-to-building energy sharing mainly depends on the driving demand ratio to the battery size.}

One of the modules, a multi-output, machine-learning unit, is deployed on the simulation results, enabling city officials to more effectively analyse vast quantities of data, discern patterns and trends, and so facilitate advanced policy decisions. The city's decision makers define potential city scenarios, key performance indicators, and a utility function, while the module assists in identifying the policy that is best aligned with the stipulated constraints and preferences. One of the main improvements is a speeding up of the policy testing for the decision makers, reducing the time needed for one policy verification from 3 hours to around 10 seconds. The system was evaluated for Bilbao's Moyua area, where it suggested strategies that could result in a decrease in emissions of more than 5% CO2, NOx, PM in the selected area and a broader part of the city with a machine-learning accuracy of 91%. The system was therefore able to provide valuable insights into effective policies for restricting private traffic in specific districts and identifying the most advantageous times for these restrictions.}

The city is considered to be a fore-runner in sustainable development amist the rapid urbanization occurring in India. Though, selected under the “smart city” project launched by the Indian government, the city faces many urban challenges ineffectively addressed by the current development plan. Haphazard and rapid infrastructural development without any comprehensive plan is leading to urban sprawl that compromises urban green infrastructure across the city. It excludes utilizing benefits of nature and ecosystem services to complement and reduce urban stress. This has led to wetland reductions, reduced water infiltration affecting the water table and causing water shortage, flash floods, significant loss of vegetation cover and biodiversity across the city and increased heat island effects. These issues along with current approach that discounts the importance of ecosystems-based approach has put forward many challenges and a question with regard to sustaining “green image of the city”. To reduce risk against uncertainties, it is imperative to understand human-environment connections that involves diverse values and ecosystem services provided by the natural environment of the cities. Present study is a review of major issues raised due to un-planned development and addresses the feasibility and appropriateness of using the EbDRR approach. Environmental engineering based approaches having potential to transform Nagpur City into to a “smart city” can set an example for other Indian cities to follow. This article facilitates understanding and practical applications of ecosystem based approaches and practices to counter negative impact of urbanization.}

Travel data acquisition and appropriate emission inventory availability make estimating high-resolution urban passenger transportation carbon emissions challenging. This paper aims to establish a method to estimate and analyze urban passenger transportation carbon emissions based on sparse trip trajectory data. First, a trip chain identification and reconstruction method is proposed to extract travelers' trip information from sparse trip trajectory data. Meanwhile, a city-scale trip sampling expansion method based on population and checkpoint data is proposed to estimate population movements. Second, the identified trip information (e.g., trip origin and destination, and travel modes) is used to calculate multimodal passenger transportation CO2 emissions based on a bottom-up CO2 emissions calculation approach. Third, we develop a multi-scale high-resolution transportation carbon emission calculation and monitoring platform and take the city of Hangzhou, one of China's leading cities, as our case study, with around 10 million daily trips data and a quarter million road links. Five modes of passenger transportation are identified, i.e., walking, cycling, buses, metro, and cars. Hourly carbon emissions are calculated and attributed to corresponding road links, which build up passenger transportation carbon emissions from road links to region and city levels. Results show that a typical working day's total passenger transportation CO2 emission is about 36,435 tonnes, equivalent to CO2 emissions from 4 million gallons of gasoline consumed. According to our analysis of the carbon emissions produced by approximately 40,000 km of roadways, urban expressways have the most hourly carbon emissions at 194 kg/(h·km). Moreover, potential applications of the developed methods and platform linking to smart mobility management (e.g., Mobility as a Service, MaaS) and how to work in tandem to support green transportation policies (e.g., green travel rewards and carbon credits in transportation) have been discussed.}

It makes an attempt to evolve the discussion on smart design from a simple add-on logic of digital over physical to what it means in terms of challenges and opportunities for the design process and the thinking behind it. This stems from a reengagement with and rediscussion of two fundamental spatial design notions: context and affordance.

Smart cities are transforming our everyday lives through the integration of their core services. A major part of the power consumed by cities is used by street illumination. The conventional illumination method consumes high power and rapidly depletes luminaire lifetime. In this chapter, a Centralized Eco-Friendly Role Assignment Scheme (CEFRAS) has been proposed for smart city street illumination considering requirements such as luminaire type, lighting duration, and zone. System modeling with simulation of the lighting applications facilitates testing various kinds of luminaires in a very large-scale environment. Investigations on performance metrics such as illumination level, power consumption, and luminaire lifetime were performed on the (i) conventional, (ii) static, and (iii) dynamic CEFRAS. The dynamic-CEFRAS in comparison to the static-CEFRAS and conventional method is shown to increase the luminaire lifetime by 25.94% and 33.94%, respectively. The power consumption of the luminaires is minimized by 7.31% and 8.18% by the dynamic-CEFRAS in comparison to static-CEFRAS and the conventional method. Thus, the dynamic-CEFRAS increases the overall lifetime of the luminaires and minimizes the overall power consumption.}

The traditional hardware devices are separated from the centralized network architecture of the smart energy network into a hybrid network architecture model of distributed trust.

Thus, a better understanding of the determinants of PSS usefulness in practice helps to improve the functional support of PSS for smart cities. This study is based on a recent international questionnaire (268 respondents) designed to evaluate the perceptions of scholars and practitioners in the smart city planning field. Based on the empirical evidence, this paper recommends that it is imperative for PSS developers and users to be more responsive to the fit for task-technology and user-technology (i.e., utility and usability, respectively) since they positively contribute to PSS usefulness in practice and to be more sensitive to the potential negative effects of contextual factors on PSS usefulness in smart cities. The empirical analyses further suggest that rather than merely striving for integrating smart city technologies into advancing PSS, the way that innovative PSS are integrated into the planning framework (i.e., how well PSS can satisfy the needs of planning tasks and users by considering context-specificities) is of great significance in promoting PSS's actual usefulness.}

abstract = {Implementing Intelligent Transport System (ITS) presents many challenges despite its potential to enhance mobility, reduce congestion, and improve traffic management in urban regions. Previous research has focused on investigating the obstacles associated with implementing ITS in particular settings. However, a more all-encompassing comprehension of the effects of these challenges on intelligent urban mobility is required. The objective of this research is to examine the obstacles that affect the execution of ITS within the context of intelligent urban mobility. The present study makes a scholarly contribution by identifying and analyzing the key challenges that hinder the execution of ITS for intelligent urban mobility. The research utilized both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the data obtained from a questionnaire survey administered to professionals in transport and urban planning. The findings suggest that the successful implementation of ITS for smart urban mobility is significantly influenced by various challenges, including technical, resource-related, interoperability, management, personal, and economic factors. The results of the study have various implications for management. Urban planners and transport professionals must prioritize resolving the challenges identified in this study to ensure the successful implementation of ITS. The study's sample was limited to professionals exclusively from the transport and urban planning sectors, thereby precluding the inclusion of viewpoints from other relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, the research was constrained to a particular geographical area. Subsequent research endeavors may consider enlarging the sample size and extending the geographic range to enhance the applicability of the results.}

abstract = {Climate change, such as melting ice caps in Antarctica or a rise in sea level, poses a mega threat to our daily lives, worsening living conditions and the quality of our lives in many ways. The main contributor to this climate change is the emission of excessive CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) into the earth's atmosphere as a result of continuous human activities. Many nations and international organizations have already realized the adverse effects of climate change, emphasizing that decarbonization is the key to reducing climate change. Based on that, in this research, we design a novel, smart, carbon–neutral hydroponic farming setup for stem cutting propagation of tropical tree species to supply plantlets for reforestation and revegetation of degraded forests. The aim is to reduce the effects of climate change, as planting or replanting more trees would help in reducing the existing greenhouse gases, while the trees act as effective natural carbon sinks. We have integrated our hydroponic stem cutting propagation system with the cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) to design an extended cloud-enabled platform for monitoring underlying real-time conditions pertaining to hydroponic systems and evaluating the generation and consumption of solar energy to prove that our setup is carbon–neutral. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind, and we believe this research would contribute to the concerted efforts in overcoming challenges associated with climate change and provide references for future researchers who are keen on developing environmentally friendly and smart solutions.}

More specifically, research has overlooked how such provider capabilities address the adopter's requirements and facilitate the related innovation outcomes for the adopter firm. Thus, our findings provide several contributions to the literature. Firstly, by examining two smart manufacturing projects within Pharmaceutical and Semi-conductor manufacturing contexts, we provide an in-depth analysis of the complexity of adopter requirements. Secondly, we uncover the nature of three main technology provider dynamic ecosystem capabilities. These reflect comprehensive skills in technology search and learning, project implementation, and knowledge transfer capabilities supporting the development of solutions for decision-making and predictive maintenance. Thirdly, we reveal how provider ecosystems build on these capabilities to address the complex requirements of the adopter firm and facilitate different types of process innovation outcomes.

One of the key research challenges toward replacing wired fieldbuses with wireless links is the design of wireless systems that address short packet transmissions and multi-user environments. Nevertheless, this challenge is partially obstructed by the limits of the current proposals and the industrial channel models. The authors detect as a potential solution the optimization of IEEE 802.11ax that, due to the use of OFDMA, could offer a high-performant system for smart warehouses. This article proposes an ad-hoc wireless system based on IEEE 802.11ax for smart warehouses that comprises optimization for MAC and PHY layers. Furthermore, two retransmission schemes based on frequency domain are described. This article proposes a methodology to evaluate the latency and reliability performance.

In this paper the authors developed a planning methodology based on the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the reciprocal impacts among Smart strategies applied at the district level. The aim is to assess if and to what extent these actions would influence the performance of the district from a global perspective (Economy, Energy, Mobility, Community, Environment) compared to the base case scenario. The methodology has been applied to a sustainable district ideally located in the suburb of Rome and seven Smart scenarios have been modeled and simulated (with Matlab® - Simulink). Absolute results show the differences among the seven scenarios; the application of the normalized and a-dimensional Smart Performance indicators allowed also to identify the best scenario from a holistic perspective.}

The methodology addresses the benefits of smart technologies and their functionalities in buildings to offer low-energy, healthier, and environmentally comfortable buildings that balance the needs of occupants and the energy grid. This is a case study implementation of the SRI calculation to the university campus scale. The SRI methodology is applicable on a building-by-building basis; however, the assessment of large stocks and energy hubs is not addressed and will be the focus of this study. Other studies have proposed a method to extend the calculation to building clusters which, however, involves assessing all the buildings in the cluster in detail. The current case study extends to a much larger number of buildings, therefore, the assessment of each individual building was not considered effective. A critical implementation of the SRI calculation is presented here that leverages publicly available information like Display Energy Certificate (DEC) advisory recommendation reports for a university campus. A complex building is used to verify the proposed method based on the SRI detailed methodology. The proposed method provides a solution to the large-scale processing of building information across multiple complex buildings, hence benefiting decision-makers early on. Furthermore, the method benefits from the inclusion of building-specific recommendations based on DEC surveys. For the 98 buildings examined, a campus SRI score range has been estimated and focus areas have been identified as the foundation of smart energy and net-zero transition pathways.}

A pivotal contribution to this research lies in the introduction of an innovative Intrusion Detection System (IDS) fortified by the robust capabilities of deep evolving convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This novel security measure is designed to fortify urban energy transactions against potential cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the energy infrastructure. Furthermore, our study introduces a groundbreaking hybridization of the Bat Algorithm (BA) and Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) for the optimization of GAN model training. This fusion of optimization techniques enhances the efficiency and accuracy of the training process, elevating the reliability of the generated models within the context of urban energy management. To validate and demonstrate the practical applicability of these innovations, we deploy them on the real-time dataset of a smart city's digital twin. This implementation serves as a tangible proof of concept, offering valuable insights into the performance and adaptability of the proposed approaches within real-world urban energy scenarios. As the findings unfold, it becomes evident that our research significantly contributes to the evolution of urban energy management, providing a robust foundation for the development of secure, resilient, and community-centric smart city energy systems. Through these advancements, we pave the way for a sustainable urban future where energy transactions are not only efficient but also secure and inclusive, aligning with the broader goals of smart city development.}

To minimize adverse environmental impacts, industrial waste can be effectively managed through implementingsmart technologies. The present study aimed to identify the challenges of industrial waste management and propose smart solutions to effectively manage these challenges. The findings derived from a systematic literature review indicate that the challenges of industrial waste management can be classified into five dimensions within the STEEGO model. By evaluating the weights of each dimension using the HF-BWM method, the “organizational” dimension, with a weight of 0.27, was found to be the severest challenge, while the “technological” dimension, with a weight of 0.347, was considered to be the most probable challenge. Furthermore, the findings from conceptual modeling, using the TISM method, show that the primary challenges in industrial waste management include: “a lack of culture for effective waste management”, “insufficient training on legal waste drainage and proper waste digestion”, and “a lack of specific technical instructions for refining and recycling." To overcome these challenges, smart solutions have been proposed. The result of the HF-QFD method indicate that the most important solution is “constructing smart infrastructure for proper waste management”, with a score of 0.27. The novelty of this study lies in the theoretical development of the model for the challenges of industrial waste management by applying the “organizational” dimension, considering both biological and physical aspects in the “environmental” dimension, identifying smart solutions to overcome the challenges for cleaner industrial waste systems, as well as using smart industrial waste management technologies in different industries. Our results emphasize that, given the type of waste, industry managers should employ specific smart technologies for disposing and recycling industrial waste. This approach can prevent the loss of raw materials and protect the environment from various types of waste.}

This paper presents findings from analysing 3 years’ data of an Oslo Vulkan parking garage pilot, one of the largest hybrid public/commercial/residential parking garages for EV charging in Norway/Europe. A long-short-term-memory (LSTM) regression network is developed to predict hourly EV charging demand with a Weighted Absolute Percentage Error of 30.5%. The analysis suggests that a smart charging strategy is needed to shave the peak demand during 19:00-21:00.}

The results show that the camp's sanitation infrastructure is wholly unsafe, with faecal sludge (FS) not being properly contained, emptied, or treated.

These changes impact on the management and regulation of future energy systems and question how they will support a socially equitable, acceptable, net-zero transition. This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies, business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and optimisation (e.g. automated network management across energy vectors), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways. Through this they are expected to deliver on a wide range of outcomes, both within the SLES boundary and to the wider system. However, there may be trade-offs between outcomes due to pressures for change originating from competing actors (e.g. landscape vs. incumbents in the regime); understanding the mapping between different outcomes, SLES elements and their interconnections will be key to unlocking wider benefits.}

A web map service (WMS), as a RESTful API with URL, that makes real-time information of power outage and economic loss estimation accessible and available across the web would be valuable and important for decision makers in smart cities and smart energy utility. Objective: This paper presents a web-based system that is capable of creating real-time WMS. Our system enables geo-enabled applications (such as web mapping, mobile GIS app, operations dashboard) to access, query, and display a web map of real-time outage status and economic loss information associated with outages in the county scale. Method: Our method is based on the Internet of Things (IoT), web services, GIS web services, web mapping, and web GIS (Geographic Information Systems). To implement our system, we used esri ArcGIS for Server, SQL Server Spatial, Amazon Web Services, and C#.NET. The system architecture consists of autonomous computer program, spatial database, GIS Server, cloud computing platform, a WMS, web feature service (WFS). Our insight is in real-time by continuously 1) connecting to web sensors and collecting outage data, 2) connecting to web services for calculating economics loss associated with outages, 4) manipulating (modify, insert, delete) our spatial database over the Internet, 4) publishing a real-time WMS. Result: The system implementation resulted in a back-end server that includes /serves a real-time WMS. A data record includes: name of county, name of state that contains this county, total number of costumers located within the county, total number of costumers without electricity who are located into the county, and total economic losses (modeled as total jobs loss, total GDP loss, and total cost in $) caused by outages for the county. Findings: Real-time WMS created by our system can be used by applications to display and query a web map of electric outage status and their macroeconomic loss in real-time. They provide a decision support tool for disaster emergency management in the energy sector by aiding in prioritization of restoration operations and recovery phase in electric utilities in order to reduce the economic impact of outages. Our system provides an important platform for smart cities, real-time GIS, Internet on Things, map-based crowdsourcing applications, real-time intelligent systems, and for real-time monitoring and analytical applications.}

abstract = {In this paper, we examine the association between neighborhood change trajectories and the use of latent smart growth and sprawl words in real estate listings through a series of exploratory analyses. We address questions such as how, where, and to whom smart growth and sprawl type neighborhood characteristics have been advertised by neighborhood typologies, through time. In a case study on the Charlotte, North Carolina metropolitan area between 2001 and 2020, we find a positive association between the marketing of sprawl characteristics mentioned in property listings of a neighborhood and an increasing share of minority applicants and a positive relationship between the marketing of smart growth characteristics, income, and higher-end housing amenities. The spatial and temporal patterns of the marketing of smart growth in real estate listings correspond to broader trends that have occurred across metropolitan areas in the past few decades with the increasing suburbanization of lower-income and minority residents, and an increasing preference for urban, walkable areas among residents of higher socioeconomic status.}

abstract = {Newly emerging digitally-connected and renewables-based energy systems (often referred to as ‘Smart Local Energy Systems’) aim to generate, supply, manage and balance energy across all vectors as well as to improve efficiencies and deliver social, environmental and economic benefits to the local communities. This paper presents a qualitative study of fifty current Smart Local Energy System professionals to report on the career progression paths taken to engage in this newly emerging sector. Based on the careers of these professionals, we sketched examples of career progression paths in various sub-sectors of the Smart Local Energy System, as well as discussed the factors that foster professional development. Drawing on the evidence from this study, a set of desirable actions for employers, policy makers, teaching and training providers, and accrediting bodies are also discussed.}

abstract = {Sustainable urban energy planning depends on how renewable and local sources are integrated, how smart systems are implemented, and how synergies between regional and national policies are maximized. This study presents a methodology for the design of 100% renewable energy systems aiming to optimize the use of biomass and energy exchange with the national system while ensuring electricity import and export balance. The proposed procedure combines the robustness of the EnergyPLAN hourly energy system simulation model with the flexibility of multiple-criteria decision analysis. The result is a suitable methodology able to identify the best energy scenario based on a deep multi-parameter analysis from a technical point of view. A test case is proposed aiming at achieving 100% renewable energy for the Alpine city of Bozen-Bolzano in 2050.}

abstract = {This paper studies the performativity of smart mobility expectations in envisioning urban futures. Smart mobility, or ICT-enabled transport services, are increasingly considered a necessary ingredient for sustainability transitions in cities. Expectations of smart mobility’s contribution to such a transition are constituted by a strong belief in the transformative potential of data collection and use. These knowledge claims embedded in smart mobility expectations tend to be unchallenged, yet contribute to a particular future vision of urban mobility. Our empirical analysis, which draws on two empirical smart cycling case studies in Utrecht, the Netherlands, and Bordeaux, France, underlines the politics of such smart knowledge claims in two smart cycling projects and identifies distinct processes as to how such claims may shape and structure mobility futures. We observe intimate entanglements between what is being developed in terms of technologies and services; and the societal needs that the projects’ expectations promise to fulfil. At the same time, we witness a disentanglement of these interconnected knowledge claims when projects unfold, leaving the promise of (un)achieved societal benefits out of view. Indeed, smart knowledge claims carried strong inherent legitimacy in the cases studied, thereby risking to exclude non-smart alternatives.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of China's power industry and the improvement of residents' living standards, the electricity consumption of residents has increased significantly. With smart electrical household appliances are walking into resident’s household, residents can change their appliance’s usage behavior by using the built-in software to save electricity without sacrificing the electricity usage comfort a lot. This paper studied the influence of residents' smart electrical appliance usage behaviors. We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework model based on TPB and VBN theory, in addition, we considered external information influence, including resident’s usage knowledge, policies, and so on. We design a questionnaire and employ structural equation model (SEM) model to analyze the influences, and we find that the attitude, social norm, and external information have a significant direct influence on residents' smart electricity usage behavior, altruism awareness, and personal norm have no direct significant influence on residents' smart electricity usage behavior, however, they work through the external information and then have an indirect influence on residents' smart electricity usage behavior. As a result, we put forward some specific policy suggestions to promote residents' behaviors for the government, smart electric household appliance manufacturers, and the power service department.}
