abstract = {Based on the investigation of the development of fracturing monitoring at home and abroad, this paper studies the mechanism of fracturing fluid injection and fractures monitoring, and puts forward a remote fracturing monitoring and decision-making method suitable for conventional wells. Firstly, combined with the dynamic monitoring model of fracturing fluid, many parameters are optimized and analyzed. The velocity monitoring of fracturing fluid is realized by constructing the average velocity formula of fracturing fluid, and its approximate position is calculated. After analyzing the limitations of traditional models, the monitoring model of the unsteady friction resistance is established by summarizing the existing models and fitting the weight function by the gradient descent method. In this paper, the relationship between the pressure-time curve and crack is studied. Then the pressure curve is optimized by OPTICS algorithm improved by the adjacency list, and conduct the unsupervised learning about the stress data. By using computers, the pressure data can be clustered automatically. The classification is rapid and more accurate than the manual classification, which improves the intelligence and accuracy of data analysis, and realizes more accurate and intuitive monitoring of fractures than before. At the same time, the relationship between the city and well sites is analyzed in this paper. Combined with WITS acquisition and industrial Internet technology, the real-time data of the well site is remotely transmitted to the headquarters, which makes it possible to monitor fracturing in the city far from the well site, so that the combination of city and industry is no longer restricted by geographical location. It is beneficial to give full play to the role of industry in promoting urban development and promote the sustainable development of the city. Surface monitoring instruments have been fully utilized by using this method. This method of remote monitoring of fracturing promotes the development of intelligent city and provides a method for builders to ensure the construction safe and to make abnormal early warning of on-site fracturing.}

abstract = {Although data is a key part in smart cities, traditionally there has been no systematic effort to enable the sharing of data in a trustworthy manner among applications or services. In order to promote sharing of data, mechanisms need to be put into place to provide the different actors — data producers, data consumers, etc. means to control and visualize how their data or requests are being processed and used. In this paper we deal with a key issue involved in trust which is usage control, i.e., how data is used once access to it has been granted. We propose a Data Usage Control Model (DUPO) to capture the diversity of obligations and constraints that data providers impose on the use of their data. Based on the DUPO model and semantic technologies, we propose a trustworthy data sharing platform which enhances transparency and traceability of data usage in smart cities. Lastly a proof-of-concept is developed to evaluate our solution and results show that the performance of the added trust does not impact negatively on the system.}

abstract = {People, systems, and things in the cities generate large amount of data which is considered to be the most scalable asset of any smart city. Linux users are rapidly increased in last few years, and many large multinational organizations are deploying long distance high bandwidth (LDHB) cloud networks for centralizing the data from various smart cities on a central location. TCP is responsible for reliable communication of data in these cloud networks. For reliability communication among various smart cities, a number of TCP congestion control mechanisms have been developed in the past. TCP Compound, TCP Fusion, and TCP CUBIC are the default TCP congestion control mechanisms for Microsoft Windows, Sun Solaris, and Linux operating systems respectively. The response function of TCP CUBIC is higher than the response function of Standard TCP, which is a trademark congestion control mechanism. As a result, TCP CUBIC does not behave friendly with Standard TCP in LDHB cloud networks. The Congestion Window (cwnd) reduction and growth of TCP CUBIC is very aggressive, which causes high packet loss rate and unfair share of available link bandwidth among competing flows from various smart cities. The aim of this research is to design a new TCP congestion control mechanism for Linux operating system to achieve maximum performance in LDHB cloud networks being used by smart cities. In this paper, congestion control module for slow start (CCM-SS) is designed by increasing the lower boundary limit of cwnd size in slow start phase of communication. Congestion control module for loss event (CCM-LE) is designed by increasing the cwnd reduction rate at each packet loss event and finally Advance Response Function for TCP CUBIC (ARFC) is proposed to design a new congestion control mechanism for Linux operating system. NS-2 is used to compare the performance of TCP CUBIC* with TCP CUBIC in short distance high bandwidth (SDHB) and long distance high bandwidth (LDHB) cloud networks. Results show that TCP CUBIC* has outperformed in LDHB networks, at least by a factor of 18% as compared to TCP CUBIC.}

We present a comprehensive data model for smart cities that integrates several data sources, including, geo-referenced data, public transportation, urban fault reporting, road maintenance and municipal waste collection. We show some novel ontology design patterns for modeling public transportation, urban fault reporting and road maintenance. Domain practitioners and general members of the public have been asked to play with the prototype, and fill out a survey with questions and feedbacks. A computational experiment has been also conducted to evaluate the performance of our data model in terms of practical scalability over increasing data and efficiency under complex queries. All produced data, models, prototype and questionnaire results are publicly accessible online.}

This paper analyzes the temporal variations of public bike riding over the hours, the days and the months. A whole year of usage data (34,098,787 trips) are collected using Internet of Things(IoT) for the bikesharing system in Ningbo, China. Data Mining shows significant seasonal variations of bike rental amounts. The seasonal reductions of bike riders are explained mainly by three factors: nonpermanent residents leaving the city during the Chinese Spring Festival, uncomfortable high/low outdoor temperature, and rainy/snowy weather. Weather impact analysis suggests that rainfall decreases rental amounts significantly, with 1mm of daily rainfall expected to reduce daily rental amount by about 10%. The results also show significant day-of-the-week variations, with rental amounts in weekends 20-30% lower than in weekdays, indicating a clear commuter pattern of usage. The commuter pattern is further proven by the time of day variation with the double rental peaks of morning and afternoon. It should be noted that the total usage in either morning or afternoon rush hours only accounts for 60% of the total bike supply, which indicates that some bikes in the system may have been positioned in the wrong place at peak times. It is further shown that peak hour usage accounts for only 10∼12% of AADT (annual average daily traffic), much lower than the peak hour percentages for other modes, indicating insufficient bike supply and improper positioning of infrequently used bikes. These temporal characteristics imply that the bike turnover rate could increase further if the efficiency of the bike supply is improved with proper location and relocation of bikes. Understanding these temporal characteristics of bikesharing ridership could help the service provider and policy maker to improve the bikesharing services for building Smart City.}

This chapter establishes a holistic framework to define and evaluate smart cities through three core objectives that any city wants to improve—productivity, sustainability, and livability. Although smartness includes a wide range of aspects within a city, it should tackle the complexity of urban challenges internally and externally generated. Thus, adaptive capacity is becoming more and more important, requiring timely innovation. The chapter asserts cities are and should be a platform for technological and social innovation to enhance these three urban cores. Creating smart cities via innovation is not a one-way process, but reciprocal. Innovation can create smart built environments, and, in turn, smart cities engender innovation. There are many successful evidences and documented examples of both technology-oriented initiatives and social innovation strategies worldwide. However, there is limited understanding of the combined view on technological innovation or social innovation that can contribute to meeting urban challenges. Furthermore, how the urban future might benefit from interdependency and interactions of the elements in these two concepts has not been fully explored. The research will set an agenda for measurement of cities’ performance in productivity, sustainability, and livability from both technological and social innovation perspectives.}

abstract = {Cities around the globe are now following the “smart” trend. Smart cities are complex systems of systems that rely on IT to improve their efficiency in terms of economics or sustainability. Many of the activities involved in this context require data to be transferred via communication networks. However, due to the heterogeneity of the applications involved, different nature traffic patterns and number of connected elements (humans or machines), these data traffic flows become extremely complex to model. This work focuses on the application of location intelligence to simplify the modeling of data networks’ activity in such complex systems. It is essential to describe and understand when and where data is generated to effectively design, plan and manage communication networks. We introduce a model based on traffic generation rules and patterns to be applied over Geographic Information Systems data to create “dynamic data activity heat maps”. These heat maps provide a spatial-temporal overview of the behavior of network data in cities as a whole. In addition, we illustrate the model's application to a specific geographic area of relevance.}

This work aims at supporting coordinated emergency management in smart cities based on the localization of first responders during crisis events.

To further avoid the semi-honest-but-curious cloud server returning a fraction of false search results, this paper proposes a verifiable attribute-based keyword search scheme, thereby allowing users to check the correctness of the search results and achieving the fine-grained access control. Besides, our scheme considers the access privileges of the same data according to attribute-based priority tree. The formal security analysis proves that our scheme is secure against the chosen-keyword attacks in the generic bilinear group model, and the experimental simulations using a real-world dataset demonstrate its efficiency and feasibility in practice.}

Source Location Privacy (SLP) protection is an essential problem in security. To enhance SLP in WSNs, in this paper, we propose a trace cost based source location privacy protection scheme (TCSLP) in WSNs for smart cities. First, we construct a phantom area to position phantom source nodes far away from the real source node. Second, we combine shortest path routing and random routing to send packets to improve the location privacy of the source node. Then, to decrease the trace speed of adversary, we design a special trace cost area, which consists of many sensor nodes with different weights in mountains, plains, and forest. Finally, packets are routed in a ring around the sink node. The ring consists of many nodes that are chosen from nearby grids. Compared with source location protection based on limited flooding (SLP) and enhanced source location protection protocol based on SLP (SLP-E), which allows the packet to be transmitted in any direction but fails to consider the overused nodes, our proposed scheme can avoid overused nodes and reduce overlapping path. Simulation results show that TCSLP can increase safety time and enhance SLP in WSNs for smart cities.}

Maximum energy consumption reduction in residential buildings occurs in the lighting sector, and the smart management system cuts residential energy consumption by up to 37%. In addition to providing security and peace of mind, system features such as alarms for natural and abnormal occurrences may also give safety. With the integration of smart management systems in residential buildings, such as security control devices, seismic controllers, imaging controllers, fire alarm systems, and fire extinguishing systems, building resilience will be increased. With the assistance of an smart management system, a reduction in energy consumption of between 20% and 27% will be accomplished.}

Advanced manufacturing techniques, while still in their relative infancy for civil applications, nevertheless will eventually support the manufacturing of these integrated components, making new designs and functionality possible. Specifically, metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is proving to be one of the most promising advanced manufacturing techniques, with applications aligning with smart city infrastructure such as embedded sensors and targeted structural reinforcement. While reduced part weight, cost, and production time are the benefits of MAM, there are several challenges which have prevented faster adoption by the manufacturing sector. Specifically, part reliability and repeatability are especially poor for MAM-produced components as compared to more mature manufacturing techniques. A variety of defects plague MAM production such as thermal deformation, irregularities in grain structure, and porosity, all of which cause substantial fabrication difficulties when compared to traditional, subtractive manufacturing techniques. Academia, industry, and US Government agencies such as the Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and The National Institute of Standards and Technology have reached a consensus of the widespread need for in situ monitoring systems to detect build-breaking mechanisms uniquely associated to MAM. It undoubtedly follows that the smart cities of tomorrow will require similar standards for process control. In this chapter, we review state-of-the-art MAM monitoring research designed to provide structural health assessments and detect MAM-specific material and structural defects. We provide a case study of the development and design process of a particular structured light monitoring system and the associated measurement model used to bolster its measurement capabilities.}

Building smart cities is also a long-term task for China to promote new-type urbanization and healthy urban development. Nowadays, China's new urbanization takes wisdom, intelligence and green ecology as the core theory, and an increasing cities have joined the planning and construction of green ecology, intelligent and intelligent urbanization. Landscape pattern optimization is one of the important ways in achieving regional ecological security. With the rapid development of urbanization, the ecological space has been continuously compressed. How to coordinate the contradiction between regional ecological security and social and economic development has become the main problem facing China's land use. In this study, GLP-ESA-ACO coupling model is used to optimize the allocation of landscape pattern under the goal of ecological security and economic coordination, and Jinzhou-Huludao coastal area is taken as an example for empirical research. Maximizing comprehensive benefits is taken as the objective of optimizing landscape pattern allocation, and GLP is applied to quantitatively constrain landscape types from three aspects of ecological security, ecological service function and social and economic development. Based on the ecological suitability assessment of construction land, considering the change rule of landscape pattern characteristics and the ecological service value of each land type, the appropriate land use distribution map is determined as the spatial constraint of landscape pattern optimization. Using ant colony optimization algorithm, under the constraints of quantity and space, and under the guidance of ecological protection, the optimization sequence is determined, and the optimal allocation results of various landscape types are obtained and superimposed to obtain the final optimal allocation map of landscape pattern in Jinzhou-Huludao coastal area. The results show that: (1) The optimal plan meets the land use indicators of actual planning, takes the maximization of comprehensive benefits as the goal, strictly controls the development and construction of ecological sensitive areas along the coastline, and is superior to the urban planning of destroying the ecological coastal zone tidal flat wetland through reclamation; (2) In the optimal plan, the grassland in the northwest mountain area of Jinhu coastal area is converted into forest, which is consistent with the actual situation in the coastal area of Jinzhou-Huludao in 2020, and the hot spots of inland urban construction in the optimal plan are basically consistent with the actual situation. The research method is scientific and reasonable, which can coordinate the contradiction between regional ecological security and social and economic development, provide theoretical basis for land use planning and rational allocation of land resources, and also provide reference for similar research in other regions.}

Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users’ quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection. The proposed solution achieved an overall accuracy of 99.43% with 99.92% detection rate and 0.96% false positive and false negative rate of 1.53%.}

In this direction, the current work involves developing a cycling comfort matrix based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulations of an urban layout (Niigata city in Japan) under different meteorological conditions (wind directions) enables us to measure cycling comfort through: (a) the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) a thermal comfort measure and (b) the Turbulence Intensity (TI). Work involves validation of CFD wind prediction with measured experimental data. Results show that during the summer time, the higher wind velocity regions will provide thermal comfort to cyclist (near-zero PMV regions), but such zones also tend to have higher TI (due to high gradients near the buildings at high wind speed) which may be unsafe. This work has the prospect of both aiding in planning of new cycle routes and developing smart urban building layouts.}

The use of the SCD may improve the understanding of transit users' travel patterns from precarious settlements areas, where the residents have historically limited access to opportunities and are usually underrepresented in surveys. In this paper, we explore smart card data mining to analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of the urban transit movements from residents of precarious settlements areas in São Paulo, Brazil, and compare the similarities and differences in travel behavior with middle/high-income-class residents. One of our concerns is to identify low-paid employment travel patterns from the low-income-class residents, that are also underrepresented in transportation planning modeling due to the lack of data. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm for the analysis, and the DBSCAN algorithm is used to infer passengers' residence locations. The results reveal that most of the low-income residents of precarious settlements begin their first trip before, between 5 and 7 AM, while the better-off group begins from 7 to 9 AM. At least two clusters formed by commuters from precarious settlement areas suggest an association of these residents with low-paid employment, with their activities placed in medium / high-income residential areas. So, the empirical evidence revealed in this paper highlights smart card data potential to unfold low-paid employment spatial and temporal patterns.}

We find that non-digital knowledges are easily eclipsed, yet remain vital to effective and inclusive urban environmental governance. Our findings suggest that digital technologies need to be developed in ways that are attentive towards the different kinds of knowledge (digital and non-digital) that may be necessary for effective and inclusive urban governance. This holds for the knowledges that are used to develop digital devices and the knowledges intended to be generated through them, as well as openness towards unanticipated or overlooked knowledges that still matter.}

abstract = {Smart Cities have become a global strategy. However, massive data generated by various smart devices need to be uploaded and stored to the cloud servers. It is critical to ensure the integrity and privacy of the stored data. Quite a few public cloud auditing schemes have been proposed recently. However, most of them use bilinear pairing operations in the audit phase, requiring a significant time cost. Meanwhile, users (may be resource-constrained mobile devices or sensor nodes) still need to perform significant computations, like computing meta data for each data block, which bring a huge burden of calculation for these users. Moreover, those schemes cannot effectively protect users’ data privacy. Thus, we propose a lightweight and privacy-preserving public cloud auditing scheme for smart cities that does not require bilinear pairings. First, the proposed scheme is pairing-free, and allowing a third party auditor to generate authentication meta set on behalf of users. Furthermore, it also protects data privacy against the third party auditor and the cloud service providers. In addition, this new scheme can be easily and naturally extended to batch auditing in a multi-user scenario. Detailed security and performance analyses show that the proposed scheme is more secure and efficient compared to the existing public cloud auditing schemes.}

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.}

Wavelength division multiplexed passive optical networks (WDM-PON) are popularly used for supporting the high data rate IoT and ICT services. With the exponential growth of users and traffic demand in access networks, large energy consumption, OPEX, service reliability has become the most challenging bottleneck for smart cities. This paper proposes a flexible, wavelength division multiplexed passive optical network (WDM-PON) architecture which provides a dedicated point to point (P2P), broadcasting downstream transmission and latency-aware direct optical network units (ONUs) interconnection. Broadcasting downstream transmission is achieved by diverting a particular wavelength from the main path towards (N + 1) × (N + 1) star coupler (SC). Direct ONU interconnection is accomplished by separating the inter-ONU signal from the upstream path by using 50 GHz interleaver at the remote node (RN) and redirecting it towards ONUs. Direct ONU intercommunication avoids the complex re-routing, re-scheduling and re-modulation of the inter-ONU signal at optical line terminal (OLT) and thus increases the reliability and energy efficiency of the network. Broadcasting enables the best resource utilization, and direct ONU interconnection reduces the significant transmission latency among different communicating users. Proposed architecture reduces the operational cost and energy consumption of the network by reducing the processing by some components. By reducing the extra burden of the inter-ONU signal on downstream bandwidth, proposed architecture also provides the efficient bandwidth utilization.}

abstract = {With the current availability of an extreme diversity of data sources and services, emerging from the Internet of Things and Cloud domains, the challenge is shifted towards identifying intelligent, abstracted and adaptive ways of correlating and combining the various levels of information. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate such a combination, on one hand at the service level, through integrating smart cities platforms for user level data, and on the other hand at Complex Event Processing, Storage and Analytics capabilities together with Twitter data. The final goal is to identify events of interest to the user such as Large Crowd Concentration (LCC) in a given area, in order to enrich application level information with related event identification that can enable more sophisticated actions on behalf of that user. The identification is based on observation of Twitter activity peaks compared to historical data on a dynamic time and location of interest. The approach is validated through a two-month experiment in the city of Madrid, identifying LCCs in sporting events around two sports venues and analyzing various approaches with relation to the needed thresholds definition.}

A central issue in the context of smart cities is related to the capability to acquire timely information about city events. This paper describes a platform which focuses on processing messages posted in Twitter social network. Key issues here are the high throughput a large volume of data per second that needs to be processed, and the need to process ill formed natural language texts. With these in mind the platform has pipelined modules for robust, fast, real time tweet acquisition and storage, filtering of several kinds, natural language processing and sentiment analysis, that feed a final analysis and visualization module. A case study of sentiment analysis during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil is used to validate the effort made so far.}

Considering how relevant the city-regional path dependency is in each territorial context, this chapter elucidates the notion of data devolution as a key governance component for data ecosystems in Europe that is enabling some cities and regions to formulate their own smart governance policies stemming from technological sovereignty standpoint and to implement these policies by considering the role of the smart citizens as decision-makers rather than data providers. This chapter concludes by identifying an implicit smart city-regional governance strategy for each case study based on the techno-politics of data devolution.}

Based on an in-depth case study in Stockholm, the research points to utopian logics of visibility, predictability and controllability within smart city initiatives. These further point to a common tendency where planning is sought perfected–and believed to approach perfection through the supplantation of human planners by smart technologies. As urban planning is faced with pressing urban challenges and dwindling resources, “mere” brain capacity largely appears as too limited and as necessary to compliment with computerized intelligence.}

With the growing number of large cities across the world, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that holds the promise to make cities smart and sustainable. A primary objective of a smart and sustainable city is to ensure urban air quality is clean and sustainably managed for future generations. Current regulation-based ambient air quality monitoring technology in urban environments involves sparsely distributed bulky and expensive equipment, which requires continuous calibration and maintenance. IoT devices can help measure, monitor, and abet the impact of poor air quality. This is so because of the ubiquitous nature of the devices, available connectivity in smart cities, and opportunities to analyze data within reasonable time to take corrective actions. This chapter discusses various aspects of air quality monitoring for smart cities capitalizing on IoT devices. Starting with a discussion on the background of air quality monitoring in the context of smart cities, this chapter outlines the challenges and the various ways in which IoT and Cloud-based applications can work together to overcome those challenges. Overall, this chapter proposes a three-tiered approach for effectively applying data to achieve better urban air quality. The first tier is a practical approach, the second tier is a strategic approach, and the third and final tier is a legislative approach.}

These include: attitude on intention to share, perceived behavioural control on intention to share, subjective norm on intention to share, economic benefit on attitude, and perceived risk on attitude. Geographically, Germany and the United States of America were found to be the nations with the highest number of respondents. Temporally, an increasing trend in the number of articles on the sharing economy and respondents was observed. The consolidation of the drivers of the sharing economy provides a solid theoretical foundation for the research community to explore existing hypotheses further and test new hypotheses in emerging contexts of the sharing economy. Given the different conceptual theories that have been used to study the sharing economy and their application to different contexts, this study presents the first attempt at advancing knowledge by quantitatively synthesizing findings presented in previous literature.}

abstract = {With the innovations and increasing popularity of smart cities, video analytics (e.g., from social media, entertainment, surveillance, smart health monitoring, and crowd management) are used in a range of application domains to provide safety, security, and well-being for residents. As these video analytics are shared through highly interconnected devices, sensors, and other smart city stakeholders, security and integrity is a concern for secure video content. Without proper techniques to address the security threats of such transmission and sharing, it would be very difficult for a smart city government to provide safety and quality-of-life to its residents. To this end, this paper proposes a cloud-assisted framework for secure video transmission and sharing, where mobile clients have limited capabilities; however, users need to share videos seamlessly without sacrificing integrity and quality. In the proposed framework, once the video is captured by a smart phone, the key frames are detected. The key frames are detected by applying a genetic algorithm (GA). A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based watermarking algorithm is used to insert the watermark into the key frames. A two layer protection mechanism based on error correcting codes is applied to the signature or identity of an individual to generate the watermark that is inserted into the video to protect it from any transmission loss, distortion or attacks. Watermarked video is then transmitted to the cloud. The watermark is also shared to a number of clouds in a space efficient and secret-robust way. To check the integrity of the video, the original user can at any time download the video, extract the watermark, and verify it. To test the quality of the watermarked video, imperceptibility analysis is carried out using PSNR and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). The experiment results demonstrate that the watermarking algorithm does not degrade the quality of the video.}

abstract = {This chapter aims to enhance the existing concept of “smart cities'” to “inclusive smart cities.” For doing so, the authors in this chapter advocate a three-sieved filter that insists all smart cities to be necessarily “accessible,” “adaptable” as well as “affordable” (3As) to the needs and aspirations of “elderly,” “poor and disadvantaged,” and “people with disabilities,” henceforth referred together as “differently abled communities” (DAC). This three-pronged approach, 3As approach, insists that for a smart city to be “inclusive,” the first and foremost criteria is that its facilities must be “accessible to all” especially to DAC that continually struggle with differences in terms of physical mobility, mental abilities, and economic abilities. The second essential characteristic is its “adaptability” that refers to its flexibility that must emanate from various smart features for addressing the personal aspirations and contextual needs of its DAC. Finally, the study insists that a smart city must be “affordable for all” so that its “tech offerings” must not be deemed as luxuries but should be available as a constitutional right for all. This three-pronged approach (3As approach) presented in this chapter has emanated from a desk-based research on the smart-city endeavors of various countries that are particularly responsive to DAC. Followed by this review of literature, the chapter moves on to propose a conceptual model for designing an inclusive smart city with special reference to Indian context. In the process, the study also puts forth related policy-recommendations—most relevant for developing countries like India that beseech inclusive initiatives for achieving SDGs by the year 2030. The overall intent of the study is to ensure that the emerging technologies must be employed more meaningfully to improve the quality of life for all irrespective of the differences assailing DAC.}

abstract = {The rapid growth in the population density in urban cities demands that services and an infrastructure be provided to meet the needs of city inhabitants. Thus, there has been an increase in the request for embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, leading to considerable business potential for the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which all devices are capable of interconnecting and communicating with each other over the Internet. Thus, Internet technologies provide a way of integrating and sharing a common communication medium. With this knowledge, in this paper, we propose a combined IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning using Big Data analytics. We propose a complete system consisting of various types of sensor deployment, including smart home sensors, vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors, and surveillance objects. A four-tier architecture is proposed that includes 1) Bottom tier-1, which is responsible for IoT sources and data generation and collection, 2) Intermediate tier-1, which is responsible for all types of communication between, for instance, sensors, relays, base stations, and the Internet, 3) Intermediate tier 2, which is responsible for data management and processing using a Hadoop framework, and 4) Top tier, which is responsible for application and usage of the data analysis and the results generated. The system implementation consists of various steps that begin with data generation and move to collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing and decision making. The proposed system is implemented using Hadoop with Spark, voltDB, Storm or S4 for real time processing of the IoT data to generate results to establish the smart city. For urban planning or city future development, the offline historical data are analyzed with Hadoop using MapReduce programming. IoT datasets generated by smart homes, smart parking weather, pollution, and vehicle data sets are used for analysis and evaluation. This type of system with full functionality does not currently exist. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient than existing systems. Moreover, system efficiency is measured in terms of throughput and processing time.}

Parallel with the evolution of the world wide web, these technologies vary in their complexity, capability, and applicability to different scales and types of planning activities. While such technologies represent a significant opportunity for planners and planning to become more effective and efficient, little is currently known about planners perceptions of such technologies and how they are responding to the increasingly technological nature of their work. This chapter seeks to fill this gap and explore planners’ perspectives and experiences of new technologies in planning practice.}

With an increase in carbon emissions, the popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is a major step towards environment friendly smart cities. However, energy trading with dynamic pricing is one of the major challenges for EVs in a smart city environment. Most of the existing solutions reported in the literature do not consider energy trading with an aim to maximize benefits to EVs in terms of their demand satisfaction. EVs have to pay higher price as they have limited knowledge about the location and pricing policy of the charging stations (CSs). Moreover, they have to wait for long time till the required amount of energy is met from the CSs. To address these issues, a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game for energy trading is proposed by assuming EVs as the consumers and CSs as energy providers. Using this concept, a dynamic pricing scheme known as multi parameter pricing scheme is designed by taking parameters such as — electricity usage, time-of-use, location, and type of EVs. Two cases of Stackelberg Game are considered in the proposal- (i) EVs as leaders and CSs as followers, and (ii) CSs as leaders and EVs as followers. The proposed scheme is evaluated using three types of vehicles with respect to performance metrics such as (a) price of energy (b) utility function and (c) satisfaction factor. The results obtained clearly depict the superior performance of the proposed scheme in comparison to the existing schemes.}

One cannot look at the development of systems in cities and their path to Smart Cities only from the point of view of the architecture of these systems and the development of IoT systems. First of all, important mechanisms resulting from the development of Smart Cities, which are processes of obtaining and processing open data, should be taken into account. It should also be seen that the basis for the development of Smart Cities are not long-term processes but implemented projects that are a consequence of the city’s short-term processes. Hence, these projects should be properly managed. It should also be considered to what extent reference models and IoT system architectures are closed to technology only, and to what extent they can form the basis for building a reference model of using open data from IoT devices for Smart Cities. This chapter reflects on experiences gained by IoT-fueled open data projects implemented by the author in the frame of Smart Cities. Two scientific and research projects managed using conventional (hard) approaches were presented. Also, problems with the implementation of these projects are presented, resulting from their strong innovation and at the same time the difficulties of entering these projects into the rigid framework of PM. This arrangement of presentation of PM methods was important from the point of view of analyzing the possibilities of expanding Agile methods with hard management aspects. It was also important for assessing the possibilities of reducing classical software PM methods for specific Smart Cities PM. The purpose of this chapter is to consider developing a method or modifying an existing method of managing open data projects from the IoT for Smart Cities, including reference models for development or process management discussed in this book.}

This article revisits key interoperability questions in heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple, modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture is composed by sensing, access network, Internet/cloud and application layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security, have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover). Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring delays from the proposed low cost sunspot/mesh and arduino/mesh gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed. Significant results from simulations allow the analysis of the reliability on vehicular/mesh networks under jamming attacks by applying the OLSR and MP-OLSR routing protocols.

Many efforts have been made to efficiently utilize the existing parking facilities. Most of these solutions target the large-scale private and public parking facilities; however, the individual parking facilities are not much explored and exploited for reducing the parking issues. In the last few years, the Online-to-Offline (O2O) model has witnessed huge attention from the research community due to its versatile applications in many domains. The main objective of the O2O model is to create service awareness online, allowing potential users to review different offers and then visit local physical places for purchasing. The security of the users’ data has always been considered a crucial factor in any public sharing platform. The blockchain model has been regarded as a solid security platform for many public sharing platforms.

Several experiments are performed using the sawtooth blockchain tool to investigate the performance of the proposed blockchain framework against the baseline approach concerning latency, meantime testing (MTT), throughput, transaction sending rate (TPS), and average response time (ART). The obtained results confirm that the proposed approach is scalable and feasible for smart parking and other IoT-based applications.}

abstract = {Smart technologies have a remarkable potential for making our cites safer and more liveable. However, gender equity and gendered violence are largely ignored by mainstream smart cities and intelligent spatial planning approaches. Current approaches can exacerbate existing inequalities and violence due to the lack of awareness of the scale of the problem. Recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey show that nine out of 10 women who experience a sexual assault do not report the incident to the police with the result that mainstream approaches ignore the seriousness and extent of gendered violence. Counter to this, there is a burgeoning movement amongst tech and gender activists to identify and raise awareness around such problems and to apply technology to make urban spaces safer and more inclusive for women and gender-diverse people. A range of social entrepreneurs and gender activists have revealed the extent of street harassment and gender-based violence in public areas and begun to suggest approaches for tackling this injustice. This chapter reviews recent innovative initiatives to harness the Internet of Things and Big Data to address such injustice in a two-part approach. Firstly, to investigate the range of safety tech available and critique these initiatives. And secondly to identify gender-based safety factors relevant for designing and creating safer urban environments. In the pursuit of more intelligent and safer environments, spatial technologies offer innovative ways to analyze these issues at scales ranging from local to national. The uptake of such tools is likely to improve liveability in cities worldwide. To answer these questions, this chapter methodically reviews a database of 82 papers to identify 21 relevant peer-reviewed articles and critiques 12 innovative urban technology initiatives focused on gender and urban safety. Our findings are presented as a set of recommendations that can help urban managers better understand how to address, for example, UN Sustainable Development Goals 5 (gender equality) and 11 (sustainable cities) and a range of related inclusive initiatives in cities around the world.}

The answer to the question is neither straightforward nor unique, given the scale of the issue, the lack of a single administrative entity for such tiny devices (arguably run by a multiplicity of distinct and independent service providers), and the cost and power concerns that their direct connectivity to the cellular network might pose. This paper posits that one possible alternative consists in connecting such devices to their data collection gateways using “oblivious data mules”, namely transport fleets such as taxi cabs which (unlike most data mules considered in past work) have no relation whatsoever with the smart city service providers, nor are required to follow any pre-established or optimized path, nor are willing to share their LTE connectivity. We experimentally evaluate data collection and delivery performance using real world traces gathered over a six month period in the city of Rome. Results suggest that even relatively small fleets, such as an average of about 120 vehicles, operating in parallel in a very large and irregular city such as Rome, can achieve an 80% coverage of the downtown area in less than 24 h.}

Solar energy is one of the inexhaustible, clean, and economically viable green energy resources. Nowadays, photovoltaic systems are playing a major role in meeting the energy demands of the future. The uncertain climatic conditions and exhaustion of fossil fuel systems lead to vast use of photovoltaic systems worldwide. The integration of solar power with power grids in the actual power system causes anomalies such as abrupt uncertainties, climate changes causing system instability, voltage surges, inefficient utility planning, and economical loss. The forecasting of renewable energy is difficult for dispatch of generation and optimal balancing in smart grid due to high fluctuations. The confidence and accuracy level of photovoltaic forecasting are a challenge due to computational cost. Therefore, forecasting techniques play a crucial step for accurate forecasting of PV output and successful integration of PV into the grid. The random forest regression and artificial neural network machine learning algorithms are best suited for accurate prediction of solar power output. The performance of these machine learning techniques is compared in terms of correlation coefficient and performance metrics. The forecasting accuracy of PV output is measured by different performance indices.}

Smart Green cities are the future technology that emphasizes the impending of digital arrangement to enhance green environments and simplifies the authorization in green space planning. As the devices which are used in smart city applications are entirely equipped with the Internet of Things (IoT), there comes the need for ensuring the sustainability of such devices. Blockchain-based energy management is the most sensational issue that drives the implementation of smart green cities. For real-time IoT applications, there exists a demand for sensitivity and latency. Edge computing can provide support to deal with these kinds of issues, by providing a most well-organized structure in reducing the delays and thus improves the performance of the system. This chapter deals with the applications of blockchain and its technologies with the development of the energy-efficient smart green city in IoT environments. A novel model for the management of energy, waste, soil, and air is proposed by using the integrated blockchain technologies. The blockchain method will deliver a safety base for data regulation, and also the transaction of information is in between the unconventionally working devices in the edge-based smart green city environments. This will create a sustainable environment with more security features. The proper handoff mechanism with appropriate authentication routing strategy is proposed in this chapter. This will provide security against all kinds of suspicious attacks and thus improves the performance of the network and reduces the response time. Thus, the proposed sensor-based resource management with edge computing through SDN and blockchain paves the way for security and reliability in a smart city, making human life more comfortable and innocuous.}

Here, an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is deployed to pick up, and drop off users at their required spots, and then drive to the car park around well-organized places of city autonomously. In this framework, we aim to minimize the overall distance of AV, while guarantee all users are served with great QoE, i.e., picking up, and dropping off users at their required spots through optimizing the path planning of the AV and number of serving time slots. To this end, we first present a learning-based algorithm, which is named as Double-Layer Ant Colony Optimization (DLACO) algorithm to solve the above problem in an iterative way. Then, to make the fast decision, while considers the dynamic environment (i.e., the AV may pick up and drop off users from different locations), we further present a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm, i.e., Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) to solve this problem. Experimental results show that the DL-ACO and DQN-based algorithms both achieve the considerable performance.}

The system’s decisions are optimally shared between its two main designed layers; a “core cloud” and the “edge clouds”. The EM of a Microgrid (MG), covered by an edge cloud, is directly done by its operator and the Distribution System Operator (DSO) is responsible for optimising the EM of the core cloud. Changing the load consumption pattern, based on market energy prices, for the edge clouds and their peak load hours, the framework results in decreasing the total operation cost of the edge clouds. Using the optimal trading power of the MGs aggregators as the input parameters of the core cloud optimisation problem, the DSO optimises the network’s total operation cost addressing the optimal scheduling of the energy storages. The energy storages are charged in low energy prices through the purchasing power from the market and discharged in high energy prices to meet the demand of the network and to satisfy the energy required by the edge clouds. As a result, the shiftable loads and the energy storages are used by the DSO and the MGs to meet the energy balance with the minimum cost.}

Opportunities that can be seized jointly for efficiency/cost-effectiveness for all include strategic planning; area-wide data collection for planning; capturing economies of scale through joint procurement, research, and training; piloting technologies; and creating a joint body for their smart city development, possibly even functioning as a “control center” for some implemented applications. It may involve pooling of funds for a facility or equipment for shared use. The chapter also highlights more comprehensive metropolitan governance models applied internationally, through which smart city matters can be addressed, and obstacles that need to be overcome for effective collaboration among local governments. It concludes with a summary of a systematic approach along the lines of a smart city development framework outlined by the World Bank for cities in developing countries.}

abstract = {With the advent of advancements in the power sector, various new methods have been devised to meet modern society’s electricity needs. To cope with these large sets of electronic device’s current requirements, better energy distribution is needed. Smart Grid (SG) facilitates energy providers to distribute electricity efficiently to the user according to their particular requirements. Recent advancements enable SG to monitor, analyze, control and coordinate for the demand and supply of electricity efficiency and energy saving. SG also allows two-way real-time communication between utilities and customers using cloud and Fog enabled infrastructures. SG minimizes management and operations cost, electricity theft, electricity losses, and maximize user comfort by giving the user choice about their energy use. It also facilitates Renewable Energy Resources (RER) and electric vehicles. Blockchain is a promising technology, provides the necessary features to solve most of these issues. Current Issues include saving a large amount of data, deletion, tampering, and revision of data. It also eliminates the necessity of intermediaries. Inherent security, along with the distributed nature, makes it a perfect candidate for improving the overall services. The rules of the smart contract are automatically enforced upon execution. Smart contracts are enhanced in a way that per-unit price is calculated dynamically based upon RER and utilities generated energy units in the overall grid. The system is also automated in a way that electricity is transferred from one resident (or service) to another resident according to their requirements. The exchange of energy is done via a smart contract after checking the needs of each participant. Each participant defines their requirements at the time of the registration and can update these thresholds. The privacy protection scheme has higher security, shown by theoretical security analysis. The main contributions of our work are two-fold; Using smart contracts to automate the bidding process for transactions based upon supply and demand for energy in smart cities. Secondly, at the same time, using hyper ledger fabric and composer to leveraging Blockchain to uphold privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality at the same time giving the users ability to have dynamic pricing based on supply and demand.}

Its municipalities hope to attract investors, firms, high-quality labour force and residents in line with ecological modernization. They do so by using a variety of attractive city labels, such as eco city, low carbon city, and smart city. The physical shape these city labels take is best exemplified in the emergence of large new towns at the fringes of existing urban areas. Few studies to date unearth empirical evidence as to how municipal governments in China implement their smart eco city ambitions. This study does precisely that by examining how concrete policy networks at the local level develop new towns in the Pearl River Delta. The Policy Network Theory is used to map the positions actors have in three different new town projects in Shenzhen, Foshan, and Zhuhai respectively. It explains project progress or lack thereof by studying the organizational constellations that structure the interactions among actors and how the constellations affect their resources exchange. Our analysis suggests that in the various arenas where policy actors meet each other and are supposed to exchange resources and work out viable policy packages, blockades exist preventing such exchanges from happening. This creates impasses to which different cities have found different institutional and organizational answers.}

abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, metropolitan areas around the world have been engaged in a multitude of initiatives aimed at upgrading urban infrastructure and services, with a view to creating better environmental, social and economic conditions and enhancing cities' attractiveness and competitiveness. Reflecting these developments, many new categories of ‘cities’ have entered the policy discourse: ‘sustainable cities’; ‘green cities’; ‘digital cities’; ‘smart cities’; intelligent cities'; ‘information cities’; ‘knowledge cities’; ‘resilient cities’; ‘eco cities’; ‘low carbon cities’; ‘liveable cities’; and even combinations, such as ‘low carbon eco cities’ and ‘ubiquitous eco cities’. In practice, these terms often appear to be used interchangeably by policy makers, planners and developers. However, the question arises whether these categories nevertheless each embody distinct conceptual perspectives, which would have implications for how they are understood theoretically and applied in policy. In response, this article investigates, through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, how the twelve most frequent city categories are conceptualised individually and in relation to one another in the academic literature. We hypothesize that, notwithstanding some degree of overlap and cross-fertilization, in their essence the observed categories each harbor particular conceptual perspectives that render them distinctive. This is borne out by the findings, which demonstrate robustly for the first time the conceptual differences and interrelationships among twelve dominant city categories. The ‘sustainable city’ is the most frequently occurring category and, in a map of keyword co-occurrences, by far the largest and most interconnected node, linked closely to the ‘eco city’ and ‘green city’ concepts. Recently, the more narrow concepts of ‘low carbon city’ and ‘smart city’ have been on the rise, judging by their frequency of occurrence in academic journals; the latter in particular appears to have become an increasingly dominant category of urban modernization policy. On their part, ‘resilient city’ and ‘knowledge city’ represent distinct concepts, albeit with comparatively low frequency. Overall, the findings point to the need for rigor and nuance in the use of these terms, not least if one wishes to comprehend their implications for urban development and regeneration policy and practice.}

Due to the population growing rate, new issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario, surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are already using different types of devices to provide high levels of security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it. However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A relevance-based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city applications.}

The latter avoids resource starvation and is combined with a slice-based optimization method that configures spreading factor and transmission power parameters in a way that maximizes the performance utility in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in respecting defined quality of service (QoS) thresholds in terms of delay, throughput, energy consumption and improving reliability while providing a complete isolation between LoRa slices.}

The Adelaide case study illuminates the technological, economic, and governance contexts in which smart city policy is formulated and operationalized in Australia. While the state government of South Australia has long shared Adelaide’s vision—the city is a dominant economic player in this highly urbanized state—smart urbanism in Australia has unfolded in a setting where national governments have rarely taken an interest in urban policy. Adelaide is also an intriguing example of corporate storytelling, in constructing a narrative of its smart city credentials, designed to attract public and private investment, and build on a historical record of innovation and progressive governance for which the city and state of South Australia are known. The mobilization of Adelaide’s past to anchor and articulate its future, the chapter argues, demonstrates the importance of identifying continuities rather than ruptures when analyzing the technological transformation of cities.}

abstract = {The concept of smart cities is relatively new. However, “smart lighting” has been around for a decade or more. Smart lighting allows a “precious balance” of lighting to be applied at the location it is needed, when it is needed and only in the correct amount. Smart lighting makes the urban environment safe for humans at night while improving quality of life both night and day while enabling a more harmonious existence of technology, humans, flora, and fauna that cannot be achieved with traditional technology. Finally, a smart lighting infrastructure provides a network ubiquitous through a city that can be the initial backbone for smart-city services and technologies. This chapter discusses what “smart lighting” is and the benefits of such a system. Smart lighting consists of dimmable light emitting diode (LED) luminaires with sensor and controller interfaces, a controlling system, and support infrastructure. The control system is comprised of luminaire nodes, a communication network with one or more luminaire node controllers, and a human interface. Smart lighting, when adaptive lighting is implemented, can reduce lighting energy usage by as much as 50% while providing higher-quality light for improved safety. Lastly, the usage of smart lighting infrastructure as a jumping off point for smart-city devices and services is introduced. Usage of the excess power available in the lighting power lines is discussed as well as usage of the controller network for additional services or data collection and transmission. Smart lighting is available and offers significant potential benefits to cities. Smart lighting seems to be the logical starting point of any smart-city plan.}

This significant figure sets the plot for an interconnected environment that shares media content and sensors data. The most suitable environment for such a paradigm is a Smart-City. We present two data fusion techniques, which apply to the SPIDER Peer-to-Peer overlay.. The proposed methods take into consideration the architecture of the SPIDER overlay, which is formed by rings and chains; thus both chain and ring approaches are considered. Another contribution to this research is the analysis and presentation of two case scenarios of IoT in Smart Cities. The first scenario presents a novel approach to Smart-Streets and the second one describes a Waste recycling IoT scenario. The efficiency of the data fusion methods was evaluated through experimental data sets for different size neighborhoods.}

abstract = {Urbanisation in the cities of Sub-Saharan Africa has been associated with urban sprawl and increased vehicular traffic, which undermine the agglomeration effects of the cities on socioeconomic development. These adverse effects will exacerbate as the human population of the region continues to increase. Some scholars argue that making the cities mobility-smart could mitigate the adverse effects of urbanisation in the region. However, the conventional literature on smart mobility in Sub-Saharan Africa does little to demonstrate how the concept can be applied. In this regard, the purpose of this study is two pronged: a) to assess the mobility smartness of Ghanaian cities and b) to demonstrate how the concept can be operationalised to mitigate some of the adverse effects of urbanisation in the cities. The research process began with a review of relevant literature to conceptualise smart mobility. The conceptual framework was then used to assess the mobility-smartness of Ghanaian cities, which was followed by a discussion of how the concept of smart cities can be operationalised in Ghanaian cities. The results show that the cities in Ghana, like many cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, depend mainly on the road sub-sector for the movement of people and freight. The rapid increases in vehicular population without a commensurate expansion in road infrastructure have undermined the cities’ productivity. The conclusion from this is that the cities are not mobility-smart and for this to change, the paper argues that efforts should be made to improve people mobility, information logistic mobility and information mobility. These require technological literate and receptive population and investments in transport infrastructure.}

This paper addresses the utilization of the public transportation system as a mobility platform for sensor nodes and bus stops acting as sinks. This platform can improve the coverage of a sensor network and take advantage of opportunistic communication. Since this platform can be used for delay-constrained applications, we propose an algorithm to choose sensor sinks in the bus stops of a smart city that minimizes the maximum delay when delivering messages. We compare our solution with an optimal formulation and use real data, obtained in buses from Rio de Janeiro, as an input of our algorithm. Our experiments show that we can use approximately 16% of bus stops as sinks, having less than 10% of increase in the network maximum delay and no significant loss in the spatial coverage.}

abstract = {The intelligent and connected transportation system (ICTS) is a significant and mandatory component of the smart city architecture. Multimedia content sharing, vehicle power management, and road navigation are all examples of ICTS services. As smart cities continue to deploy different technologies to improve the performance and diversity of vehicular cloud services, one of the main issues that prevails is efficient and reliable service discovery and selection for smart vehicles. Furthermore, cloud service providers (SPs) are limited to the availability, variety and quality of services made available to vehicular cloud subscribers. Smart vehicles rely on a number of SPs to acquire the required services while moving. It therefore becomes challenging for vehicular cloud subscribers to acquire services that meet their quality of experience (QoE) preferences. This paper introduces a new service provision scheme to provide continuous availability of diversified cloud services targeting vehicular cloud users through a cluster-based trusted third party (TTP) framework. TTPs act as cloud service mediators between cloud service subscribers and providers. Vehicles that are considered to have similar patterns of movement and service acquisition characteristics are grouped into service-specific clusters. TTPs communicate with service providers and cluster heads to negotiate for services with high QoE characteristics. A location prediction method is adopted to determine a vehicle's future location and allow services to be negotiated for before the vehicle's arrival. We provide simulation results to show that our approach can adequately discover and deliver cloud services with increased QoE results, minimal overhead burden and reduced end-to-end latency.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G are establishing the building blocks of the post human smart city. These high impact industrial and commercial applications are contextualized within the evolutionary development and hierarchy of smart city functions. By exploring their inter-relationship and co-dependencies of the systems functions and subsystems at structural, operational and strategic levels, we can begin to visualize the impact these technologies will have on the design, operations and DNA of smart cities. Building on a combination of the hardware infrastructure that enables smart cities and diverse forms of AI and their capabilities and applications, smart city functions — Smart Mobility, Smart Environment, Smart People, Smart Governance, Smart Economy and Smart Living — are connected and optimized as individual and collective functions within an integrated city operating system. This new alignment allows cities to function much better, reducing noise within system functionality while creating efficiencies. Edge computing is an example of system optimization through the reduction of energy consumption, more efficient data processing and overcoming latency and bandwidth issues. The facilitated convergence process, enabled by AI, contributes to the desired outcome. The true smart city is not just about technology, but convergence on a new holistic, biomimetic system architecture level that optimizes the health and wellbeing of the users, the city and the operating system itself.}

abstract = {Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration.}

However, uncertainty in the dynamic process and limited information about chemical constituents and emissions sources make air-quality predictions very difficult. This study proposed a novel deep-learning method to extract high levels of abstraction in data and capture spatiotemporal features at hourly and daily time intervals in NEOM City, Saudi Arabia. The proposed method integrated a residual network (ResNet) with the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). The ConvLSTM method was boosted by a ResNet model for deeply extracting the spatial features from meteorological and pollutant data and thereby mitigating the loss of feature information. Then, health risk assessment was put forward to evaluate PM10 and PM2.5 risk sensitivity in five districts in NEOM City. Results revealed that the proposed method with effective feature extraction could greatly optimize the accuracy of spatiotemporal air quality forecasts compared to existing state-of-the-art models. For the next hour prediction tasks, the PM10 and PM2.5 of MASE were 9.13 and 13.57, respectively. The proposed method provides an effective solution to improve the prediction of air-pollution concentrations while being portable to other regions around the world.}

In smart cities, numerous IoT-based services are likely to be available and a key challenge is to allow mobile users perform their daily tasks dynamically, by integrating the services available in their vicinity. Semantic Service Oriented Architectures (SSOA) abstract the environment’s services and their functionalities as Semantic Web Services (SWS). However, existing service composition approaches based on SSOA do not support dynamic reasoning on user tasks and service behaviours to deal with the heterogeneity of IoT domains. In this paper, we present an adaptive service composition framework that supports such dynamic reasoning. The framework is based on wEASEL, an abstract service model representing services and user tasks in terms of their signature, specification (i.e., context-aware pre-conditions, post-conditions and effects) and conversation (i.e., behaviour with related data-flow and context-flow constraints). To evaluate our composition framework, we develop a novel OWLS-TC4-based testbed by combining simple and composite services. The evaluation shows that our wEASEL-based system performs more accurate composition and allows end-users to discover and investigate more composition opportunities than other approaches.}

Dynamic transportation assignment has attracted more interest in the smart city construction under the new era of the Internet of things (IoT) because the urban road traffic is the heart of many problems in many fields, such as in the case of city congestion and processing center planning system. In this paper, we analyzed the processing center’s economic indexes and optimized the dynamic transportation network assignment based on continuous big IoT input database, and a high performance computing model is proposed for the dynamic traffic planning. Specifically, while the previous methods exploited the geographical information system (GIS) or K-means separately, the proposed transportation planning is based on the real-time IoT and GIS data, which is processed by DBN and K-means to make the final solution close to the practice and meet the requirements of high performance computing and economic cost. which is regarded as the key target index. Moreover, considering the large data characteristic of real-time online stream, the deep belief network (DBN) model is built to preprocess the data to improve the clustering effect of the K-means. This study works on the example case of hotel service centers problem in Tianjin to evaluate the optimal dynamic traffic network planning result. The experiment test has proved that based on the performance of super high computing, the model is precisely helpful for the optimal planning of traffic network under real time mass data situation and low cost, and promoting the construction and development of the smart city.}

The dynamic path planning problem from multiple sources to a single destination (DMS-SD) without prior knowledge about the target is proposed in this paper. The modified Dijkstra’s algorithm (Xiao et al., 2022) in the previous work can optimally address the DMS-SD problem, which effectively generates an optimal solution in the small map. However, it requires more than 60s to compute the result in our extensive map test, which is intolerable for real-time navigation users. Therefore, we have proposed a hybrid optimisation method to address the problem more efficiently in this paper. The proposed method integrates the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and modifies the heuristic function to fit the hybrid algorithm. The pure MCTS algorithm can accelerate the randomised search by only exploring unvisited nodes, instead of generating every possible solution. More importantly, benefiting from limiting the maximum exploring depth, our method can approach an optimal point and generate a sub-optimal solution without any prior training used in other neural network-based methods. Experiment results show that our proposed algorithm demonstrates competitive performance with other existing state-of-the-art methods, such as reinforcement learning-based approaches, without training the neural network model. Our method also provides up to 98% reduction in computation time while obtaining sub-optimal results, comparing with the modified Dijkstra’s algorithm.}

Unlike the existing studies, the potential reduction of the service capacity due to failures are considered as well as various performance metrics such as throughput, mean queue length, response time, and energy consumption. In other words, the femtocells are modelled as fault tolerant wireless communication systems, considering factors such as mobility of the mobile users, multiple channels for the femtocells, and failure/repair behaviour of the channels for more realistic performance measures. A typical scenario is considered for smart-city applications as case study where a set of femtocells are deployed within the coverage area of a macrocell. The numerical results presented show the accuracy of the proposed model as an abstraction of a femtocell system. The results also reveal that the computational efficiency of the analytical model is significantly better than simulation.}

However, the selection of technology and policy for providing better services to citizens and ensuring sustainable development is a multiple-objective decision process that is usually performed by experts in relevant domains. The major goal of this study is to propose a structural method for policy selection, which consists of three phases. In the first phase, the modified Delphi method is used to determine the elements of the decision by surveying panel members for their opinions. In the second phase, an analytic hierarchy process is used to ascertain the priority of each alternative according to the goal of the decision. In the third phase, zero-one goal programming models are developed to select a feasible portfolio based on the political goal and the annual budget. We conducted an empirical study to demonstrate and validate that the proposed model can induce the municipality to consider citizens’ requirements, identify the strengths and weaknesses of proposed policies, and select a feasible project portfolio in response to public expectations. In addition, the study found that a feasible portfolio, including consideration of citizens, business, and the environment, enables the public perceptions of government performance within the resource constraints of the organization.}

The emergent, all-hazard approach to smart cities and communities are marked by collaborative, multilevel governance increasingly coordinated under the rubric of Society 5.0 industrial policy. This policy is integrating with global Sustainable Development Goals and is further enhanced by the impending rollout of 5G networks. As a consequence, infrastructure is becoming intrastructure: lifeline systems that are simultaneously linked, monitored, and managed through smart communications. Japan’s transformation has been driven by learning from a diverse range of smart city projects. The transformation is also impelled by the increasing intensity of challenges facing Japan.

This is achieved through optimum management of its available and affordable resources. A smart city is defined as a city equipped with intelligent services and infrastructure that assure an improved quality of life with sustainable smart built environment solutions. Smart cities aim to attain a reliable, energy efficient, and high-quality power and thus smart grid becomes imperative. Energy management in smart cities would be one of the most demanding issues due to the complexity of the energy systems and their vital role. Significant attention and effort need to be focused directed and dedicated to efficiently solve this problem. Mathematical modeling and simulation are among the major tools commonly utilized to assess the technological and policy impacts of smart solutions, as well as to plan the best directions of shifting from current cities to smarter ones. Distributed energy systems, likely in the form of microgrids and combined heat and power—small, local energy system comprised of single or multiple entities that generate electric and thermal, energy and operate autonomously from or are integrated into the power grid. Energy and access to smart cities will become an even more integral part of modern living in cities. In other words, on top of addressing an unsustainable demand for energy, new energy systems must also be increasingly more reliable and resilient. Broad agreement among energy experts is that solar and wind remain to be the best candidates in terms of new major energy sources in smart cities, and should be considered as the backbone of future energy systems. Solar panels have made such substantial leaps since their inception a few years ago that prices have dropped drastically with the expansion of their utilization in the United States, Europe, and Middle East. However, the transition to hybrid solar-wind energy systems comes with its own set of challenges, limitations including current inefficiencies in present energy storage capabilities. This is quite apparent in the transportation sector, which exhibits the most trouble when anticipating its energy transition. Given the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy, it is also necessary to consider the present focus on traditional centralized power production and distribution, which if neither unchanged, nor developed will become harder to maintain. Evidently, hybrid wind and solar integration into our energy system implies significant investment in research, as well as improvement of equipment and deployment.}

In this scenario, OAuth 2.0 has been widely adopted as a de facto authentication and authorization protocol. However, the current OAuth 2.0 protocol specification does not consider the user privacy issue and presents several vulnerabilities that can jeopardize users' privacy rights. Therefore, in this paper we propose an OAuth 2.0 based protocol for Smart City mobile applications that addresses the user privacy issue by integrating a pseudonym-based signature scheme and a signature delegation scheme into the OAuth 2.0 protocol flow. The proposed solution allows users to self-generate user-specific and app-specific pseudonyms on-demand and ensure privacy-enhanced user authentication at the Service Provider side. The proposed protocol has been validated with Proverif and its performance has been evaluated in terms of time and space complexity. Results show that the proposed protocol can provide users with efficient and effective means to authenticate towards service providers while preventing user tracking and impersonation from malicious entities located in the network side or in the users' mobile device.}

abstract = {Followed by digital cities and smart cities, another advanced form of information city has emerged, namely smart cities. Such kind of city is integrated with informationization, industrialization and urbanization. Smart cities belong to the fusion of multiple information technologies such as the Internet of Things technology and cloud computing technology. Smart city is the use of various sensors and wireless networks, communication technologies to achieve information interaction. The use of cloud computing and big data effectively integrate information is to make comprehensive decisions on various data to achieve comprehensive coordination of city operation management and industrial development. In the wireless city infrastructure of smart cities, the deployment of network nodes directly affects the quality of network services. The problem can be attributed to the deployment of appropriate ordinary AP nodes as access nodes of wireless terminals on a given geometric plane. The deployment of special nodes as gateways will aggregate the traffic of ordinary nodes into the wired network Taking the wireless mesh network as an example, it is proposed to determine the deployment location and number of AP nodes based on the statistics of regional human traffic, and the gateway node deployment problem is seen as a geometric K-center problem. Taking the minimum path length between the node and the gateway as the optimization goal, an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the gateway node deployment position. In the APSO algorithm, improved strategies such as random adjustment of inertia weights, adaptive change of learning factors, and neighborhood search are introduced. A new calculation method of the fitness function is designed to make the algorithm easier to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation results show that, compared with GA algorithm and K-means algorithm, the improved particle swarm algorithm has a stable solution effect, strong robustness, and can obtain a smaller coverage radius, thereby improving the network service quality.}

abstract = {This prologue introduces the book by presenting an amalgamation of critical aspects to better understand the contemporary research and policy issues related to smart city citizenship. This prologue thus draws on the current data-driven debate stemming from the artificial intelligence (AI) disruption in the post-GDPR European realm by pointing out the importance of data ecosystems and digital rights for democracy in smart cities. This prologue aims to deconstruct the smart city citizenship through seven interrelated chapters and the final epilogue as follows: (Prologue) Deconstructing; (i) Unplugging; (ii) Deciphering; (iii) Democratising; (iv) Replicating; (v) Devolving; (vi) Commoning; (vii) Protecting; and (Epilogue) Resetting.}
