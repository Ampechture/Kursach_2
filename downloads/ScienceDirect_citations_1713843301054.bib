abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is the next step evolution of our today Internet, where any physical object/thing having/equipped with computation and communication capabilities could be seamlessly integrated, at different levels, to the Internet. The Smart Grid (SG), which is considered as one of the most critical Infrastructures, is defined as the classical power grid augmented with a large-scale ICT and renewable energy integration, can be seen as one of the largest IoT network. The SG will involve billions of smart objects/things: smart meters, smart appliances, sensors, actuators-cars, etc. in addition to several communication infrastructures whether public (most often) or private. However, security is seen as one of the major factors hampering the rapid and large scale adoption and deployment of both the IoT vision and the Smart Grid. In this paper we investigate the security issues and challenges on the IoT-based SG, and define the major security services that we should consider when dealing with SG security}

abstract = {This paper develops a machine learning aggregated integer linear programming approach for the full observability of the automated smart grids by positioning of micro-synchrophasor units, taking into account the reconfigurable structure of the distribution systems. The proposed stochastic approach presents a strategy occurring in several stages to micro-synchrophasor unit positioning based on the load level and demand in the system and based on the pre-determined sectionalizing and tie switches. Such a technique can also deploy the zero-injection limitations of the model and reduce the search space of the problem. Moreover, a novel method based on whale optimization method (WOM) is introduced to simultaneously enhance the reliability indices in order to specify the optimum topology for each phase and reduce the costs of power losses and customer interruptions. Although the problem of micro-synchrophasor placement is formulated in an integer linear programming framework, the restructuring technique is resolved on the basis of the WOM heuristic approach. Considering the uncertainty due to the metering devices or forecast errors, a stochastic framework based on point estimation is deployed to handle the uncertainty effects. The simulation and numerical results on a real system verify that the proposed method assures visibility of the distribution network pre and post reconfiguration in the time horizon of the planning. Furthermore, the results show that the system observability can be guaranteed at different load levels even though the system experiences different reconfiguration and topologies.}

Evaluation of development scenarios against a defined set of indicators and goals can help urban planners and other stakeholders understand the consequences of their strategies. This article presents a scenario calculator designed to link detailed measures with overall climate goals. This tool has been developed in interaction between researchers and potential user groups, through a series of interviews and workshops, in addition to testing of the tool in specific case studies. General feedback has been positive, but several barriers remain before community planners can employ such a tool in their working process and make it count in their decisionmaking processes: 1) community planners lack commitment to the overall environmental visions set by policymakers, and 2) community planners have no legal power to influence actual community development.}

abstract = {This paper presents an effective control approach for structural vibration of onshore wind turbines in the edgewise direction. Huge multi mega-watt wind turbines are currently developed to harvest large amounts of energy from the wind. Such designs require the construction of huge slender blades and towers which consequently lead to undesirable structural deformations that hinder the power production and reduce life span of the wind turbine. Many researchers have worked on structural control of wind turbines. However, these efforts neither have resulted in an effective reliable mitigation for deformation of structural elements, nor they have achieved an economical solution in terms of actuators exploitation. The work presented in this paper, however, introduces a particle swarm optimisation-based semi-active controller which exploits magnetorheological dampers to mitigate edgewise blade displacements. Dampers are modelled using neural networks for they are capable of predicting future forces and eliminating control lag. The developed controller is tested at several configurations of actuators placement on a benchmark 5-MW wind turbine. The proposed approach, indeed, showed a significant reduction of over 80% in the peak responses and about 77% of peak-to-peak response of blades against uncontrolled and passive systems which leads to promoting longevity of wind turbines.}

Two examples of popular technologies in some crucial IoT domains (e.g., smart home, smart factories and smart cities, among others) are IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11. However, IoT devices supporting different wireless technologies are not interoperable without a gateway. One solution to this problem is exploiting bidirectional Cross-Technology Communication with Wake-up Radio (WuR-CTC). Nevertheless, existing WuR-CTC approaches do not support IPv6, and therefore cannot offer full Internet protocol stack interoperability. For the first time to our knowledge, in this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of an adaptation layer to provide IPv6 support over WuR-CTC, by leveraging the IETF Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework. Among others, experimental results show that our solution allows transferring a 127-byte IPv6 packet from an IEEE 802.15.4 device to an IEEE 802.11 device, without a gateway, in 69 ms (in average). Therefore, the designed solution supports latency-stringent applications in smart environments, where a human in the loop expects real-time interaction between devices.}

To facilitate the subsequent waste disposal, we subdivide recyclable waste into plastic, glass, paper or cardboard, metal, fabric and the other recyclable waste, a total of six categories. Deep-learning convolution neural networks (CNN) were applied to realize the garbage classification task. Here, we investigate seven state-of-the-art CNNs and data pre-processing methods for waste classification, whose accuracies of nine categories range from 91.9 to 94.6% in the validation set. Among these networks, MobileNetV3 has a high classification accuracy (94.26%), a small storage size (49.5 MB) and the shortest running time (261.7 ms). Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices which implement information exchange between waste containers and waste management center are designed to monitor the overall amount of waste produced in this area and the operating state of any waste container via a set of sensors. According to monitoring information, the waste management center can schedule adaptive equipment deployment and maintenance, waste collection and vehicle routing plans, which serves as an essential part of a successful municipal waste management system.}

The encapsulation method is a quick and easy way to preserve their properties, facing many challenges in achieving stable oil-in-water emulsions. This review paper summarizes recent achievements in encapsulating drying oils, tackling their high viscosity by changing process parameters (stirring speed, homogenization/ultrasonic step, use of different emulsifiers, etc.). Besides, a critical overview of crucial points in corrosion protection of metals is presented and discussed. The difficulties drying oils encapsulation methods face and recent proofs-of-concept and future developments are explored.

Using Rothwell and Zegveld's innovation policy framework as a starting point, this paper compares innovation policy in smart grids across the Pacific; specifically, China and the USA. This research describes the policy tools used by both countries and presents results that indicate national preferences for innovation policy that differ in the ways in which they are linked with the state of the power system. China has preferred to use “supply-side policy,” which focuses on “public enterprise, scientific and technical development and legal regulation.” The USA has preferred to use “environmental-side policy,” which focuses on “scientific and technical development, financial, political and public enterprise.” This paper also describes in detail a number of innovation policies being pursued in the smart grid industry in both China and the USA.}

abstract = {One of the challenges of living in today's cities is parking availability. Searching for available parking spots can be a time-consuming task that simultaneously increases traffic congestion and greenhouse gas pollution by a significant 40%. A solution that would increase drivers' ability to locate an empty parking spot would represent an important step towards more sustainable parking as it would have a direct impact on reducing greenhouse gas pollution in urban areas. This paper proposes how data science can help by evaluating the prediction performance of four machine learning models. Analysed machine learning models are based on different machine learning methods (i.e., CatBoost and Random Forest) and use different real-world data sets (i.e., parking sensor data only or contextually enriched parking sensor data). The dummy (baseline) model is considered as well, but with a R2 score of 61.29% is outperformed by more advanced data science approaches. Prediction performance in the case of using parking sensor data only gives R2 score of 84.31% and 88.16% for Random Forest and CatBoost, respectively. The best prediction performance is achieved using CatBoost and contextually enriched data, resulting in the high-performing machine learning model with the R2 value of 88.83%, thus outperforming the Random Forest model by 1.7%. In fact, for both machine learning methods, the contextually enriched data approach gives better results for predicting parking spot availability. This suggests that parking data should be enriched with contextual data when designing and building sustainable parking solutions for smart cities of the future.}

Our proposal treats robustness from a multi-objective point of view. We model the parameters that define each instance as random variables, described through their mean and variance. In this way, we can obtain efficient solutions that are also less sensitive to changes in the environment. We run different types of algorithms in multiple instances to solve this problem so that we obtain a global view of the behavior of different techniques. All experimentation uses a scenario based on real data: The province of Malaga, Spain. This realistic settlement for our study allows us to test the applicability of our model in final systems for the citizens. The results clearly state the interest of our proposal for tackling robustness and represents a new state-of-the-art in smart mobility, an always appealing feature of works, that could lead to an industrial prototype.}

Owing to natural limitations, it is necessary to exploit the available energy sources in a manner, which requires careful planning. Furthermore, civic engagement is necessary for a democratic transition to a smart energy system. Therefore the transition has a social side and a technical side, which is analysed. The analysis applies the causal loop diagram of an urban model in order to explain the inner workings of the island community. The analysis illustrates many planning elements, such as political energy targets, sociotechnical priorities, energy vision, energy balance, energy action plan, and examples of demand-side management. The analysis shows that the current municipal plan is comprehensive, but not coherent. It will be necessary to consider trade-offs, that is, set a goal that would balance housing, jobs, agriculture, tourism, biomass and energy. An open question for further research is whether this insight from Samso can be scaled or replicated to other regions.}

For non-experts, it is much more difficult to make accurate predictions through machine learning. In this paper, we propose an autonomic machine learning platform which provides the decision factors to be made during the developing of machine learning applications. In the proposed autonomic machine learning platform, machine learning processes are automated based on the specification of autonomic levels. This autonomic machine learning platform can be used to derive a high-quality learning result by minimizing experts’ interventions and reducing the number of design selections that require expert knowledge and intuition. We also demonstrate that the proposed autonomic machine learning platform is suitable for smart cities which typically require considerable amounts of security sensitive information.}

abstract = {As cities across the globe continue to grow, traffic congestion has become globally ubiquitous with great economic and environmental costs associated with it. The increasing prevalence of self-driving vehicles creates an opportunity to build smart, responsive traffic infrastructure of the future. Such an infrastructure consisting of connected and autonomous vehicles and smart traffic lights would have the potential to cope with congestion, weather phenomena and accidents, while maintaining safety and ensuring privacy of information. This paper introduces an approach to address the challenge of dynamically adjusting traffic to the changes in the environment. We argue that multiagent meta-level control (MMLC) is an effective way to non-myopically determine how and when this adaptation should be done. The approach highlights the role of dynamic meta-reasoning in a platooning scenario, in which collaboration contributes to improved travel time for vehicles in the network as well as a positive environmental impact as related to fuel consumption and emissions. Specifically, for the case study described in the paper, our MMLC-based approach leads to approximately 44% decrease in travel time, 7% increase in average speed, a 32% decrease in fuel consumption and a 35% drop in emissions. We also see performance advantages for a scaled-up mixed traffic simulation environment.}

While automated lawn irrigation systems established in urban areas are critical factors affecting water quantity and quality, homeowners’ water use may vary with their preferences for lawn irrigation systems. The choice of an irrigation system is not determined only by local restrictions or policies but also by homeowners’ preferences. Further, individuals’ preferences can be influenced by the availability of product-specific attributes such as evapotranspiration or soil-moisture based controllers (known as smart irrigation controllers). With a focus on single-family home residents in California, Florida, and Texas, the present study uses the discrete choice analysis framework to link smart irrigation attributes (e.g., sensor types, wireless operation, remote control, alert notification) and monetary incentives (e.g., annual water bill savings, rebates) to preferences and willingness-to-pay. Results indicate that homeowners prefer smart irrigation controllers to conventional automated systems, and that savings on annual water bills could be one of the most important features determining adoption of smart irrigation controllers. Controller features such as the type of operation (i.e., wireless/on-site weather station) and system malfunction alert/notification also impacted homeowners’ preferences. The findings provide practical insights into the promotion of smart irrigation controllers that can be integrated with educational campaigns, or advertisements highlighting benefits of smart irrigation technologies. Clearer understanding about homeowners’ preferences could serve as a feedback loop for policy makers and improve water policies at state and local levels.}

However, the development of these systems requires regulations that take into account the technological capabilities and the needs of users both in the present and in the immediate future. This paper starts with a review of the energy policies aimed at the implementation of smart metering infrastructures (SMI) in Spain, Europe, and around the world. It then addresses the trends in the energy sector that will shape the future and the contribution that SMI are likely to make given its current status, its potential, its limitations, and the implications they would have.

abstract = {One of the main problems for adopting smart thermostats is consumers’ expectations about smart thermostats. Generally, the interfaces in smart thermostats and smart devices in the energy market are designed without consideration for the expectations of the customers or are not adjusting their operation according to the consumers’ expectations and behavior. Moreover, the business model does not consider one part of the product as the main link between customers and value propositions. This study shows a structure for creating a smart interface based on consumers’ expectations and shows an extension of the CANVAS business model. Furthermore, the paper re-defines the term “smart” in electric devices as the ability to adjust the system in order to reach the expectations of the consumer and to save energy. This term is not only defined in terms of saving energy but also it includes the customer’s expectations. If the system is only smart to control the temperature and save energy, the customer’s expectations may not always be achieved; thus, the smart devices are not successfully adopted in households. The design is based on artificial neural networks and a fuzzy logic controller to achieve the consumer’s expectations. The results show the interface operation on each block. The classification systems have to operate to detect changes in the customer’s market segment. The fuzzy logic controller tries to reach the customer’s expectations in order to move the customer into the energy saving market. This expectation interface tries to motivate designers to focus on consumer’s expectations for smart devices in the energy market. Not only are the energy requirements important to design a smart thermostat, but also the consumer’s expectations to create a successful smart thermostat in the electric market. Smart thermostats can reduce the consumption of electrical energy, but they need to be accepted. This interface provides an effective manner to connect the consumer’s expectations with the consumption of energy. This papers shows a proof of concept about intelligent interfaces.}

System non-synchronous generation replaces conventional generators as penetration of renewable generation increases. This affects system rotational inertia and limits the number of online thermal generators that can provide frequency stability services and system-wide areas voltage stability. This evolution has resulted in some changes to existing grid codes and new ancillary services. Furthermore, it could provide opportunities to address the security of the system utilizing modern smart technologies, e.g. smart loads, heat pumps and electric vehicles. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of large-scale renewable power generation on power system dynamics from the perspective of the power system operator. It focuses on the grid codes implications and challenges specifically. Synthetic inertia response opportunities from smart loads, electric vehicles and energy storage technologies and dispatching wind farms during frequency excursions are analyzed and thoroughly discussed. The key finding is that rethinking in the development of grid code requirements and market mechanisms are needed if a power system based on 100% power electronic renewable generation is to be achieved. This type of power system would need a range of technologies to provide the types of ancillary (i.e. system) services required, as none of the technologies alone can tackle all the challenges presented.}

The use of Smart Cards (SCs) to protect these systems is pertinent, as they are resistant to physical attacks, portable, and have low cost. Nonetheless, SC processing and memory capacity are not sufficient to meet IoT demands. Therefore, the use of multiple clustered SCs seems interesting. The Field Programmable Gate Array can manage multiple SCs since it has the ability to parallelize tasks. In this work, Smart Card Cluster (SCC) is applied to ensure message authenticity and integrity through hardware signing. For instance, with only three SCs, a SCC supports signing about 26 messages per minute. In this paper, we propose a SCC that is modular, portable, flexible and cost-effective. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our SCC outperforms existing solutions by as much as 69%, while the cost is lower.}

Several optimal combinations of energy resource components and storage which have significant potentials within the university campus were modeled on HOMER software in grid-connected mode. The daily energy consumption data of Covenant University were measured using EDMI Mk10E digital energy meter for a whole year. Data for analyzing renewable energy potentials for several years were sourced from the NASA database through the HOMER platform. Significantly, due to the fluctuating price of diesel fuel in Nigeria, sensitivity analysis was carried out for each combination using diesel fuel prices ranging from 0.3 $/litre to 1 $/litre. The results of each projected combination which gave 32 simulation scenarios, were analyzed comparatively using eight important system performance indices which cover economic, technical, and environmental impact assessment with and without battery energy systems. The results of the comparative analysis showed that the PV-Diesel-Grid-BESS HRES is the best configuration for meeting the Covenant university load demands in terms of credible reduction in the net present cost and cost of electricity. However, deployment of the wind energy system is economically infeasible at the study site, while the diesel generator should be strictly a backup.}

The knowledge graph grows via automated link predictions using genetic programming that are validated by humans for improving transparency and calibrating accuracy. The knowledge graph builder is designed for pervasive devices such as smartphones and preserves privacy by localizing all computations. The accuracy, practicality, and usability of the knowledge graph builder is evaluated in a real-world social experiment that involves a smartphone implementation and a Smart City application scenario. The proposed methodology of knowledge graph building outperforms a baseline method in terms of accuracy while demonstrating its efficient calculations on smartphones and the feasibility of the pervasive human supervision process in terms of high interactions throughput. These findings promise new opportunities to crowdsource and operate pervasive reasoning systems for cyber–physical social systems in Smart Cities.}

However, there is a lack of appropriate online systems that can handle anomaly detection for large-scale smart meter data effectively and efficiently. This paper proposes a lambda system for detecting anomalous consumption patterns, aiming at assisting decision makings for smart energy management. The proposed system uses a prediction-based detection method, combined with a novel lambda architecture for iterative model updates and real-time anomaly detection.

abstract = {The accelerating energy demand, growing concern regarding global warming and climate change has paved the path of electrification of the transport sector. Large scale adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) call for availability of sustainable and easily accessible charging infrastructure. The sporadic energy demand, different battery storage capacity and diverse penetrating patterns of electric vehicles have significantly raised the load elasticity on a power grid. Smart-grid environment promises to assist the addition of EVs into national grids by enabling both EV-charging and discharging (G2V and V2G) load. This will modify the load profile and reduce cost.This paper discusses comprehensively three basic infrastructures by which charging of EVs can be done. These infrastructures are studied and compared on the basis of some parameters. It has been found that distributed infrastructure shows best results for the charging of electric vehicles. The other two infrastructures prove costlier and increase power demand. Also, this paper examines three specific smart charging strategies and the impact of each strategy on the power system load profile and realization cost. Simulation results establish the superiority of smart charging over dumb charging.}

Physical safety designs such as employing circuit-breakers and fuses to batteries are limited by small operating voltage windows and no resumption of original working condition when it is cooled down. Here we report a smart thermoresponsive polymer electrolyte that can be incorporated inside batteries to prevent thermal runaway via a fast and reversible sol-gel transition, and successfully combine this smart electrolyte with a rechargeable Zn/α-MnO2 battery system. At high temperature, battery operation is inhibited as a result of the increased internal resistance caused by the gelation of liquid electrolyte. After cooling down, the electrolyte is spontaneously reversed to sol state and the electrochemical performance of the battery is restored. More importantly, sol-gel transition enables the smart battery to experience different charge-discharge rates under various temperature levels, providing a smart and active strategy to achieve dynamic and reversible self-protection.}

Smart ridesharing system (SRS) is a ridesharing system integrated with information and communication technology. We formulate a passenger matching problem by considering user preference in SRS. This study aims to investigate day-to-day dynamics and characteristics of passenger matching problem in SRS. A modified stable roommates problem is adopted to represent this matching problem. The characteristics of day-to-day dynamics (e.g., existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibria) of SRS are understood and revealed by a simulation of formulated model. Through the simulations, the existence of multiple day-to-day equilibria is investigated under some conditions. One of the existing equilibria is an undesirable equilibrium where SRS is not feasible to be operated as no one rideshares, while the existence of a desirable stable equilibrium, where SRS is feasible to be operated, is realized under some conditions.}

Given the cultural diversity within these groups, proposing the use of eye-trackers (ET) as an alternative to traditional public consultation prompts the need to assess the method's advantages and disadvantages. It remains uncertain whether individuals from different countries look at historical architecture and its transformations similarly. The uniqueness of this subject matter prevents drawing parallels from experiences in other domains. Moreover, prior research provides conflicting conclusions and may include methodological errors. This uncertainty impedes the adoption of ET as an administrative and legal tool. To address this gap, 320 volunteers, encompassing both Poles and foreigners, were invited. Qualification involved optometric tests and questionnaires. Subsequently, a portion of the participants underwent the experiment using ET while viewing visual stimuli on a monitor. The experiment featured twelve monuments, with six originating from Wrocław and six from another major European city (Paris, Rome, London, Berlin, Dresden, Dortmund). The study focused on the nature and pattern of fixations made on original photographs and their modified versions. Analyzing the collected ET data for 24 stimuli, two primary aspects were explored. First, whether both groups, irrespective of their familiarity with the object or the city of residence, looked at the original photographs in the same manner. Second, it was investigated whether participants cultural background significantly influenced observers' reactions to visual changes in the buildings. Only 8 out of 160 comparisons demonstrated statistically significant deviations. Other results, including visitor numbers, fixation counts, average fixation duration, total visit duration, and time to first fixation, exhibited similarity across the board.}

abstract = {One of the more challenging issues in Smart Grid (SG) communications is in handling the ever-increasing number of new SG applications that are being provisioned by the utility companies. These applications are resulting in an exponential increase in the amount of data that utility companies are collecting. Appropriate communication infrastructure and its management is vital for providing this data to unlock the full potential of the SG. Typically, these applications generate different types of data traffic that can be divided into multiple traffic classes with different QoS parameters (priority, throughput, latency etc.). Traditionally, these classes are handled with static network configuration based on individual application policies. However, due to increasing network dynamism, the problem arises as to how to adjust these configurations, based on changing traffic situations. In this paper, a software defined networking (SDN) based solution for distributed and dynamic Smart Grid network management is presented. Proposed solution responsiveness to complex dynamicity of Smart Grid communications is evaluated on a developed evaluation platform for the following cases: (1) Automatic Generation Control (AGC) during peak load, (2) Volt/Var optimization (VVO) during peak load, (3) steady-state operation with static (background) traffic load, (4) stress-state under continuous background traffic overload and (5) dynamic prioritization of traffic for data disaggregation. The presented solution provides significant benefits, when compared with traditional networking in tested scenarios, including: over 70 times lower latency for the most time-sensitive traffic (AGC), 25% increased VVO system observability and 5% to 7% decrease in unprivileged traffic bandwidth consumption whenever privileged traffic QoS is threatened. Additionally, it is shown that dynamic prioritization can provide requested QoS on demand as long as overall capacity is larger than the privileged traffic offered load.}

This fusion results in generating huge volumes of data that might not be manageable using today's storage and data analytics technologies. Although cloud computing offers services to tackle this issue at infrastructural level, its efficiency for time sensitive applications (e.g. oil, gas, and traffic monitoring) is still questionable. Arguably, transferring massive amount of data to the cloud for storage and processing may lead to cloud overloading and saturation of network bandwidth. In this study, an integrated fog and cloud computing framework is introduced to overcome the limitations of real-time analytics, latency and network congestion of basic cloud services for traffic monitoring. The proposed approach is implemented to prototype a smart traffic monitoring system (STMS). The proposed monitoring system is designed for congestion monitoring and traffic light management. It can also be tuned to detect traffic incidents that requires immediate assistance during congestion. In this framework, a tiny computer-on-module serves as a fog node to collect real-time data from geographically distributed sensors and to transfer it to the cloud for storage and processing. The results show the efficiency of the fog network in improving the performance of the cloud platform in terms of reducing the response time and increasing the bandwidth. Furthermore, the proposed integrated fog and cloud framework is interfaced with Tweeter to send alerts about traffic congestion to be subscribed users in the form of Tweet messages .}

This paper is devoted to surveying the research work conducted on the integration of SDN to SB. Consequently, it provides a comprehensive review on SDN enabled SB, its architecture, taxonomy, communication protocols, and challenges for an immersive and interactive experience. It also presents a basic architecture of SDN over traditional networking. Moreover, SDN applications are also exploited to handle the issues of the wireless network.

This work proposes a probabilistic topic model, adapted from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to discover representative and interpretable activity categorization from individual-level spatiotemporal data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, the activity-travel episodes of an individual user are treated as words in a document, and each topic is a distribution over space and time that corresponds to certain type of activity. The model accounts for a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes—the location, start time of day, start day of week, and duration of each activity episode. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using pseudonymized transit smart card data from London, U.K. The results show that the model can successfully distinguish the three most basic types of activities—home, work, and other. As the specified number of activity categories increases, more specific subpatterns for home and work emerge, and both the goodness of fit and predictive performance for travel behavior improve. This work makes it possible to enrich human mobility data with representative and interpretable activity patterns without relying on predefined activity categories or heuristic rules.}

Poor quality of transport services leads to road accidents and many other problems that endanger human life and cause air and sound pollution. Traffic congestion is the most prevalent factor in developing countries like India. It wastes time and also causes health hazards, air and noise pollution, and fuel waste. The key is to manage road capacity using the supply-demand equation, appropriate utilization of traffic control strategies, and creation of intelligent and smart transportation systems. An artificial intelligence-based traffic system uses sensor data, communications, and automated algorithms to ensure the smooth flow of traffic in cities. The objective is to control traffic congestion in an optimal manner and optimize the duration of green and red lights at intersections. Rather than using a fixed timer for green and red signals, timing should depend on vehicle density. If traffic is heavy in one direction, the green signal should be on for a longer duration. This should eliminate inefficiencies at intersections and reduce the costs of commuting and pollution. In this chapter, a detailed review of different techniques for designing traffic light management is given; also an intelligent and adaptive traffic light management system is proposed that uses artificial intelligence-based methods for optimizing the synchronization of green signals. Emergency vehicles such as ambulances, firetrucks, and police vans are also considered, to reduce wait times and receive high priority when arriving at an intersection.}

The proposed multi-camera system is capable of automatically estimating the number of cars present in the entire parking lot directly on board the edge devices. It comprises an on-device deep learning-based detector that locates and counts the vehicles from the captured images and a decentralized geometric-based approach that can analyze the inter-camera shared areas and merge the data acquired by all the devices. We conducted the experimental evaluation on an extended version of the CNRPark-EXT dataset, a collection of images taken from the parking lot on the campus of the National Research Council (CNR) in Pisa, Italy.

A smart city is a city in which information and communications technology are merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. The increasing amount of waste generated, and the collection and treatment of waste poses a major challenge to modern urban planning in general, and to smart cities in particular. To cope with this problem, automated vacuum waste collection (AVWC) uses air suction on a closed network of underground pipes to transport waste from the drop off points scattered throughout the city to a central collection point, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the inconveniences of conventional methods (odours, noise, etc.). Since a significant part of the cost of operating AVWC systems is energy consumption, we have developed a model with the aim of applying constraint programming technology to schedule the daily emptying sequences of the drop off points in such a way that energy consumption is minimized. In this paper we describe how the problem of deciding the drop off points that should be emptied at a given time can be modeled as a constraint integer programming (CIP) problem. Moreover, we report on experiments using real data from AVWC systems installed in different cities that provide empirical evidence that CIP offers a suitable technology for reducing energy consumption in AVWC.}

abstract = {In the context of the current ecologicalization of social policies, the National Marine Ecological Civilization Construction Demonstration Zone led by the Chinese government is not only a carrier of marine ecological civilization construction, but also a test field for building a maritime power and promoting the sustainable development of the marine economy and society. This paper considers the establishment of the demonstration zones as a "quasi-natural experiment". Utilizing panel data from 53 prefecture-level and above cities in China from 2006 to 2020, a time‑varying difference‑in‑difference model is applied to examine whether this ecological policy can promote the elevation of green development levels of the marine economy, aiming to achieve a harmonious balance between "clear waters and green mountains" and "mountains of gold and silver". The results indicate that the establishment of the demonstration zones significantly enhances the level of green development of the marine economy. Technological innovation and industrial structure are identified as two crucial mechanisms influencing green development of the marine economy, both exhibiting positive mediating effects. The impact of the establishment of the demonstration zones on the promotion of green development of the marine economy is more pronounced in the East China coastal region and the Central-south coastal region compared to the North China and Northeast coastal regions. Additionally, this policy effectively stimulates green development of the marine economy in medium and small cities and non-resource-based cities. Finally, corresponding policy recommendations are proposed from the perspectives of differentiated strategies, industrial structure adjustments, and technological innovation mechanisms.}

To the best knowledge of the authors, there is little or no comprehensive dataset that describes cycling patterns in Johannesburg. Perhaps this dataset is a tool that will support evidence based transportation planning and smart mobility.}

The adoption of Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and an increasingly wide range of sensing and actuation capabilities has led to smart homes that are more practical, but also genuinely attractive targets for cyber attacks. Here, we classify applicable cyber threats according to a novel taxonomy, focusing not only on the attack vectors that can be used, but also the potential impact on the systems and ultimately on the occupants and their domestic life. Utilising the taxonomy, we classify twenty five different smart home attacks, providing further examples of legitimate, yet vulnerable smart home configurations which can lead to second-order attack vectors. We then review existing smart home defence mechanisms and discuss open research problems.}

On the other, there are non-fare policies, for instance if holders receive advantages, such as rebates and offers, from commercial partners. The purpose of this paper is to present a geodemographic framework to identify potential commercial partnerships that could exploit the characteristics of smart cards. The framework is demonstrated using data from Montreal, Canada. Household survey data, specifically trip ends, and business data points are jointly used to determine the exposure of various types of establishments to users of the Montreal Metro network. Spatial analysis of business establishments in the neighborhood of metro stations helps to identify potential commercial partners.

They are, however, among the most sensitive fruits when it comes to the quality of the end product. The recent commercial trends show a rising number of farmers who directly sell their products in the market and are more interested in using smart solutions for a continuous control of the factors that affect the quality of the final product. Cloud-based approaches for smart irrigation have been widely used in the recent years. However, the network traffic, security and regulatory challenges, which come hand in hand with sharing the crop data with third parties outside the edge of the network, lead strawberry farmers and data owners to rely on global clouds and potentially lose control over their data, which are usually transferred to third party data centers. In this paper, we follow a three-step methodological approach in order to design, implement and validate a solution for smart strawberry irrigation in greenhouses, while keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network: (i) We develop a small-scale smart irrigation prototype solution with off-the-shelf hardware and software equipment, which we test and evaluate on different kinds of plants in order to gain useful insights for larger scale deployments, (ii) we introduce a reference network architecture, specifically targeting smart irrigation and edge data distribution for strawberry greenhouses, and (iii) adopting the proposed reference architecture, we implement a full-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment in Greece, and we compare its performance against that of conventional strawberries irrigation. We show that our design significantly outperforms the conventional approach, both in terms of soil moisture variation and in terms of water consumption, and conclude by critically appraising the costs and benefits of our approach in the agricultural industry.}

The real time data produced by smart meters provide the detailed information about the electricity usage of a particular consumer. In this paper, we propose a motif-based association rule mining and clustering technique for determining the energy usage patterns for smart meter data. The association rules of motifs within a specific time window characterizes behaviors of energy consumer. In particular, we focus on an extraction of the temporal information of the smart meter. The process is based on the unique combination of Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX), temporal motif discovery and association rule mining to detect the expected and unexpected patterns robustly. Experiments on real world smart meter datasets justify that the proposed model discovers the useful routine behavior of electricity energy consumers, which are helpful for electricity utility experts. Further, in this paper, clustering on the motifs is performed which gives the different consumption behavior of consumers on different days which can help distribution network operator (DNO) for electricity network modeling and management. In future, we can form motif-based signature using the proposed approach for different applications such as anomaly detection and dynamic detection of operating patterns.}

However, providing quality of service (QoS) requirements of smart grid applications with WSNs is difficult because of the power constraints of sensor nodes and harsh smart grid channel conditions, such as RF interference, noise, multi-path fading and node contentions. To address these communication challenges, in this paper link-quality-aware routing algorithm (LQ-CMST) as well as the priority and channel-aware multi-channel (PCA-MC) scheduling algorithm have been proposed for smart grid applications. Furthermore, the effect of different modulation and encoding schemes on the performance of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated under harsh smart grid channel conditions. Comparative performance evaluations through extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce communication delay and the choice of encoding and modulation schemes is critical to meet the requirements of envisioned smart grid applications.}

In this study, a state-of-the-art review has been conducted, in respect to interactive energy sharing networks with electrochemical battery storages, from perspectives of battery degradation modelling development, smart energy management, single- and multi-objective optimisations, and energy flexibility enhancement. Advanced techniques are proposed for the multi-criteria performance enhancement of interactive energy sharing networks, including shared renewable energy within district communities, mobility-based spatiotemporal energy sharing, and multi-directional energy interaction modes. An in-depth and dialectical analysis has been provided to predict dynamic depreciation (calendar and cycling ageing) and lifetime on electrochemical battery storages, including semi-empirical and data-driven models. Heuristic smart control strategies are thereafter formulated, such as renewable-to-demand, grid-responsive and battery-protective control strategies. Afterwards, a comprehensive review is conducted on multi-objective optimisations from different stakeholders (such as prosumers, building owners, utility grid company, and policy-makers), together with strategies for multi-criteria decision making to help identify the ‘best of the best’ solution along the Pareto optimal front. The formulated multi-directional energy sharing systems, machine learning based data-driven model on battery degradation estimation, and smart energy management framework can promote renewable and sustainable energy networks in smart cities.}

Particular attention is here paid to the factor of choice of source of information assisting with the running of a farm. Analyses relating to this matter are founded upon questionnaires supplied by almost 2500 farmers. The results show that the Internet does not constitute the most important information source for Polish farmers, though there is a close link between use of the Internet and their basic social characteristics, as also associated with structural features of Polish agriculture. On that basis, it can be considered that Polish farming still finds itself at the preliminary phase of entry into smart agriculture.

abstract = {As an extension of the ‘energy trilemma’ of affordability/sustainability/security to also include social acceptance, the ‘energy quadrilemma’, is driving multiple and complex developments in energy systems, particularly at the level of distributed energy resources. These, and in particular demand side resources, may have an important role in providing the flexibility required for electricity systems to integrate low carbon technologies, while also increasing the efficiency of the energy system as a whole. This is particularly relevant to resources that are aggregated in districts, for instance through community energy systems, that also adopt various enabling ‘smart’ technologies, thus becoming ‘smart districts’ and supporting the transition towards a smart grid. Recognising that the smart district is a relatively new and ill-defined concept, this paper identifies and answers ten questions covering relevant physical, commercial, planning and operational aspects of smart districts. In particular, amongst others, we propose a new viewpoint on ‘energy efficiency’ that is more aligned with the key role of flexibility in future energy systems; criticise the concepts of ‘self-sufficient’, ‘net-zero energy’ and ‘energy-positive’ buildings and districts; discuss how price-driven optimization through ‘transactive energy’ approaches can deliver whole-system efficiency and flexibility beyond the smart district itself; argue the importance of considering multiple energy vectors in a multi-energy context; and finally specify four requirements for districts to become smart districts.}

The first study monitored household water use in four households over a continuous 24-month period in Ireland. Meters were installed to monitor public mains water supply, toilet flushing, hot water, cold water supply to taps and water supply to kitchen. Daily water use profiles were generated. Per capita consumption rates varied from 71 L/hd/day to 132 L/hd/day. This compares to a national average in Ireland of 129 L/hd.d. These variations reflect the diversity between homes in terms of the way occupants utilise water for different practices (personal hygiene, laundry, kitchen, WC use). Averaging the results across all study households, for every 100 L of potable mains water supplied to the household, 28 L was flushed down the toilet, 22 L was used in the hot water system, 17 L was supplied to cold water taps for personal hygiene uses and 33 L was used in the kitchen. This study compares with results from an EU study compiled by the authors where over 75% of household water use across selected EU countries was also used for bathing and showering, WC flushing and laundry. Trends show that household water use has reduced across all selected countries in recent years. The influence of water meters in achieving this reduction is evident in the EU data. This effect is particularly evident from England and Wales, where water use in unmetered households is estimated to be 30% higher than metered households. The data shows that universal metering, increased water charges and a national focus on water efficiency and demand management programs can achieve significant reductions in household water consumption. The authors propose a Circular Economy of Water hierarchy focused on Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover. A twelve step approach is suggested to facilitate this transition to a water smart society.}

The findings are as follows. First, the Smart Grid project effectively causes a reduction in electricity use. Second, households which have the following characteristics tend to use more electricity: male householder, many family members, income. Third, households which have better understanding about the Smart Grid use less electricity. Based on these findings, we can derive the following policy implications. First, it is necessary to set up a policy which accelerates active participation of both consumers and producers of related equipment in order to promote the Smart Grid. Second, a reform of the electricity pricing system is needed to enhance the effectiveness of the Smart Grid project. Third, publicity activities of the Smart Grid project should be strengthened for wider recognition.}

Wastewater samples were gathered from 13 sewer manholes specific to each sewershed catchment, prior to convergence or mixing with other sewer lines, resulting in samples specific to individual catchments with defined areas. The 13 sewershed catchments selected comprise 118,832 connections to the network throughout the city, representing 84.7 % (534,747 individuals) of the total population. The number of COVID19-related exposure and symptoms cases in each area were registered using an application developed for smartphones by the provincial government. Geographical coordinates provided by the devices were recorded, and consequently, it was possible to geolocalise all app-cases and track them down to which of the 13 sampling catchments belonged. RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in every site since the beginning of the monitoring, anticipating viral circulation in the population. Over the course of the 21-week study, the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 ranged between 1.77 × 104 and 4.35 × 107 genome copies/L. There was a correspondence with the highest viral load in wastewater and the peak number of cases reported by the app for each catchment. The associations were evaluated with correlation analysis. The viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater were a feasible means to describe the trends of COVID-19 infections. Surveillance at sewershed scale, provided reliable and strategic information that could be used by local health stakeholders to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.}

This project aims to develop a flood prediction system using a combination of Machine Learning classifiers along with GIS techniques to be used as an effective tool for urban management and resilience planning. This approach can establish sensible factors and risk indices for the occurrence of floods at the city level, which could be instrumental for outlining a long-term strategy for Smart Cities. The most performant Machine Learning model was a Random Forest, with a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.77 and an Accuracy of 0.96. To support and extend the capabilities of the Machine Learning model, a GIS model was developed to find areas with higher likelihood of being flooded under critical weather conditions. Therefore, hot spots were defined for the entire city given the observed flood history. The scores obtained from the Random Forest model and the Hot Spot analysis were then combined to create a flood risk index.}

It is getting difficult day by day to lead a healthy, sustainable living in urban areas because of environmental contamination. Due to the lack of proper waste management approach, problems like an overflow of waste occurs that badly harm our environment. Polluted surroundings result in the spread of various kinds of diseases in an epidemic form. For developed and developing countries, waste management is a challenge to long-term development. Proper management of waste is getting tougher because of increasing population, urbanization, and industrialization. In this modern era of technology, we need to apply technology-based solutions to handle large amounts of waste for overpopulated urban areas. We have reviewed several recent research articles related to the smart waste management system, and almost all of them have some major limitations as well as progress. To ensure environmental hygiene and sustainable urban life, we have presented a smart IoT based integrated system consists of an identification system, an automated lid system, a display system, and a communication system. Arduino Uno is used as a microcontroller to synchronize all of the four systems. Sensors are used for identification and measuring the garbage level. The system provides the facility of continuous monitoring of the status of waste inside the garbage bin and shows the percentage filled up on liquid crystal display (LCD). The communication system uses a global system for mobile communications (GSM) module that will inform the corresponding authority to collect the waste when the garbage bin is filled up. The proposed waste management system is much more efficient than any other conventional waste management system as it reduces the use of manpower, avoids spillover of waste, saves time, more economical, and most importantly it is a completely automated system.}

Referring to the triangle theory of safe resilience, and National Standard of China “Guide for safe resilient city evaluation” (GB/T 40947-2021), an evaluation index system for safe resilient cities is established. The following conclusions are drawn: The three factors of human-environment-infrastructure must be considered as a whole in the construction of resilient cities; Small cities should pay more attention to the development of people-oriented “soft resilience”; Urban infrastructure resilience is more important for megacities than for small cities; It is the optimal strategy to construct the safe resilient cities by strengthening urban emergency management system in a holistic manner, whether for megacities or small cities.}

The proposed model has three dimensions: (i) content, (ii) function and (iii) methodology and is realized through a specific structure (Lab-in-Lab). Based on this concept model, the Smart Production Lab (Smart Lab) has been designed and implemented by the Institute of Industrial Management at FH JOANNEUM University of applied sciences, Austria. Essentially the Smart Lab is about the digital transformation of connecting businesses – horizontally along the entire value chain and vertically with focus on data generation, integration, and usage. The development of use cases in the two maturity levels – state-of-the-art and research – allows the transfer of knowledge of digital transformation processes for companies as well as active learning scenarios for the qualification of future industrial engineers. As an innovative experimental environment, the Smart Lab addresses companies, researchers, students, and – with the integrated fabrication laboratory (FabLab) – the interested public in general.}

Aggregator awareness in the electric power industry is fast growing in tandem with the growing number of EVs. This paper proposes a novel smart techno-economic operation of the electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) in Egypt controlled by the aggregator based on a hierarchal model. The deterministic charging scheduling of the EVs is the upper stage of the model to balance the generated and consumed power of the station and flat the surplus power supplied to the utility grid. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is used to solve the first stage where the peak demand value is reduced to 48.17% (4.5 kW) without using any extra battery storage systems. The second challenging stage is to maximize the charging station profit whilst minimizing the EV charging tariff, which needs a trade-off. In this stage, MILP and Markov Decision Process Reinforcement Learning (MDP-RL) resulted an increase in EVCS revenue by 28.88% and 20.10%, respectively. However, the EVs charging tariff is increased by 21.19%, and 15.03%, respectively. Hence, MDP-RL is an adequate algorithm for such a complex model. The outcomes reveal a sufficient techno-economic hierarchal model concerning the normal operation stated in the literature.}

The convergence of building information modeling with the smart water field provides an opportunity to transcend existing operational barriers. Such research would pave the way for demand-side management, active consumers, and demand-optimized networks, through interoperability and a system of systems approach. This paper presents a semantic knowledge management service and domain ontology which support a novel cloud-edge solution, by unifying domestic socio-technical water systems with clean and waste networks at an urban scale, to deliver value-added services for consumers and network operators. The web service integrates state of the art sensing, data analytics and middleware components. We propose an ontology for the domain which describes smart homes, smart metering, telemetry, and geographic information systems, alongside social concepts. This integrates previously isolated systems as well as supply and demand-side interventions, to improve system performance. A use case of demand-optimized management is introduced, and smart home application interoperability is demonstrated, before the performance of the semantic web service is presented and compared to alternatives. Our findings suggest that semantic web technologies and IoT can merge to bring together large data models with dynamic data streams, to support powerful applications in the operational phase of built environment systems.}

This paper measures the digital development level and energy-saving and emission reduction performance (EEP) of 271 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2019 and empirically explores the impact of digitalization on EEP. The empirical results are: (1) digitalization can significantly improve EEP in Chinese cities, and become a new driving force to save energy and reduce emissions in the new era. After solving the endogeneity problems and replacing the explained variables, the conclusion remains robust. (2) The relationship between digitalization and EEP has significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Digitalization helps to promote EEP in China’s eastern cities, but it has not shown a positive effect in western cities. The positive effect of digitalization began to emerge after 2011. (3) There is a synergy between digitalization and industrialization, which enables cities to save energy and reduce emissions. This study helps clarify the relationship between digitalization and EEP, which provides important insights into how digitalization can empower cities’ energy-saving and emission reduction.}

Thus we focused on human factors for a smart cart system affecting work performance and convenience. This experiment surveyed and was conducted using 31 participants. First, we surveyed on which location of touch screen (i.e. 250mm and 450mm from cart handle) was more comfortable in relation to human body parts. Secondly, we asked participants which angle of handle (i.e. vertical, 45° tilted and horizontal) was most comfortable, again in relation to body parts. Lastly, participants were asked which picking method among pick-by-cover and pick-to-light was more convenient during experiment. The results revealed that 80.6% of participants preferred a distance of 250mm from the cart handle and 41.9% of them preferred a 45° tilted handle. Also, 71% of participants felt comfortable with the pick-to-light system and that it was more efficient and comfortable taking into consideration performance time as well as quality.

Although some techniques are available for the indoor localization of elderly persons, in the coming years, outdoor localization will be an essential part of society. Different approaches such as GPS, range-based, and range-free have been developed for outdoor localization. However, the localization accuracy and precision is still a significant challenge. For accurate and low-cost localization, we propose a novel IoT-based range-based localization for smart city applications. Using the extreme learning machine (ELM), fuzzy system, and modified swarm intelligence, a hybrid optimized fuzzy threshold ELM (HOFTELM) algorithm is developed. The particle swarm grey wolf optimization is used to identify the direction of the moving sensor node. A fuzzy weighted centroid is used to optimize the consequences of irregular movement of the nodes. Lastly, an optimized threshold extreme learning machine and weighted mean are applied to localize the moving nodes accurately. Our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of average location error ratio (ALER), the number of localized nodes, and the computational time. The results show that ALER reduces by at least 48.07% in comparison with the other algorithms. The proposed algorithm also localizes at least 7.25% additional nodes and has a computationally efficient operation.}

Currently, despite progress in information sharing, not every stakeholder has enough knowledge or enthusiasm about information sharing. Therefore, a reasonable collaboration-driven mode focused on information sharing can support the sustainable development of smart industrial parks. Based on the results of the specific cooperation needs of Chinese smart industrial parks, which were studied by Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats analysis (SWOT), a collaboration-driven mode is proposed in this study. It consists of four parts, i.e., cooperation promoters, contents of information sharing, diffusing professional knowledge, and incentive strategies of information sharing, and is supported by two layers, i.e., decision layers and implementation layers. Promoters were determined by Social Network Analysis (SNA) and include park management committees, enterprises, research institutions, and local governments. Based on the SNA, contents of information sharing and diffusing professional knowledge paths have been designed. Incentive strategies of information sharing were explored by Rough Set. The collaboration-driven mode was verified using an empirical case-study, which showed that the collaboration-driven mode is feasible.

abstract = {Carbon peaking is a research hotspot in China, aiming to reduce the impact of human activities on global climate change, promote the transformation of Low-carbon economy and realize high-quality development. The article takes Wuxi City in China's Jiangsu Province as a pilot low-carbon city to study its carbon emissions characters, then introduces the KAYA model, and sets different scenarios for the influencing factors, further predicts carbon emissions peak in 2019∼2030, and finally proposes the corresponding carbon reduction pathways. Results show that the total of carbon emissions in the study area is still in the upward period of the Kuznets' inverted U-shaped curve, the main factors are population growth rate, economic growth rate, energy consumption intensity and energy structure. If the enhanced carbon reduction scenario is adopted, carbon emissions peak will occur in 2025 or 2026, and the total carbon emissions will be between 120 million tCO2 e to 130 million tCO2 e, and the per capita carbon level will be about 17.5–19.5 tCO2 e. On the future, ten emission reduction pathways for China's low-carbon cities are put forward: strengthening urban spatial planning, upgrading economic structure, developing low-carbon systems in energy, industry, housing, transportation, and agriculture, encouraging low-carbon lifestyles, reforming low-carbon boosting mechanism, and improving low-carbon governance capability.}

This paper develops a composite index that consists of a unique set of 7 dimensions and 35 main indicators. The SDEWES (Sustainable Development of Energy, Water, and Environment Systems) Index is applied to a sample of 22 Mediterranean port cities. The index integrates energy and CO2 emissions data from SEAP (Sustainable Energy Action Plans). The values of the indicators are aggregated based on the Min-Max method for a final ranking. Nice, Venice, and Dubrovnik are the top three cities. An average city in the sample receives a composite score of 2.71. The results are subjugated to comparison based on three energy scenarios. The scenarios take into account reductions in final energy consumption per capita for a given area of the city based on smart energy measures. The scenarios represent improvements in the energy system that may include combined heat and power based district heating networks. A SDEWES Index Tool is developed to further allow cities to plan for potential changes in the final ranking based on energy scenarios. The SDEWES Index is useful to trigger learning, action, and collaboration among Mediterranean port cities to increase future performance.}

The energy storage technologies provide support by stabilizing the power production and energy demand. This is achieved by storing excessive or unused energy and supplying to the grid or customers whenever it is required. Further, in future electric grid, energy storage systems can be treated as the main electricity sources. Researchers and industrial experts have worked on various energy storage technologies by integrating different renewable energy resources into energy storage systems. Due to the wide range of developments in energy storage technologies, in this article, authors have considered various types of energy storage technologies, namely battery, thermochemical, thermal, pumped energy storage, compressed air, hydrogen, chemical, magnetic energy storage, and a few others. These energy storage technologies were critically reviewed; categorized and comparative studies have been performed to understand each energy storage system's features, limitations, and advantages. Further, different energy storage system frameworks have been suggested based on its application. Therefore, this paper acts as a guide to the new researchers who work in energy storage technologies. The future scope suggests that researchers shall develop innovative energy storage systems to face challenges in power system networks, to maintain reliability and power quality, as well as to meet the energy demand.}

In this interconnected world, smart objects have an important role in giving users the chance for life-logging in smart environments. However, smart devices have several limitations with regards to memory, resources and computation power, hindering the opportunity to apply well-established security algorithms and techniques for secure life-logging on the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. The need for secure and trustworthy life-logging in smart environments is vital, thus, a lightweight approach has to be considered to overcome the constraints of Smart Objects. The purpose of this paper is to present in details the current topics of life-logging in smart environments, while describing interconnection issues, security threats and suggesting a lightweight framework for ensuring security, privacy and trustworthy life-logging. In order to investigate the efficiency of the lightweight framework and the impact of the security attacks on energy consumption, an experimental test-bed was developed including two interconnected users and one smart attacker, who attempts to intercept transmitted messages or interfere with the communication link. Several mitigation factors, such as power control, channel assignment and AES-128 encryption were applied for secure life-logging. Finally, research into the degradation of the consumed energy regarding the described intrusions is presented.}

This is because different smart grid applications have different network requirements – in terms of data payloads, sampling rates, latency and reliability. Based on a variety of smart grid use cases and selected standards, this paper compiles information about different communication network requirements for different smart grid applications, ranging from those used in a Home Area Network (HAN), Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) and Wide-Area Network (WAN).

However, a proper scheduling strategy with strategic goals is needed to reap these benefits of SDS. In this regard, a multi-objective techno-economic optimization framework for optimal operation of SDS consisting of different resources such as renewables, dispatchable distributed generations and battery storage systems (BSSs) is presented in this paper. The proposed framework aims at simultaneously minimizing operation cost and network energy loss. To manage the operation of grid effectively, provision of both real and reactive power from BSS is included in operation of SDS. The initial operational problem is modeled as mixed integer non-linear non-convex optimization, which is then translated into mixed integer second order cone programming that can be successfully solved using commercially available solvers. Moreover, the multi-objective problem is tackled using ϵ-constraint method followed by fuzzy satisfying criteria. In order to highlight the efficacy of proposed work, case studies are conducted on 33-bus distribution system. Results demonstrate that utilization of reactive power services from BSS significantly reduces energy losses and operation cost.}

In the context of a fast and continuous expansion of tourism activities, particular attention is given to their impacts. The results of our path model suggest that different patterns of tourism dynamics coexist in European regions and that, for those where this sector assumes larger socio-economic importance, the contribution to the achievement of the “Millennium Goals”, as proposed by the United Nations, is relatively poor. Regions particularly endowed in natural resources reveal a weak socio-economic performance, while showing high levels of specialization in tourism, based on large scale and low value-added products and services, suggesting that new approaches to territorial design are required. This also leads to important spatial unbalances, with the most tourism-dependent European regions revealing relatively low levels of regional gross domestic product and high levels of unemployment. Despite their relatively good performance in terms of CO2-emissions, it seems important for those regions' sustainable development to increase the value added in tourism, by reinforcing the linkages with other relevant regional economic sectors. Information and communication technologies can contribute to these achievements, through the integration of knowledge and innovations into the products and services comprising the smart tourism experiences (smart development) and their connections with related sectors (smart specialization).}

However, the information island phenomenon hinders these connections in the digital world because outdoor sidewalks and indoor spaces are modelled using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) technologies, respectively, which challenges obtaining integrated information for intelligent pedestrian services. This study presents an approach for interlinking BIM and GIS data for a semantic pedestrian network using semantic web technologies. The proposed approach automatically converts BIM and GIS data into linked data and establishes interlinkages between BIM and GIS data through semantic queries and inferences. The resulting semantic pedestrian network based on integrated linked data graphs forms a knowledge base, including topological and geometrical information and abundant semantic information from BIM and GIS datasets. The application potential of the semantic pedestrian network is demonstrated through information query and semantic route planning.

Recent advances in digitalization and sophisticated data analytics offers new innovative ways in delivering rehabilitation services to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities. Currently, the development of data-driven solutions for rehabilitation in Malaysia is limited due to multiple factors: medical and rehabilitation data is not digitally stored; the knowledge for the interpretation of clinical data is distributed; in particular, there is a lack of expertise in the field of medical data science. Thus, a data science platform is proposed so that medical expertise can be made available through digital services and is not dependent on human resource, location, time or financial ability. This platform is applied for the smart diagnosis of upper limb spasticity in compliance with clinical practice, and extensible for the other smart rehabilitation applications. By collaborating with the prestigious Fraunhofer Society, their knowhow in industrial data science can be brought to Malaysia towards improved health care in the country. The smart diagnosis system provides advice in classifying the severity level of upper limb spasticity based on the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Modified Tardieu scale. The basis is a measurement system for muscle signal, muscle tone and elbow motion. Users of the smart diagnosis application include rehabilitation physicians, doctors from other specialities, nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. The tools provided by the data science platform is deployed to store and analyze the clinical data. Further, the expertise of a rehabilitation physician is emulated in the form of an expert system to determine the severity level of upper limb spasticity. The digital clinical database helps medical researchers in secondary analysis towards knowledge discovery for the betterment of intervention and treatment of spasticity.}

Till now, existing CNC systems do not offer sufficient openness that supports researchers and engineers to expend its capabilities and functionalities in response to the increasing demands of smart manufacturing; on the other hand, transforming an EDM machine made by small and medium-sized machine tool builders, into a smart manufacturing system has never been an easy job. To address the issues and overcome the difficulties which block the way towards smart manufacturing, this paper proposes an open architecture CNC platform for EDM machine tools. This platform utilizes the state-of-the-art technologies in implementation of the hardware and software without compromising with the constraints of obsolete techniques. For demonstrating the unique capabilities, the generalized unit arc length increment (GUALI) interpolation method and the Digitizer/Player system architecture are adopted. To exhibit the feasibilities of the newly developed platform, three kinds of EDM machine tools are applied associated with advanced functionalities such as machining process adaptive control, applications of machine learning, 6-axis EDM of shrouded turbine blisks etc. In addition, a small-scale smart manufacturing unit for drilling film cooling holes of turbine blades is built up into real production by applying the new CNC system and related software applications. From the practitioner’s viewpoint, openness and standardization are the keys that enable the people from academia and industry bringing in their domain knowledge to enrich the smart manufacturing ecosystem.}

The irrigation levels applied throughout the experiment ranged between 39% and 103% reference ET (ETo) and the irrigation frequency restrictions imposed were 3, 5 and 7 d/wk. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were continuously collected to evaluate the response of hybrid bermudagrass [‘Tifgreen’ Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt‐Davy] to irrigation treatments. Plots were also visually assessed and scaled from 1 (dead plot) to 9 (ideal turfgrass) following the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP) standards. Turfgrass water response function (TWRF) was introduced as a statistical regression model to estimate hybrid bermudagrass quality response (NDVI values) to irrigation levels over time. In the years 2018 (p < 0.01) and 2019 (p < 0.001), the irrigation levels showed a significant effect on NDVI values. The irrigation frequency restrictions showed no significant impact on NDVI in any of the years. We observed a high correlation (r = 0.84) between visual rating (VR) and NDVI data. The TWRF shows a high accuracy (RMSE = 0.047, no units), and estimated NDVI values were highly correlated (r = 0.89) with measured NDVI values. A comparison between the California irrigation management information system (CIMIS) reference evapotranspiration (ETo) versus temperature-based ETo estimations by the controller revealed the smart controller on average over-irrigated by 12%, 2% and 3% throughout the experimental periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. A long term (34 years) analysis using CIMIS ETo data and TWRF model revealed 75% ETo as the minimum irrigation application to maintain the acceptable hybrid bermudagrass quality in the inland southern California semiarid climate for months with high irrigation demand (i.e., May to November). The results also showed that hybrid bermudagrass could withstand more severe deficit irrigation treatments for shorter periods depending on ETo demand.}

This article examines how neoliberal planning facilitates and shapes new city projects in the Global South. In particular, this article focuses on three key mechanisms of neoliberal planning that promote new cities: deregulation, authoritarian state intervention, and public-private partnerships (PPPs). The findings suggest that neoliberal planning has been widely employed as a critical tool in developing new cities across the Global South, which has generated detrimental consequences such as social exclusion and inequality, spatial fragmentation, and environmental deterioration. It also finds that deregulation, authoritarian state intervention, and PPPs can work hand in hand in complex and dynamic ways to foster new cities. Although this article does not argue that neoliberal planning is the only mechanism that facilitates new city building, pervasive and variegated neoliberal planning warrants further attention to the interactions between neoliberal planning and new city building. In addition, further research is needed to decipher how neoliberal planning coexists and interacts with non-neoliberal ideologies and practices in new city developments, which is critical for promoting sustainable development.}

The 15-minute city emerges as a robust concept to inform the adaptation of the urban environment to the post-pandemic scenario. The 15-minute city concept combines the components of density, proximity, diversity, and digitalization to increase residents' access to basic services, favour sustainable modes of transportation, and transform public urban spaces into multifunctional places. The proposed study focuses on the dimensions of density, proximity, and diversity. It develops a set of indicators derived from the configurational analysis to evaluate urban quality in terms of the potential to actualize the 15-minute city concept. The selected areas of study are the cities of Terni and Matera in Italy. The study addresses three issues: i) defining a set of relevant, reproducible, and comparable indicators for measuring density, proximity, diversity, and imageability at the district scale; ii) investigating the influence of distinct urban planning concepts, manifested and reproduced by the configuration of public spaces, on density, proximity, diversity, and imageability; and iii) defining urban scale metrics to measure levels of spatial injustice in terms of unequal conditions of access to basic services. The analysis underlines the gap in terms of access to basic services and imageability among central compact districts and dispersed outer areas. As a result, the case study underlines that the proposed set of indicators is instrumental to understanding the urban environment's potential to meet the needs of urban populations. Moreover, by enabling the identification of inequalities in the distribution of spatial capital, the proposed set of indicators facilitates informed decisions in the context of urban planning.}
