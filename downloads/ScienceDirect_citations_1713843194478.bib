abstract = {Smart cities are developing at increasing speed. Smart cities rely on the deployment of information and communication technology (ICT) that is digitally transforming our habitats. Digital transformation affects several areas from transportation, energy, government to the environment. But, primarily, it affects citizens. Therefore, the adoption of all areas of the smart city holds great research potential. The purpose of this paper is thus to provide an insight into millennials’ adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV), which are at the forefront of future transport. Millennials are an important focus group for smart city concepts since they are keen to adopt technology and new transport modes. Our research focuses on technology adoption, perception of the benefits, security, safety, mobility-related efficiencies and concerns as the key AV adoption factors. The impact of these factors is empirically tested with structural equation modelling using data from 382 millennials. We confirm the perceived benefits of AV are vital factors for AV adoption whereas the perceived safety of AV significantly reduces the influence of various concerns regarding AV.}

abstract = {Smart city can be seen as a glocal phenomenon, as it is characterised by both global and local aspects. Smart cities are a global phenomenon because they spread all over the world and emerge with similar features and interdependencies at the global level. In the meantime, smart cities are a local phenomenon, because each city is unique, has different problems and should address them with specific solutions. The aim of this work is to better understand smart cities as a glocal phenomenon, considering their universal features together with the local aspects influencing their implementation. Through a research based on a Qualitative Data Analysis, the present work suggests a novel way to examine the smart city, to support a better understanding of this glocal trend promising enormous benefits for citizens and growing revenues in all five continents, but not equally distributed. In particular, the paper analyses and compares Italy and China to verify that smart city is a glocal urban strategy, depending both from global, standard drivers and local contingencies. The methodology and results can be generalised to other cities and countries.}

abstract = {By 2030, the population living in cities will increase by an additional 1.5 billion people, placing a great strain on resources, infrastructure, jobs and healthcare (UN 2018). It has become clear that to combat this change, a number of creative approaches need to be put in place to ensure the sustainable growth of cities - one such approach is the ‘smart city’ (UN 2018). Due to the relative infancy of smart cities, and the diversity of approaches and implementations of smart information systems (Big Data and AI), many of the ethical challenges are still being defined. One of the reasons behind this challenge is a result of the varying smart information systems (SIS) being used in different urban contexts. This case study aspires to unpack some of these ethical challenges by looking at four different applications of SIS being deployed in large European cities: an AI used to understand citizens’ complaints (Amsterdam), a parking permit chat-bot (Helsinki), a platform for data exchange (Copenhagen), and a project with an open-source algorithm (Hamburg).Upon first glance, these technologies seem very disparate, but they all factor into the equation of what goes into making a smart city, ‘smart’. Over the course of the interviews, what quickly became clear was the degree to which smart cities are in their infancy, meaning that the availability and accuracy of data remains an issue in a large majority of the cases. In terms of the accuracy of recommendations – due to the early stages of smart city implementation, many projects remain wary of expanding the use of SIS, due to potential unforeseen issues and are therefore proceeding cautiously. Data has been taken on as a potentially helpful tool for citizens and planners alike to regain control and access to information within their respective cities. Consent, transparency and data ownership featured as prominent ethical considerations in all cases, especially the focus on citizens regaining control over their own data. Further, it remained a point of contention to whom the data would belong – with an overall consensus that data should remain the property of the citizen or municipality and not necessarily that of private companies. Throughout the process, it became clear that collaboration is at the heart of a successful smart city. Many of the projects utilised a collaborative public-private model to facilitate both the business development side and the citizen-engagement sides of the smart city. With differing degrees of success in the individual projects, this remained an important feature that experts believe will continue to develop in tandem with smart city projects. A bottom-up approach is clearly the most effective way to ensure that a smart city works and is used by its citizens. Overall, this case study offers valuable insights into the development of smart cities in a European context: including the use and implementation of SIS in urban environments, what kinds of ethical issues are evaluated in the literature and how they contrast and diverge from those faced by professionals in practice. It is hoped that this case study will offer practitioners, policymakers, smart city organisations, and private ICT companies interesting observations about a more ethically responsible approach towards SIS implementation in smart city projects.}

Though traditionally there have always been transactional elements between government and citizen, for example payment of taxes in exchange for services, or voting in exchange for representation, the rise of modern smartphone and smart city technologies have further enabled micro-transactions between citizen, government, and information broker. We conceptualize how the modern smart city, as both envisaged and enacted, incorporates the citizen not necessarily as a whole actor, but as a series of micro-transactions encoded on the real-time landscape of the city. This transactional citizen becomes counted by smart city sensors and integrated into smart city decision-making through the use of certain preferred platforms. To approach this shift from traditional forms of citizen/city interaction towards micro-transactions, we conceptualize four broad modes of transaction; type (intentional contribution), tweet (intermediated by third party), tap (convened or requested transaction), and pass (ambient transaction based on movement). These four modes are used to frame critical questions of how citizens interact with government in the emerging age of the smart city, and how these interactions impact the relationship between citizen and government, introducing new avenues for private sector influence.}

For the oil industry, exploring how to apply enabling technologies such as data transmission, internet of things, big data analysis in the energy field can fill the gap of applying intelligent technologies to energy facilities system. For the petroleum field, one of the biggest threats to safe drilling operations during oil and gas exploration is loss circulation. In the study, based on a new assessment framework that integrates intelligent energy into smart cities, an improved fuzzy evaluation method of drilling risk based on cloud method is proposed to realize the transformation of drilling risk from quantitative to qualitative. The theory proposed in this paper considers the subjective engineering experience of experts and the information contained in objective data, which make the judgment results more objective. The cloud theory proposed can clearly show the result of risk assessment, which fully reflects the fuzziness and randomness of the drilling system. The model is embedded in the evaluation framework of smart cities, which realizes the online remote online assessment of risks by city office workers.}

Urban vehicular network consisting of ICVs is evolving towards a distributed intelligent platform for pervasive sensing, connecting and computing in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and smart cities. In this paper, we propose that parked vehicles (PVs) could be exploited for environment perception and model inference. We describe the system architecture and its typical application scenarios of distributed environment perception for city roads, parking lots, as well as for commercial and residential buildings. PVs are motivated to assist in deep learning model inference for the captured image data in such applications. Regarding the diversity of PVs in deep learning capability, a differential incentive mechanism is elaborately designed based on contract theory to emulate PVsparticipation. The experiment on the dataset of German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark is conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.}

Such VSN attacks can lead to loss of life due to road accidents and breach of privacy. In this paper, we overview the VSN concept in a vehicular IoT-based smart city paradigm, focusing on the security aspects. In addition, we discuss the design features of VSN, its robustness, and reliability. We also discuss relevant communication technologies and their security concerns. We highlight the main open research issues in literature and provide hints for overcoming them. This analysis concludes that VSNs play a key role in developing efficient ITS. Nevertheless, current VSNs security standards must be improved for a reliable, and safe transportation system.}

The analysis reveals that current rankings generally overlook indicators of the Information and Communication Technologies dimension. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a methodology based on Multiple-Attribute Decision Making that uses technological criteria for designing smart city rankings. The proposed methodology is evaluated against the cities of New York, Seoul, and Santander. Imbalances between results provided by the studied rankings and our evaluation are detected, which suggests the need for a new insight into more suitable and precise evaluation of the smartness degree of cities.}

abstract = {Smart cities represent an archetypal example of infrastructures where the fog computing paradigm can express its potential: we have a large set of sensors deployed over a large geographic area where data should be pre-processed (e.g., to extract relevant information or to filter and aggregate data) before sending the result to a collector that may be a cloud data center, where relevant data are further processed and stored. However, during its lifetime the infrastructure may change, e.g., due to the additional sensors or fog nodes deploy, while the load can grow, e.g., for additional services based on the collected data. Since nodes are typically deployed in multiple time stages, they may have different computation capacity due to technology improvements. In addition, an uneven distribution of the workload intensity can arise, e.g., due to hot spot for occasional public events or to rush hours and users’ behavior. In simple words, resources and load can vary over time and space. Under the resource management point of view, this scenario is clearly challenging. Due to the large scale and variable nature of the resources, classical centralized solutions should in fact be avoided, since they do not scale well and require to transfer all data from sensors to a central hub, distorting the very nature of in-situ data processing. In this paper, we address the problem of resources management by proposing two distributed load balancing algorithms, tailored to deal with heterogeneity. We evaluate the performance of such algorithms using both a simplified environment where we perform several sensitivity analysis with respect to the factors responsible for the infrastructure heterogeneity and exploiting a realistic scenario of a smart city. Furthermore, in our study we combine theoretical models and simulation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms under a wide range of heterogeneity, overall providing a remarkable improvement compared to the case of not cooperating nodes.}

There is little study examining what results have been achieved in practice by applying policy measures. This study presents a holistic evaluation of smart city performance in the context of China. The evaluation indicators in this study are selected by applying a hybrid research methodology including literature review and semi-structured interviews. Indicator data are collected from 44 sample smart cities. The evaluation was conducted by applying Entropy method and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique collectively. This study highlights that the overall smart city performance in China is at a relatively low level. There is also a significant unbalance in performance between five smart city dimensions including smart infrastructure, governance, people, economy and environment. The smart performance between cities varies significantly since cities implement smart city programs in different ways. These differences impede experience sharing between cities.

However, such distributed systems, if not secured, may cause a major threat by disclosing sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities.

This paper presents a concept for securing distributed applications and services in such data infrastructures for Smart Cities. The concept facilitates privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components by establishing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The approach facilitates Single-Sign-On (SSO) authentication by a novel combination in the use of the state-of-the-art security concepts such as OAuth2 access tokens, OpenID Connect user claims and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). An implementation of this concept for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper and is also provided as an online demonstration.

abstract = {With the rapid development and deep application and cooperation of new concepts and technologies brought by the Internet of Things and cloud computing all over the world, all walks of life have gradually moved towards a ”smart” modern society. These technologies have gradually penetrated into the field of smart cities. The traditional urban system, the system that has been handed down since ancient times, has a very inefficient and cumbersome mode of operation, and the information between the systems has not been effectively shared and interconnected. In order to solve this series of problems, this study first studies the development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing-related technologies and smart cities, and then focuses on the key technologies of the Internet of Things and cloud computing in the field of structure and application. Under the support of these two technologies, proposed a smart city system based on Internet and cloud computing. System architecture, application system design, application support platform, various transmission networks and typical sensors are studied in detail and on different levels. In smart city systems based on the Internet of Things, sensor networks are often placed in unreliable communication environments, and this usually causes the transmission of information to fail. Whether the sensor chooses to transmit again after the information transmission fails is an optimized problem. This research study proposes a data aggregation algorithm based on Markov chain to solve the problem of transmitting such data again. The experimental results show that the system can realize information sharing, exchange and fusion between various sensing subsystems, solve the previous information island phenomenon and meet the actual needs of smart cities.}

The smart cities analysed achieved acceptable, but rudimentary, levels of engagement via social media using Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. However, they displayed weaknesses related to their image and branding as well as the effectiveness with which they communicated their smart characteristics. The main implication of this research is that these Spanish smart cities have considerable scope to improve their use of social media to enhance their communications and branding. Greater emphasis is required on delivering emotional (affective) messages and a higher priority needs to be given to business and business event travellers and those visiting friends and relatives.}

The advent of sophisticated data and communication arrangements has paved the way for cost-centric DR programs as a practical means to regulate loads in intelligent landscaping design of microgrids (MGs). Individuals in residential settings are increasingly adopting unpredictable RESs, such as photovoltaic (PV). This research investigates a unified landscaping framework aimed at addressing issues related to the scheduling or commitment of loads in households involving RESs, regardless of the tariff structure applied. Decision-making problems influenced by uncertainty find effective resolution through reinforcement learning (RL). The study puts forth an RL-powered resolution to load commitment challenges in intelligent MGs. An inventive facet of the research lies in the formulation of a comprehensive framework based on unscented transform (UT) that factors in user contentment, unpredictable renewable energy, and tariff considerations. Through simulated assessments, the proposed framework is evaluated for its efficacy and adaptability. An in-depth analysis of the methods’ performance is presented using a residential user scenario featuring devices with and without schedulable characteristics, in addition to a PV resource.}

Based on an in-depth study at Philips Lighting of four smart city cases across a period of five years, our article illustrates four distinct business models that enable incumbent organizations to enter this smart city market. We develop and contrast the four types of business models on individual and joint value creation and value capture dimensions and show how each business model can be of value to an incumbent, depending on the project and ecosystem. We illustrate these business models with insights from Philips Lighting's transition from public lighting to smart cities and provide specific implementation suggestions for incumbent companies.}

The city can be defined as "smart" when social capital, traditional and modern (ICT) communication infrastructure encourage sustainable economic development and high quality of life. Smart Mobility is often highlighted as a key system without which the Smart City could not be sustainable. A number of smart solutions have been analyzed and implemented in the context of smart mobility/movement in the cities and beyond. Many of these solutions are based on IT and they include a vehicle navigation system, e-parking, e-ticket, info-mobility signalization, demand-responsive transport, car sharing, bike sharing, public transport live tracking but also some innovative solutions are not necessarily related to IT (walking bus). Smart Mobility Survey has been conducted in Croatia and Italy during 2017 with the aim to establish users’ opinion on a number of the above-mentioned solutions that have been lately used in the cities worldwide. The survey has examined the familiarity with such solutions, their current use, and future expectations of using smart solutions in everyday life. The results showed, among Croatian responders, more limitations in accepting new technological solutions for mobility in the future. This points to the need to have a more public debate about future mobility solutions and their benefits in order to bring them closer to the wider population.}

It is used as a measure of the load balance of health data streams to determine whether load migration is needed and to determine the way and amount of migration tasks to make migration decisions. The simulation experiments show that the method has good computational performance and dynamic load balancing.

Through a set of parameters and the grouping of the main Smart Mobility initiatives, this study seeks to answer the following research question: as a result of the Smart City approach, have the Italian metropolitan cities enhanced their mobility system? This study highlights the fact that the application of the Smart City paradigm has had different effects on urban mobility systems, as the potential application of the model in question can be limited by the poor starting position of some cities. Indeed, in cities with a well-functioning mobility system, ICTs are a means to improve the efficiency of the transport system, while in metropolitan contexts where there is a lack of transport infrastructure, the use of new technologies becomes only a label rather than being integrated into urban policies.}

Based on qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews and documentation on firm activities related to smart cities, our study offers two contributions. First, the empirical analysis provides insight into how MNEs have developed resources and capabilities in the smart city realm from a multitude of smart city engagements globally, and shows how firm-specific strategies and programmes for smart cities (IBM Smarter Cities, Cisco Smart + Connected Communities, and Accenture Intelligent Cities) have facilitated this process. Second, it provides an actor-centric perspective on the (potential) role of business in the emergence and spread of technological innovations for urban development, helping to address the need for further insights into (smart) cities and stakeholder involvement in sustainability transitions.}

Smart city is the ubiquitous and a paradigm shift which has revolutionized the entire landscape with the support of information and communication technology (ICT), sensor-enabled IoT devices. For the better and big picture of the entire scenarios with high visibility multimedia (i.e., video, audio, text, and images) transmission is the soul-concept in the smart world, but due to resource-constrained (power hungry and limited battery lifetime) nature of these tiny devices (which are building blocks of smart city) and voluminous amount of the data it is very challenging to openly talk about the sustainable and Green smart city platform. Thus, to remedy these problems two Hybrid Adaptive Bandwidth and Power Algorithm (HABPA), and Delay-tolerant Streaming Algorithm (DSA) are proposed by adopting stored video stream titled, StarWarsIV. Besides, a novel architecture of smart city system is proposed. Experimental results are obtained and analyzed in terms of performance metrics i.e., power drain, battery lifetime, delay, standard deviation and packet loss ratio (PLR) in association to the buffer size. It is concluded that the HABPA (45%,37%,20 ms) significantly optimizes power drain, battery lifetime (37%), standard deviation (3.5 dB), PLR (4.5%) of the IoT-enabled devices with less delay than DSA (43%, 32%,25 ms, 5 dB, 5.75%) and Baseline (42%,28%, 30 ms, 6 dB, 6.53%) respectively during media transmission in smart city.}

abstract = {Supporting deep learning is a challenge for Internet of Things hardware with limited computing capacity. Edge computing is a promising solution that supports such hardware as it solves transferring and processing bottlenecks. To allocate appropriate loads to utilize edge computing efficiently, we propose an edge computing solution for smart city environments that assigns some of the deep learning layers to edge nodes in order to support deep learning tasks on Internet of Things devices. The proposed deep learning layer assignment in edge computing algorithm determines the ideal number of deep learning layers to be assigned to each edge considering computing capacity and bandwidth of each edge separately. Simulation results of the proposed algorithm were compared with other existing methods such as Li's offline and online method, fixed assignment, and cloud-only method. The comparison showed that the proposed algorithm handles the most deep learning tasks while maximizing resource utilization of edges.}

There are abundant studies on political and technological strategies to make smart cities, however, the changes induced by those strategies have not been comprehensively understood. In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to identify the results of smart city development using the systematic literature review method. We reviewed 55 papers and found 12 positive and 4 negative results are frequently mentioned. Among 12 positive results, six were purely hypothetical without any evidence: (1) enhancing citizen involvement, (2) protecting environment, (3) facilitating social development, (4) facilitating sustainable development, (5) fostering innovation, and (6) increasing social capital. There is relatively less attention to negative results. Two out of four negative results are purely hypothetical: (1) privacy and security issues and (2) diminishing freedom of speech and democracy. Further studies are needed in discovering the evidence for purely hypothetical impacts and comparing smart city development in advanced and emerging economies.}

To reduce the energy consumption of data centers and promote smart, sustainable, and low-carbon city development, this study analyzes the energy conservation and emission-reduction technologies and potential decarbonization paths for data centers, compares the energy-saving situation of 20 typical data center cases, and highlights the impact of green data centers on the global carbon neutrality goal. The analysis reveals that data center energy consumption can be reduced by about 20–40% and 15–27% through IT equipment optimization and cooling technology improvements, respectively. Data center energy-saving strategies must consider differences in geographical location, natural resources, and economic bases. Therefore, this study examines the necessary steps for building zero-carbon data centers from the perspectives of public policy, technological innovation, and resource management. Specifically, the following aspects are explored: 1) accelerating the intelligent and unified management of data center resources; 2) building storage-computing integrated data centers that are compatible with heterogeneous resources and streamlined business models; 3) realizing large-scale and diversified use of clean energy in data centers.}

abstract = {Smart cities have been developing aggressively around the globe, especially in China. As of 2017, more than 1000 cities in the world have commenced smart city developments, half of which are in China. However, there is not a uniform and clear understanding of smart city systems; this may affect their evaluation/planning and lead to misguided construction. Smart cities are characterized by complex self-organizing systems, and thus their sustainable and healthy development may require following the evolutionary patterns of such systems. Hence, self-organizing system theory may be useful in explaining such cities. Therefore, this paper first performs secondary qualitative data analyses of previous attempts at characterizing smart city development to identify the most robust aspects tested in previous work. Then, incorporating the results, self-organization theory is used to develop an overall, comprehensive system framework of smart cities. In this framework, all types of smart devices are the basic units of development (defined as “smart cells”). Meanwhile, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and developmental mechanisms offer technical support and regulatory mechanisms in the spontaneous operation of smart cities. These three dimensions (smart cells, ICT, and developmental mechanisms) are combined into a scalable and distributed smart city evaluation system. Finally, smart transportation systems and the current state of these in China are used as a case study for discussion.}

In this paper we consider a set of few terminals, not ever of the same type, in a smart city fractioned in zones that are interested in collecting the information originated from environment but possibly also other several sources by sensors, reading tags or communications. This set includes mobile nodes, two differently equipped type of them, pedestrian and vehicles, and fixed terminals. Also we aim to consider other nodes, for example also nodes with a completely random series of movements, regardless of their usefulness or natural real possibility. In particular, each terminal aims to retrieve the data items or environmental information in a limited region of interest (ROI). This is centred around the node position itself. The environment is supposed to be dynamic: data items may change over time. So all nodes must strive for updating or obtaining the latest data version. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the percentage of information each node gathers with policies based on a simple distributed data gathering and sharing through local broadcast communications. We study the diffusion of data items and information updates in the whole area, experimenting in different conditions the influence of adding to the scenario random motion of nodes. Some reflections are made so as that similar results may be obtained adding Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to a real urban scenario. The study we present in this paper has been done using computer simulation. We wrote a discrete event simulator working on the base of mobility and radio propagation traces obtained from the UDelModels tools.}

abstract = {There has been a surge of interest over the past several years in the development and implementation of tools, frameworks, and indicator sets (hereafter, ‘schemes’) for smart city assessment. This indicates the growing recognition of the significance of assessment schemes to better inform planning and design of sustainable, smart, and resilient cities. Despite this, there has been little examination of the typology and structure of assessment schemes. This gap has been partially addressed in a recent study by Sharifi (2019) that examines strengths and weaknesses of selected assessment schemes in terms of issues such as coverage of different smartness dimensions, stakeholder engagement, context sensitivity, alignment with city vision and strategic needs, uncertainty management, addressing interlinkages and interoperabilities between smart city indicators, dealing with temporal dynamism issues, flexibility, feasibility, presentation and communication of the results, and using assessment results to inform action plans. To build on and complement that study, this paper examines thirty-four schemes to contribute to a better understanding of their typology. It provides general information related to characteristics such as geographic focus, scale of analysis, target audience, and the method of development. In addition, it identifies format, thematic focus areas, and persistent indicators across the schemes and provides detailed information on the major methods and approaches used for assessing city smartness. Results show that diverse approaches have been taken, but there are also some commonalities. Index is the dominant format across the schemes and the most common themes are: economy, people, governance, environment, mobility, living, and data. This typology study can be used for multiple purposes; it can serve as a frame of reference for those aiming at evaluating performance of smart cities using appropriate schemes, can be used as a basis for conducting further critical analyses of assessment schemes, and may also guide the development of better-informed schemes in the future.}

Simultaneously, the protection of these images is crucial for various emerging applications. Encryption is a popular technique for protecting image data confidentiality and privacy. There are multiple existing studies on image encryption, however, most of them are computationally overhead and do not achieve high security. Considering that time cost and security have become the most important factors, designing an efficient encryption algorithm for digital images are necessary. In this paper, a secure chaos-based image encryption algorithm for smart city applications is proposed. First, the You Only Look Once v3 object detection algorithm is used to quickly identify the objects of an image. Second, initialisation and generation of a key is performed with confusion and diffusion operations to get an encrypted object image. This algorithm for encryption has the advantage of strong security performance combined with speed, which is not available in the general encryption system. Experimental results show that this proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes.}

In the context of smart health, smart devices are employed to collect and transmit biomedical information to a medical server, allowing medical practitioners to give better and improved healthcare services. However, considering the sensitive nature of the medical data, any illegal access may have devastating effects on the patient's health condition. A lightweight privacy-preserving authentication and fine-grained access control scheme for smart health known as PAASH is proposed. In PAASH, a new ultraefficient certificateless signature scheme with compact aggregation is developed to achieve source authentication and data integrity. To achieve efficient user authorization and data confidentiality, a privacy-preserving access control technique using the developed aggregate signature and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is implemented. An analysis of PAASH reveals that it can provide desirable privacy and security measures in smart health. Moreover, the formal security demonstrated in the random oracle model (ROM) shows that PAASH is semantically secure under the intractability of the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP). The performance evaluation shows that PAASH is par excellence practically suitable for smart health.}

Therefore, while planning for new electrified systems, such a trading policy is taken into consideration. On the other hand, as the electrification of railway systems along with the use of electric vehicles serve several sustainable development goals, plans are studied for the electrification of the inter-city railway system in Alexandria, Egypt, in order to connect it with the high-speed inter-provincial electric railway system. In addition, other plans are studied for local production of electric vehicles. For this purpose, this paper presents a study regarding P2P based optimal energy management (EM) of a flexible smart railway substation taking into consideration multiple energy sources of the traction system and the wayside distribution network. The energy sources of the substation include captured regenerative braking energy (RBE), photovoltaic (PV) units and a multistory parking garage of electric vehicles (EVs). The wayside distribution network also contains several energy sources including distributed generation and multiple energy hubs (EHs) in addition to district distribution area with flexible loads. Optimal energy management is carried out including optimal demand side management of flexible loads and EHs. The optimization study takes into consideration several operational uncertainties arising from several components of the system. The simulation results show the feasibility of applying the proposed EM algorithm with an improvement of the energy economics of the system.}

The 2nd phase builds up a technology inventory for the selected cases. The 3rd phase is the expert prediction phase for technology maturity, in which technology development predictions are used to establish the causal relationship between a technology and the timing of its application. This process produces a technology roadmap which is then used as the basis for organizing smart city technologies and applications into four ascending layers: Sensor, Integration, Intelligent, and Application. The result is a blueprint for the application of smart city technologies. In addition, 36 smart city experts were surveyed to assess the maturity of and connection between smart city technologies, markets, and industries. Current smart city developments can then be ascertained to provide recommendations on smart city development. This preliminary forecast and analysis of smart city technologies can be applied to related industries to gain a general understanding of trends in the development of key technologies and applications.}

Smart cities are a topic whose key importance is being increasingly recognised across both academic disciplines and urban planning. The idea of a smart city is a dream of urban planners all over the world, and a subject of many research and business initiatives as well as policy debates. As cities vary considerably in size, it is important to ask if the size influences the level of selected indicators of smart cities. Our main presumption is that the development level of indicators of smart cities varies in cities of different size. Our scientific objective is to find a simple understandable model linking the categorical variable “city size” to a group of smart city indicators. Our data set contains 26 smart city indicators for 158 European smart cities, divided into two sizes: medium-sized cities and larger cities. We draw from the methodology of “European Smart Cities” elaborated by the Vienna University of Technology (Project ID: 314704) that classify European smart cities and smart city indicators by considering their size. Analysing the statistics by using decision tree modelling, we identify the most significant indicators of smart cities that can divide smart cities into size categories with impressive 96.2% correct classification. Besides excellent classification result based on real empirical data, several research results overturn common assumptions about smart cities. Based on the research results the paper also highlights intriguing future challenges in smart city research and policy development. Several research results have policy implications and might be useful for urban planners, policy representatives and decision makers.}

Panel data analysis methods were employed to investigate changes in carbon dioxide emissions level of 15 UK cities with differential level of city smartness over the period of 2005–2013. The findings reveal that the link between city smartness and carbon dioxide emissions is not linear, and the impact of city smartness on carbon dioxide emissions does not change over time.

Whereas, switching from traditional to networked power grid requires a long process. Currently, renewable energy (RE) injection into existing power systems is in transition state, which is a sophisticated and multidisciplinary task. In this article, RE integration engineering efforts are discussed that take a step ahead towards green energy. RE integration engineering refers to the controlling and configuring tasks regarding distributed power generation sources, information and communication technologies and dispatchable loads. An extensive literature review of this domain is conducted considering main objectives with associated constraints, techniques used and miscellaneous parameters that lead towards green energy. As with the induction of renewable energy sources (RESs) and utilization of microgrids (MGs), the power generation uncertainty factor is evolved which limits networked grid to operate within its full capacity and perceived advantages. In this study, an hierarchal conceptual framework is also presented that is hybrid in nature, i.e., adds functionalities of both centralized as well as distributed control to avoid bottle necks and complexities to minimize the power generation uncertainty effects. Furthermore, a brief discussion is provided keeping a broader perspective in forth coming power networks for eco-friendly smart cities. The focus of the discussion is on RE integration engineering in perspectives of precise forecasting problem, dynamic dispatch problem, demand responsiveness and market implications that tends to lead towards eco-friendly and power aware smart cities.}

So comes the natural question: has smart city construction improved the eco-efficiency of cities In China? How does the impact change over time? Is the impact heterogeneous across cities? Based on Green Solow model, this paper adopts the Super-efficiency SBM model to measure the eco-efficiency of 152 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period 2003-2016, and then DID model is applied to investigate the impact of smart city pilot policy on eco-efficiency. On the whole, the smart city construction significantly improves the eco-efficiency, and the multi-stage DID results reveal that the promotion effect is increasing over time due to the annual superposition. Furthermore, the impact is heterogeneous across cities. Although the promotion effect on medium-sized cities is less than that of large cities, the promotion effect has actually weakened when the urban population size exceeds 5 million. Moreover, the lower the level of city’s economic development, the greater the role of smart city construction in promoting eco-efficiency. The research conclusion is of great practical significance for the reform of urban governance model and the realization of high-quality urban development.}

The sustainable properties of smart city applications require less energy consumption and efficient resource allocation. The Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G, and fog networks have emerged as the most crucial researched areas due to their numerous applications for smart cities to provide the desired sustainable outcome. The sustainable properties of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a vital role in the deployment of these technologies into the physical world and efficient utilization of the available spectrum is a major problem faced here. As a potential solution of this, Cognitive Radio (CR) merged with WSN as Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs) make the smart perspective with high resource management through cooperative communication. The proposed work establishes a dynamic correlation between Secondary Users/nodes (SUs) in a single cluster according to their statistical behavior at the time of performing smart cooperative communication in CRSNs to improve sustainability of smart world IoT applications. Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is used to calculate the real-time resource allocation to these clusters using their respective Coordinator Agent (CoA) based on the dynamic behaviors. To improve sustainability in the smart city applications, the time delay in the prediction of vacant channels is reduced which results in making these applications become more energy efficient. The effectiveness of the proposed work is illustrated with mathematical analysis and simulation results confirm its better sustainable performance compared to the existing techniques.}

abstract = {While scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues. But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0’. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0’ or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), owing to its ability to support sustainability in various fields, has recently been considered one of the most important components of the information and communications technology (ICT) for sustainable smart cities. To achieve the required quality of the IoT communication system, performance prediction is necessary; it is beneficial for fault avoidance through the dynamic and continuous adaptation of network behavior, which helps achieve sustainable improvement of IoT communication systems in smart cities. Herein, a deep-learning (DL) model to evaluate and predict the performance of an IoT communication system is proposed. In the proposed model, the number of dynamic neural networks is equal to the number of networks in the IoT system. Each neural network predicts the performance of a given IoT network. Subsequently, the performance of the entire IoT communication system can be predicted from the outputs of individual networks, which will be considered the inputs for another dynamic neural network. The proposed IoT DL model was tested using network simulator (ns-3) to construct a simulated IoT environment. The simulation results verify that the proposed DL model predicted and improved the performance of an entire simulated IoT system highly accurately.}

We developed a framework for conducting case studies examining how smart cities were being implemented in San Francisco and Seoul Metropolitan City. The study's empirical results suggest that effective, sustainable smart cities emerge as a result of dynamic processes in which public and private sector actors coordinate their activities and resources on an open innovation platform. The different yet complementary linkages formed by these actors must further be aligned with respect to their developmental stage and embedded cultural and social capabilities. Our findings point to eight ‘stylized facts’, based on both quantitative and qualitative empirical results that underlie the facilitation of an effective smart city. In elaborating these facts, the paper offers useful insights to managers seeking to improve the delivery of smart city developmental projects.}

These dichotomies generate a critical knowledge gap because they suggest divergent hypotheses on what principles need to be considered when implementing strategies for enabling smart city development. This paper starts filling such a gap by reporting on the findings of a multiple case study analysis which is conducted into European best practices. In meeting this aim, four European cities considered to be leaders in the field of smart city development are analyzed to test the validity of the hypotheses emerging from each dichotomy. These cities are Amsterdam, Barcelona, Helsinki and Vienna. The results of this best practice analysis offer a series of critical insights into what strategic principles drive smart city development in Europe and generate scientific knowledge which helps to overcome the dichotomous nature of smart city research.}

In order to plan and build a smart city district, where ICT is integrated in critical infrastructure and used to control and govern city functions in innovative ways, new ways of working in city planning are needed. The purpose of this article is to develop a framework that takes into account stakeholders and smartness dimensions in city planning. We have studied a city district development in Sweden where a new planning approach was implemented. The developed framework was used to analyze the complexity of this city planning process. By defining which smartness dimension each stakeholder primarily focus on and analyzing the consequences of this, the framework pinpoints each stakeholder's contribution and/or hindrance to the process and outcome. A recommendation from this study is that new stakeholder groups are important to involve in smart city planning, but this also adds complexity that must be acknowledged when setting up this kind of projects. The developed framework can be useful when organizing and staffing city planning processes as well as when evaluating project outcomes.}

abstract = {Evolution of smart cities induces critical challenges related to cyber and network security. The increased reliance of a smart city on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure improves automation, efficiency, and sustainability of city services. However, it also poses enormous challenges for ensuring continued operations and services at all times and especially under cyber-attacks. Any lapse in cyber security can lead to critical disaster across the city. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are considered to be the most predominant and prevalent cyber-attacks. We believe that smart city could consist of numerous applications with varying level of network and security requirements. Therefore, providing an adaptive mechanism against DDoS attacks for all applications in a smart city is a key challenge. Further, considering the wide-scale requirements of a smart city, developing an adaptive and flexible solution is a key requirement. Considering these requirements, this paper presents SEAL (SEcure and AgiLe) – a novel Software Defined Networking (SDN) based adaptive framework for protecting smart city applications against DDoS attacks. The SEAL framework leverages key characteristics of SDN such as the global visibility, centralized control, and programmability to enhance the security and resilience. SEAL is capable of effectively detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks not only on application servers but also on network resources. SEAL is also unique in this regard that it provides application specific DDoS attack security solution instead of static threshold mechanism. Moreover, inherently distributed architecture of the SEAL framework ensures fault tolerance, scalability and reliability of the smart city. The SEAL framework comprises three modules, namely D-Defense, A-Defense and C-Defense. These modules collectively provide a mechanism to detect and mitigate DDoS attack on smart city applications and the network infrastructure. Adaptability in SEAL is achieved through implementing customized version of estimated-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. Three types of filters, Proactive Filter, Active Filter, and Passive Filter are proposed and implemented to compute the dynamic threshold in real time for various types of applications. Experimental evaluation of the SEAL framework has been conducted to establish the efficacy of the framework and its components in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. The results prove that SEAL is able to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks effectively. The focus of the SEAL framework is to protect smart city applications, however, the SEAL framework can potentially be utilized in a wide range of systems.}

Considering the smart governance as a collaborative network of government agencies and external stakeholders including citizens and a socio-technical system, we conduct in this paper an ethnographic mixed method by combining a qualitative method that studies actors’ collaboration and engagement in co-governance with a quantitative method that is based on graph theory to provide numerical analyses of organizational structures. While the qualitative method aims to discover organizational “smart factors” that affect the performance of SCN structures or configurations, the quantitative method aims to find “smart indicators” and metrics to evaluate these organizational factors. The result of this mixed method is an analytical recommender framework of the relevant SCN organizational structures in terms of robustness, flexibility and efficiency.}

To accurately solve the problem, several algorithms have been proposed in this paper. These can be split into two categories. First, algorithms based on data mining and knowledge discovery, which study the different correlation among human behavioral data, and identify the collective abnormal human behavior from knowledge extracted. Secondly, algorithms exploring convolution deep neural networks, which learn different features of historical data to determine the collective abnormal human behaviors. Experiments on an actual human behaviors database have been carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the deep learning solution outperforms both data mining as well as the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime and accuracy performance. In particular, for large datasets, the accuracy of the deep learning solution reaches 88%, however other solutions do not exceed 81%. Additionally, the runtime of the deep learning solution is below 50 seconds, whereas other solutions need more than 80 seconds for analyzing the same database.}

Despite sustainability often claimed to be a desired outcome of smart city initiatives, little evidence exists how sustainability outcomes are incorporated or achieved within the smart city initiatives. This paper aims to address the question of whether cities can become smart without actually being sustainable. The study undertakes a systematic review of the smart and sustainable cities literature. The analysis highlights an expectation in the reviewed academic literature for cities to become sustainable first in order to be considered truly smart. The results point to major challenges of smart cities in delivering sustainable outcomes: (a) Smart city policies are characterised by heavy technocentricity; (b) Smart city practices involve complexities, and; (c) Smart city notions are conceptualised in an ad-hoc manner. The findings provide evidence that the current smart city practice fails to incorporate an overarching sustainability goal that is progressive and genuine. This, then, highlights the need for a post-anthropocentric approach in practice and policymaking for the development of truly smart and sustainable cities. The findings seek to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on this topic.}

However, players do not passively comply. Rather their subversions and transgressions are integrated into the realisation of the smart city. Drawing on an in-depth empirical study of the popular LBG Pokémon Go, this paper critiques the dynamics inherent in the game design aimed to produce profit from gamers' exercise, exploration and interaction. We trace how smart citizens exploit ambivalences in game design to unleash a form of ‘gamification-from-below’.

The case study of the Italian city of Genoa shows that the smart city utopia acts as a generator of a collective imaginary while promoting the interests of business elites and diverting the attention away from urgent urban problems, such as urbanization. The neoliberal ideology influences the framing of these problems by favoring business-led technological solutions rather than political and long-term urban planning. The study suggests that this business-led utopia has important implications in terms of accountability of the actors involved.}

Drawing on data collected from a community workshop that included representatives from local government, technology and start-up sectors, community service providers, and community activists, we adopt a Creative Analytic Practice (CAP) approach and present a set of hybrid vignettes centered on the experiences of these stakeholder groups. The vignettes highlight differing expectations for the role of technology in promoting quality of life and illustrate a struggle to translate aspirations for collaboration and equity into on-the-ground action.

The governments around the world and others are aiming to guide and standardise this process by developing an array of standards to support this digitalisation, most notably on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Smart Cities Framework.

abstract = {Presently, the interconnected networks in smart cities are increasing at a high pace using the Internet of Things (IoT), which allows the user to access the device from anywhere and gather the data. With such massive networks, data analysis plays a vital role in the real world to interpret and analyze the information, giving it a meaningful form. Such an extensive network of interconnected devices leads to a high probability of information theft and data alteration/manipulation through malicious attacks, leading to incorrect information floating over the network, resulting in misleading analysis. This may result is significant disaster in FOG computing environment resulting in failure of smart city applications like healthcare, smart traffic and many more. So, to over a model is required to identify the behaviors of attacker/malicious node. Many work are been proposed using clustering, game theory, fuzzy logic and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to solve this but they do not consider the spread of infection affecting the other nodes. In this work a pre-predator model to determine the malicious node in the network has been proposed. The model consists prey and predator, where prey consists of infected nodes, whereas predators are malicious objects. In IoT networks, the delay is not the real factor in the spread of infection due to the chaotic nature of the malicious objects. So to overcome this issue, delay differential equation modeling is used. The performance of proposed model is compared with fuzzy logic and game theory based existing models taking into time to detect malicious, rate of infection and Count of infected node detected as performance parameters. Results shows 5% and 8% reduction in number of infected nodes as compared to fuzzy logic and game theory-based approach and reduction of 9% in infection rate.}

abstract = {This paper pursued to evaluate the residents' evaluation on the smart sustainable city and the sense of community. The study analyzed interviews with 392 citizens from five neighboring cities from a micro-region in southern Brazil. Factorial analysis and linear regression were applied. The investigation recognized three factors for smart sustainable cities evaluation: public services and facilities; material well-being, and environmental well-being. Linear regression reveals that residents' satisfaction with the city is predicated on the material well-being, public services and facilities, environmental well-being, and sense of community, which explain 40.2% of satisfaction with the city. Considering a smart sustainable city viewpoint, the study accomplishes that: (i) policies should be projected from the neighborhood standpoint, due to the facility of understanding shared values (ii) sense of community should be included in policies for smart sustainable city; (iii) the design of neighborhoods and cities should prioritize social interactions, with the view to build social capital and facilitate policies implementation. By integrating the smartness to sustainability approaches in the city context, this study intends to contribute to a major discussion on sustainable development, with special attention to residents' evaluation. Finally, the paper offers pertinent outcomes for urban planners and social researchers, by finding factors that influence the sense of community and residents’ evaluation on their city and by offering elements for academic, political and debates.}

This paper examines how authorities involved in such ecosystems coordinate data initiatives from an orchestration perspective. A case study of London's city data initiatives highlights the challenges faced in complex city data environments and the importance of an integrated view. Three elements of orchestration in smart city data ecosystems – namely openness, diffusion and shared vision– are identified as the main enablers of city data initiatives within London's local government authorities. The study contributes to our theoretical understanding of orchestration within data ecosystems, as well as the social and technological impacts of city data.}

The ‘smart city’ concept is linked to an urban research agenda which seeks to embed advances in technology and data collection into the infrastructures of urban environments. Through this neoliberal framework, market-led and technological solutions to city governance and development are prioritised. The urban food movement has a different trajectory compared to the smart city agenda, comprising a diverse mix of urban food production practices, including community and grassroots-based social innovations, and associated more recently with food security discourses. Recognising these ideological and epistemological differences (between the smart city and the urban food movement) is important for conceptualisations of ‘smart food city’ governance. Based on theoretical reflections, review material and findings from a European project on city-region food systems, the paper argues that smart technology can be an important part of the solution to city food challenges but in combination with social innovations to enable flexible modes of governance that are inclusive, technologically and socially-orientated and linked to specific city-region contexts. Key elements include city regionalism, new organisational structures and connectivities, a circular model of metabolism and social practices.}

Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole. The paper ends with a call for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism.}

This urban industrial configuration no longer fits with the value creation principles of the new techno-economic paradigm. In order to overcome this crisis, cities of the future must find suitable trajectories and become smart cities. However, there is no consensus about what really makes a city smarter. What are the elements that a smart city must have in order to offer high quality of life and a prosperous environment for creativity and innovation? This paper aims at disclosing the driving elements that make a city smarter, based on the literature, interviews with experts, and insights from smart cities projects (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lisbon, Vienna). Results show that a smart city is an urban innovation ecosystem where knowledge easily flows from a deliberated interaction and collaboration among different stakeholders to create wealth, supported by a flexible institutional structure, an integrated-participative governance model, a digital-green infrastructure and a functional urban design with diversified amenities and facilities. We conclude that cities, to become smarter, should upgrade the elements related to their different dimensions, which are the techno-economic activity, the environ-urban configuration and the socio-institutional structures in an integrated manner, guided by an integrated and comprehensive governance model.}

To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.}

Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.}

Based on technological innovations, smart cities are complex ecosystems that have the potential to improve urban livability, workability and sustainability through a network of people, processes and data. However, according to academics and urban planners the smart city concept favors technological products and solutions over end users and their quality of life. This perspective calls for an integrated analysis approach that considers the smart city as an organic whole, which encompasses objective and subjective quality of life domains (QOL). This paper aimed to evaluate the perception of quality of life in a smart city and to analyze the main elements of citizens’ satisfaction with their home city. The research analyzed the city of Curitiba, in Southern Brazil, claimed to be a livable, green, and inclusive city and one of the ten smartest cities in the world. Interviews with 400 residents identified four main QOL domains: socio-structural relationships, environmental well-being, material well-being and community integration. The respondents’ overall perception revealed their low satisfaction with the main elements that characterize Curitiba as a smart city. This finding calls for a better understanding of the planning and management of smart cities in conjunction with the QOL elements and their effects on citizens. The research provides some contributions to understand the interconnected facets of QOL domains in the Smart Cities context. From a smart city perspective, the research concludes that success within the domain of smart living can be achieved by providing the four factors revealed by the analysis. According to our results, meeting these criteria of success would improve citizen’s quality of life, creating a stronger community within the city. Finally, the study provides relevant information for social researchers and urban planners by identifying factors that influence QOL perceptions and providing elements for political and academic debate.}

Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) is an ambitious plan by India to create and manage smart cities with sustainable development plans. Under this plan, renewable energy usage plays a substantial role and the selection of appropriate energy options is a complex decision problem with competing criteria. Previous studies on renewable energy selection have paid subtle attention towards criteria interrelationships, managing of linguistic expressions, and relative importance of experts. Therefore, in this study, a new decision making approach is developed. Specifically, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic information (HFLI) is adopted. Then, attitudinal Choquet integral (AC) is proposed under HFLI context along with their fundamental properties. Besides, relative importance of criteria and experts are determined by evidence-based Bayesian approach and variance approach under HFLI context, respectively. A ranking algorithm is presented with the CRITIC technique. Finally, a case study in Tamil Nadu illustrates the usefulness of the integrated framework and the comparison provides grounding for the superiority of the framework.}

Alternatively, during a catastrophic event in the city, smart boxes switch to emergency mode and provide a communication channel to first responders via the redundant overlay network they establish, without requiring any power from the grid. We provide a detailed research map to realize such a conceptual network, both from technology (i.e., communication, hardware) and policy aspects (i.e., institutional and personal policy adoption), including extensive suggestions for assessment of both technical and policy success, and incorporation of non-traditional smart city customers for smart city application data and services like first responders and emergency managers.}

One of the most recent debates in this context is digital citizen participation. This study aimed to identify the potential role of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in citizen participation as a major contributor towards ‘smart sustainable cities’. A systematic and exhaustive literature review, coupled with critical content analysis, was conducted. The focus was on a central research question: What kind of relationship is fostered in the literature between sustainability and digital citizen participation, and how can ICT contribute to social sustainability through digital citizen participation (DCP)? The results suggested a connection between smart sustainable cities and DCP. This article is concluded by emphasizing the role of ICT in citizen participation processes and its significant contribution to social sustainability and the creation of more-than-human smart cities.}

abstract = {Geoinformation and Communication Technology (GeoICT) is being increasingly adopted to foster urban sustainability and smart cities. Despite the burgeoning utilization of GeoICT, the development of frameworks of components and guidelines is still at the infancy. This is due to the fact that GeoICT implementations are guided by contextual factors and there is no one size fits all approach. This paper focuses on the topic of leveraging GeoICT for smart sustainable cities by examining the Saudi Arabian experience using information from the literature, government websites, official documents, newspaper articles and personal interviews. This study reviews the definitions, typologies, and frameworks of implementing GeoICT and smart cities. It highlights case studies of smart city development in Saudi Arabia. A comparison of the Saudi case studies with frameworks and practices found in the literature is presented. This paper concludes with policy implications for Saudi Arabia and lessons for GeoICT and smart city development. It is concluded that local context has an influence on the implementation of smart cities, ICT infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient for developing smart cities and blending top-down with bottom-up approaches is essential.}

The system was simulated, and then the quality performance of image and video obtained by using industrial visual perception technology was processed and analyzed. The results show that in the analysis of image local optimization effect, it is found that the classification performance of all algorithms decreases with the increase of noise, and the performance of local anisotropic mode (LAP) is superior, which has strong robustness to rotation, illumination, and noise. In the analysis of image feature similarity effect, it is found that the chi square distance between Log Gabor features is positively correlated with the degree of image distortion, and the validity of the measurement method is verified. Further analysis of the video processing effect of industrial visual perception technology shows that the video processing effect of test algorithm is significantly better than that of HM16.8 by comparing the distortion performance of the two algorithms with different sequences, with low distortion and significantly improved performance. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the improved CNN algorithm is superior to other algorithms in image and video processing.}

In the 21st century, there has been a shift from sustainability assessment to smart city goals. We analyze 16 sets of city assessment frameworks (eight smart city and eight urban sustainability assessment frameworks) comprising 958 indicators altogether by dividing the indicators under three impact categories and 12 sectors. The following main observations derive from the analyses: as expected, there is a much stronger focus on modern technologies and “smartness” in the smart city frameworks compared to urban sustainability frameworks. Another observation is that as urban sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, smart city frameworks lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects. A general goal of smart cities is to improve sustainability with help of technologies. Thus, we recommend the use of a more accurate term “smart sustainable cities” instead of smart cities. However, the current large gap between smart city and sustainable city frameworks suggest that there is a need for developing smart city frameworks further or re-defining the smart city concept. We recommend that the assessment of smart city performance should not only use output indicators that measure the efficiency of deployment of smart solutions but also impact indicators that measure the contribution towards the ultimate goals such as environmental, economic or social sustainability.}

Based on the SIRS risk contagion model, we describe the transmission process of credit risk between enterprises after the bursting of the stock market with the contagion process, and clarify their diffusion mechanism and effect. The propagation effect of SIRS model in complex network is simulated and analyzed. The results show that when the risk contagion intensity exceeds a certain threshold and the proportion of infected enterprises in the economy exceeds a certain level, it will inevitably lead to the insecurity of the whole economy. In most cases, the policy intervention of the regulatory authorities is necessary. If the crisis is allowed to infect, it is likely to induce the financial risk of the whole system; The construction of smart city credit system can use big data to solve the problem of information island, promote the co construction and sharing of data resources, assist the regulators to effectively prevent and block the transmission of credit risk, and nip the risk in the bud, so as to maintain social stability and economic security.}

While the time seems now ripe to conclude that such policies have a positive impact on urban economic growth, the picture is much less clear when looking at the microfoundations of this effect. In this paper we look at the urban innovation impact of Smart City policies. In fact, typical Smart City projects imply the involvement not only of major multinational corporations, along with local public authorities, but also of local companies, typically with the aim to translate general technological solutions to the local needs. A new data set collected for these analyses comprises data on Smart City features for 309 European metropolitan areas, Smart City policy intensity, and urban innovation outputs. The latter are proxied by calculating total patent applications to the European Patent Office between 2008 and 2013. Patent counts also include technologically narrower classes, namely high-tech, ICT, and specific Smart City technologies patent applications. Propensity Score Matching estimates suggest that cities engaging in Smart City policies above the EU average also tend to patent more intensively. This effect is stronger for high-tech patents, while decreases for more narrowly defined technological classes. This last result suggests possible technological spillovers from technologies directly involved in Smart City policies.}

Despite significant changes in modern data communication systems and devices, the cryptosystems are still the primary option to achieve data security. Several cryptosystems have been developed, implemented and standardized to date. However, there is always a continuous demand for a new cryptosystem for providing security during data communication. In this paper, a novel symmetric cryptosystem is presented for achieving data confidentiality. The proposed cryptosystem is a graph-based system, where an algebraic structure of directed graphs along with a novel operation is defined to provide the base of the cryptosystem. Here, a directed graph represents a plaintext, a ciphertext, and a secret key as well. The defined operation is used for encrypting and decrypting plaintext and ciphertext graphs. The proposed cryptosystem provides a simplified transformation process and representation of plaintext to plaintext graph. The correctness of the proposed cryptosystem is validated, and also shown that the conventional brute-force approach to obtain the key from either plaintext or ciphertext is exponential and this computational time is significantly higher than AES. This implies that the proposed cryptosystem is highly secured against this attack. The proposed cryptosystem is implemented and compared with AES and the results infer that it incurs a marginally higher execution time than the AES for larger plaintext due to the involvement of matrix operations.}

These challenges include important technical questions, but equally important policy and organizational questions. It is important to understand that these policy and technical implementation hurdles are perhaps equally likely to slow or disable smart city implementation efforts. In this paper, a survey of the theoretical and practical challenges and opportunities are enumerated not only in terms of their technical aspects, but also in terms of policy and governance issues of concern.}

By building on a Service-Dominant logic perspective, the study capture how smart city transformation is closely related to a smart market transformation. While prior conceptualizations of markets have followed a linear supply-demand structure, the new market conceptualization can be described as a service ecosystem. The study empirically follows the increased use of renewable energy, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems and their related services, as they are incorporated into smart cities. The results reveal that the overall interaction level among the involved actors increases as the energy market changes from a linear to a networked logic. This transition impacts the market’s information quality and, subsequently, the actors’ level of required knowledge. The study shows that even if the prevailing actors become more informed, information needs to be ‘translated’ into ‘knowledge-in-context’ to become a valuable resource. Thus, the resulting service ecosystem demands a complementary actor that requires the role of a knowledge broker to function. The paper describes the mechanisms behind this smart city transformation and clarifies the broker functions.}
