abstract = {Background: To date, a 10-year follow-up study on complementary and alternative medical treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (LDH) has never been conducted. Therefore, we aimed to perform a prospective 10-year follow-up study on the integrated treatment of LDH in Korea. Methods: One hundred and fifty patients from the baseline study, who initially met the LDH diagnostic criteria with a chief complaint of radiating pain and received integrated treatment, were recruited for this follow-up study. The 10-year follow-up was conducted from February 2018 to March 2018 on pain, disability, satisfaction, quality of life, and changes in herniated disc, muscles, and fat through magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Sixty-five patients were included in this follow-up study. Visual analogue scale score for lower back pain and radiating leg pain were maintained at a significantly lower level than the baseline level. Significant improvements in Oswestry disability index and quality of life were consistently present. MRI confirmed that disc herniation size was reduced over the 10-year follow-up. In total, 95.38% of the patients were either “satisfied” or “extremely satisfied” with the treatment outcomes and 89.23% of the patients claimed their condition “improved” or “highly improved” at the 10-year follow-up. Conclusions: The reduced pain and improved disability was maintained over 10 years in patients with LDH who were treated with nonsurgical Korean medical treatment 10 years ago. Nonsurgical traditional Korean medical treatment for LDH produced beneficial long-term effects, but future large-scale randomized controlled trials for LDH are needed.

abstract = {Background
As the age of our surgical population continues to rise, there is an increased need for adequate preoperative evaluation and risk stratification to ensure the best possible surgical outcomes for patients.
Aim
We sought to describe the 3 main models currently used to evaluate patient frailty and explore how they are being utilized in the field of surgery and sexual medicine.
Methods
We reviewed online resources including Pubmed with relevant search criteria centered around frailty, surgery, sexual medicine, and prosthetics.
Outcomes/Results
All relevant studies were reviewed and several models for patient frailty emerged; the Phenotype Model, the Frailty Index, the Clinical Frailty Scale, and the modified Frailty Index. Worse frailty indices were seen to be linked to higher rates of complications and mortalities postoperatively.
Clinical Implications
Although the adoption of patient frailty in the field of sexual medicine has been sluggish, few studies have shown that its use could help predict which patients are at increased risk of complications and may require more support when it comes to postoperative care and teaching.
Strength & Limitations
Overall there is a paucity of literature as it relates to sexual medicine and patient frailty and this paper provides a limited look at the usage of patient frailty in sexual medicine.
Conclusion
We implore all sexual health providers to begin to incorporate frailty metrics when caring for this population to help reduce postoperative complications and help better predict surgical success.

abstract = {Organ donation and transplantation become complex due to the limited supply of organs and increasing demand of organ donors. Nowadays, development in regenerative medicine or tissue engineering is highly important, and scientists are optimistic about finding a solution to these problems. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis etc. are uncurable diseases. However, until now, no medicine is available, which will cure a cause rather than symptoms for example acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors used in the treatment of PD have symptomatic base of treatments. Altman and Das have proven that neurogenesis takes place in adult human brain, and new neurons are generated. So, stimulation of neurogenesis by using regenerative medicines will be a great therapeutic approach in the treatment of NDs. In short, during neurogenesis, morphogens, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and transcription factors play a very critical role. Stem cells such as native progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells are promising candidates to stimulate neurogenesis process in human brain. These stem cells have the ability to differentiate, proliferate, and finally mature into new neuronal cells into neurons, which integrate into existing brain neuronal network. The currently available animal models have shown promising results during preclinical studies, for example, improvement in motor symptoms after transplantation of brain tissues into PD patient, intravenous injection of human mesenchymal stem cells into mice, which results in an increase in average life of mice. But, there is need to dig deeper into it to bring these technologies into clinical stage to take maximum advantage for saving patient’s life span by curing the cause of disease rather than being symptomatic.}

Recent studies have shown that surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology is promising in this field. In the present study, we propose an SPR-based integrated strategy to screen and analyze the major active components of TCM. We used Radix Paeoniae Alba (RPA) as an example to identify the compounds that can account for its anti-inflammatory mechanism via tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNF-R1). First, RPA extraction was analyzed using an SPR-based screening system, and the potential active ingredients were collected, enriched, and identified as paeoniflorin and paeonol. Next, the affinity constants of paeoniflorin and paeonol were determined as 4.9 and 11.8 μM, respectively. Then, SPR-based competition assays and molecular docking were performed to show that the two compounds could compete with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) while binding to the subdomain 1 site of TNF-R1. Finally, in biological assays, the two compounds suppressed cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by TNF-α in the L929 cell line. These findings prove that SPR technology is a useful tool for determining the active ingredients of TCM at the molecular level and can be used in various aspects of drug development. The SPR-based integrated strategy is reliable and feasible in TCM studies and will shed light on the elucidation of the pharmacological mechanism of TCM and facilitate its modernization.}

With advances in nutrition science research, CPGs increasingly include dietary guidance; however, the degree of consistency in dietary recommendations across CPGs has not been investigated. Using a systematic review approach adapted for meta-epidemiologic research, this study compared dietary guidance from current guidelines developed by governments, major medical professional societies, and large health stakeholder associations owing to their often well-defined and standardized processes for guideline development. CPGs making recommendations for dietary patterns and food groups or components for generally healthy adults or those with prespecified chronic diseases were eligible. Literature from January 2010 to January 2022 was searched in 5 bibliographic databases and augmented by searches in point-of-care resource databases and relevant websites. Reporting followed an adapted PRISMA statement and included narrative synthesis and summary tables. Seventy-eight CPGs for major chronic conditions (autoimmune, 7; cancers, 5; cardiovascular-related, 35; digestive, 11; diabetes, 12; weight-related, 4; or multiple, 3) and general health promotion (n = 1) were included. Nearly, all (91%) made dietary pattern recommendations, and approximately half (49%) endorsed patterns centered on plant foods. Overall, CPGs were most closely aligned in promoting consumption of major plant food groups (vegetables = 74% of CPGs, fruit = 69%, whole grains = 58%), whereas discouraging intake of alcohol (62%) and salt or sodium (56%). CVD and diabetes CPGs were similarly aligned with additional messaging to consume legumes/pulses (60% of CVD CPGs; 75%, diabetes), nuts and seeds (67%, CVD), and low-fat dairy (60%, CVD). Diabetes guidelines discouraged sweets/added sugars (67%) and sweetened beverages (58%). This alignment across CPGs should boost clinician confidence in relaying such dietary guidance to patients in accordance with their relevant CPGs. This trial was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero; PROSPERO 2021) as CRD42021226281.}

These studies have clearly indicated that a rapid resolution of the inflammatory process, mediated by a switch in the macrophage population towards a reparative phenotype, is essential for tissue regeneration to occur. While various biomaterial surfaces have been developed in order to impart immunomodulatory properties to the resulting constructs, an alternative strategy involving the use of reparative biological cues, known as resolvins, is emerging in regenerative medicine. This review reports on the mechanisms via which resolvins participate in the resolution of inflammation and describes their current utilisation in pre-clinical and clinical settings, along with their effectiveness when combined with biomaterial constructs in tissue engineering applications.
Statement of significance
The resolution of the inflammatory process is necessary for achieving tissue healing and regeneration. Resolvins are lipid mediators and play a key role in the resolution of the inflammatory response and can be used in as biological cues to promote tissue regeneration. This review describes the various biological inflammatory mechanisms and pathways involving resolvins and how their action results in a pro-healing response. The use of these molecules in the clinical setting is then summarised for various applications along with their limitations. Lastly, the review focuses on the emergence resolvins in tissue engineering products including the use of a more stable form which holds greater prospect for regenerative purposes.}

The MM–TCMRs exhibited larger specific surfaces and rougher structures with massive spherical particles than those of original residues. They could be separated by adjusting the magnetic field. The phosphate and ammonium adsorption by MM–TCMRs were matched with the pseudo–second–order model, while the Langmuir model yielded the maximum adsorption capacities of 635.35 and 615.57 mg g−1, respectively. Struvite precipitation on the MM–TCMRs surface was the primary removal mechanism with electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange, intra–particle diffusion, and ion exchange also involved. The recyclability of MM–TCMRs confirmed their good structural stability. More importantly, the nutrient–loaded MM–TCMRs enhanced alfalfa growth and improved soil fertility in planting experiments. Collectively, the MM–TCMRs are promising candidates for nutrient removal and recovery from wastewater.}

The morbidity due to CVD in the working population is a great socio-economic concern to India. The most notable risk factors for CVD include an unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, stress, genetics, diabetes, habituation to tobacco, and alcohol overuse. The socio-economic factors, globalization, urbanization, pollution, and an aging population are also the determinants. Despite the advancement in understanding the aetiology, pathophysiology, and development of interventional drugs/therapies the alarming increase in the incidence of CVD are uncontrollable. Most of the population in developing and underdeveloped countries are not able to afford the life-long medications to control the underlying conditions of the disease and/or surgical procedures. Hence, alternative medicines/therapies are of interest to control/manage CVD. As per the 2018 WHO report, 91% of people from South East Asia region including the Indian subcontinent were dependent on traditional and conventional medicines (T & CM); similarly, 87% from the African continent; 80% from the Americas, and 89% from European countries are relying on alternative medicine. Many medicinal plants that are used in the oriental system of medicine and Indian medicines such as Arjuna, (Terminalia arjuna) Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Guggul (Commiphora wightii), Gokshura (Tribulis terrestris), etc., have been used in the patients affected from various set of CVD. The recent surge in usage of medicinal plants for human ailments via indigenous medical systems of India such as Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani resulted in the stabilization of the Ministry of Ayush by the Government of India to regulate and validate the traditional medicines for ailments including CVD. In this chapter, we reviewed the beneficial effects of medicinal plants in addressing CVD.}

In 2016, Belgium launched the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Roadbook, consisting in 10 Actions, across the health care system, to facilitate the uptake of NGS in routine clinical practice. We compiled feedback on deployment of the NGS Roadbook from governmental stakeholders and beneficiaries: health policy makers, insurance providers, pathologists, geneticists, and oncologists.
Main findings
The Roadbook ensured the establishment of a Commission on Personalized Medicine and NGS testing guidelines. A national benchmarking trial ensued, and 10 networks of hospitals and laboratories adopted a reimbursement convention with the Belgian Health Insurance Agency. The Healthdata.be platform centralizes the collection of NGS metrics, and citizens were consulted on their views about NGS and genomics.
Conclusion
The Roadbook facilitated the implementation of NGS in routine (hemato-)oncology care in Belgium. Some challenges remain linked to data sharing and access by a wider range of stakeholders. Next steps include continuous monitoring of health outcomes and the budgetary impact.}

abstract = {Introduction
The Himalayan region possesses a vast diversity of medicinal plants for ethnodermatological use. There is increasing scientific interest regarding the chemical, microbiological and clinical evidence. The aim of the present review is to compile fragmented literature on ethnodermatology, anti-dermatophytic activities of the Himalayan flora, their active phytoconstituents and to discover gaps in the research for further studies that may provide targeted drug development.
Methodology
Relevant literature between the years 1990–2021 was searched using online databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Google scholar and Research Gate. About 200 research papers were downloaded. Among them, only 49 papers were reviewed, which were published in English and contain maximum information on Himalayan medicinal plants being tested in-vitro against the selected dermatophytes and their inhibitory activity was mentioned in number.
Results
The knowledge of medicinal plants in the Himalayan region has great potential to cure skin infections. Activity of plant species were reported against eight selected dermatophytes of Trichophyton and Microsporum genera. Root extract of Coleus forskohlii has shown potent inhibition zones (10–25 mm) against Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum gypseum. Phytochemical investigation of these plants showed a variety of secondary metabolites, such as saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids and iridoid. Except for α-Pinene and δ-3-Carene extracted from Juniperus communis, the rest of the compounds were not tested directly against dermal fungi. T. rubrum has been reported to be the most tested pathogen in in vitro studies. Scarce data is available on the mode of action of the plant extracts or their active compounds against dermal fungi.
Conclusions
It is concluded that very scarce literature has been found on the toxicity level, isolation of pure compounds and their mechanism of action for these traditionally used plant species. Thus, the authors invite the attention of chemists, pharmacists and pharmacologists to further explore anti-dermatophytic plants for the isolation of pure compounds, mechanism of action and development of targeted drugs or medicines from most effective compounds against dermatomycosis.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) CFF-1 has been used in clinic for prostate cancer therapy in China. We reported before CFF-1 induced cell apoptosis via suppressing EGFR-related pathways, reminding us its potential role associated with antitumor immunity.
Purpose
The study was aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of CFF-1 on PD-L1/PD-1-mediated tumor immune escape.
Methods
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and the functional assessment of cancer therapy-prostate (FACT-P) and karnosky performance status (KPS) questionnaires were carried out to evaluate patient’ condition before and after therapy. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used for analyzing cell apoptosis, T lymphocyte subsets and cell cycle. Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to measure protein expressions. The synergy of drug combination was assessed by calculating combination index (CI).
Results
CFF-1 obviously decreased PSA and improved the quality of life in patients with advanced prostate cancer. PD-L1 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cells including LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3, DU145 and RM-1. PD-1/PD-L1 was upregulated in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of subcutaneous homograft mouse model with immune response, where CD3+ T cell subsets were declined. CFF-1 inhibited PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer cells in a time/dose-dependent manner and blocked tumor growth by suppressing PD-1/PD-L1 upregulation to promote the recovery of CD3+ T lymphocytes, especially CD4+ T cell subset, accompanied by the downregulation of CD4+ FOXP3+ T cell subset. CFF-1 also prolonged the survival and inhibited lung metastasis in tail vein prostate cancer mouse model while repressing PD-1/PD-L1. CFF-1 in combination with docetaxol (DTX) produced a synergistic effects by sensitizing the inhibitory effect of DTX on JAK1/STAT3 pathway targeting PD-L1 blockade.
Conclusion
CFF-1 inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis by blocking PD-1/PD-L1 to ameliorate T lymphocyte immune response through EGFR/JAK1/STAT3 pathway, suggesting that CFF-1 might be a promising treatment to resist tumor immunosuppression for prostate cancer patients.}

abstract = {Background
While progress has been made on communication skills training for clinicians, gaps exist in how to best monitor, measure, and evaluate the implementation of communication skills in the actual clinical setting and provide timely feedback about effectiveness and quality.
Methods
This 1-year, multi-phase, proof-of-concept study aims to design and pilot test ‘CommSense,’ a novel wearable sensing system and associated natural language processing algorithms. Our team leverages disciplinary expertise from nursing, engineering, medicine, and library science. CommSense will be deployed on mobile devices (e.g., smartwatches) with the goal to reliably extract key markers of communication quality from real-time patient-clinician palliative care interactions. In Phase 1 (completed) we conducted a thorough review of the literature to develop an evidence-based list of quality communication metrics and determined how these metrics could be best operationalized. Phases 2 and 3 (in-progress) will involve design of the CommSense system and pilot testing with simulated clinical scenarios to assess fidelity of data capture and extraction of desired metrics.
Findings
We identified 96 articles from relevant databases in consultation with a health sciences librarian; 18 articles were added based on expert opinion. After screening article titles and abstracts (n=114) for relevance, 72 articles were selected for full-text extraction and independently reviewed by 2 members of our clinical team. We used a ‘talk-aloud’ thematic analysis approach to develop a list of 7 core communication metrics (5 verbal; 2 non-verbal) with associated strategies for operationalization.
Discussion
Clinician-patient communication is complex and determining appropriate metrics for evaluation is challenging. We propose a core set of communication ‘best practices’ that can be extracted from conversations using the CommSense technology. The long-term goal of this research is to deploy CommSense in a variety of healthcare contexts to provide real-time feedback to end-users to improve communication and patient-centered health outcomes.}

abstract = {Recently, regenerative therapy research has attracted much attention using adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) and adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (ASVF) cells. Treatments using AMSCs and ASVF cells are also being actively investigated concerning the musculoskeletal system, including studies related to bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, tendons, meniscus, and nerves. ASVF cell and AMSC therapies are excellent alternatives for treatment, especially in osteochondral regeneration. However, further clinical trials are needed in the other areas of treatment, requiring that the nonresponder group be the target group and be compared with the responder group, rather than the placebo group, as the control group. In addition, future studies are needed to investigate the appropriate dosages of ASVF cells and AMSCs for specific treatments, how frequently these treatments should be applied, and where these cells grow. The focus will continue to be on ASVF cell and AMSC therapies for the musculoskeletal system.}

Nevertheless, the development of 3D medicines by fused deposition modeling (FDM) is still based on a trial-and-error method. Hence, this work designed a short and sensitive protocol based on oscillatory rheology and mechanical evaluation to assess hot-melt extrusion filaments viscoelastic behavior, define the ideal printing parameters, and predict their repercussions on the developed 3D tablets. For this purpose, polyvinyl alcohol filaments were produced using different plasticizer concentrations (glycerin) and subsequently printed on two different FDM 3D printers. The increase in plasticizer ratio (≥30%) enhanced viscous deformation, resulting in too flexible materials that are inappropriate for printing. On the other hand, filaments with 10–20% of plasticizer have adequate viscosity (close to 0.8 kPa·s), homogeneous diameter, and appropriate resistance to extensional force, resulting in suitable filaments to be pulled by the gear, flow through the nozzle, and build adequate 3D structures. Therefore, viscoelasticity and tensile strength measurements could anticipate problems in printability, possible printing errors, and instabilities of 3D medicines, which may ultimately increase drug product performance.}

abstract = {Background
The method of photodynamic therapy for skin rejuvenation (PDT-SR) provides an improvement in appearance with a safe and painless effect. The quality of treatment is most often assessed subjectively. The most informative morphological control methods are rarely used due to the invasiveness of the sampling procedure.
Aim
This study aimed to find out the possibility of using skin autofluorescence spectroscopy (SAF) for an objective assessment of changes occurring in the skin during PDT-SR.
Methods
This study included 12 volunteers (10 women, 2 men) aged 32 to 79 years. Two (n = 6) or three (n = 6) PDT sessions were performed at intervals of 13–30 days. Photosensitizer chlorin e6, exposure 20 min, energy density 18–24 J/cm2 were used. SAF spectra were recorded using a two-wavelength fiber optic spectrometer under excitation at wavelengths (λex) of 365 nm and 440 nm. Measurements were made both before and after each PDT session and up to 25–238 days from the start of treatment. For the evaluation, we used the spectra AF365(λ) and AF440(λ) averaged over 40 points corrected for diffuse reflection at λex=440 nm in the range λem= 460–700 nm, as well as the spectra of the ratios AFN365(λ) and AFN440(λ), which were obtained by dividing the intensities of the current spectra by the intensities collected before PDT-SR.
Results
PDT-SR led to changes in both the intensity and shape of the spectra. Analysis of the spectra using numerical fitting of the spectra showed that the main changes can be explained by changes in the content of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), as well as lipofuscin-like lipopigments (LPs) and porphyrins (PPs). The spectra of AGEs upon excitation at wavelengths of 365 and 440 nm differ, which may be due to the formation of two types of bonds, with collagen and elastin. By the end of the study, the vast majority of the examined volunteers showed a significant decrease of the parameters characterizing both of these types of AGEs, AGE365 (0.56–1.2) and AGE440 (0.58–1.01), relative to the beginning of the study. In most cases, a decrease was also noted for LPs and PPs. AGE365 and AGE440 were positively correlated with the age of the volunteers (r2 = 0.26–0.46 %). A steady decrease in the content of AGEs occurred approximately on the 40th day.
Conclusion
SAF spectroscopy makes it possible to assess changes in the content of AGEs, LPs, and PPs in the skin during PDT-SR. The method has great potential for non-invasive monitoring of the treatment process, as well as its improvement, including through its personalization. In addition, the method can be used to study the mechanisms of age-related skin changes at the molecular level and to study the processes of rejuvenation.}

abstract = {Background
Depression is a common mental disorder characterized by persistent sadness and lack of interest or pleasure in previously rewarding or enjoyable activities. Understandably, the causes of depression are complex. Nevertheless, the understanding of depression pathophysiology has progressed considerably and numerous studies indicate that hippocampal neurogenesis plays a pivotal role. However, no drugs specifically targeting hippocampal neurogenesis yet exist. Meanwhile, the effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on hippocampal neurogenesis have received increasing attention in the field of antidepressant treatment because of its multi-ingredient, multi-target, and holistic view. However, the effects and mechanisms of TCM on hippocampal neurogenesis in clinical trials and pharmaceutical studies remain to be comprehensively delineated.
Purpose
To summarize the importance of hippocampal neurogenesis in depression and illustrate the targets and mechanisms of hippocampal neurogenesis regulation that underlie the antidepressant effects of TCM.
Method
A systematic review of clinical trials and studies ending by January 2022 was performed across eight electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, SciFinder, Research Gate, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus and China Knowledge Infrastructure) according to the PRISMA criteria, using the search terms ‘traditional Chinese medicine’ “AND” ‘depression’ “OR” ‘hippocampal neurogenesis’ “OR” ‘multi-ingredient’ “OR” ‘multi-target’.
Results
Numerous studies show that hippocampal neurogenesis is attenuated in depression, and that antidepressants act by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, compound Chinese medicine (CCM), Chinese meteria medica (CMM), and major bioactive components (MBCs) can promote hippocampal neurogenesis exerting antidepressant effects through modulation of neurotransmitters and receptors, neurotrophins, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory factors, autophagy, and gut microbiota.
Conclusion
We have comprehensively summarized the effect and mechanism of TCM on hippocampal neurogenesis in depression providing a unique perspective on the use of TCM in the antidepressant field. TCM has the characteristics and advantages of multiple targets and high efficacy, showing great potential in the field of depression treatment.}

abstract = {Background
Quality marker (Q-marker) serves an important role in promoting the standardization of the quality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions. However, discovering comprehensive and representative Q-markers from TCM prescriptions composed of multiple components remains difficult.
Purpose
A three-step-based novel strategy integrating drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) with network pharmacology and bioactivity evaluation was proposed to discover the Q-markers and applied to a research example of Danlou tablet (DLT), a famous TCM prescription with remarkable and reliable clinical effects for coronary heart disease (CHD).
Methods
Firstly, the metabolic profile in vivo of DLT was systemically characterized, and the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of PK markers were then investigated. Secondly, an integrated network of “PK markers – CHD targets – pathways – therapeutic effects” was established to screen out the crucial PK markers of DLT against CHD. Thirdly, the crucial PK markers that could exhibit strong myocardial protection activity in the H9c2 cardiomyocyte model were selected as the candidate Q-markers of DLT. According to the proportion of their Cmax value in vivo, the candidate Q-markers were configured into a composition; the bioactivity was then evaluated to confirm their synergistic effect and justify their usage as Q-markers.
Results
First of all, a total of 110 DLT-related xenobiotics (35 prototypes and 75 metabolites) were detected in bio-samples, and the pharmacokinetic properties of 13 PK markers of DLT were successfully characterized, revealing the quality transitivity and traceability from prescription to in vivo. Then, 6 crucial PK markers with three topological features (degree, betweenness, and closeness) greater than the average values in the pharmacology network were screened out as the key components of DLT against CHD. Furthermore, among these 6 crucial PK markers, 5 components (puerarin, alisol A, daidzein, paeoniflorin, and tanshinone IIA) with strong myocardial protection activity were chosen as the candidate Q-markers to constitute a new composition. The composition activated the expression of the PI3K/AKT pathway and exhibited strong myocardial protection activity, and the effective concentrations (nM level) of these components in the composition were significantly lower than their individually effective concentrations (μM level), indicating that there was a certain synergistic effect between them. Hence, the 5 components with multiple properties, including testability, quality transitivity and traceability from prescription to in vivo, effectiveness, and compatibility contribution, were defined as comprehensive and representative Q-markers of DLT.
Conclusion
This study not only presented a novel idea for the revelation of comprehensive and representative Q-markers in quality control research of TCM prescriptions, but also identified the reasonable Q-markers of DLT for the first time to improve the quality control level of DLT.}

abstract = {Objective
To know the current status of the technique of radioguided localisation of non-palpable breast lesions with or without indication for selective sentinel node biopsy -ROLL, SNOLL and 125I seeds- by conducting a national survey developed by the Working Group on Radioguided Surgery (GTCRG) of the Spanish Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SEMNIM).
Material and methods
In October 2020, the form was sent in digital format to the different nuclear medicine services in Spain. A response time of 2 months with an overtime of 15 days was given. The number of ROLL/SNOLL procedures in each centre and the methodology used were obtained, including important technical details. In addition, a specific section on 125I seeds was included. The results were automatically downloaded into an Excel 2007 spreadsheet for subsequent analysis with the same program.
Results
The survey was answered by 55 centres; 21 use wire-guided localisation while the remaining 34 use different radioguided surgery techniques (RGS) for the localisation of non-palpable breast lesions, with the results itemized into thirteen sections. The commonly used tracer dose is 111 MBq for the ROLL technique and 222 MBq for the SNOLL technique, with a volume of 0.2 ml. The most common protocol is the two-day protocol. 26% of centres performing CRG use 125I seeds for both breast lesion and suspicious/pathological node detection, with the time between implantation and removal being about 3 days, with subsequent radiological control in most cases.
Conclusion
The survey shows the relevance of radioguided surgery in the management of breast cancer patients at different stages of the disease, with disparity in the implementation of new techniques and tools, which responds to the multiple healthcare realities of Nuclear Medicine services.
Resumen
Objetivo
Conocer el estado actual de la técnica de localización radioguiada de lesiones no palpables de mama con o sin indicación de biopsia selectiva de ganglio centinela —ROLL, SNOLL y semillas de 125I— mediante la realización de una encuesta nacional elaborada por el Grupo de Trabajo de Cirugía Radioguiada (GTCRG) de la Sociedad Española de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular (SEMNIM).
Material y métodos
En octubre del 2020 se envió la encuesta, en formato digital, a los distintos servicios de Medicina Nuclear de nuestra geografía. Se dio un tiempo de respuesta de 2 meses con prórroga de 15 días. Se ha obtenido el número de procedimientos ROLL/SNOLL de cada centro y la metodología utilizada, recogiendo importantes detalles técnicos. Además, se ha incluido un apartado específico sobre las semillas de 125I. Los resultados se volcaron de forma automática en una hoja de cálculo Excel 2007 para su posterior análisis con el mismo programa.
Resultados
La encuesta fue contestada por 55 centros; 21 utilizan arpón mientras que los 34 restantes emplean distintas técnicas de cirugía radioguiada (CRG) para la localización de lesiones no palpables de mama, desglosando los resultados en 13 apartados. La dosis de trazador habitualmente utilizada es de 111 MBq para la técnica ROLL y de 222 MBq para la técnica SNOLL, con un volumen de 0,2 ml. El protocolo más habitual es el de 2 días. El 26% de los centros que realiza CRG utiliza semillas de 125I tanto para la detección de lesiones mamarias como de ganglios sospechosos/patológicos, siendo el tiempo entre la implantación y la extirpación es de unos 3 días, con posterior control radiológico en la mayoría de los casos.
Conclusión
La encuesta pone de manifiesto la relevancia de la cirugía radioguiada en el manejo de los pacientes con cáncer de mama en las diferentes etapas de la enfermedad, con disparidad en la implementación de las nuevas técnicas y herramientas, que responde a las múltiples realidades asistenciales de los servicios de Medicina Nuclear.}

abstract = {Objectives: New approvals for upfront maintenance therapy with PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer necessitate efficient germline genetic testing and Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) testing within several months of diagnosis to aid in consideration of PARP inhibitors for frontline maintenance treatment. Despite being recommended for all newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer cases, national rates of germline genetic testing are approximately 30%1. The testing process can be overly manual, prone to delays and missed opportunities for timely PARP initiation. Completion of testing often involves multiple steps, including the use of different testing companies, without a clear way to track patients’ progress in the process. A previous trial aimed at applying novel healthcare innovation techniques to this problem was conducted to identify the optimal approach to improve germline and somatic tumor testing rates in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients2. Based on the results of this trial, we developed and implemented an interactive precision medicine dashboard for tracking germline and HRD testing pathway completion tracking and PARP inhibitor prescribing. Methods: After previously conducting four pilots trialing various behavioral economic interventions2, it was determined that the development of an interactive dashboard would be the most effective solution to improve genetic testing completion and timely PARP delivery. We first implemented automation and choice architecture utilizing the EMR to surface missing clinical information while removing the provider’s mental burden of the work required to complete necessary testing. We then developed the “PreAct: Precision Medicine Activated” Dashboard to filter patients by priority status, clear identification of patient data, interactive notes, and data report- ing3. After the initial implementation of the dashboard, delays were noted in time to HRD testing for germline negative patients; thus, reflex HRD testing was initiated in an effort to further streamline the process. Results: After implementation, our genetic testing rates increased from 65% to 94%. We improved our time to genetic testing from a range of 100-150 days in 2019 to 20 days. Potential trends in racial disparities were identified, with 70% of current patients who missed testing being identified as Black. Given the utility of PreAct, this dashboard is being expanded to other disease sites, including abnormal somatic testing in colon/uterine cancer and metastatic breast cancer. Conclusions: The development of an interactive dashboard improves rates of genetic testing for ovarian cancer and aids in the facilitation of timely PARP initiation when applicable. The precision medicine dashboard automates work to reduce the cognitive burden for clinicians. An innovative “concierge approach” to assist patients who have missed testing could be used to “rescue” patients that have fallen off the pathway, as we have previously tested and demonstrated this method to be effective in moving patients forward in germline testing. Potential racial disparities need further exploration to ensure equitable and applicable solutions to all patients.}

Generally low uptake in the advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) market and difficult patient access has been observed across Europe. The objective is to analyze the key challenges of the ATMP innovation ecosystem around R&D, entrepreneurial activities, framework conditions and legitimacy and to highlight how national level activities can impact on patient access to ATMPs in Sweden and Germany.
Methods
An exploratory case studies approach was applied for analyzing ATMP development and uptake in Sweden and Germany between 2010 and 2021. A mixed methods and multi-level approach was used to collect data, including desktop research and 17 expert interviews.
Results
Germany is performing well and apart from better patients' engagement has lower barriers for ATMP development and diffusion compared to Sweden. The main hindrances in Sweden include a lack of collaboration between stakeholders in translational research, conservative HTA assessment and lack of innovative payment models. Both countries could benefit from better streamlined regulation on different aspects around clinical trials (i.e. ranging from legislation on genetically modified organisms for gene therapy medicinal products and master file approach for raw materials).
Conclusions
Despite a number of hindrances around ATMP development and uptake, the evidence in terms of technological development on the one side and unmet patient needs on the other side, shows that ATMPs will play an important role in the future of modern healthcare systems. It is clear that further national level collaboration between academic, clinical and industrial players is necessary to overcome the existing hindrances and boost further development of ATMPs in Europe.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Over 50 million adults in China suffer from angina pectoris, which are often treated with traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs). However, the efficacies of TCMIs and conventional drugs as determined by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were not rigorously compared with one another by network meta-analysis (NMA). This PRISMA-compliant NMA aimed to compare the efficacy and assess the evidence strengths of 24 TCMIs in treating adults with angina pectoris of RCTs.
Materials and methods
Following the protocol (PROSPERO registration number CRD42018117720), the RCTs that compared any TCMI with another TCMI or conventional drug on outcome measures including symptomatic and electrocardiography improvements were included. The quality of included RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane's risk of bias 2 tool. Frequentist statistical analyses were performed, including NMA, pairwise meta-analysis (PMA), subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias analysis. The certainty of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.
Results
Totally, 556 eligible RCTs with 57015 participants were identified while the quality of all but five included RCTs was poor. The significant efficacy estimates and insignificant heterogeneity assessment from PMA and NMA indicated that nearly all TCMIs were more efficacious than conventional treatments for angina pectoris. Adequate subgroup and sensitivity analyses found the robust and consistent results. However, the evidence strengths of meta-analyses were assessed as very low to low due to the high risk of RCTs. The comprehensive efficacy estimates suggested that 4 TCMIs (HH, Honghua injection; HHH, Honghua Huangsesu injection; GLP, Gualoupi injection; and SM, Shenmai injection) was the best anti-anginal drugs for adults with angina pectoris.
Conclusion
TCMIs appear to be efficacious for angina pectoris, although evidence evaluation of high-quality RCTs of TCMIs would be necessary. In particular, randomization and blinding procedures of the RCTs should be explicated to meet the CONSORT requirements.}

Unlike the general medical approach, personalized medicine suggests more effective and patient-oriented treatments at different levels, which accounts for specific needs and characteristics of the patient. Furthermore, healthcare providers can significantly increase their efficiency by customizing treatment strategies, predicting treatment outcomes more precisely, and minimizing the risks of failures. Main medical applications that involve 3D bioprinting technology can be arranged into three categories: (1) 3D bioprinting of vascularized organs and tissues in vitro, (2) in situ bioprinting and, (3) 3D in vitro tissue models. Various constructs have already been successfully produced using 3D technology, including printing of cells, blood vessels, cartilages, bones, bandages, corneas, liver tissues for drug tests, and customized drugs. The recent advances in 3D human tissues and organs modeling allowed numerous studies on infection’s mechanisms and effects of different therapeutic agents and drugs on 3D-printed human tissues. For the past decade, several successful cases of fabrication functional organs using 3D printing technologies have been reported. In parallel with in vitro 3D bioprinting technology, in situ 3D printing directly onto the defect site is developing rapidly. Recent studies have demonstrated that in situ 3D printing provides a powerful technological solution, which is expected to become a routine in various clinical applications and personalized medical treatments.}

Even if DTC mortality is quite low mainly among patients with low or lower intermediate risk cancer, the number of patients who suffer of persistent or recurrent disease is not negligible, also in the so-called low risk DTC patients. To date, total thyroidectomy is the surgical approach of choice while the use of Iodine-131 therapy (RaIT) had been reduced according to 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines. However, 2015 ATA recommendations were proposed in spite of the presence of conflicting data, controversy and significant differences in clinical real life practice, mainly regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic use of radioiodine (RAI). More recently, the concept of postoperative disease assessment not only based on histopathological results but considering clinical, molecular, laboratory and imaging data has been introduced. It should be standardized and integrated into routine care to optimize DTC management and improve patients’ selection for radioiodine therapy. Accordingly, the goal of RaIT should be characterized as follows: thyroid remnant ablation; adjuvant treatment and treatment of known metastases. This chapter is aimed to provide an updated overview on clinical management in real life, diagnostic and therapeutic use of radioiodine.}

abstract = {Background/Aims: Despite the advancement in risk-directed, chemotherapy-based protocols, the prognosis of children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) especially for those who were refractory to existing treatments or relapsed from remissions remains poor. The complexity of mutational landscape and lack of actionable genomic lesions collectively pose significant challenges for implementing targeted therapies based solely on genomics. To address this issue, this study seeks to utilize drug sensitivity and resistance test (DSRT) to directly assess the ex vivo response of primary T-lymphoblasts to a portfolio of targeted agents, aiming to establish its drug sensitivity profile and identify drug candidates of immediate clinical relevance to tailor functional precision medicine. Methods: A serum-free, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based culture system was adopted to perform ex vivo DSRT on primary or patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples of pediatric T-ALL. The latter was generated by transplanting NSG mice with paucicellular specimens with splenocytes collected at leukemia engraftment as the sources of patient-derived T-lymphoblasts. The 42-drug panel consisted of 35 targeted agents (1 in Phase I trials, 6 in Phase II trials, 6 in Phase III trials, 22 FDA-approved) and 7 standard chemotherapeutics. The DSRT tested six serial drug concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 nM. After 96 hours of co-culturing with MSCs, T lymphoblasts were identified by CD7 staining, while apoptotic cells were characterized by Annexin V/7-AAD. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of individual drugs were curated from the dose-response curves. Unsupervised clustering was performed to map the overall drug response pattern. A case series of relapsed or refractory T-ALL were managed with targeted therapies guided by drug profiling results and evaluated for clinical responses. Results: DSRT was conducted on 19 primary and 14 PDX pediatric T-ALL samples from 20 patients. For primary samples, two had been tested for 42 drugs, ten were tested for 16 drugs and the rest underwent testing with varying numbers of drugs depending on cellularity and sample quality. All PDX samples were subjected to testing for 42 drugs. PDX samples retained the original pattern of drug response in matched patient materials (R 2 = 0.77-0.94, 8 paired samples). Unsupervised clustering identified 5 distinct groups of drug response: (i) highly active compounds with median IC50 <10 nM (4 drugs including the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfizomib, BCL2 inhibitor navitoclax and HDAC inhibitor panobinostat); (ii) generally active compounds (median IC50 <230 nM, 10 drugs), including BCL2 inhibitors, MCL1 inhibitors, JAK2/3 inhibitors and MDM2 inhibitors; (iii) compounds with bimodal activities (wide IC50 ranges, 4 drugs), including dasatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), sirolimus and everolimus (mTOR inhibitors) and standard chemotherapeutics; (iv) generally inactive drugs with sporadic exceptions (12 drugs); and (v) completely inactive compounds (12 drugs). Four children with T-ALL received treatment according to drug profiling results. Two patients were in first relapse, one in third relapse and one in a non-remission state. Three of these patients received bortezomib treatment, while the fourth patient received venetoclax. All patients responded to the treatments with complete or partial remission. One patient was bridged to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and two were bridged to CD7-directed CAR therapies. Conclusions: Our study unveiled a pediatric-specific drug response profile for T-ALL and highlighted opportunistic drug candidates with clinical relevance. The successful implementation of functional precision medicine in our clinic elucidated its practicality and potential to enable personalized treatment for high-risk pediatric T-ALL.}

abstract = {Objectives
In our first study, the data collected from the public database showed the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Oral Medicine (OM) practice in Brazil, with a deficit of -65.59% appointments during the first pandemic period. In this way, this study aimed to compare the number of OM appointments from the first half of the pandemic with second half so as to update the data and verify if measures to return to clinical activities were effective in the subsequent months.
Study Design
A descriptive analysis of data extracted from the public database of the Brazilian Ministry of Health was performed.
Results
There was an increase in the number of OM appointments in the second half of the pandemic throughout Brazil (+64.2%), representing more 9,235 appointments during this period. After the second half of the pandemic, even with the increase in COVID-19 cases caused by the second wave, the number of OM appointments remained stable.
Conclusion
These positive numbers can be explained by the several movements that began after lockdown in the 1st half of 2020 in order to return to in-person health care, following strict hygiene and safety protocols against the dissemination of COVID-19.}

Clinical procedures in a Nuclear Medicine Department produce radioactive liquid and solid waste. Regarding waste release into the environment from an authorised hospital, it is mandatory to verify the compliance with European Directive 2013/59/EURATOM, adopted by the Italian Government via the Legislative Decree 101/2020.
Methods
Different activity release pathways into the environment from Trieste Nuclear Medicine Department have been analysed: liquid waste from patients’ excreta discharged by sewage treatment system into the sea, and atmospheric releases following solid waste incineration. Reference models, provided by NCRP and IAEA guidelines, have been implemented to assess the impact of the discharged radioactivity for coastal waters and atmospheric transport conditions. Finally, an accidental fire event occurring in Radiopharmacy Laboratories has been simulated by HotSpot software.
Results
Advanced screening models give an effective dose to population of 5.3 · 10−3 µSv/y and 1.4 · 10−4 µSv/y for introduction by sewage system into coastal waters and atmospheric releases by the incinerator, respectively. Workers involved in the maintenance of the sewage treatment plant receive a total annual effective dose of 3.8 µSv/y, while for incinerator staff the total annual exposure is 5.9 · 10−8 µSv/y. For the accidental fire event the maximum total effective dose to an individual results 3.8 · 10−8 Sv with mild wind, and 4.1 · 10−7 Sv with strong wind.
Conclusions
The total annual effective doses estimated to representative person, due to both Nuclear Medicine authorised clinical practices and in case of an accidental fire event, are in compliance with regulatory stipulations provided by Directives.}

Ayurveda promotes restoration of the innate healing mechanisms existing in the body for optimal immunity, resilience, and health. Ayurveda also has an abundant resource of botanical products containing diverse pharmaco-active ingredients and millennia of experience of clinical applications for health benefits. But there is a lack of evidence–based research to demonstrate its efficacy and potential. This 2-part review is written from the perspective of a western-trained biomedical scientist and student of Ayurveda. It aims to educate research scientist peers about the opportunities and challenges for scientific validation of Ayurvedic herbal compounds, protocols, and modalities and inspire more research in this area. Part 1 will review several aspects of Ayurveda including principles of body constitution (Prakriti), digestion (Agni and Ama) and mind-body health, in relation to cancer. Part 2 [1] will focus on Ayurvedic botanical resources used for cancer and research studies will be discussed on selected herbal compounds. Research gaps and opportunities will be identified to guide development of research programs to validate safety and efficacy of these therapies. Importantly, the use of Ayurvedic modalities is not intended to substitute for allopathic treatments for cancer but as an integrative component for prevention and restoration of strength and immunity post treatment.}

Systematically review parental perceptions of shared decision-making (SDM) in neonatology, identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation.
Methods
Electronic database (Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Scopus) and follow-up searches were conducted to identify qualitative studies. Data were extracted, thematically analysed and synthesised.
Results
Searches yielded 2445 papers, of which 25 were included. Thematic analysis identified six key themes. Key barriers included emotional crises experienced in the NICU setting, lack of medical information provided to parents to inform decision-making, inadequate communication of information, poor relationships with caregivers, lack of continuity in care, and perceived power imbalances between HCPs and parents. Key facilitators included clear, honest and compassionate communication of medical information, caring and empathetic caregivers, continuity in care, and tailored approaches that reflected parent’s desired level of involvement.
Conclusion
The highly specialised environment, and the emotional crises experienced by parents impact significantly on their perceived capacity to engage in surrogate decision-making.
Practice Implications
Complex and multi-factorial interventions that address the training needs of HCPs, and the emotional, informational and decision support needs of parents are needed. SDM skills training, improved information delivery, and integrated emotional and decisional support could help parents to become more involved in SDM for their infant.}

Nutmeg-5, which consists of Myristica fragrans Houtt., Aucklandia lappa Decne., Inula helenium L., Fructus Choerospondiatis and Piper longum L., is an ancient and classic formula in traditional Mongolian medicine that is widely used in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. However, its material basis and pharmacological mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study was to explore the potential material basis and molecular mechanism of Nutmeg-5 in improving cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI).
Materials and methods
The constituents of Nutmeg-5 absorbed into the blood were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A mouse MI model was induced in male Kunming mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LDA) ligation. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. The protective effect of Nutmeg-5 and compound Danshen dripping pills as positive control medicine on post-MI cardiac remodeling was evaluated by tissue histology and determination of the serum protein levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury. RNA sequencing analysis of mouse left ventricle tissue was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of Nutmeg-5 in cardiac remodeling after MI.
Results
A total of 27 constituents absorbed into blood were identified in rat plasma following gavage administration of Nutmeg-5 (0.54 g/kg) for 1 h. We found that ventricular remodeling after MI was significantly improved after Nutmeg-5 treatment in mice, which was demonstrated by decreased mortality, better cardiac function, decreased heart weight to body weight and heart weight to tibia length ratios, and attenuated cardiac fibrosis and myocardial injury. RNA sequencing revealed that the protective effect of Nutmeg-5 on cardiac remodeling after MI was associated with improved heart metabolism. Further study found that Nutmeg-5 treatment could preserve the ultrastructure of mitochondria and upregulate gene expression related to mitochondrial function and structure. HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit) expression was significantly upregulated in the hearts of MI mice and significantly suppressed in the hearts of Nutmeg-5-treated mice. In addition, Nutmeg-5 treatment significantly activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha signaling pathway, which was inhibited in the hearts of MI mice.
Conclusions
Nutmeg-5 attenuates cardiac remodeling after MI by improving heart metabolism and preserving mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting HIF-1α expression in the mouse heart after MI.}

abstract = {Introduction
The benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown in multiple large randomized clinical trials across the spectrum of heart failure (HF) regardless of the ejection fraction (EF) and diabetic status. Despite these data, there is still an observable discrepancy in the prescription rates in the inpatient and outpatient settings. In this study, we examined the SGLT2i prescription rates within a single internal medicine resident-run teaching clinic that serves a diverse and vulnerable patient population in the Bronx, NY, USA.
Methods
Using an electronic health record registry, we identified patients with a history of HF who were seen by a primary care provider at the Wakefield Ambulatory Care Center from December 2022 to March 2023. We excluded patients with an estimated GFR <30 ml/min, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and documented allergic reactions to SGLT2i. SGLT2i prescription rates were assessed based on various subcategories, including race, ethnicity, language, presence of diabetes, ejection fraction, presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and insurance. Chi-Square test was utilized for the comparison of independent variables.
Results
One hundred seventy-three patients met the inclusion criteria. The median (IQR) age was 67 (53-80) years, and 46% were females. Most patients were Non-Hispanic Black (50%), followed by Hispanic (37%), Non-Hispanic White (11%), and 15% had a preferred language of Spanish. Comorbid diabetes was observed in 53% of patients; 38% had CKD Stage 3, and 37% had an EF ≤50%. Patients with commercial insurance were more frequently prescribed an SGLT2i (41%) compared to Medicaid (28%) and Medicare (17%, p=0.05). The SGLT2i prescription rate was higher in patients with diabetes (32%) compared to those without diabetes (17%, p=0.04) and trended higher in patients with an EF ≤50% (32%) compared to EF ≥50% (20%, p=0.08). No difference in prescription rates was observed by sex, race, ethnicity, language, or CKD stage.
Conclusions
In a medically underserved and complex population, SGLT2i are underutilized in the primary care setting. Our study demonstrated higher prescription rates in patients with comorbid diabetes and commercial insurance. Further investigations are needed to evaluate primary care providers' barriers to SGLT2i prescription to overcome clinical inertia in patients with HF.}

Zuojin Pill (ZJP), composed of Coptis chinensis Franch. and Euodia ruticarpa (A. Juss.) Benth. in a mass ratio of 6:1, is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula recorded in “Danxi's Experiential Therapy”, an ancient medical book from the Ming Dynasty of China. It is used to treat liver fire invading the stomach, which is caused by liver stagnation transforming into fire and disharmony between the liver and stomach.
Aim of the study
To develop a systematic strategy to screen hepatoprotective components from TCM using ZJP as a model sample.
Materials and methods
A CCl4-induced mouse model of acute liver injury was used for the verification of the hepatoprotective effects of ZJP. UPLC-Q-Exactive Plus Orbitrap MS/MS was used for the identification of the components in mouse serum after intragastric administration of ZJP. The hepatoprotective activities of the components found in mouse serum were tested in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes induced by CCl4.
Results
Nine components with significant hepatoprotective activity including berberine, epiberberine, coptisine, palmatine, jatrorrhizine, rutaecarpin, dehydroevodiamine, evocarpine and chlorogenic acid were successfully screened out.
Conclusions
Our developed strategy has the advantages of high efficiency and low cost, and would provide a powerful tool for screening potential hepatoprotective components from TCM.}

The IDEXX ProCyte Dx is a veterinary hematology analyzer validated for several species, but not for donkeys. The aim of this study was to validate the ProCyte Dx for Asinina de Miranda donkeys. The validation requires a controlled study of precision, carryover, linearity and comparison between the equipment and the manually obtained values for the leukocyte differential count and hematocrit. Results indicated coefficient of variation was good (below 5 %) for both the intra-assay and the inter-assay precision, except for basophils. Carryover was 0 % for all the parameters except platelets (5.88 %). Linearity showed a very high Pearson correlation coefficient, above 0.99, for erythrocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, platelets and plateletcrit. Comparison demonstrated excellent agreement for hematocrit (rs=0.96) and good Spearman rank correlation for neutrophils (rs=0.84) and lymphocytes (rs=0.90). Accuracy for total leukocyte count and platelets could not be determined. In conclusion, the ProCyte Dx seems appropriate to be used in Asinina de Miranda hematology.}

abstract = {Introduction
Pathology of the musculoskeletal system is a frequent cause of healthcare requirements. Knowledge of musculoskeletal medicine (MSM) should be essential for most specialties. Unfortunately, many medical intern residents (MIRs) admit to a lack of confidence and competence in this field.
Material and methods
50 recently hired MIRs (32 of whom were COT residents from the Comunidad Valenciana) completed the Freedman and Berstein test of basic competency in MSM. In addition, they completed a questionnaire about their confidence in performing five common tasks in clinical practice and their perception of the curricular importance of medicine in their academic training.
Results
The overall mean score obtained on the test was 69.44% (SD 13.32%), while the specific score for 5 “red flags” questions was 14.34% (SD 2.58%). Both of them showed significant differences between COT residents and other specialties. The median obtained in the evaluation of the level of confidence in wound examination was 2 above 5 (IQR 2), with significant differences (p=.014) between the COT group and other specialties. The perception of the time spent in the faculty on MSM was considered adequate (median 3, IQR 1). 64% of participants would modify the approach to the practical part of the curriculum in MME.
Conclusions
The overall test was passed by 50% of the residents, which shows that the teaching of MME is deficient during the university and pre-MIR training period. We believe that it is important to plan training actions to increase the knowledge and skills necessary for its correct handling; this way, the system would be more efficient with better health care and a better screening of specialised derivations.
Resumen
Introducción
La enfermedad del sistema musculoesquelético es una causa frecuente de demanda asistencial. El conocimiento en medicina musculoesquelética (MME) debe ser esencial para gran parte de las especialidades. Desafortunadamente, gran parte de los médicos internos residentes (MIR) reconocen tener falta de confianza y de competencia en este campo.
Material y métodos
Cincuenta MIR recién incorporados a su plaza (32 de ellos residentes de COT de la Comunidad Valenciana) completaron el test de competencia básica en MME de Freedman y Berstein. Además, realizaron un cuestionario sobre el grado de confianza al momento de desempeñar cinco tareas habituales en la práctica clínica y sobre la percepción de la carga curricular de MME en su formación académica.
Resultados
La puntuación media global obtenida en el test fue de 69,44% (SD 13,32%), mientras que la puntuación concreta para cinco preguntas que se consideraban «banderas rojas» fue de 14,34% (SD 2,58%). Ambas mostraron diferencias significativas entre los residentes de COT y otras especialidades. La mediana obtenida en la valoración del nivel de confianza en la exploración de heridas fue de 2 sobre 5 (IQR 2), con diferencias significativas (p=0,014) entre el grupo COT y el de otras especialidades. La percepción del tiempo dedicado en la facultad en materia de MME fue considerada como adecuada (mediana 3, IQR 1). El 64% modificaría el planteamiento de la parte práctica del currículo en MME.
Conclusiones
La prueba global fue superada por el 50% de los residentes, lo cual pone de manifiesto que la enseñanza en MME es deficitaria durante el periodo universitario y formativo preMIR. Consideramos primordial la planificación de acciones formativas que se traduzca en un aumento de los conocimientos y aptitudes necesarias para su correcto manejo, ya que ello se traduciría en una mayor agilidad del sistema, una mejor asistencia sanitaria y un mejor cribado de derivaciones especializadas.}

abstract = {Obesity in the elderly not only impacts morbidity and mortality but their quality of life. This phenomenon has sparked extensive research and debate regarding treatment recommendations, primarly due to the lack evidence in this specific population. When addressing possible treatment recommendations for older adults with obesity, it is crucial to assess certain essential aspects such as functional status, sarcopenia, cognitive status, and others. Intentional weight loss in this population can be both effective and safe. The best weight loss plan for the elderly revolves around adopting a healthy lifestyle, which includes following a Mediterranean diet pattern and engaging in physical exercise, particularly strength training. Additionally, the use of weight loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonists, can provide an additional stage of treatment. In selective candidates, bariatric surgery may also be considered. The objective of this document is to propose a comprehensive algorithm of recommendations for the management of obesity in the elderly (above the age of 65), based on scientific evidence and the expertise of members from the Diabetes, Obesity, and Nutrition Workgroup of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine.
Resumen
La obesidad en los ancianos no solo influye en la morbimortalidad, sino también en su calidad de vida. Este fenómeno ha suscitado una amplia investigación y debate sobre las recomendaciones terapéuticas, debido principalmente a la falta de datos en esta población específica. Cuando se abordan las posibles recomendaciones terapéuticas para adultos mayores con obesidad, es fundamental evaluar ciertos aspectos esenciales, como el estado funcional, la sarcopenia, el estado cognitivo y otros. La pérdida de peso en esta población puede ser tanto eficaz como segura si es intencionada. El mejor plan de pérdida de peso para los ancianos gira en torno a la adopción de unos hábitos de vida saludables, que incluyen seguir una dieta mediterránea y hacer ejercicio físico, especialmente el entrenamiento de fuerza. Además, el uso de medicamentos para adelgazar puede proporcionar una fase de tratamiento adicional, en concreto los agonistas del receptor del péptido glucagonoide-1 (AR GLP-1) y nuevos polipéptidos insulinótropos dependientes de la glucosa (GIP)/agonistas del receptor del GLP-1. Y en determinados candidatos también se puede plantear la cirugía bariátrica. El objetivo de este documento es proponer un completo algoritmo de recomendaciones para el manejo de la obesidad en las personas de edad avanzada (mayores de 65 años), basado en datos científicos y en la experiencia de los miembros del Grupo de Trabajo de Diabetes, Obesidad y Nutrición de la Sociedad Española de Medicina Interna.}
