abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by significant interindividual heterogeneity. With a wider selection of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions available and in advanced developmental stages, a priority for the coming decade is to determine accurate methods of predicting treatment response and disease course. Precision medicine strategies will allow tailoring of preventative and therapeutic decisions to individual patient needs. In this review, we consider the future of precision medicine in inflammatory bowel disease. We discuss the critical need to extend from research focused on short-term symptomatic response to integrative multi-omic systems biology strategies to identify and validate biomarkers that underpin precision approaches. Crucially, the international community has collective responsibility to provide well-phenotyped and -curated longitudinal datasets for scientific discovery and validation. Research must also study broader aspects of the immune response, including components of the extracellular matrix, to better understand biological pathways initiating and perpetuating tissue fibrosis and longer-term disease complications.}

This chapter outlines a brief overview of the properties of thermoresponsive hydrogels (TRHs), the research spectrum, and their applications in tissue engineering in particular. To illustrate the phase transition, TRHs use temperature as an external stimulus. As per the polymer's nature, it can form either a soft or hard hydrogel matrix around or into biological tissue. The ease of availability of biocompatible thermoresponsive polymers, ease of handling and fabrication, and high functionality of TRHs offer many advantages for developing a broad range of tissue engineering applications.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes (T2DM) for thousands of years. The holistic view of TCM and the “multitarget” characteristics of Chinese medicine have unique advantages in the prevention and treatment of T2DM. TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment are effective for T2DM; however, currently, the therapeutic effect of TCM is generally evaluated by asking for patients' subjective feelings, or by checking the changes in relevant indicators. The main problems are that the patient's descriptions are unclear and subjective, and although the self-reported symptoms may have improved significantly, the relevant indicators are sometimes not obvious, which cannot truly reflect the therapeutic effect of TCM. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a novel, sensitive, and noninvasive method to quantitatively evaluate the therapeutic effect of TCM.
Methods
In this study, ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) was measured at four sites of hands of T2DM patients with Qi-Yin deficiency before treatment and after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment with TCM. The UPE intensity and spectral distribution were calculated and analyzed using the results measured at these four sites. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to quantify the correlation between the UPE parameters and the syndrome scores of TCM.
Results
The UPE intensity of T2DM patients with Qi-Yin deficiency decreased gradually with the course of the treatment and was significantly lower than that before the treatment. The ratio of photon counts between the wavelength ranges of 495–550 nm and 550–610 nm after the treatment was higher than that before the treatment and negatively correlated with the corresponding syndrome scores so that the degree of symptoms improvement could be characterized by the ratio (495–550 nm/550–610 nm).
Conclusions
The therapeutic effect of TCM in T2DM patients with Qi-Yin deficiency can be shown at the level of UPE. UPE is a potential and noninvasive tool for evaluating the therapeutic effect of TCM in patients with T2DM.}

Slow transit constipation (STC) is a common gastrointestinal disorder seriously impacting patients’ quality of life. At present, although conventional chemical drugs effectively control STC symptoms in the short term, the long-term effects are poor, and the side effects are significant. In this regard, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers an opportunity for STC treatment. Many pharmacological and clinical studies have confirmed this efficacy of TCM with multiple targets and mechanisms.
Aim of the study
This review attempted to summarize the characteristics of TCM (compound prescriptions, single Chinese herbs, and active ingredients) for STC treatment and discussed their efficacy based on analyzing the pathogenesis of STC.
Materials and methods
The information was acquired from different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases. We then focused on the recent research progress in STC treatment by TCM. Finally, the future challenges and trends are proposed.
Results
TCM has good clinical efficacy in the treatment of STC with multi-mechanisms. Based on the theory of syndrome differentiation, five kinds of dialectical treatment for STC by compound TCM prescriptions were introduced, namely: Nourishing Yin and moistening the intestines; Promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis; Warming Yang and benefiting Qi; Soothing the liver and regulating Qi; and Benefiting Qi and strengthening the spleen. In addition, six single Chinese herbs and eight active ingredients also show good efficacy in STC treatment.
Conclusions
TCM, especially compound prescriptions, has bright prospects in treating STC attributed to its various holistic effects.}

We identified 217 relevant publications through a systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore and SpringerLink databases. We propose a new taxonomy including use case, technical methodology for registration and tracking, data sources, visualization as well as validation and evaluation, and analyze the retrieved publications accordingly. We find that the bulk of research focuses on supporting physicians during interventions, where the HoloLens is promising for procedures usually performed without image guidance. However, the consensus is that accuracy and reliability are still too low to replace conventional guidance systems. Medical students are the second most common target group, where AR-enhanced medical simulators emerge as a promising technology. While concerns about human–computer interactions, usability and perception are frequently mentioned, hardly any concepts to overcome these issues have been proposed. Instead, registration and tracking lie at the core of most reviewed publications, nevertheless only few of them propose innovative concepts in this direction. Finally, we find that the validation of HoloLens applications suffers from a lack of standardized and rigorous evaluation protocols. We hope that this review can advance medical AR research by identifying gaps in the current literature, to pave the way for novel, innovative directions and translation into the medical routine.}

abstract = {Study objective
We sought to identify longitudinal trends in workforce entry and attrition among rural and urban emergency physicians, nonemergency physicians, and advanced practice providers.
Methods
We performed a repeated cross-sectional analysis, from 2013 to 2019, of emergency clinicians who received reimbursement for at least 50 Evaluation and Management services [99281-99285] from Medicare part B within any study year. We calculated the emergency workforce’s entry and attrition rates annually. Entry was defined as clinicians newly entering or re-entering the workforce, and attrition was defined as clinicians leaving permanently or temporarily. We stratified the analyses by rural designation and assessed the proportions and state-level changes in clinician density.
Results
In total, 82,499 unique clinicians performed at least 50 Evaluation and Management services within any of the 7 study years examined, including 47,000 emergency physicians, 9,029 nonemergency physicians, and 26,470 advanced practice providers. Emergency physicians made up a decreasing proportion of the workforce (68.1% in 2013; 65.5% in 2019), and advanced practice providers made up an increasing proportion of the workforce (20.9% in 2013; 26.1% in 2019). Annually, 5.9% to 6.8% (2,186 to 2,407) of emergency physicians newly entered and 0.8% to 1.4% (264 to 515) re-entered the workforce, whereas 3.8% to 4.9% (1,241 to 1,793) permanently left and 0.8% to 1.6% (276 to 521) temporarily left. Additionally, the total proportion of clinicians practicing in rural designations decreased, and advanced practice providers separately made up a substantially increasing proportion of the rural workforce (23.0% in 2013; 32.7% in 2019). Substantial state-level variation existed in the supply and demand of emergency clinician densities per 100,000 population.
Conclusion
The annual rate of emergency physician attrition was collectively more than 5%, well above the 3% assumed in a recently publicized projection, suggesting a potential overestimation of the anticipated future clinician surplus. Notably, the attrition of emergency physicians has disproportionately affected vulnerable rural areas. This work can inform emergency medicine workforce decisions regarding residency training, advanced practice provider utilization, and clinician employment.}

Objectives To determine the prevalence and specific modalities of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by professional voice users (PVUs) for vocal ailments and to examine the PVU's health care utilization. Methods A Canadian national cross-sectional survey was conducted. Surveys were distributed electronically to members of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television, and Radio Artists; the National Association of Teachers of Singing; the Canadian Actors Equity Association; and the Department of Vocal Performance at Western University. Participants were asked about the products/therapies they use to improve vocal health. Frequency of use, health care utilization, and general influencers in treatment choice were also collected. Results Two hundred eighty-eight participants completed the survey. 86% of participants claimed to have taken at least one form of CAM when experiencing voice loss or a negative voice change. Of the respondents, 18% claimed to use products/therapies for vocal health routinely in the absence of vocal ailments. The most common CAMs used were hot drinks with honey and/or lemon, lozenges, and inhaling steam. When vocally ill, PVUs were significantly more likely to use CAMs than any other treatment method. Voice teachers and medical doctors most commonly influenced the choice of the treatment. Conclusion This study illustrated the substantial prevalence of CAMs in the PVU community. Understanding the utilization of CAMs can help clinicians navigate treatment strategies for this patient population.}

The most relevant fields in which MC simulation has an established role in nuclear medicine are internal dosimetry, instrumentation design and optimization, radiation protection and radionuclide production. Internal dosimetry models, at organ or voxel level, have been successfully developed. MC simulations can be also employed for patient-specific 3D dosimetry based on SPECT-CT and PET-CT data. Concerning imaging devices, the optimization of all the parameters influencing the detector response and image quality, also for innovative scanner architectures, can be deeply investigated. On the other side, existing PET and SPECT tomographs can benefit of MC-derived correction factors. In radiation protection from radionuclides used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, MC approach reveals to be a powerful tool for estimating exposures, even in complex environmental conditions, for designing radiation shielding, particularly in the case of high-energy therapeutic beta emitters. Radionuclide production goes through several nuclear reaction processes, induced in most cases by proton or neutron beams. Target assembly, including the choice of target material and shape, and beam features, must be optimized to achieve an optimal production yield and radionuclide purity. Finally, MC simulation shows its potential in supporting the effective teaching of radiation-matter interaction concepts, applied in nuclear medicine.}

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been increasingly popular in genomics studies over the last decade, as new sequencing technology has been created and improved. Recently, NGS started to be used in clinical oncology to improve cancer therapy through diverse modalities ranging from finding novel and rare cancer mutations, discovering cancer mutation carriers to reaching specific therapeutic approaches known as personalized medicine (PM). PM has the potential to minimize medical expenses by shifting the current traditional medical approach of treating cancer and other diseases to an individualized preventive and predictive approach. Currently, NGS can speed up in the early diagnosis of diseases and discover pharmacogenetic markers that help in personalizing therapies. Despite the tremendous growth in our understanding of genetics, NGS holds the added advantage of providing more comprehensive picture of cancer landscape and uncovering cancer development pathways. In this review, we provided a complete overview of potential NGS applications in scientific and clinical oncology, with a particular emphasis on pharmacogenomics in the direction of precision medicine treatment options.}

abstract = {Background
Whilst attention has been paid within the literature to examining potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) for older adults in a variety of care settings, less is known about the extent within intermediate care. Furthermore, few studies have examined the utility of clinical pharmacist involvement in this care context.
Objective(s)
Determine the prevalence of PIP in intermediate care (IC) settings in Northern Ireland (NI), explore the utility of a novel pharmacist case management model at reducing PIP and to examine the association with subsequent healthcare utilisation.
Methods
Secondary analysis of prospective data (N = 532) collected during a medicines optimisation pharmacist case management model in three intermediate care sites in NI. Independent prescriber pharmacists delivered the intervention. Variability in Medication Appropriateness Index score change (ΔMAI) from admission to discharge was examined using multivariate linear regression analysis. Multivariate logistic and Poisson regressions were used to examine the association between ΔMAI and likelihood and numbers of unplanned hospital readmissions within 30 and 90 days of IC discharge.
Results
PIP was highly prevalent (89.5%) at baseline with significant reductions in MAI score achieved from admission (Median = 14) to discharge (Median = 0) (Z = −18.28, p < .001). The prevalence of PIP at discharge was 7.8%. No relationship was observed between ΔMAI score and unplanned hospital readmission. Those who received at least one educational intervention were less likely to be readmitted within 30 days of IC discharge (OR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.03, 0.71, p < .001). Baseline healthcare utilisation consistently predicted healthcare utilisation post-IC discharge.
Conclusions
Drug-related problems persist for many older adults following acute care discharge and intermediate care may provide an ideal location for medicines optimisation interventions.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the growing interest in health data science education, it is not embedded in undergraduate medical curricula and little is known about best teaching practices. This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science.
Methods
The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students.
Results
The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance.
Conclusions
Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinically-relevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Purpose
Evidence supporting complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) for improving cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is still fragmented. This study therefore critically appraised all the systematic reviews (SRs) regarding the effectiveness of CIM in mitigating CRF in adults.
Methods
A systematic review of SRs and a meta-analysis were conducted in 4 databases. The effect sizes of the included SRs were quantitatively pooled (standardized mean difference [SMD]; 95% CI) using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested by using χ2 (Q) tests and I² statistics.
Findings
Twenty-two SRs met the inclusion criteria, and results from 20 SRs underwent meta-analysis. The pooled significant estimate of fatigue reduction was as follows: SMD, −0.50; 95% CI, −0.67 to −0.32; P < 0.001. The subgroup analysis based on the type of CIM intervention revealed that the approach showing higher effects in reducing fatigue thus far is acupuncture: SMD, –0.99; 95% CI = –1.37 to –0.62, P < 0.001; I2 = 84%. CIM therapies showed a significant reduction of fatigue in patients with breast cancer: SMD, –0.46; 95% CI, –0.69 to –0.23; P < 0.001; I2 = 82%.
Implications
CIM interventions showed effectiveness in reducing CRF. Subgroup analysis suggested some potential influencing, such as tumor type and specific CIM therapy factors, that require in-depth assessment in future research. Study protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42020194254.}

abstract = {Objectives
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of multicomponent lifestyle medicine (LM) interventions for improving sleep quality have yielded inconsistent findings. This study marks the first meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of multicomponent LM interventions in improving sleep quality.
Methods
We searched six online databases for RCTs that compared multicomponent LM interventions to an active or inactive control group in an adult population and assessed subjective sleep quality as a primary or secondary outcome using validated sleep measures at any post-intervention time-point.
Results
A total of 23 RCTs with 26 comparisons involving 2534 participants were included in the meta-analysis. After excluding outliers, the analysis revealed that multicomponent LM interventions significantly improved sleep quality at immediate post-intervention (d = 0.45) and at short-term follow-up (i.e., <three months) (d = 0.50) relative to an inactive control group. Regarding the comparison with active control, no significant between-group difference was found at any time-point. No meta-analysis was conducted at the medium- and long-term follow-up due to insufficient data. Subgroup analyses supported that multicomponent LM interventions had a more clinically relevant effect on improving sleep quality in participants with clinical levels of sleep disturbance (d = 1.02) relative to an inactive control at immediate post-intervention assessment. There was no evidence of publication bias.
Conclusion
Our findings provided preliminary evidence that multicomponent LM interventions were efficacious in improving sleep quality relative to an inactive control at immediate post-intervention and at short-term follow-up. Additional high-quality RCTs targeting individuals with clinically significant sleep disturbance and long-term follow-up are warranted.}

This study delves into the persistent need for contemporary information systems, where information plays a crucial role in decision-making. It aims to provide an objective approach to addressing pressing medical challenges, particularly in disease diagnosis and prediction, enhancing the effectiveness of these critical tasks. Automated medical information systems, built on advanced mathematical models, significantly empower physicians. Machine diagnostics, relying on deterministic logic, the phase interval method, and information-probabilistic logic, bolster diagnostic capabilities. Functional entropy enables individuals to handle vague information, aiding decision-making. Assessing imprecision and uncertainty computationally diminishes subjectivity, while employing fuzzy set theory enhances diagnostic modeling. Mathematical models assess diagnostic indicators, and linguistic variables quantify resemblance. The diagnostic model for primary biliary cirrhosis and active hepatitis utilizes a diagnostic table and gradient projection. This comprehensive study advances medical diagnostics through mathematical models and automated systems, addressing critical healthcare challenges.}

This study deciphered the underlying common molecular mechanisms of these TCM treatments for AS. The ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-triple/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) assays were employed to detect herbal ingredients. Target proteins of herbal ingredients were identified by ChEMBL Database. To infer the relationships between ingredients and AS-related proteins, network pharmacology was employed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and core target analyses were carried out with tools Cytoscape and STRING. To find out the molecular basis and target of AS, molecular docking and an in vitro experiment were also conducted. It is found that estradiol may participate in the treatment of AS via the inhibition of inflammatory factors, and Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) appears to be a key target. This research offers insight into the therapeutic mechanism of TCM formulas for AS and furthers our understanding of TCM pharmacology.}

In each instant of time, there is a large number of random pairwise encounters between members of the two populations. In each encounter, a physician heals a patient. The outcome of the healing process is uncertain and may result in patient harm; if that happens, the patient may sue the physician for medical malpractice. Physicians have to choose between two alternative treatments, D and ND, with different levels of benefits and risks. The treatment D is less risky than the alternative treatment ND, but has the disadvantage of providing a lower expected benefit to the patient. Therefore its provision corresponds to practicing “negative” defensive medicine. Physicians prevent, at least partially, negligence charges by buying medical malpractice insurance. This transfers the risk of litigation from the physician to the insurer. The dynamics we analyze are determined by a three-dimensional discrete-time dynamic system, where the variables x and y are, respectively, the shares of defensive physicians and litigious patients, while the variable a represents the insurance premium. In such a context we show that, depending on the policy’s price calculation principle as well as on model’s parameters related to the accuracy of the judicial system and legal reforms, the game’s final outcome could be an appealing equilibrium point in which the defensive strategy of physicians and litigious behavior of patients vanish, an interior (Nash) equilibrium in which all strategies coexist, or even an oscillatory behavior arisen via a Neimart–Sacker bifurcation in which strategies coexist in a recurrent manner. Furthermore, we state a “no chaos” conjecture, supported by analytical, numerical and empirical arguments.}

The prevalence of kidney disease has increased rapidly in recent years and has emerged as one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Natural products have been suggested as valuable nephroprotective agents due to their multi-target and synergistic effects on modulating important proteins involved in kidney injury. There is a large number of plant species that have been used traditionally for kidney-related conditions in Mesoamerican medicine by different cultural groups that could provide a valuable source of nephroprotective therapeutic candidates and could lead to potential drug discovery.
Aim of review
This review aims to provide an overview of the currently known efficacy of plant species used traditionally in Mesoamerica by Mayan groups to treat kidney-related conditions and to analyze the phytochemical, pharmacological, molecular, toxicological, and clinical evidence to contribute to public health efforts and for directing future research.
Methods
Primary sources of plant use reports for traditional kidney-related disorders in Mesoamerica were searched systematically from library catalogs, theses, and scientific databases (PubMed, Google Scholar; and Science Direct), and were filtered according to usage frequency in Mayan groups and plant endemism. The database of traditional plants was further analyzed based on associations with published reports of the phytochemical, pharmacological, molecular, toxicological, and clinical evidence.
Results
The most reported kidney-related conditions used traditionally in Mayan medicine involve reducing renal damage (a cultural interpretation that considers an inflammatory or infectious condition), cleaning or purifying the blood and kidney, reducing kidney pain, and eliminating kidney stones. A total of 208 plants used for kidney-related problems by 10 Mayan groups were found, representing 143 native species, where only 42 have reported pharmacological activity against kidney damage, mainly approached by in vitro and in vivo models of chemical- or drug-induced nephrotoxicity, diabetes nephropathy, and renal injury produced by hypertension. Nephroprotective effects are mainly mediated by reducing oxidative stress, inflammatory response, fibrosis mechanisms, and apoptosis in the kidney. The most common nephroprotective compounds associated with traditional Mayan medicine were flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenolic acids. The most widely studied traditional plants in terms of pharmacological evidence, bioactive compounds, and mechanisms of action, are Annona muricata L., Carica papaya L., Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., Lantana camara L., Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw., Tagetes erecta L., and Zea mays L. Most of the plant species with reported pharmacological activity against kidney damage were considered safe in toxicological studies.
Conclusion
Available pharmacological reports suggest that several herbs used in traditional Mayan medicine for renal-associated diseases may have nephroprotective effects and consistent pharmacological evidence, nephroprotective compounds, and mechanisms of action in different models of kidney injury. However, more research is required to fully understand the potential of traditional Mayan medicine in drug discovery given the limited ethnobotanical studies and data available for most species with regards to identification on bioactive components, pharmacological mechanisms, and the scarce number of clinical studies.}

The ability to incorporate evidence-based medicine (EBM) into clinical practice is an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competency, yet many pediatric residents have limited knowledge in this area. The objective of this study is to describe the effect of an EBM curriculum on resident attitudes and clinical use of EBM.
Methods
We implemented a longitudinal EBM curriculum to review key literature and guidelines and teach EBM principles. In this Institutional Review Board-exempt mixed methods study, we surveyed residents, fellows, and faculty about resident use of EBM at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention. We conducted point prevalence surveys of faculty about residents’ EBM use on rounds. Residents participated in focus groups, which were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using conventional content analysis to develop themes.
Results
Residents (N = 61 pre- and 70 post-curriculum) reported an increased appreciation for the importance of EBM and comfort generating a search question. Faculty reported that residents cited EBM on rounds, with an average of 2.4 citations/week. Cited evidence reinforced faculty's plans 79% of the time, taught faculty something new 57% of the time, and changed management 21% of the time. Focus groups with 22 trainees yielded 4 themes: 1) increased competence in understanding methodology and evidence quality; 2) greater autonomy in application of EBM; 3) a call for relatedness from faculty role models and a culture that promotes EBM; and 4) several barriers to successful use of EBM.
Conclusions
After implementation of a longitudinal EBM curriculum, trainees described increased use of EBM in clinical practice.}

The PIK3CA-inhibitor, alpelisib, seems to be a promising treatment option for PROS patients. We describe a young boy with overgrowth and a pathogenic mosaic variant in PIK3R1; c.1699A > G, p.(Lys567Glu). He was prenatally suspected of a syndrome on the presence of unusual transient fluctuating subcutaneous edemas and lymphedema of his left shoulder. The pathogenic variant, later found to be causative, was below detection threshold in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of amniotic fluid. Upon delivery a mosaic pathogenic PIK3R1 variant, was identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of a skin biopsy. With no proven treatment options available, and based on the theoretical disease mechanism, alpelisib therapy was initiated at nine months of age. In the first year of treatment growth normalized and the affected vascular and lymphatic tissue regressed. No side effects have been observed. This report underlines the importance of early variant detection in children suspected of having severe mosaic overgrowth, and proves that prenatal diagnosis is possible, enabling prompt treatment. Furthermore, it demonstrates the promising effects of alpelisib in this patient group.}

Atmospheric changes, driven by anthropogenic emissions, expose global populations to droughts, heat waves, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events—posing major threats to public health and exacerbating environmental health disparities. Existing evidence demonstrates the potential for climate-driven events to impact reproductive health outcomes, yet very few studies have explored this relationship. Recently, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics released position statements regarding reproductive health and environmental exposures. Unfortunately, such initiatives have yielded little action within the health care system. To address this stagnation, health care workers must meld research findings into actionable preventive medicine strategies and transition to a more action-oriented approach to address the climate crisis. The objective of this article is to elucidate the urgency of the climate crisis in relation to reproductive health and push the health care workers to recognize their intrinsic opportunity as leaders in climate action at local, state, national, and international levels. We call on health care organizations and health care workers to leverage their inherent positions as climate action leaders to increase climate resilience and mitigate climate-related adverse reproductive health outcomes.}

However, while big data and AI tools have already revolutionized many fields, medicine has partially lagged due to its complexity and multidimensionality, leading to technical challenges in developing and validating solutions that generalize to diverse populations. Indeed, inner biases and miseducation of algorithms, in view of their implementation in daily clinical practice, are becoming relevant concerns. In fact, AI could mirror the unconscious thoughts, racism, and biases of the humans who generated these algorithms. So, a potential worsening of existing health disparities is possible, especially without a thoughtful, transparent, and inclusive approach that involves addressing bias in algorithm design and implementation along the cancer care continuum. In this chapter, a broad landscape of major applications of AI in cancer care is provided, with a focus on cancer research and precision medicine. Major challenges posed by the implementation of AI in the clinical setting will be discussed. Potentially feasible solutions for mitigating bias are provided, in the light of promoting cancer health equity.}

Biyuan Tongqiao granule (BYTQ) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used in China to clinically treat patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), yet its underlying mechanism and targets remains unclear.
Aim of the study
The study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of BYTQ against AR using the ovalbumin (OVA) -induced AR mice model. Integrating network pharmacology and proteomics to investigate possible targets of BYTQ for AR.
Materials and methods
The compounds in BYTQ were analyzed using UHPLC-ESI-QE-Orbitrap-MS. The OVA/Al(OH)3 were used to induce the AR mice model. The nasal symptoms, histopathology, immune subsets, inflammatory factors, and differentially expressed proteins were examined. Proteomics analysis elucidated the potential mechanisms of BYTQ to improve AR, which was further validated by Western blot (WB) assay. The compounds and potential targets of BYTQ were systematically elucidated by integrating network pharmacology and proteomics analysis to explore the mechanism. The binding affinity between key potential targets and corresponding compounds was then validated using molecular docking. Molecular docking results were verified by a western blotting and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA).
Results
A total of 58 compounds were identified from BYTQ. BYTQ significantly suppressed AR symptoms by inhibiting the release of OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and histamine, improving the pathological injury of nasal mucosal tissue, and regulating the proportions of lymphocytes to maintain immune balance. Proteomics analysis showed that the cell adhesion factors and focal adhesion pathway might be potential mechanism of BYTQ against AR. The levels of E-selectin, vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) proteins in the nasal mucosal tissue were significantly downregulated in the BYTQ-H group compared to the AR group. Integrating network pharmacology and proteomics analysis identified that SRC, PIK3R1, HSP90AA1, GRB2, AKT1, MAPK3, MAPK1, TP53, PIK3CA, and STAT3 may be potential protein targets for BYTQ to treat AR. Molecular docking analysis indicated that the active compounds of BYTQ could bind tightly to these key targets. In addition, BYTQ could inhibit OVA-induced phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT1, STAT3 and ERK1/2. The CETSA data suggested that BYTQ could improve the heat stability of PI3K, AKT1, STAT3 and ERK1/2.
Conclusions
BYTQ suppresses E-selectin and VCAM-1 and ICAM1 expression by regulating PI3K/AKT and STAT3/MAPK signaling pathways, thus alleviating inflammation in AR mice. BYTQ is the aggressive treatment for AR.}

abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) mind-body therapies in patients with neuropathic pain. Design: This systematic review was undertaken according to the PRISMA 2020 statement.
Data sources
We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in seven English databases and four Chinese databases up to March 2022.
Review/Analysis methods
The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 was used for the quality assessment, and the mean difference with a 95% confidence interval for data pooling. The review was registered in the INPLASY (INPLASY202240016).
Results
Twenty-three RCTs were identified, including 1,693 patients with lumbar herniated discs (LHD), cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR), sympathetic cervical spondylosis (SCS), trigeminal neuralgia, and central poststroke pain. Pooled results showed that for LHD, TCM mind-body therapy used alone (MD: -0.57, [-0.77, -0.36], P＜0.01, week 8) or combined with physiotherapy (MD: -1.02, [-1.12, -0.91], P＜0.01, week 4) showed advantages over physiotherapy alone on pain relief. However, there was no statistical difference on physical function. For CSR, TCM mind-body movement combined with physiotherapy had better effect than physiotherapy alone on pain relief (MD: -1.15, [-1.37, -0.94], P＜0.01, week 4). Six trials reported safety. Nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and pain at the acupuncture point were observed.
Conclusions
Low-quality evidence showed that TCM mind-body therapies might reduce pain intensity and improve physical function when used as an adjuvant therapy or monotherapy. There is a need to conduct high-quality trials to confirm the effectiveness and safety of TCM mind-body therapies for neuropathic pain.}

abstract = {Introduction
The Medicare annual wellness visit was designed to address health risks and encourage evidence-based preventive care in aging. However, it can be challenging for providers to dedicate time for comprehensive attention to wellness during these visits. Our project implements a group setting for Medicare wellness visits (GMWV) as an efficient method for delivering high value preventive care.
Methods
Three hundred patients from two primary care ambulatory clinics in Detroit, MI in need of their annual Medicare visit were invited to participate in the pilot GMWV. Fifty-eight patients agreed and completed their GMWV. The visit included collection of vitals, vision screening, and risk assessment during check-in, followed by educational wellness presentations led by an interdisciplinary team of six healthcare professionals. Patients completed a post visit-satisfaction survey and researchers calculated rates of completion of health maintenance gaps (HMG), i.e. immunizations and cancer screenings, among participants.
Results
The average age of participants (N female = 48) was 74 years old. Thirty-four participants had more than one HMG at baseline. On average, 8 % of immunization gaps and 12 % of screening gaps were completed at or within one-year post GMWV. Participant feedback reported that 82 % of patients felt that they learned something new from the presentation and 81 % of patients felt satisfied with the amount of time they spent with their physician.
Discussion
GMWV is a feasible approach to promoting wellness and healthy aging that patients find satisfying although, additional study is needed to compare the effectiveness of this model to standard care.}

abstract = {Introduction
Prevalence of HCV infection in adults in Italy ranges between 0.5 and 3% across the country. Free HCV screening is offered to subjects born after 1969, but little is known about the prevalence of HCV infection in elder subjects.
Aim
This prospective study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and significance of HCV infection in consecutive adult inpatients without a history of hepatitis C during their stay in a large division of Internal Medicine in Tuscany.
Materials and Methods
Between October 2021 and July 2022, all the consecutive adult inpatients born before 1969, without a history of hepatitis C, and admitted to the Division of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital in Siena (AOU Senese) were tested for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). In addition, demographic characteristics and liver test results were collected.
Results
A total of 571 consecutive adult patients (307 males, 264 females) without a history of hepatitis C were evaluated. Median age was 82 yrs. (range: 52 - 99). Unknown HCV infection was detected in 12 patients (2.1%). Characteristics of the HCV-positive patients are summarized as follows (values are expressed as median and range):Sex (M/F): 7/5, Age (yrs): 74 (54 – 84), AST (IU/L): 25.5 (14 – 163), ALT (IU/L): 19 (11 – 89), Bilirubin (mg/dL): 0.8 (0.2 – 3.3) Among the 12 HCV-positive patients without a history of hepatitis C, clinical signs of liver cirrhosis were present in 1, and hepatocellular carcinoma was first detected in another patient.
Conclusions
Routine detection of anti-HCV in all adult inpatients consecutively admitted in a division of Internal Medicine in a large hospital in Tuscany allowed estimation of a 2.1% HCV infection prevalence rate. Evidence of advanced liver disease was not found in many of them but let the detection of previously undiagnosed clinically significant liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.}

abstract = {Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) remains a major global public health challenge. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are standard therapeutic drugs for RA. Conventional DMARDs (c-DMARDs) are a subgroup of approved synthetic DMARDs. The c-DMARDs experienced lesser response with longer disease duration or drug exposure, and unwanted adverse events (AEs). The combination treatments (CTs) of c-DMARDs and Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHMs) were often used in RA clinical trials for increasing the therapeutic effectiveness and reducing the AEs. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CTs for RA. Databases were searched from inception to October 2020 for identification of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the CTs in the management of RA. Twenty-three RCTs with 2,441 participants were included. The assessments and analyses found CTs improved American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 (RR: 1.33, 95% CI [1.21, 1.45], 10 studies, n=1,075) and alleviated AEs (RR: -0.40, 95% CI [-0.30, -0.53], 19 studies, n=2,011) in comparison with c-DMARDs. The CTs also significantly improved RA symptoms and patient-reported outcomes; reduced disease activity score (DAS) 28, serum acute-phase reactants and RA biomarkers. The five most commonly used herbs in included studies were Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Cinnamomi Ramulus, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, and Clematidis Radix et Rhizoma. Pharmacological studies indicated these CHMs could contribute to the outcomes. The integrated CHMs potentially increased the overall effectiveness of c-DMARDs and alleviated AEs in management of RA. Large sample and rigorously designed RCTs are required for future studies.}

abstract = {From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic we, the nuclear medicine (NM) community, expediently mobilized to enable continuity of essential services to the best of our abilities. For example, we effectuated adapted guidelines for NM standard operating procedures (SOPs) and enacted heightened infection protection measures for staff, patients, and the public, alike. Challenges in radionuclide supply chains were identified and often met. NM procedural volumes declined globally and underwent restoration of varying degrees, contingent upon local contexts. Serial surveys have gauged and chronicled such geographical variance of the impact of COVID-19 on NM service delivery and, though it may be too early to fully understand the long-term consequences of reduced NM services, overall, we can certainly expect that this era adversely affected the management of many patients afflicted with non-communicable diseases. Today we are unquestionably better prepared to face unforeseen outbreaks, but a degree of uncertainty lingers. Which lessons learned will endure in the form of permanent NM pandemic preparedness procedures and protocols? In this spirit, the present manuscript presents a revision of prior recommendations issued mid-pandemic to NM centers, some of which may become mainstays in NM service delivery and implementation. Discussed herein are (1) comparative worldwide survey results of the measurable impact of COVID-19 on the practice of nuclear medicine (2) the definitions of a pandemic and its phases (3) relevant, recently developed or updated guidelines specific to nuclear medicine (4) incidental findings of COVID-19 on hybrid nuclear medicine studies performed primarily for oncologic indications and (5) how pertinent pedagogical methods for medical education, research, and development have been re-invented in a suddenly more virtual world. NM professionals shall indefinitely adopt many of the measures implemented during this pandemic, to enable continuity of essential services while preventing the spread of the virus. Which ones? Practices must remain ready for possible new peaks or variants of the roiling COVID-19 contagion and for the emergence of potential new pathogens that may incite future outbreaks or pandemics. Communications technologies are here to stay and will continue to be used in a broad spectrum of applications, from telemedicine to education, but how best? NM departments must align synergistically with these trends, considering what adaptations to a more virtual professional environment should not only last but be further innovated. The paper aims to provide recent history, analysis, and a springboard for continued constructive dialogue. To best navigate the future, NM must continue to learn from this crisis and must continue to bring new questions, evidence, ideas, and warranted systematic updates to the figurative table.}

abstract = {Background
The NHS Genomic Medicine service for England (GMS) was established in 2018 to “harness the power of genomic technology and science to improve the health of our population and deliver on the commitments in the NHS Long Term Plan”. These commitments include being the first national health care system to offer WGS as part of routine care. The GMS comprises of 7 Genomic Laboratory Hubs (GLH) and associated Genomic Medicine Service Alliances (GMSAs). The GMSAs are working with health providers, patients and the public to embed genomics into mainstream healthcare and ensure easy and equitable access to the genomic investigations specified in the NHS Genomic Test Directory. There are approximately 50 NHS Mental Health Trusts in England which provide mental health services (including dementia, learning disability and autism services). The directory includes genetic tests relevant to the assessment of intellectual disability (ID) and dementia – for example microarray and the WGS neurodegeneration panel. There is little data on the use of genetic investigations within mental health services but what there is suggests overall low use with large variability in practice. A NTGMSA transformation project was commissioned to:1)map the utilisation of genomics investigations by NHS mental health trust in the North Thames (North London) region2)develop model “end to end” genomic testing pathways for adult ID services and dementia services.3)develop a strategy to increase genomic testing and improve equity of access
Methods
Request data was extracted from the North Thames GLH (at Great Ormond Street hospital). Consultants in the Psychiatry of ID and psychiatrists working in dementia services in the North Thames region were surveyed about genomic testing. Model genomic testing pathways were developed using the “Clinical Pathway Initiative” framework (NHS Genomic Education Programme). Extensive consultation with stakeholders and in particular patient/carer groups was undertaken to create the pathways. Clinical nurse specialist posts have been created and QI projects set up to increase testing and address equity of access.
Results
10 Mental Health Trust are covered by the NTGMSA footprint. It appears that genetic investigation of adults with ID is seldom initiated in mental health services with less than 10 requests over an 18 month period. We were unable to identify any requests for the dementia panel originating from Mental Health Trusts over the same period. Overall, the survey highlighted the need for further education/training about and support for genomic testing among the psychiatry workforce. Two model testing pathways have been developed. These can be adapted to fit the needs of individual services. The consultation process revealed broad support for the aims of the project. Services users and carers identified difficulties with the logistics of testing and lack of post diagnostic support as key areas for improvement. Mental and GMS clinicians and scientists highlighted the need for strong links between GMS and mental health services and the need for basic competencies in genomic medicine across the wider mental health workforce.
Discussion
The level of genetic testing in mental health services in North London is currently very low. People who meet criteria for genomic investigation (as laid out in the directory) should have easy and equitable access. It appears there is still much work to be done to support the workforce with the integration of genomic medicine in mental health settings.}

abstract = {Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, which may affect adherence to continuous therapy. Since Rikkunshi-To, a Japanese herbal medicine, activates the ghrelin signaling pathway and promotes gastrointestinal function, it is administered to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms. We herein investigated whether donepezil-induced gastrointestinal side effects in mice are ameliorated by Rikkunshi-To and if its therapeutic efficacy is mediated by ghrelin. Since pica behavior, the ingestion of kaolin, correlates with nausea and vomiting in humans, donepezil was intraperitoneally administered with or without Rikkunshi-To daily to mice, and food and kaolin intakes were monitored. The effects of donepezil on intestinal motility and a ghrelin receptor antagonist on donepezil-induced pica behavior, anorexia, and changes in intestinal motility were examined in mice treated with Rikkunshi-To. Pica behavior and anorexia were significantly induced by donepezil and significantly inhibited by Rikkunshi-To. Intestinal motility was significantly suppressed by donepezil and promoted by Rikkunshi-To. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of Rikkunshi-To were antagonized by the ghrelin receptor antagonist. The present results support the therapeutic efficacy of Rikkunshi-To against donepezil-induced gastrointestinal side effects.}

abstract = {Influenza virus-induced pneumonia (IVP) is a high morbidity and contagiousness pulmonary infectious disease caused by invasion of the influenza virus into the lower respiratory tract. Currently, the treatment of IVP is mainly based on an anti-influenza virus infection strategy, which includes the use of anti-influenza vaccines and drugs. However, the clinical use of these treatment options is limited as the influenza virus has a high level of variability and drug resistance may occur. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) for the treatment of IVP have unique advantages, a variety of precise curative effects and have been widely used in clinical practice in China both historically and in the present day. However, there are only few literature reviews on the prevention and treatment of IVP using TCMs. Therefore, we conducted a review of relevant literature from the past 10 years and a comprehensive analysis of various databases containing reports on TCMs used for IVP prevention and treatment to provide basic data for future research and development of drugs against IVP. Herein, we summarize research progress on the pathogenesis of IVP, the TCMs effective in prevention or treatment of IVP, their underlying molecular mechanisms and active components. Overall, we provide a theoretical basis for the clinical use of TCM in the prevention and treatment of IVP. Furthermore, we provide a reference for the development of new multi-component, multi-target, low-toxicity drugs, which is of great academic and clinical significance.}

abstract = {Background
In traditional Chinese medicine, the skin reflects the health of body organs. A skin whitening agent, named seven whitening creams (also called Chi-Bai-San), has been used since ancient times in China. Chi-Bai-San reduces melanin and helps to reduce wrinkles.
Purpose
We aimed to determine the skin-whitening ability and safe dose of the seven compounds in Chi-Bai-San.
Study design
A common use for Chinese medicine is decocted in water. To mimic the function of Chi-Bai-San apply in clinical, we boiled all seven compound in water, respectively. These single recipe extractions and a mixture of these seven items were used in zebrafish embryo and B16F10 melanoma cell to identify the anti-melanogenesis function.
Methods
Chi-Bai-San comprises Bai-Lian (Ampelopsis japonica), Bai-Ji (Bletilla striata), Bai-Zhi (Angelica dahurica), Bai-Zhu (Atractylodes macrocephala), Bai-Shau (Paeonia lactiflora), Fu-Ling (Wolfiporia cocos), and Jen-Ju-Fen (Pearl powder). All components were extracted by heating in distilled water. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation. The extracted components were introduced into zebrafish embryos at different doses to determine the safe dose. B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with the final dose of each component and the component mixture. Melanin content and tyrosinase activity were assessed in zebrafish and B16F10 cells. Chi-Bai-San and its components were exposed to α MSH-induced B16F10 cells, and detected for mechanism of anti-melanogenesis pathway.
Results
Most compounds were not toxic at a low dose (0.1 mg/ml), except A. macrocephala, which resulted in a survival rate of only 30% at 72 hpf. The final dose of A. dahurica, P. lactiflora, W. cocos, and pearl was 1 mg/ml; that of A. japonica was 0.5 mg/ml; and that of A. macrocephala and B. striata was 0.1 mg/ml. Chi-Bai-San markedly decreased melanin content 37.47% in zebrafish embryos. Further, Chi-Bai-San abolished tyrosinase activity and MITF-mediated tyrosinase expression by down regulating the upstream transcription factors ZEB2, β-catenin, and CREB2 in α MSH-induced B16F10 cells. Additionally, Chi-Bai-San might reduce melanosome secretion from melanocytes.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that safety and efficacy of heat-extracted Chi-Bai-San, which can reduce αMSH-induced melanin production by inhibiting the key role of melogenic-related transcription factor and promote the synergic effect of seven types of traditional Chinese herbal medicines.}

abstract = {Background
Skin aging is caused by exogenous and endogenous factors and is commonly manifested as wrinkling, sagging, and looseness of the skin. The herbal extract including Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Atractylodes chinensis (Bunge) Kodiz, Curcuma longa L., and Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl (ZACC extract), is widely used for So-eum (SE) Sasang constitutional type individuals. This study aimed to examine the protective effects of the ZACC extract against skin aging in 21 SE type subjects.
Methods
The safety and clinical efficacy of herbal cream were evaluated after application on human skin in a split-face randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The Sasang Constitution Analysis Tool (SCAT) was used to select 21 SE type subjects, who applied herbal cream and placebo cream for 12 weeks. Visual assessment, wrinkle parameters, questionnaires, and skin safety were evaluated.
Results
The visual assessment score was decreased by using of the herbal cream, but there were no significant differences between groups. Among the wrinkle parameters, R1 (skin roughness) and R4 (smoothness depth) values were significantly improved after the application of the herbal cream compared to those observed after application of the placebo cream for 12 weeks. No significant differences were observed in evaluation of the product efficacy and usability by questionnaires. There were no adverse dermatologic reactions in the SE type subjects during the evaluation period.
Conclusion
The ZACC herbal cream may be used to prevent or slow skin aging, including wrinkle formation, in SE type individuals.}

The purpose of these changes is to increase RO involvement in clinical decision making and to avoiding becoming pigeon-holed as technicians instead of oncologists. There are no data estimating the financial implications of substituting traditional radiation oncology practice with that of an expanded clinical role. We sought to fill this void with a general proof-of-principle analysis based on current benchmark data. To determine the relative value units (RVU) of a blended radiation oncology practice, we selected the specialties of general internal medicine, hospital medicine, and palliative care as these fields most closely match the scope of the broadened clinical roles, which supporters of a more diversified radiation oncology practice typically advocate. To estimate the financial implications of a blended radiation oncology practice, we retrieved salary data by specialty and academic rank from the Clinical Practice Solutions Center report of annual RVU generation and the American Association of Medical Colleges annual faculty salary survey. For an assistant professor, this simulation estimates an 11% to 15% decrease in RVU generation for the median assistant professor operating with a 20% blended practice which, in turn, translates to a 7% to 9% decrease in total salary. The calculations for full professor demonstrate a similar decrease in total salary of approximately 8% to 9%.}

abstract = {Background
Focused transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) can be a valuable tool for emergency physicians (EP) during cardiac arrest.
Objectives
We sought to demonstrate the ability of emergency medicine (EM) residents without prior TEE experience to perform a simulated four-view TEE following a short, flipped conference curriculum.
Methods
This was a prospective, simulation-based study where EM residents participated in the following four-view TEE curriculum: 1 h of online content reviewed prior to a 20-min in-person lecture and 30-min hands-on practice using a TEE trainer. Each resident attended four testing sessions over an 8-week period and performed a total of 25 TEE scans. Each TEE scan was graded in real time using a 10-point checklist by a TEE-credentialed EP. Interrater reliability of the checklist was calculated using the kappa coefficient (κ). A random sample of 10% of the TEE scans were reviewed by a TEE expert using a standard ultrasound 1–5 scale for image acquisition quality, with a “3” considered to be satisfactory. Residents completed an online pretest and posttest.
Results
Twenty-four residents participated. Mean pre- and posttest scores were 52% (SD 16) and 92% (SD 12), respectively. Mean TEE scores using the 10-point checklist after sessions one and four were 9.4 (SD 0.4) and 9.7 (SD 0.3), respectively. Mean time to complete each TEE scan after sessions one and four were 118.1 (SD 28.3) and 57.1 (SD 17.0) s, respectively. The κ for the checklist was 1. The median score for the image acquisition review was 3 (interquartile range 3–4).
Conclusions
This simplified flipped conference curriculum can train EM residents to competently perform TEE in a simulated environment.}

RNCs performances were assessed with 99mTc through comparison of reference value for radionuclide activity and RNC measurements. Results of the intercomparison revealed that RNCs, 15 in total, are accurate within 10% in vial geometry and within 15% in syringe geometry. Most of them showed similar performance. The results revealed that container geometry is an important influencing parameter in the accuracy of activity measurement.
