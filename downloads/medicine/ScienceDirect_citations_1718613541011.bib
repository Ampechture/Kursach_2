abstract = {Background and aim
The management of the worldwide spreading COVID-19 consists of amelioration of its symptoms but no cure is yet available. Herbal medicines supplemented with the Western medicine have been applied for COVID-19 treatment in India, China, Iran, and other countries. This systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluates the effect and safety of herbal intervention in the management of COVID-19.
Experimental procedure
RCTs from databases like PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Science Direct, CTRI, AYUSH Research Portal, India, were reviewed and the data were extracted for study sample demographics, intervention details, clinical effect, inflammatory markers and safety monitoring. Outcomes were expressed as Risk-ratio (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous data, and Mean-Difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous data.
Result and conclusion
From the 32 eligible studies, a total of 3177 COVID-19 patients were included in the review. Herbal intervention as an adjuvant to Western medicine causes significantly higher improvement compared to Western medicine alone [Fever (RR = 1.09 CI 1.03, 1.15), Cough (Risk-Ratio = 1.22 CI 1.08, 1.37), Fatigue (Risk-Ratio = 1.27 CI 1.11, 1.44), Chest CT Improvement (Risk-Ratio = 1.15 CI 1.08, 1.23)]. The laboratory parameters were also better in the herbal medicine group compared to standard care group only WBC (MD = 0.36 CI 0.16, 0.55), Lymphocyte percentage (MD = 5.48 CI 3.05, 7.92), Absolute lymphocyte count (MD = 0.23 CI 0.07, 0.39), CRP (MD = −5.66 CI -7.96, −3.37). However, duration of hospital stays (MD = −1.82 CI -3.84, 0.21); IL-6 (MD = −3.67 CI -8.76, 1.43), ESR Level (MD = −10.38 CI -25.96, 5.21) were statistically insignificant. No significant adverse events for herbal medications were noted in the included RCTs, during the time of the studies. (n = 665, RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.76, 1.14).}

abstract = {Background
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular alternative to opioid and other analgesics in sickle cell disease (SCD). We review the effectiveness, prevalence, and factors associated with CAM use in the pediatric SCD population.
Methods
The review protocol was created based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science.
Results
Twenty-four studies were examined. The prevalence of CAM use in pediatric patients with SCD ranged from 36 to 84.5%. Common inpatient CAM interventions were yoga, virtual reality, and acupuncture, which decreased pain scale scores. Outpatient CAMs were consisted of cognitive behavioral therapy, massage therapy, and guided-imagery, which increased pain tolerability and decreased pain scale scores.
Conclusions
CAM modalities can decrease pain scale scores. However, the impact of specific CAM modalities on emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school absences were inconclusive.}

While chemotherapy remains the primary form of treatment for leukemia, its effectiveness was profoundly diminished by the genetic heterogeneity and cytogenetic abnormalities of leukemic cells. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop precision medicine for leukemia with distinct genetic backgrounds. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a freshwater fish with exceptional feasibility in genome editing, is a powerful tool for rapid human cancer modeling. In the past decades, zebrafish have been adopted in modeling human leukemia, exploring the molecular mechanisms of underlying genetic abnormalities, and discovering novel therapeutic agents. Although many recurrent mutations of leukemia have been modeled in zebrafish for pathological study and drug discovery, its great potential in leukemia modeling was not yet fully exploited, particularly in precision medicine. In this review, we evaluated the current zebrafish models of leukemia/pre-leukemia and genetic techniques and discussed the potential of zebrafish models with novel techniques, which may contribute to the development of zebrafish as a disease model for precision medicine in treating leukemia.}

The recipe of Mongolian medicine Sendeng Decoction was recorded in “The Pleasure of the Viewer” compiled by Jigwood Danjinzhamusu. Mongolian medicine clinical experience proved that Sendeng Decoction had good antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatism effect. However, the mechanism of this drug in psoriasis is still unclear. In this study, imiquimod cream (IMQ) was used to construct psoriasis model in 8-week-old male BALB/c mice, and Sendeng Decoction was used to treat the mice with psoriasis. The results showed that PASI score and spleen index decreased after Sendeng Decoction treatment. Meanwhile, HE staining showed that the pathological structure was improved, flow cytometry results showed that the proportion of Treg cells increased and Th17 ​cells decreased, and results of Western blot showed that the level of p38 MAPK, p-p38 MAPK, p-STAT3 and p-JAK1 decreased observably. More importantly, the above results were most significant in Sendeng's M group, which was similar to MTX group. Our results indicated that Mongolian medicine Sendeng Decoction can effectively relieve the symptoms of psoriasis mice induced by IMQ, mainly by regulating the ratio of Th17/Treg cells through the JAK/STAT and p38 MAPK pathways to reduce the inflammatory state in mice, thereby improving the symptoms of dermatitis.}

abstract = {Background
The utilization of vitamins and dietary supplements (DSs) among consumers in Malaysia has seen a notable increase. However, there is limited research available on how pharmacists in Eastern countries manage the provision of these products.
Objective
This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of community pharmacists in Malaysia regarding the provision of counselling services on vitamins and DSs. The findings will inform education strategies in this area.
Methods
A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted from February to April 2022 using a validated online-based questionnaire. The survey was distributed to community pharmacists across Malaysia through social media channels. t-test and ANOVA test were used for data analysis.
Results
Among the 260 participants, 73.5% were categorized as having average product knowledge. Key concerns included a lack of knowledge about the indications of new products and when to discontinue their use. Regarding dosing in specific patient groups, 33.5% of pharmacists only occasionally consulted references and primarily relied on product labels. Furthermore, 29% of pharmacists believed it was unnecessary to refer patients to doctors when they experienced ongoing symptoms while taking vitamins or DSs. Interestingly, 44.6% of pharmacists believed there was a correlation between the efficacy of vitamins and their price, often recommending more expensive brands despite similar content.
Conclusion
There is an opportunity to enhance the knowledge of pharmacists in Malaysia regarding vitamins and DSs. Education interventions should focus on areas such as dosing for specific patient groups, when to discontinue products, understanding new products, evidence-based efficacy of products for specific conditions, and providing a framework for appropriate referral to support pharmacists in their practice.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Wuweiganlu (WGL) is a well-known formulation described in the “Four Medical Scriptures of Tibetan medicine”, which is mainly used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and other chronic ailments prescribed by Tibetan medicine. Nonetheless, the active constituents present in the water extracts of Wuweiganlu (WGLWE) specifically targeting arthritis treatment are largely unknown.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study is to explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of the active components in WGLWE on RA.
Materials and methods
We utilized ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) to identify the main chemical compositions of WGLWE. The polarization effect of WGLWE on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) was determined. A rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was established by injecting an emulsion of bovine type II collagen mixed with an equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant into the tail, paw and back of rats. A WGLWE-based ointment was topically applied to the legs and paws of the rats for 30 days. The rats' ankles were photographed to measure the degree of swelling. Micro-CT was used to image the knee joint and paw of rats, and the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of knee joint in rats were analyzed. High-frequency ultrasound imaging of the rat knee joint was performed to observe knee joint effusion. Further, the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and arginine (Arg-1) in CIA rats were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) co-staining were employed to detect the expression levels of inflammatory factors in synovium.
Results
A total of 28 main components were identified in WGLWE, and these compounds can directly bind to the inflammatory pathway proteins such as JAK2, NFκB and STAT3. In vitro experiments demonstrated that WGLWE promoted the transformation of M1 macrophages into M2 macrophages and suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. In vivo studies showed that WGLWE effectively reduced ankle swelling, alleviated knee joint effusion, and improved BV/TV while also reducing synovial inflammation levels. Furthermore, WGLWE compounds induced the transition of M1-type macrophages to M2-type macrophages in synovial tissue, resulting in decreased secretion of inflammatory factors TNF-α, WGLWE improved the synovial inflammatory state.
Conclusion
Our results indicated that WGLWE alleviated joint inflammation in CIA rats and the underlying mechanism may be related to inducing the transformation of bone marrow-derived M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages, leading to an increase in the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors and a decrease in pro-inflammatory factors. Therefore, WGLWE may be used as a potential herbal preparation for the treatment of RA.}

Cardiac ion channels (voltage-gated NaV, CaV, KVs, and others) synergistically shape the cardiac action potential (AP) and control the heartbeat. Dysfunction of these channels, due to genetic mutations, transcriptional or post-translational modifications, may disturb the AP and lead to arrhythmia, a major risk for CVD patients. Although there are five classes of anti-arrhythmic drugs available, they can have varying levels of efficacies and side effects on patients, possibly due to the complex pathogenesis of arrhythmias. As an alternative treatment option, Chinese herbal remedies have shown promise in regulating cardiac ion channels and providing anti-arrhythmic effects. In this review, we first discuss the role of cardiac ion channels in maintaining normal heart function and the pathogenesis of CVD, then summarize the classification of Chinese herbal compounds, and elaborate detailed mechanisms of their efficacy in regulating cardiac ion channels and in alleviating arrhythmia and CVD. We also address current limitations and opportunities for developing new anti-CVD drugs based on Chinese herbal medicines.}

Concomitant type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is frequent with a poor prognosis with high risk of comorbidities. Strict risk factor control reduces the risk for complications – yet many people do not achieve treatment targets. The complexity and fragmentation of the healthcare system may, together with the vulnerability of these patients, be a reason.
Objective
The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol of a non-randomized interventional pilot study testing the feasibility and effect of a multidisciplinary, shared care clinic using personalized medicine and coordinated care in people living with concomitant T2D and CVD.
Methods
Participants were included from the Holbaek area in Denmark. People suffered from T2DM and CVD and were dysregulated regarding to HbA1c, cholesterol, micro/macroalbuminuaria or blood pressure. Participants went through a thorough evaluation to identify their needs and resources and received consultations every three months for one year.
Results
A total of 63 participants with T2DM and CVD were enrolled in the clinic. The participants had a mean age of 69 years and a BMI of 30.9 kg/m2. Almost 50 % had heart failure, 95 % dyslipidemia and 91 % hypertension. Around 54 % received GLP-1 agonists and 39 % received SGLT-2-inhibitors.
Perspectives
To our knowledge, a similar study with a multidisciplinary, shared care, outpatient clinic treating people living with concomitant T2DM and CVD, has not been performed previously. This study will provide information about the feasibility and efficacy of a multidisciplinary clinic based on changes in cardiovascular risk factors and medication.}

Migraine is a relatively common disease that has a significant effect on the daily activities of affected individuals. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of herbal medicine (Jodeungsan, JDS) on migraine.
Methods
Sixty-four patients with migraine were recruited and randomized to either the JDS or placebo group at a 1:1 ratio. The subjects received JDS or placebo daily for four weeks. The primary outcome was a change in the number of headache attack days (HADs), and the secondary outcome measures were the headache impact test (HIT), migraine-specific quality of life (MSQoL), the deficiency and excess pattern identification questionnaire (DEPIQ), the cold and heat pattern identification questionnaire (CHPIQ), and the blood stasis pattern questionnaire (BSPQ).
Results
In all, 61 of the 64 patients took the investigational drugs for four weeks. The number of HADs did not significantly differ between the JDS and placebo groups at the end of the study. However, the HIT and MSQoL results showed significant improvement over the baseline in both groups.
Conclusions
JDS did not have a significant effect on chronic migraine. Larger studies are needed to confirm this result.

SCD remains a critical public health problem accounting for 185,000-450,000 deaths annually, representing around 7%-18% of all deaths globally. As per evidence, ∼2%-54% of sudden unexpected deaths in people under the age of 35 years fail to show evidence of structural cardiac abnormalities at autopsy, making ion channelopathies the probable causes in such cases. The most generally recognized cardiac ion channelopathies with genetic testing are long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). The substantial progress in understanding the genetics of ion channelopathies in the last 2 decades has obliged the early diagnosis and prevention of SCD to a certain extent. In this review, we analyze the critical challenges and recent advancements in the identification, risk stratification, and clinical management of potentially fatal cardiac ion channel disorders. We also emphasize the application of precision medicine (PM) and artificial intelligence (AI) for comprehending the underlying genetic mechanisms, especially the role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based platforms to unravel the primary refractory clinical problems associated with channelopathies.}

The identification of individuals with systemic sclerosis in an oligosymptomatic phase preceding the very early manifestations of the disease represents a challenge in the search for a new window of opportunity in systemic sclerosis. This phase could be identified in a clinical scenario as the pre-scleroderma phase, in which the disease would still be far from systemic sclerosis-related fibrotic or irreversible manifestations in skin or organs. In this Personal View, we discuss parameters and candidate definitions for a conceptual framework of pre-scleroderma, from the identification of populations at risk to autoantibodies and their potential functional activities. We discuss how this new paradigm of pre-scleroderma could represent a game-changing approach in the management of systemic sclerosis, allowing the treatment of patients at high risk of organ involvement or skin fibrosis before such events occur.}

It is therefore essential to carry out stress testing studies to evaluate how such medicines respond to these stresses. For this reason, in this paper we present a strategy for a comprehensive analytical characterization of a peptide and a stress testing study in which it was subjected to various stress conditions: heating at 40 °C and 60 °C, light exposure and shaking. Several complementary analytical techniques were used throughout this study: Far UV circular dichroism, intrinsic protein fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, size-exclusion chromatography and intact and peptide mapping reverse-phase chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to offer an in-depth description of the chemical structure of teduglutide peptide and its physicochemical characteristics after stress stimuli were applied to the reconstituted medicine Revestive®.}

abstract = {Background
Vulnerability to infectious diseases in refugees is dependent on country of origin, flight routes, and conditions. Information on specific medical needs of different groups of refugees is lacking. We assessed the prevalence of infectious diseases, immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases, and chronic medical conditions in children, adolescents, and adult refugees from Ukraine who arrived in Germany in 2022.
Methods
Using different media, we recruited Ukrainian refugees at 13 sites between 9–12/2022. An antigen test for acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, serologies for a range of vaccine-preventable diseases, as well as interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) for tuberculosis (TB), and SARS-CoV-2 were performed. We assessed personal and family history of chronic medical conditions, infectious diseases, vaccination status, and conditions during migration.
Results
Overall, 1793 refugees (1401 adults and 392 children/adolescents) were included. Most participants were females (n = 1307; 72·3%) and from Eastern or Southern Ukraine. TB IGRA was positive in 13% (n = 184) of the adults and in 2% (n = 7) of the children. Serology-based immunological response was insufficient in approximately 21% (360/1793) of the participants for measles, 32% (572/1793) for diphtheria, and 74% (1289/1793) for hepatitis B.
Conclusions
We show evidence of low serological response to vaccine-preventable infections and increased LTBI prevalence in Ukrainian refugees. These findings should be integrated into guidelines for screening and treatment of infectious diseases in migrants and refugees in Germany and Europe. Furthermore, low immunity for vaccine-preventable diseases in Ukrainians independent of their refugee status, calls for tailor-made communication efforts.}

abstract = {Objectives
Emergency Medicine (EM) provider experiences consulting telestroke (TS) are poorly studied. In this qualitative study, we aimed to determine how TS changes patient management and to measure TS effects on EM provider confidence with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treatment.
Materials and methods
We designed a survey for EM providers querying perceptions of TS value, confidence with treating AIS, and counterfactuals regarding what EM providers would have done without TS. Eligible EM providers participated in an audio-visual TS consult within a 6-state TS network between 11/2016–11/2017.
Results
We received 48 surveys (response rate 43%). The most common reason (71%) for using TS was tPA eligibility expert opinion. Most EM providers (94%) thought the patient/family were satisfied with TS and none felt their medical knowledge was doubted because of using TS. EM providers had high confidence in diagnosing AIS (95%) and tPA decision-making (86%), but not in determining thrombectomy eligibility (10%). Among EM providers who administered tPA, 85% said tPA would not have been given without TS consultation. TS consultation changed patient diagnosis in 60% of all patients and treatment plans in 56% of non-stroke patients. Most EM providers (86%) had increased confidence in their knowledge of future stroke patient management. Nearly all TS consults (93%) resulted in EM providers being more likely to use TS again.
Conclusions
TS consult frequently results in both patient management change and increased EM knowledge of stroke management with increased likelihood of repeat usage. Discomfort in determining eligibility for thrombectomy points to educational opportunities.}

Therefore, the development of simple and rapid methods for OPs residue monitoring is of great significance for the quality control and evaluation of TCM. In this work, a novel method was developed for the indirect determination of parathion-methyl (PM) residue in TCM by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) based on enzyme modulation. The acetylthiocholine (ATCh) can be hydrolyzed by butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) to produce thiocholine (TCh), which contains − SH that can interact with As(III) and inhibits its HG procedure, further reducing its AFS signal. However, OPs like PM can inhibit the activity of BChE to restore the AFS signal. Therefore, the indirect analysis of PM can be achieved by detecting As(III). A low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.043 μg mL−1 and a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.5% were obtained, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for the analysis of PM residue in 6 kinds of TCMs commonly used in clinical practice. This present strategy offers a unique alternative for OPs assay with high sensitivity, selectivity, and simple operation.}

The established gender gap in intensive care medicine is larger compared to other medical specialties. The aim of this study was to evaluate gender distribution in boards of intensive care medicine societies worldwide.
Methods
In this cross-sectional analysis, board members and presidents of all intensive care medicine societies associated with the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine were eligible for study inclusion. Exclusion criteria were: A) society without focus on intensive care and B) online information unavailable.
Results
In 2021, 65 presidents and 820 board members were analyzed. Ten presidents (15%) and 231 board members (28%) were women. The proportion of women presidents reached from 0% in Africa to 20% in Europe and South America. The proportion of women board members was highest in North and South America with 42% and 46% respectively and lowest in Africa (21%) and Asia (10%). In Europe, 31% of board members were women and 35% in Australia/New Zealand. Among presidents, women were underrepresented in all continents while gender distribution among board members varied significantly between countries (p < 0.0001).
Conclusion
Our analysis reveals an inequality in gender distribution in the boards of national intensive care medicine societies which varies but persists for all global regions.}

Pain after cancer remains underestimated and undertreated. Precision medicine is a recent concept that refers to the ability to classify patients into subgroups that differ in their susceptibility to, biology, or prognosis of a particular disease, or in their response to a specific treatment, and thus to tailor treatment to the individual patient characteristics. Applying this to pain after cancer, the ability to classify post-cancer pain into the three major pain phenotypes (i.e. nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain) and tailor pain treatment accordingly, is an emerging issue. This is especially relevant because available evidence suggests that nociplastic pain is present in an important subgroup of those patients experiencing post-cancer pain. The 2021 International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) clinical criteria and grading system for nociplastic pain account for the need to identify and correctly classify patients according to the pain phenotype early in their treatment. These criteria are an important step towards precision pain medicine with great potential for the field of clinical oncology. Within this framework, the Cancer Pain Phenotyping (CANPPHE) Network, an international and interdisciplinary group of oncology clinicians and researchers from seven countries, applied the 2021 IASP clinical criteria for nociplastic pain to the growing population of those experiencing post-cancer pain. A manual is provided to allow clinicians to differentiate between predominant nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic pain after cancer. A seven-step diagnostic approach is presented and illustrated using cases to enhance understanding and encourage effective implementation of this approach in clinical practice.}

Patient access to medicines in the community at end-of-life (pertaining to the last year of life) is vital for symptom control. Supply of such medicines is known to be problematic, but despite this, studies have failed to examine the issues affecting community pharmacy access to palliative medicines.
Objective
To identify community pharmacists' and pharmaceutical wholesalers'/distributors' views on supply chain processes and challenges in providing access to medicines during the last year of life, to characterise supply in this UK context.
Methods
Qualitative design, with telephone interviews analysed using Framework Analysis. Coding frames were developed iteratively with data analysed separately and then triangulated to examine differences in perspectives.
Findings
Thirty-two interviews (24 community pharmacists and 8 wholesalers/distributors) were conducted. To ensure appropriate palliative medicines were available despite occasional shortages, community pharmacists worked tirelessly. They navigated a challenging interface with wholesalers/distributors, the Drug Tariff to ensure reimbursement, and multiple systems. IT infrastructures and logistics provided by wholesalers/distributors were often helpful to supply into community pharmacies resulting in same or next day deliveries. However, the inability of manufacturers to predict operational issues or accurately forecast demand led wholesalers/distributors to encounter shortages with manufactured stock levels, reducing timely access to medicines.
Conclusions
The study identifies for the first time how palliative medicines supply into community pharmacy, can be improved. A conceptual model was developed, illustrating how influencing factors affect responsiveness and speed of medicines access for patients. Work is required to strengthen this supply chain via effective relationship-building and information-sharing, to prevent patients facing disruptions in access to palliative medicines at end-of-life.}

For evidence mapping, we created a two-dimensional bubble plot that included the width and strength of the evidence for each CAM intervention and specific outcome.
Results
In this overview, we identified 24 SRs (21 for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) medications, two for vitamin D and one for home-based activity). From the included SRs, TCM herbal medications were reported to show good results in decreasing the rate of disease progression (relative risk (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence intervals (CI) [0.20, 0.44]), time to the resolution of fever (standard mean difference (SMD) -0.98, 95% CI [-1.78, -0.17]) and rate of progression to severe COVID-19 cases (RR 0.34, 95% CI [0.18, 0.65]), but the evidence for other interventions did not show effectiveness with certainty. Gastric disturbance was a major adverse event of TCM medications.
Conclusion
There is evidence that TCM medications are effective in the symptom management of COVID-19 patients. However, evidence for the effectiveness of most CAM interventions still needs evaluation.}

With the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the growing attention of people around the world to the use of traditional and complementary medicines to control of the disease, evaluating the effectiveness of these treatments has received special attention.
Aim
This study aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of a barley-based (Hordeum vulgare) remedy combined with conventional medicine in comparison to the conventional therapy in confirmed COVID-19 patients.
Materials and methods
Seventy COVID-19 patients were randomly divided into barley-based remedy plus conventional medicine (barley-based remedy group) and conventional therapy (control group). Both groups were treated for 5 days. The outcomes were oxygen saturation, main symptoms (fever, respiratory rate, cough, and fatigue), and laboratory data (lymphocytic count, and CRP); they were measured for 6 days.
Results
In comparison to the control group, the oxygen saturation level in the barley-based remedy group significantly increased, from the second day of the intervention (P < 0.05). The herbal remedy significantly improved fatigue from the third day (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the severity and frequency of cough between the groups were not significantly different. The herbal remedy had no significant effect on the CRP and the lymphocytic count of every time points of measurement. The average of respiratory rate and temperature of patients were in the normal range in both groups during the intervention.
Conclusion
Barley-based remedy could significantly enhance the blood oxygen saturation and reduce fatigue. However, it needs to be confirmed by large sample size trials.}

Inhibiting the apoptosis of SCs through various pathological pathways in a high-glucose environment plays an important role in developing DPN. Therefore, inhibiting the apoptosis of SCs can be a novel treatment strategy for DPN. Previous studies have indicated the potential of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating DPN. In this study, we have reviewed the effects of CHM (both monomers and extracts) on the apoptosis of SCs by interfering with the production of advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathological pathways.

Burkina Faso has a legal and ethical framework governing traditional medicine. However, compliance with these regulations by traditional medical knowledge holders, which is crucial to the progress of traditional medicine in Burkina Faso, is not documented. The objective of this study was to assess the regulatory and ethical compliance of traditional health practitioners' practices in Burkina Faso.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study, conducted from October 1 to November 30, 2020, among traditional health practitioners in four randomly selected health districts: Nongr-Massom (Centre region), Tenkodogo (Centre-East region), Diapaga (East region) and Dafra (Hauts–Bassins region). An anonymous structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, data on compliance with regulations concerning the practice, establishments and traditional medicines, and data on collaboration between traditional practitioners and biomedical practitioners.
Results
Sixty-seven (67) traditional health practitioners, with an average age of 56 years, the majority being men (71.6%) participated in the study. Herbalists (43.3%) were the main professional category. The majority of traditional practitioners (82%) did not have a license to practice and most traditional medicine establishments (92%) did not have a license to open. The main reason for these non-compliances was the inadequacy of the regulations in relation to the contextual realities (61.6%).
Conclusion
The regulations on traditional medicine are poorly known and complied with by traditional health practitioners in Burkina Faso. This calls for deep reflection on the legal future of traditional medicine in Burkina Faso.}

Despite the current transfusion guidelines recommending a restrictive transfusion strategy in stable patients, the clinical practice varies according to physicians' experience and implementation of patient blood management. This study aimed to evaluate the anemia management and transfusion strategy in anemic elderly hospitalized and the impact of an educational program. We enrolled ≥ 65-year-old patients who presented or developed anemia during admission to a tertiary hospital's internal medicine and geriatric units. Patients with onco-hematological disorders, hemoglobinopathies and active bleeding were excluded. In the first phase, anemia management was monitored. In the second phase, the six participating units were divided into two groups and two arms: Educational (Edu) and non-educational (NE). During this phase, physicians in the Edu arm underwent an educational program for the appropriate use of transfusion and anemia management. In the third phase, anemia management was monitored. Comorbidities, demographic and hematological characteristics were similar in all phases and arms. The percentages of transfused patients during phase 1 were 27.7% in NE and 18.5% in the Edu arm. During phase 3, it decreased to 21.4% in the NE and 13.6% in the Edu arm. Hemoglobin levels at discharge and after 30 days were higher in the Edu group despite reduced use of blood transfusion. In conclusion, a more restrictive strategy was comparable or superior to the more liberal one in terms of clinical outcomes, with the advantage of saving red blood cell units and reducing related side effects.}

Previous recommendations for cesarean delivery rates at a country level in the 10–15% range are currently unrealistic, and the proposed concept that striving to achieve specific rates is not important has resulted in a confusing message reaching healthcare professionals and the public. It is important to have a clear understanding of when cesarean delivery rates are deviating from internationally acceptable ranges, to trigger the implementation of healthcare policies needed to correct this problem. Based on currently existing scientific evidence, we recommend that cesarean delivery rates at a country level should be in the 15–20% range. This advice is based on the demonstration of decreased maternal and neonatal mortalities when national cesarean delivery rates rise to circa 15%, but values exceeding 20% are not associated with further benefits. It is also based on real-world experiences from northern European countries, where cesarean delivery rates in the 15–20% range are associated with some of the best maternal and perinatal quality indicators in the world. With the increase in cesarean delivery rates projected for the coming years, experience in provision of intrapartum care may come under threat in many hospitals, and recovering from this situation is likely to be a major challenge. Professional and scientific societies, together with healthcare authorities and governments need to prioritize actions to reverse the upward trend in cesarean delivery rates observed in many countries, and to strive to achieve values as close as possible to the recommended range.}

Autophagy is a cellular self-catabolism process, which is critical to protect cellular homeostasis against harmful conditions. Emerging evidence suggest that dysregulated autophagy is involved in the development of AS. Therefore, pharmacological interventions have been developed to inhibit the AS via autophagy induction. Among various AS treating methods, herbal medicines and natural products have been applied as effective complementary and alternative medicines to ameliorate AS and its associated cardiovascular disease. Recently, mounting evidence revealed that natural bioactive compounds from herbs and natural products could induce autophagy to suppress the occurrence and development of AS, by promoting cholesterol efflux, reducing plaque inflammation, and inhibiting apoptosis or senescence. In the present review, we highlight recent findings regarding possible effects and molecular mechanism of natural compounds in autophagy-targeted mitigation of atherosclerosis, aiming to provide new potential therapeutic strategies for the atherosclerosis treatment preclinically and clinically.}

Obesity is a common metabolic dysfunction disease, which is highly correlated with the homeostasis of gut microbiota (GM). The dysregulation of GM on energy metabolism, immune response, insulin resistance and endogenous metabolites (e.g., short chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids) can affect the occurrence and development of obesity. Herbal medicine (HM) has particular advantages and definite therapeutic effects in the prevention and treatment of obesity, but its underlying mechanism is not fully clear.
Aim of the study
In this review, the representative basic and clinical anti-obesity studies associated with the homeostasis of GM regulated by HM including active components, single herb and herbal formulae were summarized and discussed. We aim to provide a state of art reference for the mechanism research of HM in treating obesity and the further development of new anti-obesity drugs.
Materials and methods
The relevant information was collected by searching keywords (obesity, herbal medicine, prescriptions, mechanism, GM, short chain fatty acids, etc.) from scientiﬁc databases (CNKI, PubMed, SpringerLink, Web of Science, SciFinder, etc.).
Results
GM dysbiosis did occur in obese patients and mice, whiles the intervention of GM could ameliorate the condition of obesity. HM (e.g., berberine, Ephedra sinica, Rehjnannia glutinosa, and Buzhong Yiqi prescription) has been proved to possess a certain regulation on GM and an explicit effect on obesity, but the exact mechanism of HM in improving obesity by regulating GM remains superficial.
Conclusion
GM is involved in HM against obesity, and GM can be a novel therapeutic target for treating obesity.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic is a serious challenge to human medicines. Modern medicine (MM) has been excellent in identifying the virus, sequencing its mutants, and monitoring the pandemic progress. However, due to lack of effective antivirals in the first two years of the pandemic, MM treated COVID-19 mainly by conventional supportive care with limited efficacy. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been actively participating the control of COVID-19, and the combination of TCM and conventional supportive care has shown better efficacies than the conventional care alone. Purpose: Clinical studies have shown that TCM treats COVID-19 through a holistic action, such as repairing organ injuries, anti-inflammation, immunoregulation and antiviral activities, etc. However, it is not clear how TCM is able to achieve these effects, and the scientific interpretation of TCM theories is lacking. This review aims to elucidate the scientific basis underlying TCM theories in the context of host-pathogen interaction and provide a working model for TCM in treating infectious diseases. Procedure: This review focuses on the essential components of host-pathogen interaction and performs an in-depth analysis of current literatures, including TCM theories and clinical studies as well as the most recent findings of tolerance (self-healing) mechanism in biomedical sciences. Conclusion: TCM treats COVID-19 through a holistic regulation of host responses, particularly by promoting patients’ self-healing power and balancing immune responses. Compared to the pathogen-centered MM, the host-centered TCM doesn't require specific antivirals and has less side-effects and drug resistance. This review provides a scientific insight into the mechanism of TCM and sheds a light on the prospective integration of TCM and MM for future challenges.}

At first, volatiles and semi-volatiles were enriched from Chaihu Shugan Wan (CSW) by head space- solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME), and analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (HS-SPME-GC × GC). In succession, the inter-group and intra-group differences were distinguished by multi-component spectral correlative chromatography (MSCC). Facing the challenge of data complexity, some 50 contours were selected to indicate various medicinal materials through zone- specific ion filtration in 2D fingerprints. Among them, the known compounds were proven to be effective in “soothing liver-qi stagnation” through PubChem and other bioinformatic tools. Thirdly, Speeded Up Robust Features- Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (SURF-FLANN) algorithm was utilized to estimate the pairwise similarities for the simplified fingerprints. In this procedure, the methodological examination was further made through the simulated images, including comparison with other algorithms, consideration for image complexity, and calculation of positives / negatives. At last, the similarities of six sample fingerprints were scored successfully. In summary, image similarity strategy based on zone- specific ion filtration can provide a viable solution for rapidly evaluating 2D fingerprints of extract fractions from Chinese patent medicines.}

abstract = {In pharmaceutical warehousing operations, a scientific and reasonable medicine and shelf matching strategy can improve medicine shelving efficiency and manual work efficiency. However, the traditional matching strategy has the problems of static matching and low matching efficiency, so this paper proposes the matching algorithm for drugs and shelves based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and Bayesian convolutional neural network (FAHP-BCNN). First, we propose a drug-shelf matching degree model and discuss the influence of the dynamic matching process on the matching results by studying two parts: the attribute matching degree and the dynamic matching influence degree. Secondly, this paper quantitatively assessed the importance of the two matches by means of the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. Finally, we mapped the massive matching information onto Bayesian convolutional neural network nodes, constructed a dynamic matching network model, and obtained competitive matching strategies and results. The experimental results show that the FAHP-BCNN algorithm exhibits better matching results in all three scenarios with different quantity ratios of drugs and shelf matching. Compared with the fixed cargo matching strategy of the ABC classification method, the FAHP-BCNN algorithm shows excellent performance in both the manual walking distance index and fatigue index. In summary, the drug-shelf matching algorithm based on FAHP-BCNN is effective and can provide theoretical support for pharmaceutical warehousing enterprises to perform drug-shelf matching.}

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of severity, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, NAFLD is closely linked to obesity and tightly interrelated with insulin resistance and T2DM. T2DM and NAFLD (T2DM-NAFLD) are called as the Xike Rixijing Disease and Tonglaga Indigestion Disease respectively, in Mongolian medicine. Xike Rixijing Disease maybe develop into Tonglaga Indigestion Disease. Forturnately many Mongolian medicines show efficient treatment of T2DM-NAFLD, such as Agriophyllum squarrosum, Haliyasu (dried powder of camel placenta), Digeda-4 (herbs of Lomatogonium carinthiacum, rhizomata of Coptis chinensis, ripe fruits of Gardenia jasminoides, herbs of Dianthus superbus), Guangmingyan Siwei Decoction Powder (Halite, ripe fruits of Terminalia chebula, rhizomata of Zingiber officinale, fruit clusters of Piper longum), Tonglaga-5 (ripe fruits of Punica granatum, barks of Cinnamomum cassia, ripe fruits of Amomum kravanh, fruit clusters of Piper longum, flowers of Carthamus tinctorius), Tegexidegeqi (rhizomata of Inula helenium, ripe fruits of Gardenia jasminoides, rhizomata of Platycodon grandiflorum, rhizomata of Coptis chinensis, heartwood of Caesalpinia sappan), Ligan Shiliu Bawei San (ripe fruits of Punica granatum, barks of Cinnamomum cassia, ripe fruits of Amomum kravanh, fruit clusters of Piper longum, flowers of Carthamus tinctorius, ripe fruits of Amomum tsao-ko, rhizomata of Zingiber officinale), etc. Principles of Mongolian medicine in treating diseases: by balancing “three essences or roots” and “seven elements”, strengthening liver and kidney function, transporting nutrients to enhance physical strength and disease resistance, and combined with drugs for comprehensive conditioning treatment. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this review, we prospect that Mongolian medicines might be a promising treatment for T2DM-NAFLD by activating P2X7R/NLRP3/NF-κB inflammatory pathway via lipid-sensitive nuclear receptors (i.e., FXR and LXR).}

Despite its description as a cornerstone of a healthcare provider's professional identity, the impact of compassionate care on various aspects of medicine has been poorly defined. In this review, we aimed to elucidate the role of compassionate care in various aspects of medicine and healthcare delivery.
Methods
Four databases were searched using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol for a literature review regarding compassionate care and its intersection with medical education, patient-provider communication, patient care, and clinical outcomes, patient and provider characteristics, telemedicine and artificial intelligence, caregiver compassion fatigue, and cost of care.
Results
Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. Analysis revealed that clinical outcomes are correlated with the degree of patients’ perception of empathy and compassion from their providers. Along with enhanced patient outcomes, compassionate care was shown to reduce the costs of care, compassion fatigue and burnout, and the number of malpractice claims. However, compassion can be perceived differently among patients of various cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Compassion training sessions can be implemented among residents in surgical and nonsurgical medical specialties to improve perceived compassion. Furthermore, the use of telehealth modalities may positively or negatively impact compassionate care, requiring further exploration.
Conclusions
Compassionate care plays a crucial role in improving patient care and clinical outcomes while reducing caregiver burnout and the risk of malpractice litigation. However, a lack of compassion training and caregiver compassion fatigue may detract from the delivery of effective compassionate care.}

A total of 51 articles were reviewed from an initial set of 1253 articles following an inclusion-exclusion criterion. As an outcome, this review study found that falsified and counterfeit medicines have become a crucial issue for research and investigation over time. Various advanced technologies (like Blockchain, IoT, RFID, image processing, pattern recognition, etc.) are being used to fight against this issue efficiently. The review also reveals future research opportunities to facilitate the existing initiatives for preventing medicine counterfeit that includes: exploring the implications of emerging technologies; discovering the contaminated point over the medicine supply chain; investigating the less emphasized concern of counterfeit and falsified medicines; exploring all possible use-cases or features of any digital solution to reduce falsified and counterfeit medicines; and the development of counterfeit/ falsified incidents reporting system. Thus, the implication of this study is to discover the research gaps and provide future research directions focusing on the prevention of usage of falsified and counterfeit medicines through the effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).}

Surgeons comprise only 2% of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (HPM) board-certified physicians. Little is known about the motivations of individuals who pursue this combined training or the perceived benefits of this pathway. This study aimed to capture the pathways and experiences of HPM fellowship trained surgeons and to establish recommendations for surgical trainees who may benefit from HPM fellowship training.
Design
A qualitative study was designed using semi-structured zoom interviews that elicited experiences of HPM trained surgeons. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
Setting
Researchers were from the University of Kansas School of Medicine and the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Participants were trained and worked across the United States in a variety of settings.
Participants
Eligibility included completion of a 1-year HPM fellowship and training in general surgery, general obstetrics and gynecology, or affiliated subspecialties.
Results
Seventeen interviews were conducted. All participants expressed satisfaction with their HPM fellowship training. Four themes emerged as recommendations for surgeons to pursue HPM fellowship training: 1) a commitment to joining the HPM workforce, 2) becoming ambassadors for HPM and surgical culture change, 3) desire for advanced communication and symptom management skills at the specialist level, and 4) specialist level HPM skills may enhance surgical career.
Conclusions
HPM fellowship training is achievable through multiple pathways for surgeons from a variety of training backgrounds.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause a considerable burden of morbidity and mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to safe, effective, quality-assured, and affordable essential medicines is variable. We aimed to review the existing literature relating to the availability, cost, and affordability of WHO's essential medicines for asthma and COPD in LMICs.
Methods
A systematic review of the literature was done by searching seven databases to identify research articles published between Jan 1, 2010, and June 30, 2022. Studies on named essential medicines for asthma and COPD in LMICs were included and review articles were excluded. Two authors (MS and HT) screened and extracted data independently, and assessed bias using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. The main outcome measures were availability (WHO target of 80%), cost (compared with median price ratio [MPR]), and affordability (number of days of work of the lowest paid government worker). The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021281069.
Findings
Of 4742 studies identified, 29 met the inclusion criteria providing data from 60 LMICs. All studies had a low risk of bias. Six of 58 countries met the 80% availability target for short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs), three of 48 countries for inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and zero of four for inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta-agonist (ICS–LABA) combination inhalers. Costs were reported by 12 studies: the range of MPRs was 1·1–351 for SABAs, 2·6–340 for ICSs, and 24 for ICS–LABAs in the single study reporting this. Affordability was calculated in ten studies: SABA inhalers typically cost around 1–4 days’ wages, ICSs 2–7 days, and ICS–LABAs at least 6 days. The included studies showed heterogeneity.
Interpretation
Essential medicines for treating asthma and COPD were largely unavailable and unaffordable in LMICs. This was particularly true for inhalers containing corticosteroids.
Funding

Ultra performance liquid chromatography combined with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for separation and ESI detection. An internal standard isotope matching calibration was used for quantification purposes to compensate for matrix effects. The limits of detection (LOD) of 16 mycotoxins ranged from 0.1 to 6.0 μg/kg. The linear coefficients (R2) were ≥0.996 in the linear range from 10.0 to 200 μg/L. The recoveries of the 16 mycotoxins ranged from 90.1% to 105.8%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 1.3% to 4.1%. Thirteen TCMs from five representative medicinal parts were selected and tested under the best sample preparation procedure and chromatographic analysis conditions. The results showed that the method could improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the sample analysis, improve the selectivity and reproducibility of the decolorization and purification of TCMs, which is suitable for the practical application of mycotoxin in trace analysis. This method can also provide a new idea for accurate, efficient, rapid and multi-component online detection of mycotoxins for quality and safety control of TCMs.}

The exact etiology is unclear; however, heredity, infection, and the external environment are considered to be influencing factors. One of the important medicinal agents for treating arthritis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is Angelicae Pubescentis Radix (APR), the dried root of Angelica sinensis Maxim. f. biserrata Shan et Yuan, which belongs to the Umbelliferae family. Here, we reviewed the recent Chinese and global literature on APR in RA treatment to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of APR in treating RA. Classic works and applications, chemical constituents, inflammatory factors, and related signaling pathways were summarized to consolidate the current status of research on the subject. This detailed account of APR mechanisms at the molecular and cellular level will serve as a theoretical basis for research into novel pharmaceuticals for treating RA. Treatment using TCM takes into account multiple pathways, links, and targets; therefore, integrative approaches involving different signaling pathways in RA should be considered in the future. In conclusion, this review summarizes the relevant mechanisms of APR involved in improving RA via regulation of inflammatory factors and signal pathways and provides guidance for its clinical application in RA treatment.}

abstract = {Background Across Canadian Internal Medicine residency programs, a resident's clinical exposure to hematologic disorders is highly heterogeneous depending on the residency program's curriculum, ethnic diversity of the local patient population, and access to resources. Despite this variability in clinical exposure to hematology, there is a paucity of data assessing Internal Medicine residents' competence in the various subspecialties of hematology and whether they are fulfilling the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons' expected competencies by the end of residency 1. Through this study, our primary aim was to assess Canadian Internal Medicine residents' perceptions of their hematology training to identify gaps in hematology education in residency curricula. Methods We administered a cross-sectional survey using REDCap to all Internal Medicine residents (PGY1 to PGY5) from participating sites across Canada. The survey was distributed to residents electronically by email. To increase response rates, the survey was distributed three times (every 2 weeks) over a 6-week period. An incentive ($10 Starbucks gift card) was provided to improve response rates. The survey questions were designed based on the Royal College objectives which outline expected competencies by the end of Internal Medicine residency (Table 1). It consisted of 16 questions assessing 4 domains: respondent demographics, competence in diagnosis and management of specific hematologic disorders, competence in management of hematologic emergencies, and resident perceptions on hematology education in their program. Survey responses were anonymous and consisted of a combination of dichotomous (yes/no) and ordinal variables (Likert scale). The study was approved by the University of Toronto Research and Ethics Board (REB). Generalized linear regression analysis was used to compare survey questions between residents in different subgroups. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Least square mean (LSM) difference (with standard error SE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, with positive LSM indicating a higher Likert score. Results Of the 17 Internal Medicine programs that were invited to participate, 13 programs participated in the survey. 208 residents responded, with 92.31% (192/208) complete responses and 7.69% (16/208) incomplete responses. The overall response rate was 15.02% (208/1,385), with breakdown as follows: 31.5% (436/1,385) PGY1s, 30.5% (423/1,385) PGY2s, 30.9% (428/1,385) PGY3s, 4.5% (62/1,385) PGY4s, and 1.6% (22/1,385) PGY5s. 84.46% (163/208) of residents felt that there was a need for more hematology education in their residency program (Table 2). Specifically, residents felt that there was a need for more education in thrombosis (62.5%, 120/208), hemostasis (75.5%, 145/208), apheresis (75.0%, 144/208), sickle cell disease (79.2%, 152/208), transfusion medicine (84.4%, 162/208), and malignant hematology (78.7%, 151/208). A simulation/workshop was rated to be the most beneficial intervention (mean score of 4.25 +/- 0.80 on Likert scale) for learning. Conclusion Based on a cross-national survey of Internal Medicine residents in Canada, there are significant gaps in hematology education in Canadian Internal Medicine residency programs, most pronounced in transfusion medicine, sickle cell disease, and hemostasis. Interventions targeting these gaps should be designed to improve competence in the diagnosis and management of hematologic disorders and emergencies. References 1.

abstract = {Background
Good patient access to medicines at home during the last 12 months of life is critical for effective symptom control, prevention of distress and avoidance of unscheduled and urgent care.
Objectives
To undertake an evaluation of patient and carer access to medicines at end-of-life within the context of models of service delivery.
Design
Evaluative, mixed method case studies of service delivery models, including cost analysis. The unit of analysis was the service delivery model, with embedded sub-units of analysis.
Setting
(i) General Practitioner services (ii) Palliative care clinical nurse specialist prescribers (iii) a 24/7 palliative care telephone support line service.
Participants
Healthcare professionals delivering end-of-life care; patients living at home, in the last 12 months of life, and their carers.
Methods
Within each case: Patients/carers completed a structured log on medicines access experiences over an 8-week period. Logs were used as an aide memoire to sequential, semi-structured interviews with patients/carers at study entry, and at four and eight weeks. Healthcare professionals took part in semi-structured interviews focused on their experiences of facilitating access to medicines, including barriers, and facilitating factors. Data on prescribed medicines were extracted from patient records. Detailed contextual data on each case were also collected from a range of documents. Patient, carer and healthcare professional interview data were analysed using Framework Analysis to identify main themes. We estimated prescription costs and budget impact analysis of the different service models. Data were triangulated within each case. Cross-case comparison and logic models were employed to enable systematic comparisons across service delivery types.
Findings
Accessing medicines is a process characterised by complexity and systems inter-dependency requiring considerable co-ordination work by patients, carers and healthcare professionals. Case studies highlighted differences in speed and ease of access to medicines across service delivery models. Key issues were diversifying the prescriber workforce, the importance of continuity of relationships and team integration, access to electronic prescribing systems, shared records and improved community pharmacy stock. Per patient prescription cost differentials between services were modest but were substantial when accounting for the eligible population over the medium term.
Conclusions
Experiences of medicines access would be improved through increasing numbers of nurse and pharmacist prescribers, and improving shared inter-professional access to electronic prescribing systems and patient records, within care delivery systems that prioritise continuity of relationships. Community pharmacy stock of palliative care medicines also needs to become more reliable.}

abstract = {Purpose
To determine the most important factors to patients across the United States in selecting an orthopaedic sports medicine surgeon.
Methods
In this cross-sectional survey study, adult U.S. residents were surveyed using Amazon Mechanical Turk, a validated survey tool. Data included demographics and the relative importance of both pre-office and in-office factors that determine how patients select an orthopaedic sports medicine surgeon. Results were compiled, and factors were compared by patient demographics.
Results
Of 1,074 respondents, 56.3% were male, and 60.0% were 25 to 40 years old. Responses were geographically diverse. The most important factors in selecting a sports medicine surgeon (graded on a 0-10 scale) were surgeon professionalism and personality (6.6), quality of the hospital/office facilities (6.4), and how much time the surgeon spends with the patient (6.4). Each of these in-office factors were more important than pre-office factors, the most important of which were reputation of the surgeon’s hospital or group (6.3), surgeon’s reviews on medical review websites (6.2), and surgeon’s educational background (6.0). The least important factors were surgeon’s sex (3.7), marketing of the surgeon (4.2), and surgeon’s social media accounts (4.3). A social media account was taken into consideration at least “a little” by nearly two-thirds of respondents. The most preferred surgeon personality was a balance of professional and lighthearted (66.9%), with strictly professional (27.6%) or largely lighthearted (5.6%) less preferred.
Conclusions
The most important factors to patients in selecting their orthopaedic sports medicine surgeon, regardless of patient sex, race, or geography, are related to the patient’s in-office experience, including surgeon’s professionalism/personality, how much time the surgeon spends with the patient, and quality of the hospital/office facilities. Surgeons should consider prioritizing a professional office environment and taking the time to get to know patients for the benefit of their patients and their practice.
Clinical Relevance
The market for orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons is competitive. It is important to know what qualities of a surgeon and his or her practice are important to patients.}

Here, functional kiwi peel composite, manganese dioxide decorated kiwi peel powder (MKPP), is proposed for the removal of Pb2+ effectively. The adsorption of Pb2+ in aqueous solution is a highly selective and endothermic process and kinetically follows a pseudo-second-order model, which can reach equilibrium with the capacity of 192.7 mg/g within 10 min. Comprehensive factors of hydration energy, charge-to-radius ratio and softness of Pb2+ make a stronger affinity between MKPP and Pb2+. The possible adsorption mechanism involves covalent bond, electrostatic force and chelation, etc. MKPP can be efficiently regenerated and reused with high adsorption efficiency after five cycles. Besides, MKPP can remove over 97% of Pb2+ from real water samples. MKPP can also alleviate lead poisoning to a certain extent and make the Pb level of TCM extract meet the safety standard. This work highlights that MKPP is a promising adsorbent for the removal of Pb2+ and provides an efficient strategy for reusing kiwi peel as well as dealing with the problem of Pb pollution.}

The Science Citation Index, Expanded of the Web of Science was used to identify the top 100 articles with the highest normalized citation counts per year. The search was conducted on April 9, 2022, using the search topic “bibliometric” and including publications from 2019 to 2021. The results substantiated the need for a standardized reporting guideline for bibliometric research. Specifically, among the 25 proposed items in the PRIBA, only five were consistently reported across all articles examined. Further, 11 items were reported by at least 80% of the articles, while nine items were reported by less than 80% of the articles. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the reporting practices of bibliometric studies in the field of health and medicine are in need of improvement. Future research should be conducted to refine the PRIBA guidelines.}

A wealth of omics technologies, including bulk and single-cell omics approaches, have empowered to characterize different molecular layers at unprecedented scale and resolution, providing a holistic view of tumor behavior. Multi-omics analysis allows systematic interrogation of various molecular information at each biological layer while posing tricky challenges regarding how to extract valuable insights from the exponentially increasing amount of multi-omics data. Therefore, efficient algorithms are needed to reduce the dimensionality of the data while simultaneously dissecting the mysteries behind the complex biological processes of cancer. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated the ability to analyze complementary multi-modal data streams within the oncology realm. The coincident development of multi-omics technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms has fuelled the development of cancer precision medicine. Here, we present state-of-the-art omics technologies and outline a roadmap of multi-omics integration analysis using an artificial intelligence strategy. The advances made using artificial intelligence-based multi-omics approaches are described, especially concerning early cancer screening, diagnosis, response assessment, and prognosis prediction. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced in multi-omics analysis, along with tentative future trends in this field. With the increasing application of artificial intelligence in multi-omics analysis, we anticipate a shifting paradigm in precision medicine becoming driven by artificial intelligence-based multi-omics technologies.}

A total of 138 compounds, including ginsenosides, phenylethanol glycosides, iridoids, alkaloids, ionones and others, were identified in accordance with their retention times, accurate masses and characteristic MS/MS fragment patterns. Moreover, considering the active components and characteristic components of KSLP, the extraction process of KSLP was optimized, and the quantitative analysis by UPLC/QQQ-MS/MS of 13 compounds in KSLP was established. The method was stable and sensitive, and could be used for the quality control of KSLP. Then, the pharmacokinetic study was carried out by further refining the components of KSLP. Besides, quantitative method for 6 compounds in rat plasma was validated and developed by UPLC/QQQ-MS/MS. The established approach was successfully applied to characterize the pharmacokinetic features of components in KSLP and it was found that the absorption and elimination of ginsenosides in KSLP was slow. Altogether, this study laid a solid foundation and provided theoretical guidance for further clarification of bioactive components of KSLP.}

1. List 5 mental health competencies in which they already have expertise. 2. Identify 2 potential sources for further learning when a physician has a relative lack of expertise in a mental health competency (i.e. a licensed clinical social worker on their existing clinical team, journal articles in the palliative medicine or mental health literature, a consult-liaison psychiatrist with shared patient populations, etc).
Key Message
Hospice and palliative medicine physicians aim to support patients’ whole-person quality of life, but our training emphasizes physical symptoms. We used an expert panel to develop primary mental health competencies for palliative care physicians, which will undergo iterative rounds of voting from a larger stakeholder cohort for prioritization.
Introduction/Context
Psychological and psychiatric care is a core domain of palliative care. Palliative care clinicians manage common psychological and psychiatric symptoms and use concepts from mental health in serious illness communication. Despite growing interest in the mental health aspects of palliative care, recent data demonstrate that training in mental health for hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) physician fellows is variable. Few guidelines exist to define scope of practice and educational goals. The lack of operationalized criteria to guide training of HPM physicians is a barrier to upskilling the HPM workforce and meeting the mental health needs of patients with serious illness.
Objective
To delineate preliminary HPM physician competencies in the psychological and psychiatric aspects of palliative care.
Methods
We used a purposive sampling strategy to convene a cohort of interdisciplinary experts in various domains of mental health and palliative care including experts in palliative care social work, psychology, bereavement, geriatric psychiatry, psycho-oncology, addiction medicine, and medical education. Our expert panel collaboratively created a framework and proposed competencies, which were then iteratively refined by the first and senior authors (LP, DS) through individual meetings with each group member.
Results
Leveraging the input of the expert panel, an organizational framework was developed. Competencies were organized into (A) psychological foundations of serious illness (18 competencies and sub-competencies), (B) diagnosis and management of mental health disorders in serious illness (44 competencies and sub-competencies), and (C) systems-based practice (8 competencies and sub-competencies). These proposed competencies will undergo vetting by a larger stakeholder cohort to identify those deemed most important.
Conclusion
We present initial HPM physician competencies in psychological and psychiatric care, a highly significant but under-delineated domain of HPM practice. These competencies will undergo further vetting to identify priorities for developing educational content and to help define scope of practice.

Unused materials and medicines in the hospital environment can evolve to disposal, without having been used, and these represent a problem that needs to be more closely analyzed. This study evaluated the unused materials and medicines management, focusing on those discarded as waste without use. A cross-sectional study was done with data including all unused material and medicines generated by the hospital, considering the records of the years 2015–2019. The main analyzed variables were: disposal records (number); healthcare waste type (material or medication), based on classification; indication of use; year of disposal; quantity discarded (in kilograms); reason for disposal (inability to use or expiration date); cost of acquisition and final destination per year. Total cost of discarded items was USD 108,722.41, with the higher value in 2016 (USD 47,686.71) and the lower in 2017 (USD 1028.40). Over the years, data suggested an increased tendency of unused materials discharged and a decreased tendency to medicines. There was also a trend toward an increase in discards due to the impossibility of using materials and medicines, and a reduction in discards due to expiration date. Finally, there is a need to improve information systems and strengthen educational practices aiming at making more robust the organizational management process.}

abstract = {Rationale
Sedative-hypnotic drugs (SHDs) used for insomnia are recommended for short-term use owing to concerns regarding abuse and dependence. Nevertheless, drug discontinuation is challenging owing to rebound insomnia that occurs when the SHD is ceased. Therefore, a strategy is required to reduce or discontinue SHDs, while minimizing rebound insomnia.
Patient concerns
The present report discusses the cases of a 72-year-old man and 27-year-old man with insomnia. Both patients had been taking SHDs for more than 2 months.
Diagnoses
Both patients were diagnosed with primary insomnia.
Interventions and outcomes
After 2 weeks of classical conditioning (CC) using Hwangryunhaedok-tang (HHT), both patients succeeded in tapering SHD; the Korean version of the insomnia severity index of patient 1 dropped from 14 to 5, and that of patient 2 dropped from 28 to 11. In the final follow-up, the index dropped to 2 and 3, respectively.
Lessons
The CC, a concept emerging in psychology, could be a new strategy for tapering drugs. In this case, SHDs, which had been taken for a long time, were successfully reduced or discontinued through CC using HHT. Herbal medicine such as HHT is selected as a neutral stimulus for CC because the risk of rebound phenomenon is low as the compounds of herbal medicine have high structural similarities with human metabolites. Both patients in this study reported no particular challenges when HHT was discontinued. However, further studies are needed that will assist in tapering anticonvulsants or steroids as well as SHDs.}

abstract = {Background
Inflammation is a double-edged sword in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The global rise in the prevalence of T2DM in one hand, and poor disease control with currently-available treatments on the other hand, along with an increased tendency towards the use of natural products make scientists seek herbal medicines for the management of diabetes and its complications by reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker.
Purpose
To systematically review the literature to identify the efficacy of various medicinal plants with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties considering their effect on CRP in animal models of T2DM.
Study design
systematic review.
Methods
Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochran Library were searched using the search terms “herbal medicine”, “diabetes”, “c-reactive protein”, “antioxidants” till August 2021. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE's) tool. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO with an ID number CRD42020207190. A manual search to detect any articles not found in the databases was also made. The identified studies were then critically reviewed and relevant data were extracted and summarized.
Results
Among total of 9904 primarily-retrieved articles, twenty-three experimental studies were finally included. Our data indicated that numerous herbal medicines, compared to placebo or hypoglycemic medications, are effective in treatment of diabetes and its complications through decreasing CRP concentrations and oxidative stresses levels. Medicinal plants including Psidium guajava L., Punica granatum L., Ginkgo biloba L., Punica granatum L., Dianthus superbusn L.. Moreover, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, Curcuma longa L., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Morus alba L., and Ficus racemosa L. demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in animal models of diabetes.
Conclusion
Hypoglycemic medicinal plants discussed in this review seem to be promising regulators of CRP, and oxidative stress. Thus, these plants are suitable candidates for management of diabetes’ complications. Nevertheless, further high-quality in vivo studies and clinical trials are required to confirm these effects.}

Medication-related services are provided by sports medicine organizations at all levels of competition; however, no studies have been conducted to date that have been aimed at evaluating the medication-related needs among members of each organization, the challenges associated with meeting these needs, and the potential utilization of pharmacists to facilitate these services for athletes.
Objectives
To explore the medication-related needs within sports medicine organizations and identify where services provided by a pharmacist may assist in reaching organizational goals.
Methods
Qualitative semistructured group interviews were utilized to identify the medication-related needs of sports medicine organizations in the U.S. Organizations, including orthopedic centers, sports medicine clinics, training centers, and athletic departments were recruited via email. A survey and a set of sample questions were sent to each participant to gather demographic information and allow time for the participant to reflect on their specific organization’s medication-related needs in preparation for the interviews. A discussion guide was created to explore each organization’s overarching medication-related functions and the challenges and successes related to their current policies and procedures regarding their medication-related needs. Each interview was conducted virtually, recorded, and transcribed into text. A thematic analysis was conducted by a primary and secondary coder. Themes and subthemes were identified from the codes and defined.
Results
Nine organizations were recruited for participation. Of these, individuals from 3 Division 1 university-based athletic programs were interviewed. Twenty-one individuals participated across all 3 organizations including 16 athletic trainers, 4 physicians, and 1 dietitian. The thematic analysis revealed the following themes: Medication-Related Responsibilities, Barriers to Optimizing Medication Use, Contributions to Successful Implementation of the Medication-Related Services, and Opportunities to Improve Medication-Related Needs. Themes were reduced to subthemes to further describe the medication-related needs within each organization.
Conclusion
Division 1 university-based athletic programs have medication-related needs and challenges that have the potential to be enhanced by services provided by pharmacists.}

This condition presents a substantial risk for severe maternal morbidity and mortality because of challenges in securing a prompt diagnosis. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy diagnosis, although a correct and timely determination can be difficult. Surgical, medical, and minimally invasive therapies have been described for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy management, but the optimal treatment is unknown. Patients who decline treatment of a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy should be counseled regarding the risk for severe morbidity. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: we recommend against expectant management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (GRADE 1B); we suggest that operative resection (with transvaginal or laparoscopic approaches when possible) or ultrasound-guided uterine aspiration be considered for the surgical management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy and that sharp curettage alone be avoided (GRADE 2C); we suggest intragestational methotrexate for the medical treatment of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, with or without other treatment modalities (GRADE 2C); we recommend that systemic methotrexate alone not be used to treat cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (GRADE 1C); in patients who choose expectant management and continuation of a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, we recommend repeated cesarean delivery between 34 0/7 and 35 6/7 weeks of gestation (GRADE 1C); we recommend that patients with a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy be advised on the risks of another pregnancy and counseled regarding effective contraceptive methods, including long-acting reversible contraception and permanent contraception (GRADE 1C).}

Mandrake (Mandragora sp.) is one of the most famous medicinal plants. It has been in continuous medical use throughout written history and is still in use today in popular medicine.
Aim of the study
Mandrake derived drugs once played an important role in medicine and in magical practices. Today, the role of mandrake in popular medicine is marginal. However, natural products present in mandrake such as atropine and scopolamine, as well as their semi synthetic derivatives continue to hold and important role in medicine. Here we aim to trace the development of historical rationales and scientific events that led to the abandonment of mandrake as a medicine.
Materials and methods
We review the medicinal uses of mandrake drugs since antiquity in an attempt to pinpoint use patterns that were popular in certain periods of time and others that are more general. We compare the uses from the native territories to those from regions where the plant got introduced and use literature reporting mandrake's chemistry and pharmacology in order to explain the diachronic changes of use patterns.
Results and conclusion
We found information about 88 different medicinal uses for mandrake, grouped into 39 conditions. According to the number of different medicinal uses, the most versatile period was the medieval (37), followed by the Renaissance (31), the classical (27), and the modern period (21). Considering the higher number of textual sources and use-records collected for the Renaissance period, the decrease of versatility in comparison to the medieval period appears robust. This seems to indicate a more consolidated use pattern, that might be conditioned by the reproduction of classic textual sources as well as by a less experimental approach and reduced popularity of mandrake in medicine. The introduction of the volatile anaesthetics with more reliable narcotic effects set the seal on using mandrake in surgery but opened the way for atropine being used as a prophylactic and antidote during surgical interventions.}
