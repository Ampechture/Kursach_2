Due to the unique characteristics of the paediatric population, adverse effects may occur to substances generally thought safe. The proportion of topical nasal medicines approved for paediatric use and the prevalence and labelling of excipients with known effect (EKE) in these products were compared in Serbia as a non-EU country and Croatia and Slovenia as EU countries. The study was designed as a post-authorization safety study and safety of excipients was considered in accordance with recommendations of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). More than 90% of topical nasal medicines registered in the three countries were approved for paediatric use and more than half of these paediatric medicines contained EKE that may cause adverse effects. Benzalkonium chloride was found in 52.38%, 55.81% and 59.09% of these products in Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, respectively. Propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, ethanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and boric acid were also present in a few analysed preparations. A significant number of EKE labelling deficiencies were detected in all three countries, hindering healthcare professionals’ access to information needed for adequate patient counselling. A revision of the nasal paediatric medicines’ PLs and SmPCs is recommended.}

The ethnic knowledge on controlling and treating internal parasites is of value to sustainable and organic product production which are essential for long-term prosperity of goat farmers. Using participatory approaches, this study identified and documented popular plants used by farmers to control internal parasites in goats in the Ngamiland region of Botswana. A total of 120 communal farmers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of demographic parameters and ethnobotanical information. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and the most popular plants were identified using fidelity levels (FL). Most of the informants were secondary educated males of 50 to 60 years and relied on livestock for their livelihoods. It was recorded that a total of 13 local plant species from 11 families are commonly used in the treatment of intestinal parasites in goats. The plant family Fabaceae (27.3 %) was common among the farmers. The roots (76.9 %) were the most frequently used plant part while decoction (46 %) was popular in medicinal preparations. The prepared plant-based medicine is often administered orally. The highest FL values were found for the following plant species; Terminalia sericea, Gnidia capitata and Aloe ferox, scoring 89.3 %, 88.0 % and 86.3 %, respectively. The safety and efficacy of these plants should be validated to inform strategic utilization and alternative cost-effective strategy in managing internal parasites in Botswana.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore the difference in rates and reasons for disclosure of either conventional or complementary medicine (CM) to healthcare practitioners between people living with sleep disorders (SDs) and those without SDs.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey (N = 2019 adults) that measured sociodemographic characteristics, health status, health service utilisation, health literacy and health communication (medicine disclosure) of a representative sample of Australians was conducted. Data from participants reporting an SD (n = 265) were compared to those not reporting an SD to assess measures of health communication and disclosure about medicine use.
Results
Overall, rates of medicine disclosure to both conventional and CM practitioners were high, in respondents with (70%) and without an SD (57%). Those reporting an SD had higher expectations of their conventional health practitioner’s knowledge of CM, associated clinical decision-making skills, and approval of CM use, and held a higher degree of concern about drug interactions (P < 0.05). The main reasons cited for disclosing CM use to conventional health practitioners and conventional medicine use to CM practitioners were “I want them to fully understand my health status” and “I was concerned about drug interactions with the CMs used.”
Conclusion
The high rate of medicine use disclosure by people with SDs is driven by an intention to inform their healthcare practitioner about their health status and concerns about potential medicine interactions. Therefore, research about the expectations that people with an SD have of their conventional healthcare practitioners’ knowledge of CM and CM-drug interactions requires further examination. Likewise, further examination of CM practitioner’s conventional medicine knowledge is encouraged.}

In prostate cancer (PCa), questions remain on indications for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and PSMA radioligand therapy, integration of advanced imaging in nomogram-based decision-making, dosimetry, and development of new theranostic applications.
Objective
We aimed to critically review developments in molecular hybrid imaging and systemic radioligand therapy, to reach a multidisciplinary consensus on the current state of the art in PCa.
Design, setting, and participants
The results of a systematic literature search informed a two-round Delphi process with a panel of 28 PCa experts in medical or radiation oncology, urology, radiology, medical physics, and nuclear medicine. The results were discussed and ratified in a consensus meeting.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
Forty-eight statements were scored on a Likert agreement scale and six as ranking options. Agreement statements were analysed using the RAND appropriateness method. Ranking statements were analysed using weighted summed scores.
Results and limitations
After two Delphi rounds, there was consensus on 42/48 (87.5%) of the statements. The expert panel recommends PSMA PET to be used for staging the majority of patients with unfavourable intermediate and high risk, and for restaging of suspected recurrent PCa. There was consensus that oligometastatic disease should be defined as up to five metastases, even using advanced imaging modalities. The group agreed that [177Lu]Lu-PSMA should not be administered only after progression to cabazitaxel and that [223Ra]RaCl2 remains a valid therapeutic option in bone-only metastatic castration-resistant PCa. Uncertainty remains on various topics, including the need for concordant findings on both [18F]FDG and PSMA PET prior to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy.
Conclusions
There was a high proportion of agreement among a panel of experts on the use of molecular imaging and theranostics in PCa. Although consensus statements cannot replace high-certainty evidence, these can aid in the interpretation and dissemination of best practice from centres of excellence to the wider clinical community.
Patient summary
There are situations when dealing with prostate cancer (PCa) where both the doctors who diagnose and track the disease development and response to treatment, and those who give treatments are unsure about what the best course of action is. Examples include what methods they should use to obtain images of the cancer and what to do when the cancer has returned or spread. We reviewed published research studies and provided a summary to a panel of experts in imaging and treating PCa. We also used the research summary to develop a questionnaire whereby we asked the experts to state whether or not they agreed with a list of statements. We used these results to provide guidance to other health care professionals on how best to image men with PCa and what treatments to give, when, and in what order, based on the information the images provide.}

The data were analyzed using Vosviewer and biblioshiny of R Studio software to see the topic trend, citation, and number of book pages. Literature review also used to see the depiction of disease inside samples. Result showed that authors' keywords, heart and disease were closely related with a keyword chicken embryo. Moreover, each book get at least 10–11 citations globally. Moreover, repetitive keywords used in abstract of samples of this study were cells/cell, gene, and human. Those repetitive words were closely related to a word disease. It could be means that cell of the embryo of chicken also played the important role in determining its resistance against disease.}

Using multivariate cluster analysis, we initially group consumers according to psychographic and behavioral variables. Next, we performed an analysis of variance, including demographic variables, to assess the significant differences between the clusters. We also used the Tukey's post-hoc test to compare cluster averages. As a result, we found three behavioral profiles: consumers who correctly dispose of medicines regardless of incentives; consumers who incorrectly dispose of medicines if no incentive is provided; and consumers who incorrectly dispose of medicines even when incentives are provided. Based on clusters' specificities and some tendencies of Evolutionary Theory, we provide propositions for stakeholders to stimulate the pro-environmental disposal behavior of consumers from each cluster. Thus, to encourage the proper disposal of medicines, we present options for regulations and persuasive marketing practices comprising communication and short-term incentives. The propositions also contribute to consolidating the elements provided in the recently structured Brazilian legislation regarding the medicines reverse logistics system.}

abstract = {Purpose
Women remain underrepresented in medical physics in the United States, and determinants of persisting disparities remain unclear. Here, we performed a detailed investigation of American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) membership trajectories to evaluate trends in Full membership with respect to gender, age, and highest degree.
Methods and Materials
Membership data, including gender, date of birth, highest degree, membership type, and years of active membership for 1993 to 2023 were obtained from AAPM. Group 1 included Full members who joined AAPM in 1993 or later. A subset of group 1 including only members who joined and left AAPM since 1993 (former members, group 1F) was used to calculate age at membership cessation and duration. Results were compared by gender and highest degree. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was also used to evaluate membership “survival” by age and highest degree.
Results
Complete data were available for 6647 current and former Full members (group 1), including 2211 former members (group 1F). On average, women became Full members at a significantly younger age than men (34.6 vs 37.5 years of age, P < .001) and ended their memberships (if applicable) at a significantly younger age than men (46.1 vs 50.1 years of age, P < .001). The Kaplan-Meier “survival” analysis showed that for a given age, women were at a significantly greater risk of membership cessation than men, and women with master's degrees had the lowest membership survival of any gender/degree subgroup. When analyzing by membership duration, there was no difference in survival by gender alone. Still, women with PhDs were found to have the greatest membership survival among gender/degree subgroups.
Conclusions
Both gender and degree type influenced AAPM membership trajectories. Although we have offered a discussion of possible explanations, qualitative data collected from both continuing and departing AAPM members will be critical in the ongoing journey toward gender parity in the profession of medical physics.}

Despite such advancement in regenerative engineering, the clinical translation remains a major challenge. In the stance of personalized treatment, the recent progress in bioelectronic medicine likewise evolved as another important research domain of larger significance for human healthcare. Over the last several years, our research group has adopted biomaterials-based regenerative engineering strategies using innovative bioelectronic stimulation protocols based on either electric or magnetic stimuli to direct cellular differentiation on engineered biomaterials with a range of elastic stiffness or functional properties (electroactivity/magnetoactivity). In this article, the role of bioelectronics in stem cell-based regenerative engineering has been critically analyzed to stimulate futuristic research in the treatment of degenerative diseases as well as to address some fundamental questions in stem cell biology. Built on the concepts from two independent biomedical research domains (regenerative engineering and bioelectronic medicine), we propose a converging research theme, ‘Regenerative Bioelectronics’. Further, a series of recommendations have been put forward to address the current challenges in bridging the gap in stem cell therapy and bioelectronic medicine. Enacting the strategic blueprint of bioelectronic-based regenerative engineering can potentially deliver the unmet clinical needs for treating incurable degenerative diseases.}

Although the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescription of Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS) presents substantial clinical efficacy and promising clinical prospects, the safety of DSS and its extracts have been inadequately investigated. The larva-adult duality of the zebrafish model offers a more efficient approach for evaluating the safety of herbal preparations in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology.
Aim of the study
To investigate the acute toxicity of the extract derived from Danggui Shaoyao San, a traditional Chinese medicine preparation, on both Danio rerio embryos and adult organisms.
Materials and methods
The components of DSS were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The hatching rate of Danio rerio juveniles with different concentrations of DSS was calculated and the morphological changes of juveniles after administration were observed through a microscope. The behavioral trajectory of the adult fish was recorded by the observation tower of the automated Danio rerio analysis system, and DSS's effects on the behavior was analyzed. The pathological changes of Danio rerio gills, livers, kidneys, intestines and spermaries were examined using HE staining.
Results
Compared with the control group, 25, 50 and 100 mg/L of DSS did not elicit any significant impacts on the hatching rate and morphology. Both 200 mg/L and the propylene glycol 2% reduced the hatching rate and caused the morphological teratogenic changes of the juvenile fish. The dosage of DSS below 100 mg/L had no discernible effect on the behavior of the adult fish, whereas the application of propylene glycol 2% was found to stimulate the adult fish, resulting in a notable increase in high-speed movement distance. 100 mg/L DSS group was not observed to cause any noticeable damage to the gills, livers, intestines and spermaries of Danio rerio, only mild nephrotoxicity was detected. The propylene glycol 2% group was found to result in pathological changes such as hyperplasia of epithelial cells on secondary lamellae, liver cell outline loss or atypia, tubal disorganization, goblet cell hypertrophy and irregularly arranged spermatozoa.
Conclusion
A viable approach for conducting toxicological studies on TCM preparations was developed and tested in this research. The findings showed that Danggui Shaoyao San has minimal acute toxicity to embryos and adult organisms at concentrations up to 100 mg/L. These results indicate that Danggui Shaoyao San is a safe TCM preparation.}

The Effectiveness of Quality Incentive Payments in General Practice (EQuIP-GP) study investigated whether targeted financial incentives promoting access to a preferred general practitioner, post-hospitalisation follow-up and longer consultations, increase patient-perceived relational continuity in primary care. Secondary outcomes included the use of medicines.
Objective
To evaluate whether introducing a general practice-level service model incorporating enrolment and continuous and graded quality improvement incentives influenced the total prescriptions written and potentially inappropriate prescribing of medicines.
Methods
A 12-month cluster-randomised controlled trial, whereby participating patients within intervention practices were offered enrolment with a preferred general practitioner, a minimum of three longer appointments, and review within seven days of hospital admission or emergency department attendance. Control practice patients received usual care. Differences between intervention and control groups pre-post trial for total prescriptions were analysed, as an indicator of polypharmacy, along with prescriptions for four groups of drugs known to have common quality of medicines issues: antibiotics, benzodiazepines, opioids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
Results
A total of 774 patients, aged 18–65 years with a chronic illness or aged over 65 years, from 34 general practices in metropolitan, regional and rural Australia participated. The mean number of medicine prescriptions per month at baseline was 4.19 (SD 3.27) and 4.34 (SD 3.75) in the control and intervention arms, respectively, with no significant between-group differences in changes pre-post trial and also no significant between-group or within-group differences of prescription rates for antibiotics, benzodiazepines, opioids or PPIs.
Conclusions
Total prescribing volume and the use of key medicines were not influenced by quality-linked financial incentives for offering longer consultations and early post-hospital review for enrolled patients.}

With the detailed knowledge of these bacterial metabolites, extensive applications have been provided in the medicine, food, and drug industry. Bacterial biopolymers, including polysaccharides, polyamides, polyphosphates, polyesters, and enzymes, with vast diversity and desirable properties, are the most frequently used products in TE. Herein we have summarized the potential applications of different types of polymers with bacterial origin in TE for therapeutic purposes. Novel bacterial-based antimicrobial, anti-cancerous, anti-fungal peptides, quorum sensing agents, or other active molecules can be used as additive biomaterials to the scaffolds. Some challenges in scaling up and growth maintenance are among the issues to consider when applying bacteria as biomaterial factories.

Results of the current study showed positive awareness/acceptability and attitudes among medicine students toward Arabicized medical terms. The most common perceived barriers toward Arabicization among medicine students were that teaching and assessments (exams, quizzes, projects, etc.) are in English and the unavailability of valuable medical references that use Arabic terms. Several demographic variables were associated with acceptability, attitudes, and/or barriers toward Arabicized terms among medicine students, including gender, income, place of living, level of medicine study, having more than one mother tongue, and language proficiency. Medicine university professors showed acceptable awareness and generally positive attitudes toward Arabicized terms. The most frequently cited barriers among medicine professors were in concordance with those pointed out by medicine students, which indicates the validity of these barriers. Gender and English language proficiency were the only factors associated with acceptability, attitudes, and/or barriers toward Arabicized terms among medicine university professors. In conclusion, the current study indicated a generally more suitable environment for utilizing Arabicized medical terms, especially when delineating major barriers facing medicine students and professors.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Shortages and unequal access to anticancer medicines for children and adolescents are a reality in Europe. The aim of the European Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOPE) Essential Anticancer Medicines Project was to provide a list of anticancer medicines that are considered essential in the treatment of paediatric cancers to help ensure their continuous access to all children and adolescents with cancer across Europe.
Methods
This pan-European project, done between Jan 20, 2020, and Feb 18, 2022, was designed to be a systematic collection and review of treatment protocols and strategies that are used to treat childhood cancer in Europe. We formed 16 working groups on the basis of paediatric cancer types, and which were based on the existing SIOPE Clinical Trial Groups. Workings groups consisted of representatives from the SIOPE Clinical Trial Groups, Young SIOPE members, and senior paediatric oncology experts. Each group collected existing treatment protocols that are used to treat the respective cancer types in Europe. Medicines from the standard group of each protocol were extracted. For medicines not on the WHO Essential Medicines List for children (EMLc) 2017, working groups did a literature search to determine whether the medicines should be defined as essential, promising, or neither essential nor promising. Each group provided an individual summary, and all medicines that were considered essential by at least one group were combined in a joint list.
Findings
The working groups identified 73 treatment protocols used in Europe and defined 66 medicines as essential. For several newer medicines, such as kinase inhibitors or tisagenlecleucel, the supporting evidence was insufficient to consider them essential, so these medicines were defined as promising. 25 medicines were considered promising by at least one working group. 22 (33%) of the 66 essential and none of the promising medicines were included in the WHO EMLc 2017. The WHO EMLc 2021 included two new medicines (everolimus and vinorelbine) following applications we made as a result of this project.
Interpretation
Medicines that were defined as essential within this project should be available for the treatment of childhood and adolescent cancer continuously and across Europe. This list can be used to support and guide stakeholders and policy makers in negotiations on a national and European level regarding shortages, accessibility, and affordability of these medicines.
Funding
None.}

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Diabetes Association recommend a glucose tolerance test at 4 to 12 weeks postpartum for all patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. Despite these recommendations, postpartum screening rates are typically <50%, representing a major healthcare “quality gap.” The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine proposes a uniform metric that identifies the percentage of persons with gestational diabetes mellitus who completed a 75-g, 2-hour glucose tolerance test within 12 weeks after delivery. The metric is designed to be measured using diagnosis and procedure codes in payor claims data. Barriers to screening are discussed. Possible uses of the metric for quality improvement projects are outlined. Increasing the rate of postpartum diabetes screening should facilitate timely referral to implement lifestyle modifications, medication, and long-term follow-up. Use of the metric in financial incentive programs is discouraged at this time.}

In Persian Medicine (PM), diagnosis of physiological characteristics and disease symptoms is achieved by clinical indices. This study aimed to present selected tongue images as the first educational model in this area of PM.
Methods
In this Delphi study, tongue diagnostic indices were extracted from reliable PM sources. Twenty PM experts were interviewed regarding their clinical experience on the subject. Tongue photographs were taken, standardized and printed to the extent of data saturation. In face-to-face interviews with experts, they selected some images and described their characteristics. Images selected by at least 25% of the interviewees were allocated to reach a consensus on gathered opinions. Subsequently, images with highest agreement among experts regarding a specific diagnostic index were presented as an educational model.
Results
Tongue color, thickness and color of coating, size, shape, moisture, dryness and fissures are most commonly used by PM physicians. Out of 221 standardized images in the first stage, 54 and then 13 images were selected as typical educational models.
Conclusion
As the initial steps of standardization of PM diagnostic indices, selected tongue images can be used for educational and research purposes in PM diagnostics. However, future studies are need to increase the accuracy of diagnostic models.}

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Baimai ointment in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH).
Methods
This study presents a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial protocol. A total of 194 cases will be employed, with a 1:1 allocation ratio for each group. Patients will receive either Baimai ointment or placebo over a 14-day treatment period, which will be followed by a 1-week follow-up period. Visual analogue scale scores will be used for the level of pain, the Japanese Orthopedic Association score will be measured primarily to determine the functional status, the Likert scale will be graded for the level of numbness, and rescue therapy use and compliance with health education will be recorded. Laboratory tests and adverse event records will also be applied for safety assessments.
Discussion
In summary, this trial will assess the clinical efficacy and safety of Baimai ointment for LDH for the first time. The use of a placebo has the advantage of precluding anticipatory biases resulting from inadequate blinding. Outcome assessors, data managers, statisticians, and all related study staff will be blinded to avoid any bias caused by subjective factors in the study subjects and investigators. Valuable information for clinical LDH treatment and future research on Baimai ointment will be generated from the findings.}

Sri Lankan traditional medicine uses Vernonia zeylanica and Mallotus repandus broadly for the treatment of a multitude of disease conditions, including wound healing.
Aim of the study
We aimed to scientifically validate the safety and efficacy of wound healing of an aqueous distillate of Vernonia zeylanica and Mallotus repandus (ADVM) mature leaves, tested on primary human dermal fibroblasts.
Materials and methods
Human dermal fibroblasts isolated from clinical waste from circumcision surgery were characterized by flowcytometry and trilineage differentiation. The MTT dye reduction assay, and the ex vivo wound healing scratch assay established wound healing properties of ADVM using the primary human dermal fibroblast cell line. Upregulation of genes associated with wound healing (MMP3, COL3A1, TGFB1, FGF2) were confirmed by RT qPCR. GC-MS chromatography evaluated the phytochemical composition of ADVM.
Results
Compared to the synthetic stimulant, β fibroblast growth factor, ADVM at 0.25% concentration on the primary dermal fibroblast cell line exhibited significant ex vivo, (i) 1.7-fold % cell viability (178.7% vs 304.3 %, p < 0.001), (ii) twofold greater % wound closure (%WC) potential (47.74% vs 80.11%, p < 0.001), and (iii) higher rate of % WC (3.251 vs 3.456 % WC/h, p < 0.05), sans cyto-genotoxicity. Up regulated expression of FGF2, TGFB1, COL3A1 and MMP3, genes associated with wound healing, confirmed effective stimulation of pathways of the three overlapping phases of wound healing (P < 0.05). GC-MS profile of ADVM characterized four methyl esters, which may be posited as wound healing phytochemicals.
Conclusions
Exceeding traditional medicine claims, the ex vivo demonstration of rapid skin regeneration, reiterated by upregulated expression of genes related to wound healing pathways, sans cytotoxicity, propounds ADVM, cued from traditional medicine, as a potential safe and effective natural stimulant for rapid wound-healing. Additionally, it may serve as an effective proliferative stimulant of dermal fibroblasts for cell therapy, with potential in reparative and regenerative therapy of skin disorders.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most serious and irreversible liver damage associated with alcohol consumption. Flos Puerariae and Semen Hoveniae are traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) for dispelling the effects of alcohol. Many studies have shown that the combination of two medicinal materials has the enhanced effect of treating ALD.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacological effects of Flos Puerariae-Semen Hoveniae medicine pair, to elucidate its action mechanism in the treatment of alcohol-induced BRL-3A cells, and to reveal the active ingredients in the medicine pair that exerted pharmacological effects by spectrum-effect relationship study.
Materials and methods
Firstly, MTT assays, ELISA, fluorescence probe analysis, and Western blot were employed to study the underlying mechanisms of the medicine pair in alcohol-induced BRL-3A cells by examining pharmacodynamic indexes and related protein expression. Secondly, HPLC method was established for chemical chromatograms of the medicine pair with different ratios and the sample extracted by different solvents. Then, principal component analysis, pearson bivariate correlation analysis and grey relational analysis were applied for development of the spectrum-effect correlation between pharmacodynamic indexes and HPLC chromatograms. Moreover, prototype components and their metabolites in vivo were identified by the HPLC-MS method.
Results
Flos Puerariae-Semen Hoveniae medicine pair remarkably increased cell viability, decreased the activity of ALT, AST, TC and TG, reduced the generation of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MDA and ROS, increased the activity of SOD and GSH-Px, reduced protein expression of CYP2E1, compared with alcohol-induced BRL-3A cells. The medicine pair modulated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways by up-regulating the levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR. Also, the results of the spectrum-effect relationship study showed that P1 (chlorogenic acid), P3 (daidzin), P4 (6″-O-xylosyl-glycitin), P5 (glycitin), P6 (unknown), P7 (unknown), P9 (unknown), P10 (6″-O-xylosyl-tectoridin), P12 (tectoridin) and P23 (unknown) can be considered as the main components of the medicine pair in the treatment of ALD. Furthermore, 6″-O-xylosyl-tectoridin, tectoridin, daidzin, 6″-O-xylosyl-glycitin and glycitin can be absorbed into the blood and showed clear metabolic and excretion behaviors in rats.
Conclusion
In this study, the hepatoprotective effects and the pharmacology mechanism of Flos Puerariae-Semen Hoveniae medicine pair in alcohol-induced BRL-3A cells were initially investigated and revealed. Through the spectrum-effect relationship study, the potential pharmacodynamic constituents such as daidzin, 6″-O-xylosyl-glycitin, 6″-O-xylosyl-tectoridin, glycitin, and tectoridin exert pharmacological effects on alcohol-induced oxidative stress and inflammation by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. This study provided experimental basis and data support for revealing the pharmacodynamic substance basis and pharmacology mechanism in the treatment of ALD. Moreover, it provides a robust mean of exploring the primary effective components responsible for the bioactivity of complicated TCM.}

abstract = {Background
Guidance addressing atopic dermatitis (AD) management, last issued in 2012 by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force, requires updating as a result of new treatments and improved guideline and evidence synthesis methodology.
Objective
To produce evidence-based guidelines that support patients, clinicians, and other decision-makers in the optimal treatment of AD.
Methods
A multidisciplinary guideline panel consisting of patients and caregivers, AD experts (dermatology and allergy/immunology), primary care practitioners (family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine), and allied health professionals (psychology, pharmacy, nursing) convened, prioritized equity, diversity, and inclusiveness, and implemented management strategies to minimize influence of conflicts of interest. The Evidence in Allergy Group supported guideline development by performing systematic evidence reviews, facilitating guideline processes, and holding focus groups with patient and family partners. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach informed rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. Evidence-to-decision frameworks, subjected to public comment, translated evidence to recommendations using trustworthy guideline principles.
Results
The panel agreed on 25 recommendations to gain and maintain control of AD for patients with mild, moderate, and severe AD. The eAppendix provides practical information and implementation considerations in 1-2 page patient-friendly handouts.
Conclusion
These evidence-based recommendations address optimal use of (1) topical treatments (barrier moisturization devices, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors [crisaborole], topical JAK inhibitors, occlusive [wet wrap] therapy, adjunctive antimicrobials, application frequency, maintenance therapy), (2) dilute bleach baths, (3) dietary avoidance/elimination, (4) allergen immunotherapy, and (5) systemic treatments (biologics/monoclonal antibodies, small molecule immunosuppressants [cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, JAK inhibitors], and systemic corticosteroids) and UV phototherapy (light therapy).}

abstract = {Background
Herbal medicine Oryeongsan (ORS), also known as Wulingsan in Chinese, has been used for the treatment of impaired body fluid balance. However, the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. The purpose of the present study was to identify the actions of ORS on the renal excretory function and blood pressure (BP) and to define the mechanisms involved in association with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and natriuretic peptide system (NPS) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), an animal model of human essential hypertension.
Methods
Changes in urine volume (UV), excretion of electrolytes including Na+ (urinary excretion of Na+ (UNaV)) were measured. RT-PCR was performed to trace the changes in expression of RAS, NPS and sodium (Na+)-hydrogen (H+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the renal cortex.
Results
In the SHR treated with vehicle (SHR-V) group, UV and UNaV were suppressed and the Na+ balance was maintained at the higher levels leading to an increase in BP compared to WKY-V group. These were accompanied by an increase in NHE3 expression with an accentuation of angiotensin I converting enzyme-angiotensin II type 1 (ACE-AT1) receptor and concurrent suppression of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor/ACE2-Mas receptor expression in the renal cortex. Chronic treatment with ORS increased UV and UNaV, and decreased the Na+ and water balance with a decrease in BP in the ORS-treated SHR-ORS group compared to SHR-V. These were accompanied by a decrease in NHE3 expression with a suppression of ACE-AT1 receptor and concurrent accentuation of AT2/ACE2-Mas receptor.
Conclusion
The present study shows that ORS reduced BP with a decrease in Na+ and water retention by a suppression of NHE3 expression via modulation of RAS and NPS in SHR. The present study provides pharmacological rationale for the treatment of hypertension with ORS in SHR.}

abstract = {Background
There are limited longitudinal data on national patterns of opioid agonist treatment (OAT). This study describes 10-year trends in the sales of OAT medicines in Australia.
Methods
A descriptive and time-series analysis of methadone, sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (+/−naloxone), and long-acting injectable (LAI) buprenorphine sold in Australia between 2013 and 2022 was performed. Total units sold were converted into an estimate of the number of clients that could be treated over a 28-day period with that amount of medicine (‘client-months’).
Results
Between January 2013 and December 2022, the estimated number of client-months on: any OAT increased by 50 % to 53,501, methadone decreased (−8.5%), SL buprenorphine increased (+78%), and LAI buprenorphine increased substantially after September 2019. In January 2013, 78 % of OAT client-months received methadone. By December 2022, 48 % received methadone, 26 % SL buprenorphine, and 26 % LAI buprenorphine. Between 2013 to 2022, OAT client-months per capita were highest in the state of New South Wales. Over the study period, greater increases in OAT were observed in very remote areas (88%) compared to major cities (53%). The number of client-months in non-community pharmacy settings remained stable from 2013 to 2019/20, before increasing markedly. The introduction of LAI buprenorphine was associated with an immediate, sustained increase of 1,636 OAT client-months, and further increases of 190 OAT client-months each month.
Conclusion
Patterns of OAT have shifted over the last 10-years with buprenorphine (SL/LAI) now the most common OAT used in Australia. The introduction of LAI buprenorphine has expanded OAT access, particularly in non-community pharmacy settings, and in remote areas.}

abstract = {Introduction
Integrative Medicine (IM) use and efficacy is poorly defined in those with plasma cell disorders (PCD). A 69-question survey on the subject was hosted on HealthTree.org for 3 months.
Method
The survey included questions about complementary practice use, PHQ-2 score, quality of life, and more. Mean outcome values were compared between IM users and non-users. Proportions of supplement users and IM patients were compared between patients currently on myeloma specific treatment and patients not currently on treatment.
Results
The top 10 IM modalities reported among 178 participants were aerobic exercise (83 %), nutrition (67 %), natural products (60 %), strength exercise (52 %), support groups (48 %), breathing exercises (44 %), meditation (42 %), yoga (40 %), mindfulness-based stress reduction (38 %), and massage (38 %). The survey showed most patients participated in IM modalities, though they felt uncomfortable discussing them with their oncologist. Participant characteristics were compared between groups (users and non-users) using two-sample t-tests and chi-square tests. Use of vitamin C (3.6 vs. 2.7; p = 0.01), medical marijuana (4.0 vs. 2.9; p = 0.03), support groups (3.4 vs. 2.7; p = 0.04), and massage (3.5 vs. 2.7; p = 0.03) were associated with a higher quality of life scores on MDA-SI MM. There were no other significant associations between supplement use or IM practices and the MDA-SI MM, brief fatigue inventory, or PHQ-2.
Conclusion
This study provides a foundation in the understanding of IM use in PCD, but more research is needed to evaluate individual IM interventions and their efficacy.}

While the field of narrative medicine is well-developed generally, formal review of the state of poetry as a healing modality is limited. Poetry in the medical humanities literature has often been described by its indefinability as much as by its impact on healing. The power of poetry in healthcare is thought to be multi-faceted and deserves to be explored further. Poetry can be medicine for both patient and clinician. “Poetic Medicine” is a modality that has been utilized for the healing of grief, loss, wounds of the psyche and spirit, and as a process for expanding resiliency in healthcare—applications that are particularly relevant to the practice of hospice and palliative medicine—for patient and clinician alike. While numerous approaches share common themes, current programs bringing poetry into healthcare have been operating largely in isolation from each other—with a lack of national consensus on definitions or structures of interventions. Such isolation is a major restriction to the study and growth of Poetic Medicine. While it is not known with certitude, the number of Poetic Medicine programs in healthcare in the United States appears to be growing. In this paper, we propose an initial framework to define the role and impact of poetry in healthcare and then describe two different, well-established Poetic Medicine programs in the United States.}

With the advance of technology added to each phone “generation,” new technical capabilities are loaded within phones, which unlock opportunities for novel health monitoring. Coupled with this is an increasing array of health-related apps for health monitoring, assessment, and intervention. As sophistication in hardware and software evolved, the cell phone has morphed into a vital medical device. In parallel with technological advances, are price reductions and worldwide ubiquity of phones that extend to most people on the planet. This parallel evolution has allowed the cellphone to be adapted to issues of self-monitoring and prevention, remote care, health disparities of access, and opportunities for improved follow-up and care, that is otherwise difficult with conventional hospital and clinic visits and infrequent due to health system overload. In this chapter, we discuss the progression of the phone from a land-based wired system to a cellular and smartphone status, with on-board sensing and processing capabilities. Categories of cell phone-based health utility are outlined, addressing both consumer as well as prescriptive applications. Specific examples of phone-based use for motion and related clinical physical examination skills developed by our group are presented as well. Challenges and future directions for smartphone-based systems are also addressed, with an eye for utilization towards the advance of precision medicine as well as health for all.}

Biological data mining using the omics approach reveals the genetic and molecular makeup at the individual level, leading to the revolution of personalized and precision medicine. The multiomics profile of individual patients, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and other omics, are powerful tools for understanding disease pathology and its underlying causes along with disease monitoring, prevention, and precise treatment. The revolution of personalized diagnostics medicines significantly benefited medical care, especially in molecular diagnostic disease propagation and personalized treatment. This also paved the way to discover rare genetic disorders and their underlying genetic causes. Individual profiles are insufficient to provide statistical conclusions for a disease condition like mutation, aberrant expression of a gene or dysregulated biological pathways, which requires a large dataset to prove clinical relevance. Hence, publicly available high-throughput datasets (TGCA, genome-wide association studies, GTEX, etc.) of the same disease from different populations provide the apparent conclusions. Combining these datasets empower the statistical significance of disease conditions. Furthermore, the individual profile, in parallel with the cohort studies, is essential for developing a diagnostic medicine approach which can be utilized both at the individual and cohort level. Moreover, omics-level data information can transform conventional symptoms-oriented medicine toward early diagnostics, prognosis, and prevention. However, these approaches rely on costly research instruments and computational frameworks, increasing the cost of studies. This is the major limitation of omics-associated studies. In addition, other limitations are correct data analysis pipeline, correct tissue sample collection, etc. In this chapter, we discussed the integration of clinical data of individuals and groups with patient-specific omics datasets to develop personalized and diagnostic medicine considering challenges, opportunities, and prospects.}

abstract = {Introduction
Functional dyspepsia (FD) is characterized by one or more of the four bothersome symptoms of postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning. FD is divided into two subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome which are overlapping in some cases. Complementary and alternative medicine therapy has been frequently used to improve FD. In Persian medicine, temperament plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders. This study aimed to evaluate association between body temperament, stomach dystemperament, and FD subtypes.
Methods
120 patients aged 20 to 60 years with a clinical diagnosis of FD given by a gastroenterologist were enroled in this cross-sectional study. FD subgroups and symptoms were evaluated via symptom severity and symptom frequency scales. The body temperament was assessed via the Salmannejad questionnaire, and the stomach dystemperament was determined by three Persian medicine specialists. Chi-square test, Pearson correlation, likelihood ratio, and linear-by-linear tests were used for evaluating the correlations between the variables.
Results
The wet body temperament was significantly higher in women than men (P = 0.021). No significant association was observed between body temperament and FD subtypes (P > 0.05). Cold-wet stomach dystemperaments were significantly associated with postprandial distress syndrome (P < 0.001). Beside, cold-dry and hot-dry dystemperaments showed significant associations with epigastric pain syndrome (P < 0.001). Only two symptoms of postprandial fullness (P = 0.001) and early satiety (P = 0.009) were significantly associated with cold-wet stomach dystemperament.
Conclusion
A significant association was observed between stomach dystemperaments and FD subtypes.}

keywords = {Mast cells, Nuclear reporter gene imaging, Sodium iodide symporter, Cancer},
abstract = {Purpose
Owing to the close relationship between mast cells and cancer progression, an imaging technique that can be applied in a clinical setting to explore the biological behavior of mast cells in the tumor microenvironment is needed. In this study, we visualized mast cell migration to lung tumor lesions in live mice using sodium iodide symporter (NIS) as a nuclear medicine reporter gene.
Experimental design
The murine mast cell line MC-9 was infected with retrovirus including NIS, luciferase (as a surrogate marker for NIS), and Thy1.1 to generate MC-9/NFT cells. Radioiodine uptake was measured in MC-9/NFT cells, and an inhibition assay of radioiodine uptake using KCLO4 was also performed. Cell proliferation and FcεRI expression was examined in MC-9 and MC-9/NFT cells. The effect of mast cell-conditioned media (CM) on the proliferation of Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells was examined. The migration level of MC-9/NFT cells was confirmed in the presence of serum-free media (SFM) and CM of cancer cells. After intravenous injection of MC-9/NFT cells into mice with an LLC tumor, I-124 PET/CT and biodistribution analysis was performed.
Results
MC-9/NFT cells exhibited higher radioiodine avidity compared to parental MC-9 cells; this increased radioiodine avidity in MC-9/NFT cells was reduced to basal level by KCLO4. Levels of FcεRI expression and cell proliferation were not different in parental MC-9 cell and MC-9/ NFT cells. The CM of MC-9/NFT cells increased cancer cell proliferation relative to that of the SFM. The migration level of MC-9/NFT cells was higher in the CM than the SFM of LLC cells. PET/CT imaging with I-124 clearly showed infiltration of reporter mast cells in lung tumor at 24 h after transfer, which was consistent with the findings of the biodistribution examination.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that the sodium iodide symporter can serve as a reliable nuclear medicine reporter gene for non-invasively imaging the biological activity of mast cells in mice with lung tumors. Visualizing mast cells in the tumor microenvironment via a nuclear medicine reporter gene would provide valuable insights into their biological functions.}

Examining the Baishouwu plant in other studies, there is a requirement to study this medicinal plant as an urgent need due to its many medicinal applications. To date, the therapeutic effects of Baishouwu were studied by pharmacological studies and it was found that Baishouwu was traditionally beneficial for liver nutrition. According to theories of Chinese medicine, Baishouwu has great value in nourishing the kidneys and strengthening bones and muscles. However, the relationship between potential mechanisms, and other biological activities is unclear.

A chart review of 279 patients who presented to the Division of Adolescent Medicine of Cohen Children's Medical Center (Northwell Health, New York) between May 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015. Demographics and clinical information including anthropometry, last menstrual period (LMP), caloric intake, eating disorder behaviors, length of illness, DSM-5 eating disorder diagnosis was collected from 2734 visits.
Results
45% of patients had Anorexia Nervosa (AN), 24% had Atypical Anorexia Nervosa (AAN), 15% had Bulimia Nervosa/Purging Disorder (BN/PD), and 17% had Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). Patients on average were sick for 18 months and lost 20 pounds prior to presentation. Physicians indicated they wanted patients to remain in active treatment in approximately 40% of cases where care was discontinued. The factors, used to predict which patients would have an unsuccessful vs successful outcome (defined as needing vs not requiring frequent care), were analyzed. A history of diet-pill use, purging, and exercise predicted an “unsuccessful outcome” (p = 0.02, p = 0.005, p=0.03, respectively). 32% of the 202 menarchal females lost their menses prior to treatment, and 54% had resumption of menses during treatment.
Conclusions
Previous studies report high dropout rates in treatment of eating disorders across various treatment modalities and focus on those who remain in care. Here outcomes for all patients evaluated and treatment in an adolescent medicine care model are presented and show that a sizable portion, 37%, of those who drop out are recommended to stay in active treatment and only approximately 30% complete treatment. This finding supports an adolescent care model for eating disorder treatment and highlights that most adolescent patients go on to do well after leaving treatment, even if they left care earlier than recommended.}

However, a CDx assay is not only important during clinical development, but just as important as a treatment decision tool when the drug is regulatory approved and routinely used in the clinic. Owing to the central role of the CDx assay in the treatment of individual patients, regulators have imposed strict requirements on assay quality. Before a CDx assay can be used in the clinic, careful analytical and clinical validation must be performed to document the accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical performance.}

The method of screening biomarkers through metabolomics technology is a nontargeted research method to explore the differential components between two sets of biological samples. By taking this advantage, this study aims to takes Forsythia suspensa, which is a TCM also known as Lian Qiao (LQ), as the research object and to study its in vivo exposure by using metabolomics technology. By comparing the significant differences between biological samples before and after administration, it could be focused on the components that were significantly upregulated, where a complete set of analysis strategies for nontargeted TCM in vivo exposure mass spectrometry was established. Furthermore, the threshold parameters for peak extraction, parameter selection during statistical data analysis, and sample concentration multiples in this method have also been optimized. More interestingly, by using the established analysis strategy, we found 393 LQ-related chemical components in mice after administration, including 102 prototypes and 291 LQ-related metabolites, and plotted their metabolic profiles in vivo. In short, this study has obtained a complete mass spectrum of LQ exposure in mice in vivo for the first time, which provides a reference for research on the active ingredients of LQ in vivo. More importantly, compared with other methods, the analysis strategy of nontargeted exposure of TCM in vivo-based mass spectrometry, constructed by using this research method, has good universality and does not require self-developed postprocessing software. It is worth mentioning that, for the identification and characterization of trace amounts of metabolites in vivo, this analysis strategy has no discrimination and has a detection capability similar to that of highly exposed components.}

Multifactorial health determinants and shifts in global patterns of disease increase the need for Tropical Medicine training across Europe. A survey of university and postgraduate opportunities in Europe was conducted to identify and analyse gaps.
Method
An online survey was circulated to medical students and doctors in Europe between April and June 2021. Significance tests and a thematic analysis of the data were conducted.
Results
500 respondents (285 students and 215 doctors) from 27 countries were included. 17.2% of doctors were unsure whether postgraduate training in Tropical Medicine was available in their country. 20% of students and 10.7% of doctors said they were unsure whether they had been taught Tropical Medicine during university. 67.7% of students and 79.1% of doctors stated that the amount of Tropical Medicine training they encountered was or had been “not enough”.
Conclusions
Respondents demonstrated great interest in Tropical Medicine. Their self-reported knowledge, awareness, and perceived competence were partly dependent on whether there is specific teaching accessible at the university. Postgraduate training options were available in some countries but not all respondents were aware of these. There is a pressing need for harmonized curricula and expanded postgraduate training to improve Tropical Medicine competencies across Europe.}

The botanical characteristics of twinning, climbing vine plants conceptually take shape to interlink the meridians and collaterals system throughout the human body by expelling climatic evils (e.g., wind, dampness). Thus, vines have displayed great medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
Aim of the study
Although some popular vine species have been intensively investigated, the comparable features and medicinal specifications among a vast collection of taxonomic groups based on data visualization methods are relatively lacking in attention. Moreover, the translatability of vines from ancient ethnomedical evidence to modern medical system has not been well established. This review tends to quantitatively summarize the strength of vines in healthcare from the perspectives of medicinal part, traditional function, clinical spectrum, phytochemistry divergence, pharmacological attributes, toxicity as well as the progress of proprietary drug development.
Materials and methods
Medicinal vines were retrieved from databases of drug standards and curated catalogues. Synonyms of plant origin across different datasets were normalized by accepted scientific names in the World Flora Online. The distribution patterns and rank of plant origin, medicinal parts, traditional functions and target conditions, as well as the correlation between phytochemical composition and clinical applications were analyzed and visualized.
Results
A total of 121 crude drugs from 36 families, 77 genera, 133 species of vines were obtained and analyzed. The Fabaceae, Menispermaceae and Rubiaceae were the highest ranked families of medicinal vines. Not surprisingly, stem was the most dominant medical part. Moreover, “eliminate wind” displayed a hub node in the traditional function co-occurrence network. In addition to joint impediment disorders, these vines particularly displayed a wide range of therapeutic modalities toward conditions from various organ systems. Chemotaxonomic properties-oriented phytochemical analysis was performed and the chemical diversity among medicinal vines complementarily determined a certain group of therapeutic domains. Particularly, the anti-inflammatory effect and antiarthritic effect were highlighted for treating rheumatic diseases. Using integral animal models and cultured cells, modern pharmacological actions of medicinal vines have been largely observed and validated according to their traditional ethnopharmacology. Furthermore, a small proportion of vine species are well-known toxic plants. Successful drug development pipelines in rheumatic, cardiovascular, liver, malignant and infectious diseases have offered the capacity to generate new treatment options that are being sought out from vine plants.
Conclusions
Medicinal vines are rich sources of Chinese Material Medica (CMM) and good fit for a variety of clinical manifestations beyond arthritis and rheumatic diseases. In addition to stem, other parts are also popular for both medicines and dietary supplements. Vine plants provide extensive biologically relevant chemical space for developing value-creating drugs. Thus, our analysis can be useful for further motivating and strengthening the preclinical and clinical research of vine-derived remedies.}

abstract = {Objectives
In the field of orthopedics, osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common and refractory condition sometimes known as "immortal cancer" due to its complicated etiology, difficult treatment, and high disability rate. This paper's main goal is to examine the most recent literature on the pro-apoptotic effects of traditional Chinese medicine TCM monomers or compounds on osteocytes and to provide a summary of the potential signal routes.
Methods
The last ten years' worth of literature on ONFH as well as the anti-ONFH effects of aqueous extracts and monomers from traditional Chinese medicine were compiled.
Conclusions
When all the relevant signal pathways are considered, the key apoptotic routes include those mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway, the HIF-1 signaling network, etc. As a result, we anticipate that this study will shed light on the value of TCM and its constituent parts for treating ONFH by inducing apoptosis in osteocytes and offer some guidance for the future development of innovative medications as anti-ONFH medications in clinical settings.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
It has been widely reported that various anti-rheumatic traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) through regulating the abnormal production, assembly, and activation of the NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. These TCMs include monomers isolated from Chinese herbs, extracts of Chinese herbs, and Chinese medical formulae with a lengthy application history.
Aim of the study
This review aimed to summarize and analyze the published articles about the NLRP3 inflammasome and its role in the pathogenesis of RA and OA. We also reviewed existing knowledge on the therapeutic mechanism of TCMs in RA and OA via the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
Materials and methods
We searched for relevant articles with the keywords “NLRP3 inflammasome”, “traditional Chinese medicine,” “Chinese herbal drugs,” “rheumatoid arthritis,” and “osteoarthritis.” The information retrieval was conducted in medical Chinese and English databases from the date of construction to April 19, 2023, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM), Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Database (VIP), and China Online Journals (COJ).
Results
According to retrieval results, 35 TCMs have been demonstrated to relieve RA by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, including six traditional Chinese prescriptions, seven extracts of Chinese herbs, and 22 monomers extracted from traditional Chinese herbs and formulae. Additionally, 23 TCMs have shown anti-OA effects with abilities to modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome, including five traditional Chinese prescriptions, one extract of Chinese herbs, and 17 monomers from Chinese herbs.
Conclusions
We summarized mechanism research about the pivotal roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of RA and OA. Moreover, a review of TCMs with targets of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RA and OA treatment was also conducted. Our work is conducive to a better application of TCMs in complementary and alternative therapies in RA and OA.}

abstract = {Background
Medical personnel in nuclear medicine departments are exposed to ionizing radiation which is associated with cancer induction and mortality risks. Examples of such personnel are those working in the hot-areas where radioisotopes for nuclear medicine examinations are prepared. This work aims to estimate the occupational radiation exposure for workers at the Nuclear Medicine department in Da Nang Oncology Hospital, Vietnam.
Materials and methods
The study was conducted from 2020 to 2021. The personal dose equivalents (Hp) were quantified for soft tissues for deep dose (Hp(10)), eye lens dose (Hp(3)), skin dose (and Hp(0.07)) were quantified utilizing optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLD) crystals. In this study, the dose equivalent at the hot area is measured by 9 OSLD, while that for staff was measured using 16 OSLD.
Results
In 2020, the annual average Hp(10) was (0.38 mSv ± 1.39); in 2021 Hp(10) was (0.25 mSv ± 1.27). The average Hp(10) was well below the annual occupational dose limits (20 mSv.year−1). Regarding the annual dose, all recorded values were quite low compared to the annual radiation dose limits for radiation staff (20 mSv annual ∼ 1.67 mSv.month−1). Nevertheless, some points of measurement revealed a high-value dose of 5.69 mSv ± 2.83. This suggests that rigorous evaluation of the workplace is essential to ensuring workers' exposure is kept within safe levels.
Conclusions
It is concluded that the Hp(10) and Hp(0.07) for the working environment and radiation workers were below the dose limits from ICRP. In addition, it is recommended that continuous monitoring of the occupational dose in nuclear medicine department is essential to reduce the dosimetric hazards of personnel working in the department.}

The European Paediatric Medicine Regulation was launched in 2007, aiming to provide better medicines for children. However, its benefit for paediatric patients with cancer has been questioned and the European Paediatric and Orphan Regulations have been under review since November, 2020. To ascertain the effect of the European Paediatric Medicine Regulation, all paediatric anti-cancer medicines assessed by the European Medicines Agency from 1995 to 2022 were identified and reviewed using the agency's public assessment reports, and all Paediatric Investigation Plans granted since 2007 were analysed. 16 new molecular entities (NMEs; ie, a drug that contains an active moiety that had never been approved before) have been approved since the regulation was launched in 2007. The number of paediatric marketing authorisations increased from 2007 but represented the same 17% of all anti-cancer drug marketing authorisations before and after 2007. After 2007, nine (56%) of 16 NMEs were first authorised both in adults and children. For seven NMEs, a first paediatric indication was approved with a median lag time of 6·4 years (range 1·2–21·5 years) after the first authorisation in adults. Half of NMEs were authorised for the treatment of malignancies responsible for only 5·4% of all European childhood cancer deaths, including three medicines for melanoma and thyroid cancer—adult cancers occurring very rarely in children. The increased number of paediatric anti-cancer NMEs after 2007 is a result of the major increase in new medicines authorised for adult cancers since 2005 rather than a direct effect of the Paediatric Regulation. Paediatric development of these NMEs was driven by their adult market and did not address major unmet medical needs of children and adolescents with cancer. An improved, fit-for-purpose regulatory environment that incentivises paediatric drug development based on mechanism of action, better incentives, and a systematic multi-stakeholder engagement, with greater investment from industry, public funding, and non-governmental organisations, will increase the number of new medicines approved in the future to cure more children and adolescents with cancer.}

Osteoporosis (OP) is a prevalent chronic metabolic bone disease for which limited countermeasures are available. Cnidii Fructus (CF), primarily derived from Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson., has been tested in clinical trials of traditional Chinese medicine for the management of OP. Accumulating preclinical studies indicate that CF may be used against OP.

Comprehensive documentation and analysis were conducted to retrieve CF studies related to its main phytochemical components as well as its pharmacokinetics, safety and pharmacological properties. We also retrieved information on the mode of action of CF and, in particular, preclinical and clinical studies related to bone remodeling. This search was performed from the inception of databases up to the end of 2022 and included PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the National Science and Technology Library, the China Science and Technology Journal Database, Weipu, Wanfang, the Web of Science and the China National Patent Database.
Results
CF contains a wide range of natural active compounds, including osthole, bergapten, imperatorin and xanthotoxin, which may underlie its beneficial effects on improving bone metabolism and quality. CF action appears to be mediated via multiple processes, including the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK), Wnt/β-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/Smad signaling pathways.
Conclusion
CF and its ingredients may provide novel compounds for developing anti-OP drugs.}

abstract = {Background
Precision cancer care has reduced cancer-related mortality. However, minorities remain less likely to receive precision medicine than White populations with cancer due to language and system-level barriers. Precision medicine knowledge increases involvement in treatment decisions and receipt of such treatment. Few interventions exist that seek to improve precision medicine knowledge among low-income and racial and ethnic minorities with cancer.
Methods
We designed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a community health worker (CHW)-delivered intervention on patients' knowledge of precision medicine in partnership with a community oncology clinic in Monterey County, California. Eligibility includes adults with newly diagnosed, progression or recurrence of cancer, low-income, or racial and ethnic minorities, or uninsured, insured by Medicaid or by a local agricultural employer. We will randomize 110 patients with cancer to the intervention or usual cancer care. The intervention group will be assigned to a CHW who will deliver culturally tailored and personalized education on precision medicine and advance care planning, screen for social determinants of health barriers and connect patients to community resources. The primary outcome is precision medicine knowledge measured by a 6-item survey adapted from Davies at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months post-enrollment. Exploratory outcomes include patient satisfaction with decision, activation, health care utilization, and receipt of evidence-based precision medicine care.
Conclusion
This trial will assess whether the CHW-led intervention can increase knowledge of precision medicine as well as several exploratory outcomes including receipt of evidence-based cancer care among low-income and racial and ethnic minority adults with cancer.

Firstly, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition of SAD, which allowed us to identify the 28 main ingredients. Then, we employed computer simulations to investigate the potential active ingredients of SAD and the corresponding binding sites of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). The simulations revealed that D509 and D647 were the potential binding sites for TRPV1. Notably, molecular dynamics (MD) studies indicated that site D509 may function as an allosteric site of TRPV1. Furthermore, to validate the computer-aided predictions, we performed experimental studies, including in vitro and in vivo assays. The results of these experiments confirmed the predictions made by our computational models, providing further evidence for the mechanisms of action of San-Ao Decoction in asthma treatment. Our findings demonstrated that: i) D509 and D647 of TRPV1 are the key binding sites for the main ingredients of SAD; ii) SAD or its main ingredients significantly reduce the influx of Ca2+ through TRPV1, following the TCM principle of “Jun, Chen, Zuo, Shi”; iii) SAD shows efficiency in comprehensive in vivo validation. In conclusion, our computer-aided investigation of San-Ao Decoction in asthma treatment has provided valuable insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of this TCM formula. The combination of computational analysis and experimental validation has proven effective in enhancing our understanding of TCM and may pave the way for future discoveries in the field.}

Species of Cyperaceae occur in all regions of Brazil and have been used in folk medicine in the country, as well as in other parts of the world. From this perspective, the present study aimed to review, for the first time, the folk medicinal use of Cyperaceae species in Brazil, making a distinction between species with and without experimental data available in the literature.
Methods
Data were obtained from different databases. In the initial search, a total number of 604 publications were retrieved and those that did not meet the search criteria were excluded. A total of 159 articles were selected and used in this review.
Results
According to the analysed documents, a total of 27 species of Cyperaceae have reports of folk medicinal use in 15 states of the country. Of these, 44% have been scientifically investigated for chemical constituents and/or biological activities. Sesquiterpenes were the main constituents isolated from different species. The species are used to treat different health problems, especially inflammation, and the roots are the most frequently used parts.
Conclusions
Cyperus rotundus is the species with the highest number of medicinal indications and pharmacological and phytochemical studies. Despite the wide spectrum of use of Cyperaceae species, scientific evidence to validate the indications mentioned by traditional communities is lacking for most of them.}

abstract = {Herbs have the potential to interact with conventional medicines or each other upon concurrent administration. This can be at the level of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). With an estimation that 80% of the population in poor regions of the world utilise herbal medicines for primary healthcare, there is a likelihood that some people will take both herbal and conventional medicines. This could present a risk for herb-drug interactions (HDI) at the various levels of the ADME process. Most common HDI have been observed at metabolism level involving inhibition or induction of the major drug metabolising liver enzymes called cytochrome P450s. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of Parinari curatellifolia (MC), Fluggea virosa (ST), Garcinia livingstonei (MT), Pterocarpus angolensis (M), Tapinanthus quequensis (MF) and Cussonia arborea (GM) on recombinant CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Plate based fluorescent assays were used to follow enzyme activity. Inhibition was determined at 5 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml of herbal extract, with IC50 determined for herbs that showed potent inhibition. A total of 10 out of 13 extracts showed significant inhibitory effects. Pterocarpus angolensis(bark), Fluggea virossa (leaf), Cussonia arborea(bark), Parinari curatellifollia (root) had very potent effects on CYP1A2 as indicated by an IC50 of <9.9 µg/ml. Based on the worst-case-scenario of complete absorption and exposure, these herbs are predicted to result in HDI if co-administered with medicines which depend on the affected CYPs for metabolism and elimination.
Significance of the main findings
There is a potential threat of drug toxicities due to drug-herb interactions for patients undergoing chemotherapy or taking other medications where co-morbidities exist during chemotherapy. Drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 should be administered with caution for patients who are taking the herbs which have been studied in this research as risk for drug toxicities may be high. The findings act as a guide to medical doctors and patients in evaluating potential for herb-drug interactions during prescribing medications which are substrates for the studied CYPs.}

Given the emergence of numerous drug sponsors and other companies developing therapeutic modalities for combination with psychedelic medications, it is essential that the medical professional field is at the forefront of communicating unbiased information related to safety and effectiveness. Gold standards have long been a part of medicine and serve to distinguish treatments and assessments as the highest quality by which all others can be compared to. For a treatment to be established as a gold standard, several factors are considered including the quantity and quality of the supporting data, the rigor of trials, and the safety and efficacy compared to other treatments. In this article, we review the origins of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT), minimum requirements for safe use of psychedelics, criteria for gold standards in mental health, and the nuances regarding how to establish gold standards in psychedelic medicine and guide clinical decision making.}

The adsorption performance of TC on two micropore-rich AR biochars, AR@ZnCl2 (1370 m2 g−1) and HAR@ZnCl2 (1896 m2 g−1), was comprehensively evaluated using adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics. By virtue of pore diffusion, π-π interaction, electrostatic attraction, and hydrogen bonding, the prepared AR biochar showed exceptional adsorption properties for TC. Notably, the maximum adsorption capacity (930.3 mg g−1) of TC on HAR@ZnCl2 can be achieved when the adsorbent dosage is 0.5 g L−1 and C0 is 500 mg L−1 at 323 K. The TC adsorption on HAR@ZnCl2 took place spontaneously. Furthermore, the impact of competitive ions behavior is insignificant when coexisting ion concentrations fall within the 10–100 mg L−1 range. Additionally, the produced biochar illustrated good economic benefits, with a payback of 701 $ t−1. More importantly, even after ten cycles, HAR@ZnCl2 still presented great TC removal efficiency (above 77%), suggesting a good application prosperity. In summary, the effectiveness and sustainability of AR biochar, a biowaste-derived product, were demonstrated in its ability to remove antibiotics from water, showing great potential in wastewater treatment application.}

Depression is a major mental disorder and it is currently recognized as the second-leading cause of disability worldwide. However, the therapeutic effect of antidepressants remains unsatisfactory. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used for centuries, including commonly-used complementary and alternative medical therapies for depression. Recent clinical trials have been carried out to assess the efficacy and safety of TCM, and to explore the mechanisms of action in relation to the treatment of depression.
Aim of the study
To summarize frequently used TCM decoctions and Chinese patent medicines (CPM) for treating depression, review their clinical therapeutic effects in treating depressive disorders, consider their possible mechanisms, and characterize the relationships between their efficacy and mechanisms.
Materials and methods
We performed a computerized literature search using the electronic databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases, with the keywords “depression”, “traditional Chinese medicine decoction”, “Chinese patent medicine”, “application”, “mechanism”, and their combinations, from January 1, 2000 to August 8, 2022 (inclusive).
Results
A total of 51 papers were identified. We reviewed studies on six each TCM decoctions and CPMs, which demonstrated their significant clinical efficacy for treating depression and examined their mechanisms of action. The anti-depressive effects were related to: 1) increased monoamine neurotransmitter levels, 2) inhibiting hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, 3) regulating hippocampal neurons and neurotrophic factors, 4) regulating immune cytokines, 5) counteracting excitatory amino acid toxicity, and 6) regulating microbe-gut-brain axis function.
Conclusion
TCM plays an increasingly important role in the management of depression by enhancing the therapeutic effects and alleviating the side effects of antidepressant chemicals.}

In this study, a multinational survey was developed and administered to obtain experience, attitude, and promotion information with regard to the international use of TC&AM among nine countries: Germany, United States, Japan, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, Russia, Kazakhstan, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The survey was administered via online to members of SurveyMonkey Audience, a proprietary panel of respondents who were recruited from a diverse population worldwide.
Results
A total of 1071 participants has completed the survey. The participants were in favor of the treatments and therapies as well as expressed positive attitudes and also have used herbal medicine treatment more than acupuncture therapy and also used the modalities to promote metabolism rather than treating musculoskeletal diseases. Moreover, participants mentioned that TC&AM should be applied for treating and managing infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Additionally, participants recommended using Facebook channel to promote its treatments and therapies.
Conclusion
Based on the results, this study provides initial insights on TC&AM that may influence the non-users globally and perhaps inspire a need for further research including more countries in different continents.}

abstract = {Introduction
Irinotecan is a novel first-line therapy for colorectal cancer, but the toxicity and side effects include diarrhea without satisfactory treatments. Chinese herbal decoction (CHD) is an effective complementary and alternative prevention and therapy for irinotecan induced diarrhea (IID). This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims to assess the preventive effect of CHD in the treatment of IID.
Methods
Seven databases (PubMed, COCHRANE, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM) were screened for random controlled trials on the prevention and treatment of IID by CHD from January 1980 to May 2022. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias (ROB 2.0) was applied for bias risk assessment, and the Grading Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) for quality of evidence. Meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software. In addition, a subgroup analysis was conducted on different grades of diarrhea, the incidence and duration of diarrhea, the selection of specific Chinese herbal medicine decoction, and the incidence of adverse reactions. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all data by combining the meta-analysis with fixed or random-effects models based on outcome heterogeneity.
Results
Fourteen RCTs involving 1056 participants were included. The study results displayed that the incidence of IID was lower with the use of CHD than the no-treatment group (RR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.40–0.75, P = 0.0002). CHD in combination with western medicine (WM) was more effective than WM alone for IID (RR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.23–0.84, P = 0.01). This protective effect was more pronounced for severe grade III–V diarrhea (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.26–0.64, P < 0.0001). In the specific Chinese herbal medicine decoction, the Banxia Xie Xin decoction presented better effectiveness (RR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05–0.63, P = 0.007) than WM alone. The Huangqin decoction was the most widely studied interventional scheme (n = 5). The relative risk (RR) of the Huangqin decoction was 0.56. No obvious adverse reactions were observed.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that CHD has a preventive effect on IID and could be used as a complementary therapy with few side effects. However, additional large-sample, high-quality, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to guide the clinical practice scientifically.

This can aid in evaluating tissue safety and quality, as well as transportation to a clinic and multiple transplants. Hair follicle germs (HFGs), identified during in vivo development, are considered effective tissue grafts for hair regenerative medicine. However, to the best of our knowledge, methods for cryopreserving HFGs have not been explored yet. This study investigated the efficacy of slow vitrification methods for freezing HFGs. Cryoprotectants such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and carboxylated poly-l-lysine were used for vitrification. The results indicate that DMSO vitrification yielded the most efficient de novo hair regeneration in mouse skin, comparable to that of non-cryoprotected HFGs. A microfinger was fabricated to scale up the cryopreservation method, considering that thousands of tissue grafts were required per patient in clinical practice. The microfinger can be used for a series of processes, holding the HFG, replacing it with a cryopreservation solution, freezing it in liquid nitrogen, thawing it in a warm medium, and transplanting it into the skin. Although de novo hair regeneration by HFGs cryopreserved using microfingers was reduced by approximately 20 % compared to those cryopreserved using flat plates for fertilized eggs, it exceeded 50 %. These findings demonstrate that vitrification with DMSO and microfingers could be a useful approach for the cryopreservation of tissue grafts in hair regenerative medicine for hair loss.}

This study accentuates the criticality of image data, given its instrumental role in detecting and classifying vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) – a predominant global contributor to vision impairment. The timely identification of VTDR is a linchpin for efficacious interventions and the mitigation of vision loss. Addressing this, This study introduces “NIMEQ-SACNet,” a novel hybrid model by the prowess of the Enhanced Quantum-Inspired Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (EQI-BGWO) with a self-attention capsule network. The proposed approach is characterized by two pivotal advancements: firstly, the augmentation of the Binary Grey Wolf Optimization through Quantum Computing methodologies, and secondly, the deployment of the enhanced EQI-BGWO to adeptly calibrate the SACNet's parameters, culminating in a notable uplift in VTDR classification accuracy. The proposed model's ability to handle binary, 5-stage, and 7-stage VTDR classifications adroitly is noteworthy. Rigorous assessments on the fundus image dataset, underscored by metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, F1-Score, and MCC, bear testament to NIMEQ-SACNet's pre-eminence over prevailing algorithms and classification frameworks.}

abstract = {Background
The sharing of health-related information has become increasingly popular on social media. Unregulated information sharing has led to the spread of misinformation, especially regarding complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM). This scoping review synthesized evidence surrounding the spread of CAIM-related misinformation on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
This review was informed by a modified version of the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework. AMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases were searched systematically from inception to January 2022. Eligible articles explored COVID-19 misinformation on social media and contained sufficient information on CAIM therapies. Common themes were identified using an inductive thematic analysis approach.
Results
Twenty-eight articles were included. The following themes were synthesized: 1) misinformation prompts unsafe and harmful behaviours, 2) misinformation can be separated into different categories, 3) individuals are capable of identifying and refuting CAIM misinformation, and 4) studies argue governments and social media companies have a responsibility to resolve the spread of COVID-19 misinformation.
Conclusions
Misinformation can spread more easily when shared on social media. Our review suggests that misinformation about COVID-19 related to CAIM that is disseminated online contributes to unsafe health behaviours, however, this may be remedied via public education initiatives and stricter media guidelines. The results of this scoping review are crucial to understanding the behavioural impacts of the spread of COVID-19 misinformation about CAIM therapies, and can inform the development of public health policies to mitigate these issues.}

abstract = {Objective
Xiaotan Sanjie recipe (XTSJ), a Chinese herbal compound medicine, exerts a significant inhibitory effect on gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. This work investigated the mechanism underlying the XTSJ-mediated inhibition of GC metastasis.
Methods
The effect of XTSJ on GC metastasis and the associated mechanism were investigated in vitro, using GC cell lines, and in vivo, using a GC mouse model, by focusing on the expression of Glc-N-Ac-transferase V (GnT-V; encoded by MGAT5).
Results
The migration and invasion ability of GC cells decreased significantly after XTSJ administration, which confirmed the efficacy of XTSJ in treating GC in vitro. XTSJ increased the accumulation of E-cadherin at junctions between GC cells, which was reversed by MGAT5 overexpression. XTSJ administration and MGAT5 knockdown alleviated the structural abnormality of the cell–cell junctions, while MGAT5 overexpression had the opposite effect. MGAT5 knockdown and XTSJ treatment also significantly increased the accumulation of proteins associated with the E-cadherin-mediated adherens junction complex. Furthermore, the expression of MGAT5 was significantly lower in the lungs of BGC-823-MGAT5 + XTSJ mice than in those of BGC-823-MGAT5 + solvent mice, indicating that the ability of gastric tumors to metastasize to the lung was decreased in vivo following XTSJ treatment.
Conclusion
XTSJ prevented GC metastasis by inhibiting the GnT-V-mediated E-cadherin glycosylation and promoting the E-cadherin accumulation at cell–cell junctions.

Attracting more students to nuclear medicine is imperative to improving diversity and meeting growing staffing needs. In this study, we implemented a short seminar about nuclear medicine and evaluated its impact on student perceptions of the field.
Materials and Methods
We developed and presented 30-minute “Introduction to Nuclear Medicine” seminars to undergraduate college students and preclinical medical students. After the seminars, participants completed a post-pre survey to determine perceived changes to their perspective of nuclear medicine. Responses were coded on a Likert 1-5 scale with pre- and post- seminar results compared using T-test of means and analysis of variance.
Results
Of the 83 students who attended the seminar, 79 (95.1%) students participated in the survey including 67 preclinical medical students and 12 undergraduate students. Of the 78 participants who provided demographic information, there were 38 (48.7%) women, 5 (6.4%) first-generation college students, and 39 (50.0%) people who identified as either multiracial or a race other than White/Caucasian. Among all participants (n = 79), there was a significant increase in perceived understanding of nuclear medicine (p < 0.001), confidence in ability to pursue nuclear medicine (p < 0.001), and interest in becoming a nuclear medicine professional (p < 0.001). Perceived increases in knowledge were highest among first-year medical students (p = 0.031), while interest (p = 0.40) and confidence (p = 0.85) in pursuing nuclear medicine did not vary by educational level.
Conclusion
Perceptions of student interest in nuclear medicine can be improved using an easily implemented, short seminar at the undergraduate college and preclinical medical school level.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Condyloma acuminatum (CA) is a common sexually transmitted disease. Previous studies using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have revealed that Paiteling (PTL), a Chinese patent medicine formula, can effectively relieve CA symptoms. However, the evidence needs to be more cohesive and there is a need for a clear summary of the existing RCTs to assess the overall efficacy and safety profile of PTL.
Aims of the study
This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of RCTs, to examine the efficacy of PTL and physical therapies in CA.
Material and methods
A literature search was conducted in multiple databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, etc. up to December 1, 2022. Revman 5.4 and Stata 15.0 was used for data statistics and sensitivity analyses.
Results
31 trials with a total of 2868 patients were included in this review. The results showed that PTL plus physical therapies were significantly more effective than physical therapies used alone (RR = 1.60, 95% CI [1.38, 1.86]; P < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis showed that the type of physical therapies, gender, and wart location might be the primary sources of heterogeneity. Additionally, PTL can reduce recurrence rates (RR = 0.27, 95% CI [0.19, 0.39]; P < 0.00001), improve the negative conversion rate of HPV (RR = 1.15, 95% CI [1.02, 1.30]; P = 0.02), and improve immune function. No severe adverse reactions or physical injuries were observed, making it a better choice for women planning to become pregnant.
Conclusion
Compared with physical therapies, PTL can effectively eliminate CA symptoms and reduce the recurrence rates with safety ensured. However, due to the heterogeneity and methodological shortcomings, large sample sizes and high-quality rigorous RTCs are still needed to strengthen this clinical evidence.}

Data collection
Three hundred-and-eight patients that consulted a sports medicine orthopedist in the past year, whether in a private or a public sector, completed a questionnaire designed for the purposes of the present study.
Principal findings
Patient selection of a sports medicine orthopedist was primarily influenced by an orthopedist's professional skills and recommendations from friends, family members, and other patients, while patients seemed to be less concerned about an orthopedist's interpersonal skills, and less influenced by other physicians' recommendations or advertisements. Variance has been observed in attribution of importance to certain factors across patient groups.
Conclusions
These findings may be used in designing of marketing strategies aimed to assist patient selection of a sports medicine orthopedist. Marketing strategies need to be tailored to specific patient groups for example athletes.}

10 focus groups including 35 subjects were conducted. Four general themes emerged: (1) Assessment considerations; (2) Education & Expectations; (3) Systems Factors; and (4) Management considerations. Participants indicated that while it is important to treat pain, its inherently subjective nature makes it difficult to objectively quantify it. The 0–10 numeric rating scale was problematic and infrequently utilized. Patient expectations of no pain following procedures was viewed as particularly challenging. The absence of formal best practices to guide pain assessment and management was noted in every group. Management approaches overall very highly variable, often relying on word-of-mouth relay of the preferences of specific attending physicians.
Conclusions
Pain is highly nuanced and resident physicians struggle to balance pain's subjectivity with a desire to quantify and appropriately treat it. The 0–10 numeric rating pain scale, though ubiquitous, is problematic. Priority areas of improvement identified include education for both patients and physicians, functional pain scales, and expansion of existing effective resources like the nursing pain team.}

abstract = {Introduction
Comprehensive medicines reviews are a strategy to reduce medicines-related harm. In Australia, Home Medicines Review services (HMRs) are provided by consultant pharmacists to community-dwelling consumers, on referral from the consumer's medical practitioner. Limited research exists on the processes undertaken by consultant pharmacists when delivering HMRs, particularly as it relates to the information types received, collected, and reported.
Objective
Describe the types of information consultant pharmacists report receiving in HMR referrals, collect before and during consumer consultations, and include in their written reports.
Materials and Methods
We conducted a national online survey of Australian consultant pharmacists who deliver HMRs. Participants were recruited using a broad advertising strategy, including social and traditional media platforms, and snowballing. Data were analysed descriptively.
Results
Of the 248 eligible participants, 179 (72%) completed the survey. The most commonly included information in the referral was medication list (97%), the least were details of hospitalisations (8%) and specialist letters (5%). Information pertaining to hospitalisation and specialist letters were collected by 20% of participants prior to the consultation. Details of, and history from, community pharmacy was the most sought information prior to consultations. Less than a quarter of participants ‘most of the time’ or ‘always’ formally assess adherence using a validated instrument during the consultation. Participants commonly (80%) report consumer concerns in the written report.
Conclusions
Consultant pharmacists collect a broad variety of information, beyond medicines-related content. Written HMR reports by consultant pharmacists were often reported to be consumer-centric.}

Access to this innovative therapeutic approach for a growing number of patients worldwide increasingly appears to be a priority public health strategy. Inclusion of FVIII mimetic bispecific antibodies on the World Health Organization essential medicines list would contribute to health equity in lower-income countries.}
