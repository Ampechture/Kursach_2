abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC), a term for both colon and rectal cancer (colorectal), is a heterogeneous disease with multiple etiologies. It is the second leading cause of cancer worldwide, with nearly 915,880 deaths (including both men and women) recorded in 2020, according to cancer net. Many factors contribute to the development of CRC, including lifestyle, age, family history, etc. CRC is triggered by mutations. A mutation is any change in the DNA sequence during replication. Any change in the nucleotide base pairs can lead to a change in a gene’s instructions (variant genes). These instructions are vital to proper protein functioning and are coded based on these genes. Variants have the capability of producing malfunctioning proteins or different proteins altogether. Most genetic mutations are silent and do not affect any particular function of the cells in the body, therefore having little to no effect on individuals. Some mutations are also corrected by the body equipped with DNA repair mechanisms. These mechanisms fix most of these disadvantageous mutations, thereby reducing the chances of disease. In the case of CRCs, most mutations target these DNA repair mechanisms along with tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes- mutated genes that can potentially cause cancer. Specifically, the β-catenin, Smad2, Smad4, KRas, DCC, hMSH2, TGFβRII variants have shown significant expression in patients with CRC. This information can be used in treating CRC by targeting those variants as potential biomarkers. Over the past decade, the burgeoning of research in this field has given rise to many advances in medical science and technology. It has led to a better understanding of the causes, types, and more precise treatments of CRC. This review gives a brief overview of the epidemiology and etiology of CRC and focuses on some of the latest therapeutics and medicaments, including personalized medicine and targeted therapies for treating and possibly curing the disease.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The classic Chinese herbal medicine formula Xiao-qing-long-tang (XQLT) is commonly recommended to manage allergic rhinitis (AR), but the treatment efficacy and safety of XQLT are uncertain.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of XQLT in treating AR.
Materials and methods
Nine databases were searched from their inception to April 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating XQLT for AR were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis and a subgroup meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of XQLT.
Results
Twenty-four RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. XQLT was compared to both placebo and Western medicine (WM), and XQLT combined with WM was compared with WM alone. Meta-analyses were conducted for total nasal symptom scores (TNSS), four individual nasal symptom scores, quality of life (QoL), effective rate, and recurrence rate. The TNSS decreased after XQLT treatment and combination treatment (mean difference (MD): −0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) [−1.20, −0.38], standardized mean difference (SMD): −1.42; 95% CI [−1.59, −1.24], and SMD: −1.84; 95% CI [−2.08, −1.60]). The two individual nasal symptom scores decreased after XQLT treatment and combination treatment; these nasal symptoms comprised rhinorrhea (SMD: −0.30; 95% CI [−0.58, −0.02] and SMD: −0.48; 95% CI [−0.70, −0.26]), and nasal obstruction (SMD: −0.54; 95% CI [−0.78, −0.30] and SMD: −0.54; 95% CI [−0.76, −0.32). XQLT and XQLT combined with WM achieved a better effective rate than WM (risk ratio (RR): 1.18; 95% CI [1.11, 1.25] and RR: 1.16; 95% CI [1.10, 1.23]) and a lower recurrence rate than WM (RR: 0.24; 95% CI [0.13, 0.43] and RR: 0.47; 95% CI [0.31, 0.72]). XQLT was well tolerated in patients being treated for AR.
Conclusion
Our results indicated that oral XQLT may alleviate the TNSS, rhinorrhea scores, and nasal obstruction scores of AR and is safe to use in clinical practice. However, more RCTs that follow rigorous methodologies and evaluate well-accepted outcome measures are required to evaluate the effectiveness of XQLT.}

abstract = {Objective
We assessed the impact of a workshop on first-year medicine residents (PGY1) shared decision-making (SDM) communication skill, risk-benefit education, and attitude.
Methods
A SDM skills-focused workshop was integrated into an academic medical center PGY1 ambulatory rotation in 2016–2017. Pre/post recordings of virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) with standardized patients sharing decisions were scored using OPTION5. Risk-benefit education, including decision aid use, was measured. Pre/post surveys assessed SDM practice attitudes and perceived barriers.
Results
31 of 48 (65%) PGY1 workshop attendees completed pre/post OSCEs yielding 62 videos. OPTION5 scores improved from 27/100 pre to 56/100 post (p < 0.001). Pre/post increases in integration of qualitative (15/31 vs 31/31, p < 0.001) and quantitative (3/31 vs 31/31, p < 0.001) risk measures, and decision aids (1/3 vs 31/31, p < 0.001) were observed. Pro-SDM attitude of decisional neutrality increased 16.6% pre to 71.9% post-survey (P < 0.001). Barriers to SDM remain.
Conclusion
This PGY1 workshop with virtual OSCEs improved SDM communication skills, the ability to find and provide risk-benefit education, and SDM-facilitating attitude.
Practice implications
Residency programs can improve SDM skills, risk-benefit education, and attitudes with a workshop intervention. Perceived time constraints and cognitive biases regarding risk-benefit estimates should be addressed to ensure quality SDM in practice.}

abstract = {abstract
The need to implement innovative sustainable production processes is a topic of important social relevance in this current century. Environmental tragedies on different continents have revealed that humanity needs to understand how nature belongs to a system that needs to be balanced in order to maintain its existence. One of the major sustainability challenges globally is the management of solid wastes (SW). The rapid urbanization coupled with the increase in the world population has resulted in a consequential increase in the use of various products and their associated generated wastes. Of such SW that is complicated to manage are medical wastes which are deemed hazardous. Thus, the various industries including the health industry must implement a reverse logistic methodology in the disposal of solid wastes in order to efficiently and effectively manage their wastes. Countries such as Brazil, have incorporated reverse logistics into their National Solid Waste Policy (NSWP) thereby ensuring adequate disposal of various solid wastes and co-responsibility among the generators of various wastes. In this study, the strategies adopted within the scope of the Unified Health System (SUS, in Portuguese) in Brazil related to the reverse logistics of medicines consumed in the health industry were investigated. As a methodology, qualitative research such as literature review and documentary were utilized in order to obtain knowledge about the major information about the health industry in Brazil. The findings and discussions provided in this paper revealed that reverse logistics applied to pharmaceutical products in Brazil is still incipient. Although there is consolidated literature on the subject in national studies, there is a lack of evidence that indicates effective models of reverse drug logistics in the country, in a scenario of growth of 10% per year in the generation of this waste on average in the country. It is concluded that reverse drug logistics in Brazil is in an embryonic process, strengthened by the construction of regulations and laws that may encourage industries to adopt good practices in the production and management of drug wastes, and which, when implemented, can generate a reduction of around 12% in the volume generated per year.}

Various cardiovascular comorbidities can exacerbate cardiac fibrosis. While fibroblasts are believed to be the primary cell type underlying fibrosis, recent and emerging data suggest that other cell types can also potentiate or expedite fibrotic processes. Over the past few decades, clinicians have developed therapeutics that can blunt the development and progression of cardiac fibrosis. While these strategies have yielded positive results, overall clinical outcomes for patients suffering from heart failure continue to be dire. Herein, we overview the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cardiac tissue fibrosis. To do so, we establish the known mechanisms that drive fibrosis in the heart, outline the diagnostic tools available, and summarize the treatment options used in contemporary clinical practice. Finally, we underscore the critical role the immune microenvironment plays in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis.}

The challenges in COVID-19 treatment have driven patients to seek Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for the prevention and/or treatment of the disease. Pharmacists are uniquely positioned to promote the effective and safe use of CAM.
Objective
Assess the beliefs, practices, and knowledge of community pharmacists in Lebanon about existing evidence for the use of CAM for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19.
Methods
A national cross-sectional survey was conducted among community pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon (n = 310 respondents). Participants completed an online questionnaire addressing, in addition to the socio-demographic characteristics; the beliefs, practices, and knowledge of pharmacists regarding the existing evidence of CAM use for COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment.
Results
Pharmacists (70%) received frequent inquiries about CAM for COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Only 25.5% of the pharmacists reported having enough time to get information about CAM and COVID-19. Almost all participants believed that pharmacists have a major role in the fight against COVID-19 (98%) and that they have enough information to counsel patients in that regard (75%). For practices, the majority of pharmacists reported counseling their patients on proper use (98%) and possible adverse reactions (93%) of CAM, but only 51% reported toxic or undesirable effects. Regarding knowledge, although most pharmacists answered correctly the questions on the role of CAM in preventing COVID-19, few knew about its role in treating the infection. Pharmacists who trust the WHO website as a credible source had a higher knowledge score (β = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.05–0.986).
Conclusions
The positive beliefs and practices of pharmacists towards CAM during the pandemic were coupled with a few gaps, especially in their knowledge about existing evidence for CAM use. Concerted efforts ought to be dedicated to supporting pharmacists in playing a more prominent role during health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.}

To investigate the general population’s view on artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine with specific emphasis on 3 areas that have experienced major progress in AI research in the past few years, namely radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology.
Methods
For this prospective study, the April 2020 Online Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Panel Wave was used. Of the 3117 Longitudinal Internet Studies For The Social Sciences panel members contacted, 2411 completed the full questionnaire (77.4% response rate), after combining data from earlier waves, the final sample size was 1909. A total of 3 scales focusing on trust in the implementation of AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology were used. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance was used for comparison.
Results
The overall means show that respondents have slightly more trust in AI in dermatology than in radiology and surgery. The means show that higher educated males, employed or student, of Western background, and those not admitted to a hospital in the past 12 months have more trust in AI. The trust in AI in radiology, robotic surgery, and dermatology is positively associated with belief in the efficiency of AI and these specific domains were negatively associated with distrust and accountability in AI in general.
Conclusions
The general population is more distrustful of AI in medicine unlike the overall optimistic views posed in the media. The level of trust is dependent on what medical area is subject to scrutiny. Certain demographic characteristics and individuals with a generally positive view on AI and its efficiency are significantly associated with higher levels of trust in AI.}

Efforts to understand and unlock the body's potential for regeneration have increased dramatically in recent years. So-called “biohacking” hopes to improve functionality and reverse disease processes.
Objectives
This review will seek to summarize the available data for the use of platelet-rich plasma, cellular therapies, and other novel therapeutics within sexual medicine.
Methods
The PubMed database search was performed using the keywords “Stem cell therapy in Erectile dysfunction (ED)”, “Gene therapy in ED”, “Novel therapeutics for ED”, and “Biohacking”. Popular news articles for regulation of stem cell therapy were reviewed.
Results
Research efforts have managed to produce an array of novel therapeutics, including stem cell therapy and platelet-rich plasma. Although the use of these items has been largely focused within specialties other than urology, applications involving sexual medicine have been documented and appear to be increasing.
Conclusion
Despite evidence of these technologies being adopted within clinical practices as revenue-generators, quality data to support efficacy are quite limited. Matz EL, Scarberry K, Terlecki R. Platelet-Rich Plasma and Cellular Therapies for Sexual Medicine and Beyond. Sex Med Rev 2022;10:174–179.}

abstract = {Glomerular diseases are major components of kidney disease, mainly manifested as podocyte disease, immune complex-associated glomerulonephritis, and renal autoimmune disease. They are the third leading cause of end-stage renal disease, especially in younger populations. Podocyte death or shedding is a key factor in the progression of glomerular diseases, and autophagy plays an important role in maintaining podocyte homeostasis. Dysfunction of autophagy has been associated with the progression of various glomerular diseases. Modulation of autophagy has been shown to play a protective role in experimental models of glomerular diseases, suggesting that autophagy is a potential therapeutic target for glomerular diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has unique advantages in the treatment of kidney disease. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that TCM compounds can reduce podocyte apoptosis, inhibit inflammation, improve endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress responses, and play an active role via autophagy. This review summarizes the roles of autophagy in glomerular diseases and provides evidence that TCM compounds can regulate autophagy through different signaling pathways to ameliorate glomerular diseases.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate through meta-analysis the therapeutic efficacy, as well as changes in blood glucose and lipid metabolism in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treated with Shenqi Jiangtang granule + Western medicine (SJG+WM).
Methods
Web of Science, PubMed, and three Chinese databases, namely China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Platform (Wanfang), and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP Database), were searched to identify clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated SJG+WM treatment effects on women with GDM. Risk assessment criteria were used to evaluate the included studies, as recommended by the Cochrane systematic evaluation guide. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 12.0 and RevMan5.3.
Results
A total of 2,743 participants were enrolled in 28 RCTs, 1372 (50.08%) in the WM treatment group and 1371 (49.92%) in the SJG+WM treatment group. The duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 14 weeks. Compared to WM treatment alone, SJG+WM could improve the therapeutic efficacy and the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) [mean difference (MD) = -0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.16 to -0.75, P < 0.00001], postprandial 2 h blood glucose (PBG) [MD = -1.46, 95% CI: -1.74 to -1.18), P < 0.00001], glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) [MD = -0.91, 95% CI: -1.14 to 0.68), P < 0.00001], total cholesterol (TC) [MD = -0.64, 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.48, P < 0.00001], and triglycerides (TG) [MD = -0.56, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.38, P < 0.00001]. The funnel plot and Egger's test results showed that only four indicators, including the total efficiency rate, FBG, PBG, and HbA1c, had significant publication bias, indicating that the conclusions were reliable.
Conclusion
SJG+WM can significantly improve therapeutic efficacy and blood glucose and lipid metabolism in patients with GDM.}

Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) usage in childhood cancer is common. Effective communication about T&CM is a keystone in successful childhood cancer treatment to prevent abandonment of conventional cancer treatment. This study explored health-care providers’ (HCP) perception and communication about T&CM in childhood cancer care.
Methods
A cross-sectional study at an Indonesian academic hospital using semi-structured questionnaires.
Results
Altogether,175 HCP (response rate 83%) participated. Only 2% of HCP describe their view on T&CM as positive. Most HCP (90%) think that their cancer patients use T&CM. Main concerns about T&CM of HCP are: giving false hope to vulnerable patients (88%), lack of evidence that T&CM works (87%), and their own limited T&CM knowledge (80%). Significantly more doctors (88%) than other HCP (69%) are concerned about doctor's inadequate knowledge of T&CM (P = 0.006). Almost all HCP (96%) think that parents should receive guidance by doctors in hospital about potential beneficial and harmful effects of T&CM. HCP (91%) find it important that parents inform them if their child with cancer uses T&CM. Yet, only 5% of HCP always ask parents whether they use T&CM. Most HCP think that parents are afraid to disclose their T&CM use to doctors (78%) and subsequently do not inform their doctors (76%) out of fear to receive less care from doctors (55%). Parents actually do receive less care from doctors if they disclose interest in T&CM according to 31% of HCP.
Conclusion
HCP should update their knowledge about T&CM. Doctors should openly discuss T&CM with parents, without penalizing them after T&CM disclosure.}

abstract = {Background
Diabetes may be a cultural experience for many First Nations patients. In this study, we explore the potential role for traditional medicine in the treatment of diabetes.
Methods
A responsive interviewing qualitative methodology was used for 10 First Nations key informant interviews. The first objective was to accurately “re-tell” participants' stories. The second was to develop an overview of traditional medicine and its role in health and diabetes management by synthesizing academic literature, pre-existing local knowledge and perspectives, and stories shared by elders and traditional healers. The traditional medicine healers gave specific permission for this study and its publication.
Results
There is a strong cultural and historic context for the experience of diabetes in First Nations. Political and cultural suppression, lifestyle change and ongoing social determinants of health place diabetes in a unique context and generate a sense of fatalism. Traditional medicine can facilitate individual empowerment by connecting a patient with the lessons of previous generations and traditional beliefs and practices.
Conclusions
Traditional medicine can be a valuable resource for First Nations patients living with diabetes and should be considered as a therapeutic modality.
Résumé
Introduction
De nombreux patients des Premières Nations se représentent le diabète comme une expérience culturelle. Dans la présente étude, nous examinons le rôle potentiel de la médecine traditionnelle dans le traitement du diabète.
Méthodes
Nous avons utilisé une méthodologie qualitative fondée sur l’entretien ouvert lors d’entrevues menées auprès des principaux informateurs des Premières Nations. Le premier objectif était de raconter de nouveau avec précision les récits des participants. Le second objectif était d’obtenir une vue d’ensemble de la médecine traditionnelle et de son rôle dans la prise en charge de la santé et du diabète par la synthèse de la documentation universitaire, des connaissances et des points de vue locaux préexistants, et des récits partagés par les aînés et les guérisseurs traditionnels. Les guérisseurs traditionnels nous ont donné une autorisation spéciale pour réaliser cette étude et la publier.
Résultats
L’expérience du diabète au sein des Premières Nations s’inscrit dans un contexte culturel et historique fort. La répression politique et culturelle, les changements dans le mode de vie et les déterminants sociaux actuels de la santé placent le diabète dans un contexte particulier et suscitent un sentiment de fatalisme. La médecine traditionnelle peut favoriser l’autonomisation individuelle en mettant en connexion le patient avec les leçons des générations précédentes et les croyances et les pratiques traditionnelles.
Conclusions
La médecine traditionnelle qui est une ressource précieuse pour les patients diabétiques des Premières Nations devrait être considérée comme une modalité thérapeutique.}

keywords = {Hospital discharge, Risk prediction, Medication-related harm, Polypharmacy, High-risk medicines},
abstract = {Background
The imperative to identify patients at risk of medication-related harm has never been greater. Hospital clinicians cannot easily predict risk of readmission or harm. Candidate variables associated with medication-related harm derived from the literature or significantly represented in a complex patient cohort have been previously described by PHarmacie-4. With a focus on polypharmacy and high-risk medicines in vulnerable patient cohorts, PHarmacie-4 was easy to use and highlighted risks. However it over-estimated risk, reducing its usefulness in stratifying risk of readmission.
Objective
Develop a risk prediction tool built into a smart phone app, enabling clinicians to identify and refer high-risk patients for an early post-discharge medicines review. Demonstrate usability, real world application and validity in an independent dataset.
Methods
A retrospective, observational study was conducted with 1201 randomly selected patients admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital between June 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Patient characteristics and outcomes of interest were reported, including unplanned hospital utilisation at 30, 60 and 90 days post-discharge. Using multivariable logistic regression modelling, an algorithm was developed, built into a smart phone app and used and validated in an independent dataset.
Results
738 patients (61%) were included in the derivation sample. The best predictive performance was achieved by PHarmacie-R (C-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.68–0.75) which included PHarmacie-4 risk variables, a non-linear effect of age, unplanned hospital utilisation in the preceding six months and gender. The independent validation dataset had a C-statistic of 0.64 (95% CI 0.56–0.72).
Conclusion
PHarmacie-R is the first readmission risk prediction tool, built into a smart phone app, focussing on polypharmacy and high-risk medicines in vulnerable patients. It can assist clinical pharmacists to identify medical inpatients who may benefit from early post-discharge medication management services. External validation is needed to enable application in other clinical settings.}

Wilderness medicine (WM) graduate medical education (GME) fellowships were established in 2003. Outcomes and satisfaction of US WM GME fellowship alumni can inform prospective applicants and program directors of the strengths of fellowships and professional gaps in them.
Methods
A 34-question Qualtrics survey was emailed to 111 alumni from 17 institutions listed in the Wilderness Medical Society’s GME database in May 2019. Professional service, scholarship, and satisfaction were queried. Results are represented as percent response (n=answered affirmative) based on the number of respondents per question.
Results
The survey response rate was 41% (n=46); 67% reported (n=31) Fellowship of the Academy of Wilderness Medicine recognition. Within the last 5 y, 71% (n=32) reported publications in WM. Free text entry questions had 78% (n=28) describe improved clinical skills, and 68% (n=26) were exposed to new career choices in fellowship. Those who rated exposure to a variety of WM knowledge and skills highly rated the overall fellowship experience higher (P<0.001), as did those reporting a higher number of WM publications (P=0.023). Nearly half, 48% (n=21), felt they could hold their current position without fellowship training. In hindsight, 76% (n=34) would follow the same professional path.
Conclusions
WM GME fellowship alumni reported high rates of professional engagement and scholarly productivity in the subspecialty. Responding alumni overwhelmingly rated the fellowship experience positively. Fellowships that ensure a wide exposure to experiences and foster scholarly productivity are more likely to yield professionally satisfied graduates.}

Therefore, it is very important to establish an accurate detection method. The current study presents a stable isotope labeling matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (SIL-MALDI-HRMS) method for high-throughput quantitative analysis of androgenic steroid adulteration. A pair of isotope labeling reagents (d0/d5-Girard's reagent P, d0/d5-GP) were employed to label steroids prior to MALDI-HRMS detection. The signal intensity was significantly improved, and the signal fluctuations were compensated by employing d5-GP labeled analytes as the internal standards. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of four steroids (nandrolone, testosterone, methyltestosterone, and testosterone propionate) were in the ranges of 0.18–0.48 μg/g. The calibration curves were obtained with acceptable linearities (R2 > 0.99). The relative recoveries ranged from 87.9% to 118.1%, and the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) were all less than 13.4%, which were satisfactory for quantitative analysis. The potential of the GP labeling strategy to improve the MALDI detection sensitivity was further demonstrated by the successful detection of cinnamaldehyde and 2′-methoxycinnamaldehyde in cinnamon-containing samples. Compared with the reported methods, the developed method proved to be high-throughput, highly selective, and accurate for androgenic steroids analysis in complex samples with good sensitivity.}

abstract = {Background
Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have restricted pharmacotherapy options and thus resort to herbal medicines (HMs), despite limited and conflicting evidence. Therefore, use of HMs needs to be assessed in patients with ALS.
Purpose
This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of HMs in ALS and to describe the characteristics of HM users.
Study Design
The correlation between HMs and prognosis was determined based on data obtained from the largest ALS database with high-quality clinical trials. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to address confounding and selection bias.
Methods
In total, 321 and 231 HM users with at least a 4-week HM prescription were identified and PS-matched with non-HM users at a 1:1 ratio based on predefined confounders. Time-to-event models with censoring at 12 or 18 months were established for survival analyses. For evaluating activity limitation and respiratory function, 320 and 376 HM users were included, respectively, and analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).
Results
The profiles of 321 HM users indicated a better condition compared with that of non-HM users before PS-matching, including higher weight (median [IQR], 77.90 [21.8] kg vs. 74.00 [21.2] kg, p < 0.01), higher body mass index (26.00 [5.4] vs. 25.20 [5.8], p < 0.01), more percentage of limb onset (261 [81.3%] vs. 2366 [67.2%], p < 0.01), and slower progression (0.47 [0.5] vs. 0.51 [0.5], p = 0.03). HM did not significantly affect survival at 12 months (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49–1.03; log-rank p = 0.069), but it significantly prolonged survival at 18 months (adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98; log-rank p = 0.038). After imputation of missing data, MANOVA revealed significant effectiveness of HMs in improving activity limitation (Pillai trace, 0.0195; p = 0.03).
Conclusion
PS-based methods eliminated baseline differences between HM and non-HM users. Overall, the use of HM to treat patients with ALS is favored based on their association with prolonged overall survival within 18 months and improved activity limitation.}

Conventional treatments for functional dyspepsia (FD) are limited. Herbal medicine (HM) use is prevalent despite unclear comparative effectiveness among different formulae.
Aim of the study
This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of HM formulae for FD against placebo.
Materials and methods
Seven international and Chinese databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on HM versus placebo. Risk of bias among RCTs was assessed using Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool 2. Data from RCTs were extracted for random-effect pairwise meta-analyses. NMAs were performed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of HM formulae. GRADE partially contextualised framework was adopted to facilitate NMA result interpretation.
Results
Twelve different HM formulae were identified from fifteen RCTs of mediocre quality. At 8-week follow-up, pairwise meta-analyses indicated that HM was superior to placebo in alleviating global symptoms (pooled risk difference (RD): 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.11–0.29), with effect size larger than the minimally clinically important difference of 0.20 RD. Sensitivity analysis showed no significant impact on results attributable to risk of bias. NMAs demonstrated that Xiao Yao Pill and Modified Ban Xia Xie Xin Decoction probably have a large beneficial effect on alleviating global symptoms (RD: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.03–0.99) and postprandial fullness (standardised mean difference: −0.93; 95% credible interval: −1.61 to −0.06), respectively. No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions
Xiao Yao Pill and Modified Ban Xia Xie Xin Decoction may be considered as an alternative among patients unresponsive to conventional treatments. The comparative effectiveness of these two formulae should be evaluated in future trials.}

The use of herbs later in life is an important research area, yet there is little known about older adults’ herb use in Ghana. This qualitative study offers a better understanding of the motivations for herb use among older adults in Ghana.
Methods
Two separate focus group discussions were conducted for individuals who participated in a study investigating healthcare use among older adults in the Kumasi Metropolis of Ghana. Nineteen older adults (10 males, 9 females) participated in the focus group discussions. Discussion responses were coded and analysed.
Results
Older adults used various kinds of medicinal herbs which include ginger (Zingiber officinale), garlic (Allium sativum), moringa (Moringa oleifera), Bonto (Nicotiana tabacum) and Sorowisa (Piper guineense) for treating and preventing various illnesses and diseases. Reasons for herb use in later life included: (1) the perceived safety and efficacy of herbal remedies; (2) a lack of trust in conventional drugs; (3) cultural sensitivity of herbal remedies; (4) perception of positive health outcomes and status as a result of herbal medicine use; (5) unpleasant experiences of using western medications; and (6) the availability, accessibility and affordability of herbal remedies compared to conventional drugs. There was a lack of disclosure of herb use to healthcare professionals. In most cases, participants used herbs concurrently with pharmaceuticals without the knowledge of possible side effects and interactions.
Conclusion
This paper provides evidence to suggest that the implementation of an intercultural healthcare system should be considered by the relevant authorities within the Ghana health sector.}

abstract = {Stem and progenitor cells located within stem cell niches maintain the renewal and regeneration of tissues and organs throughout the life of an adult organism. Stem cell niche component dysfunction might alter the activity of stem cells and ultimately lead to the development of difficult-to-treat chronic or acute disorders. Of note, some cases of idiopathic male infertility, a highly prevalent diagnosis with no specific treatment options, might be associated with a spermatogonial stem cell(SSC) niche disturbance. To overcome this disease entity, approaches aiming at launching the regeneration of an altered stem cell niche are worth considering. Particularly, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) or their secretome might fulfill this task due to their promising contribution in recovering injured stem cell niches. However, the successful application of MSC-based treatment is limited by the uncovered mechanisms of action of MSCs and their secretome. Specific animal models should be developed or adapted to reveal the role of MSCs and their secretome in a stem cell niche recovery. In this review, in a bid to consider MSCs and their secretome as a therapeutic regenerative approach for idiopathic male infertility we focus on the rationale of SSC niche injury modeling.}

The objective of this study was to assess resident and faculty perception of the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the training experience, education, and psychological well-being of oral medicine (OM) residents.
Study Design
An anonymous 16-item online questionnaire was e-mailed to faculty and residents of all Commission on Dental Accreditation–accredited OM residency programs in North America. Survey questions asked about the pandemic's effect on resident educational, clinical, and research activities and the well-being of the residents. Survey data were collected using Qualtrics XM.
Results
Forty participants (52.5% residents and 47.5% faculty members) responded to the survey. Regarding the effect on clinical activities, 67.5% reported 50% or less reduction in patient volume seen by residents at its worst during the pandemic. With respect to educational activities, most reported a complete switch of didactic training (85.3%), academic examinations (60%), and off-site resident rotations (45%) to a virtual platform. Research activities were affected the most; 55% reported complete cessation for some time. Thirty-three percent perceived a negative effect, 18% perceived no effect, 11% perceived a positive effect, and 38% were unsure regarding the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 on resident morale. Despite the interruptions in the clinical, research, and educational activities, 62.5% expected on-time resident graduation.
Conclusion
Despite constraints due to the pandemic, OM residency programs successfully continued clinical activities, didactic training, and research productivity through virtual means and a hybrid delivery care model while supporting their residents’ morale.}

abstract = {Background
Biosimilars can improve patient access to biological medicines. Although biosimilars have been shown to be equally effective and safe, some patients remain reluctant to transition to biosimilars. Pharmacists may support patients changing to biosimilars and are often at the frontline for dealing with queries and concerns, but their confidence and readiness for this role are unclear.
Objective
This study examines pharmacists' confidence in explaining biosimilars to patients and explores the information they would provide in response to common queries.
Methods
Practicing community, hospital, and primary care pharmacists (N = 142) in New Zealand completed an Internet-based survey on their experience and familiarity with bio-originators and biosimilars, attitudes and concerns towards biosimilars, confidence in explaining key concepts, and responses to common queries. A hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine possible factors associated with confidence in explaining biosimilars, and a content synthesis was conducted to examine responses to common patient queries.
Results
Pharmacists were most confident in explaining how biosimilars are administered, their efficacy, and cost-saving, and least confident in describing manufacturing and testing. Respondents who had more positive attitudes (B = 1.64, p < .001) and more familiarity with biosimilars (B = 27.15, p < .001) were more confident in educating patients. Pharmacists' main concerns about biosimilars included reduced efficacy, safety, and a lack of knowledge and acceptance. Responses to common queries were diverse but further highlighted several gaps in knowledge. Gaps included being unable to define biosimilars, provide information on side effects, and believing that biosimilars undergo the same testing process as bio-originators. Pharmacists wanted resources (written and Internet-based) to improve their knowledge and ability to educate patients.
Conclusions
Pharmacists reported a lack of knowledge and confidence in explaining manufacturing processes and testing of biosimilars. Additional resources are needed to support their practice and may help improve patient and companion acceptance of biosimilars.}

abstract = {Background
Diabetic patients are at high risk of developing cancer. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has become increasingly popular as an adjuvant treatment for patients with chronic diseases, and some studies have identified its beneficial effect in diabetic patients with cancer. The purpoes of this study was to outline the potential of TCM to attenuate hospitalization and mortality rates in diabetic patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Methods
A total of 6,987 diabetic subjects with CIS under TCM therapy were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, along with 38,800 of 1:1 sex-, age-, and index year-matched controls without TCM therapy. Cox proportional hazard analysis was conducted to compare hospitalization and mortality rates during an average of 15 years of follow-up.
Results
A total of 3,999/1,393 enrolled-subjects (28.62%/9.97%) had hospitalization/mortality, including 1,777/661 in the TCM group (25.43%/9.46%) and 2,222/732 in the control group (31.80%/10.48%). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed a lower rate of hospitalization and mortality for subjects in the TCM group (adjusted HR=0.536; 95% CI=0.367–0.780, P<0.001; adjusted HR=0.783; 95% CI=0.574–0.974, P = 0.022). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative risk of hospitalization and mortality in the case and control groups was significantly different (log rank, P<0.001 and P = 0.011, respectively).
Conclusions
Diabetic patients with CIS under TCM therapy were associated with lower hospitalization and mortality rates compared to those without TCM therapy. Thus, TCM application may reduce the burden of national medical resources.}

abstract = {Bone tissue engineering holds great promise for the regeneration of damaged or severe bone defects. However, several challenges hinder its translation into clinical practice. To address these challenges, interdisciplinary efforts and advances in biomaterials, cell biology, and bioengineering are required. In recent years, nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)-based scaffolds have emerged as a promising approach for the development of bone regenerative agents. The unique similarity of nHA with minerals found in natural bones promotes remineralization and stimulates bone growth, which are crucial factors for efficient bone regeneration. Moreover, nHA exhibits desirable properties, such as strong chemical interactions with bone and facilitation of tissue growth, without inducing inflammation or toxicity. It also promotes osteoblast survival, adhesion, and proliferation, as well as increasing alkaline phosphatase activity, osteogenic differentiation, and bone-specific gene expression. However, it is important to note that the effect of nHA on osteoblast behavior is dose-dependent, with cytotoxic effects observed at higher doses. Additionally, the particle size of nHA plays a crucial role, with smaller particles having a more significant impact. Therefore, in this review, we highlighted the potential of nHA for improving bone regeneration processes and summarized the available data on bone cell response to nHA-based scaffolds. In addition, an attempt is made to portray the current status of bone tissue engineering using nHA/polymer hybrids and some recent scientific research in the field.}

QiruiWeishu capsule is an herbal preparation from a herbal formula prescribed by an experienced doctor at Guang'anmen Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. It has been used clinically for more than 30 years. Abdominal pain, distension, and nausea are common symptoms of chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosion dampness and heat stasis syndrome, and this herbal medicine has been used to treat them.
Aim of the study
To verify the clinical efficacy and safety of QiruiWeishu capsule in the treatment of chronic non-atrophic gastritis with damp-heat stasis syndrome.
Materials and methods
This study was a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial with positive herbal drug SanjiuWeitai capsule as control and superiority test of main efficacy. A total of 477 subjects with chronic non-atrophic gastritis with erosion diagnosed by gastroscopy and pathological biopsy were randomly divided into QiruiWeishu capsule and SanjiuWeitai groups respectively in a ratio of 3:1. During the trial, subjects were required to complete medication for 28 days. The primary outcome was the disappearance rate of epigastric pain from baseline to 4weeks. At baseline, treatment at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, and follow-up at 8 and 16 weeks, the epigastric pain and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) symptom scores were evaluated; gastroscopy, histopathology, and the helicobacter pylori test were evaluated at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. The safety assessment included blood routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation of laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG).
Results
Both groups of subjects had a high level of medication adherence (defined as treatment completion for over 80%) (346/357, 96.9% in Qirui Weishu group vs 118/120, 98.3% in Sanjiu Weitai group; p > 0.05). The QiruiWeishu capsule was significantly better than SanjiuWeitai capsule in disappearance rate of epigastric pain (64.2%, 229/357vs 46.7%, 56/120; p < 0.001)，especially subgroupsubjects with moderate epigastric pain (65.0%, 89/137 vs 30.4%, 14/46; p < 0.001), grade1 erythema (67.7%, 149/220 vs 51.9%, 42/81; p = 0.011) and grade 2 erythema (57.6%, 70/121 vs37.1%, 13/35; p = 0.050) of gastroscopy, grade 2 erosion (66.7%, 118/177 vs43.9%, 25/57; p = 0.002) of gastroscopy and Helicobacter pylori negative (65.4%, 155/237 vs 42.7%, 35/82; p < 0.001) at baseline. For the scores of TCM symptoms in QiruiWeishu group were significantly lower than those in SanjiuWeitai group after 28 days of treatment (p = 0.002). The number and incidence of adverse events related to the trial drug were 14/355 (3.9%) in QiruiWeishu group, 6/118 (5.1%) in SanjiuWeitai group (p > 0.05). No serious adverse reactions occurred in the two groups. According to laboratory tests and ECG, there was no discernible effect on heart, liver, kidney, or blood coagulation function.
Conclusion
Qirui Weishu capsule appears to be more effective in terms of symptoms than the SanjiuWeitai capsule, and its use is both safe and effective for the treatment of chronic non-atrophic gastritis. A further randomized, double-blind, placebo-control trial is warranted to verify its benefit.}

MiRNAs act as potent therapeutic weapon in cancer, but their potential therapeutic use is limited by the off-target effect due to their nonspecific distribution in normal tissues. The encapsulation of miRNAs in nanostructured carriers allows targeted effects aimed to destroy cancer cells, without affecting healthy tissues. Due to their small size and the optimal surface/size ratio, nanoparticles (NPs) envelop, protect, and release miRNAs, representing a promising strategy in cancer treatment.

We look at how Ghanaian children pragmatically deal with everyday health concerns and argue children are agents of medicalization and medicalization enables agency in children. Through interpretive and collaborative content analysis of structured ethnographic observations of 105 children from different class backgrounds (between June 2016 and December 2017) we found children in Northern Ghana framed situations of feeling ill in markedly biomedical terms and persisted in biomedical treatment even with opposition from adults. We observed that children intentionally navigated opposition from adults, mobilized support through networks, exploited power differences between adults, and organized treatment among themselves if necessary. While girls had an even harder time to muster recognition from adults, we also discovered children from a lower socioeconomic background, with more experience on the street had more leeway in navigating lack of support. So far, children's agency in health and illness has only been discussed in instances where children had already received a professional diagnosis. In our case where children had not yet received a professional diagnosis, we find that agency is enabled through bodily awareness, experience, interactions with peers, family, and the media; all working as tools for children to self-diagnose and to deal with illness in a postcolonial setting.}

Qingkailing (QKL), Reduning (RDN), Xiyanping (XYP), Tanreqing (TRQ) and Yuxingcao (YXC) injections are all phlegm-heat clearing Chinese medicine (CM) injections composed of the extract from traditional CM materials. Evidence from clinical studies and animal experiments indicates that the above CM injections are effective supplementary therapy for acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and clinicians are faced with a difficult choice on the optimal phlegm-heat clearing CM injection for AECOPD.
Aim of the study
This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of five commonly used phlegm-heat clearing CM injections for COPD.
Materials and methods
A pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness of QKL, RDN, TRQ, XYP and YXC on AECOPD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by searching English and Chinese databases. The primary outcome was lung function (forced expiration volume [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]), blood gas analysis index was secondary outcome measure. Winbugs and Stata 15.0 software were used for data analysis.
Results
A total of 57 RCTs were included. The pairwise analyses showed that each of the injections combined with routine treatment were superior to routine treatment alone [FEV1: QKL, MD 0.20, 95% CI (0.06, 0.35); RDN, MD 0.24, 95% CI (0.08, 0.40); TRQ, MD 0.24, 95% CI (0.19, 0.29); XYP, MD 0.26, 95% CI (0.20, 0.32); YXC MD 0.73, 95% CI (0.06, 1.41)]. The network meta-analysis provided the following rank of lung function improvement: FEV1: YXC > TRQ > XYP > RDN > QKL; FVC: YXC > TRQ > QKL > RDN > XYP. RDN and YXC ranked highest in blood gas analysis index. RDN was the highest ranked injection for effectiveness, followed by QKL, TRQ, XYP, then YXC. Most of the injections appeared safe, with severe adverse events rarely reported.
Conclusion
This study suggests that YXC and TRQ are the most effective therapies in treating AECOPD patients. RDN and YXC are more effective in the alleviation of clinical symptoms. Given that the safety of YXC is controversial, TRQ and RDN may be preferable as phlegm-heat clearing CM injections in the adjuvant treatment of AECOPD.}

Advances in electromechanical technology have led to renewed interest in developing unique pressure monitors in the other cardiac chambers, potentially allowing for precise hemodynamic monitoring tailored to disease and patient-specific states. Further adaptation of cardiac implantable electronic devices and noninvasive wearable technologies to detect lung congestion as a surrogate for impending decompensation have resulted in a wide variety of devices adaptable to unique patient preferences. The popularity in direct-to-consumer wearable health technologies have also added to the armamentarium of cardiovascular specialists in CVD screening and health promotion.

abstract = {Background
There are few contemporary data on outcomes, costs, and treatment following a hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) in epidemiologically representative cohorts.
Objectives
This study sought to describe rehospitalizations, hospitalization costs, use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) (renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors), and mortality after hHF.
Methods
EVOLUTION HF (Utilization of Dapagliflozin and Other Guideline Directed Medical Therapies in Heart Failure Patients: A Multinational Observational Study Based on Secondary Data) is an observational, longitudinal cohort study using data from electronic health records or claims data sources in Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Adults with a first hHF discharge between 2018 and 2022 were included. The 1-year event rates per 100 patient-years (ERs) for death and rehospitalizations (with a primary diagnosis of heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease [CKD], myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral artery disease) were calculated. Hospital health care costs were cumulatively summarized. Cumulative GDMT use was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.
Results
Of 263,525 patients, 28% died within the first year post-hHF (ER: 28.4 [95% CI: 27.0-29.9]). Rehospitalizations were mainly driven by HF (ER: 13.6 [95% CI: 9.8-17.4]) and CKD (ER: 4.5 [95% CI: 3.6-5.3]), whereas the ERs for myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease were lower. Health care costs were predominantly driven by HF and CKD. Between 2020 and 2022, use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists changed little, whereas uptake of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors increased 2- to 7-fold.
Conclusions
Incident post-hHF rehospitalization risks and costs were high, and GDMT use changed little in the year following discharge, highlighting the need to consider earlier and greater implementation of GDMT to manage risks and reduce costs.}

But like any human activity, it is not neutral in terms of environmental impact. Therefore, and like any industry, the pharmaceutical sector needs to consider the environmental aspects into its product design and activities in order to reach a sustainable production and consumption patterns, as defined by the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 of the United Nations. With a holistic perspective, the eco-design concept is an approach that aims to integrate environmental aspects into product design. To contribute to the SDGs, the pharmaceutical industry needs to consider the environmental impacts of its products. Usually, experts within Research & Development (R&D) do not have the proper level of knowledge to integrate the environmental aspects, in a Lifecycle perspective, into their decision making. Even so, those parameters are not yet part of the New Product Development (NPD) process of the medicine product. With those elements in mind, the aim of this paper is to understand which phases of the pharmaceutical R&D process represent an opportunity to eco-design such products. We proposed two qualitative experimentations with, first interviewing ten practitioners of R&D; and second, with an assessment of the medicine NPD process and related deliverables, based on LCA results. The use of such results to investigate potential key contributors during NPD stages does not seem to be explored yet, especially for the pharmaceutical sector. Results show that eco-design approaches can be performed all along the development of a pharmaceutical product. Main eco-design levers appear in parallel to the clinical phases 2a and 2b, in other words, when the tests on the final marketed form are initiated.}

abstract = {Background
Geographic variation in health care spending is typically attributed to differences in patient health status and provider practice patterns. While medicolegal considerations (i.e., “defensive medicine”) anecdotally impact health care spending, this phenomenon is difficult to measure. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the medicolegal environment and Medicare costs for diabetes and associated conditions of interest to vascular surgeons. Specifically, we hypothesized that an adverse medicolegal environment is associated with higher per capita Medicare costs for diabetic patients.
Methods
Medicare data including the most recent (2018) Medicare Geographic Variation Public Use Files and Chronic Conditions Data Files were linked to National Practitioner Data Bank files from the preceding 5 years (2013–2017), in addition to the US census data and American Medical Association workforce statistics. The state-level medicolegal environment was characterized by K-means clustering across a panel of metrics related to malpractice payment magnitude and prevalence. Per capita Medicare spending for diabetes was compared across 5 distinct medicolegal environments. Costs were standardized and risk-adjusted to account for known geographic variation in health care costs and patient population. Analysis of variance was applied to unadjusted data, followed by multivariate regression modeling. Readmission rates, per capita imaging studies, per capita tests, per capita procedures, and lower extremity amputation rates were compared between the least litigious quintile from the K-means clustering and the 2 most litigious quintiles.
Results
The median unadjusted Medicare per capita expenditure on diabetic patients was $15,963 ($14,885–$17,673), ranging from $13,762 (Iowa) to $21,865 (D.C.). A 1.6-fold variation persisted after payment standardization. Cluster analysis based on malpractice-related variables yields 5 distinct medicolegal environments, based on litigation frequency and malpractice payment amounts. Per capita spending on diabetes varied, ranging from $15,799 in states with low payments and infrequent litigation to $18,838 in states with the most adverse medicolegal environment (P < 0.05). After cost standardization and risk adjustment with multiple linear regression, malpractice claim prevalence (per 100 physicians) remained an independent predictor of states with the highest diabetes mellitus spending (P = 0.022). Moreover, diabetic patients in states with adverse medicolegal environments had more procedures, imaging studies, and readmissions (P < 0.05 for all) but did not have significant differences in amputation rates compared to less litigious states.
Conclusions
An adverse medicolegal environment is independently associated with higher health care costs but does not result in improved outcome (i.e. amputation rate) for diabetic Medicare beneficiaries. Across states, a 1% increase in lawsuits/100 physicians was associated with a >10% increase in risk-adjusted standardized per capita costs. These findings demonstrate the potential contribution of “defensive medicine” to variation in health care utilization and spending in a population of interest to vascular surgeons.}

Perioperative medicine delivers patient-centred, multidisciplinary, integrated care for patients from the contemplation of surgery throughout the surgical pathway to recovery. High-quality perioperative care reduces complications, improves outcomes, and leads to improved patient satisfaction and reduced healthcare costs. This article is based on key findings and recommendations from the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) national report on perioperative medicine and outlines key concepts of perioperative medicine; exploring how practice can be transformed to improve care. The GIRFT report was produced using information gathered from 72 visits and 119 surveys from NHS trusts in England. It illustrates examples of exemplary perioperative care across the country but also describes variation in access to and provision of perioperative care. To address this unwarranted variation and to tackle the implementation gap, transformation of perioperative care pathways ensuring a patient-centered approach, multi-professional collaboration and widespread adoption of best practice will be required.}

abstract = {Introduction
Several studies suggest the relevance of healthcare simulation to prepare future doctors to deliver bad news. A such, we designed a role-play workshop to train first-year residents enrolled in Lille University School of Medicine to break bad news. The objective of this work is to report on our experience of this training and to assess its educational value through its capacity to satisfy residents’ expectations, to induce a feeling of ease towards bad news disclosure, and to change trainees’ preconceptions regarding these situations.
Methods
The training consisted of a 45-minute heuristic reflective activity, aimed at identifying residents’ preconceptions regarding bad news disclosure, followed by 4 30-min role-plays in which they played the parts of the physician, the patient and/or their relatives. Trainees were asked to answer 2 questionnaires (pre- and post-training), exploring previous experiences, preconceived ideas regarding bad news disclosure and workshop satisfaction.
Results
Almost all residents felt very satisfied with the workshop, which they regarded as formative (91%) and not too stressful (89%). The majority felt “more capable” (53% vs. 83%) and “more comfortable” (27% vs. 62%) to deliver bad news, especially regarding “finding the right words” (12% vs. 22%). Trainees tended to overestimate their skills before the workshop and lowered their assessment of their performance after attending the training, especially when they played the role of a patient in the simulation.
Conclusion
Healthcare role-play seems an interesting technique for training to breaking bad news. Placing residents in the role of patients or relatives is an active approach that encourages reflexivity.
Résumé
Introduction
Plusieurs études suggèrent l’intérêt de la simulation pour préparer les futurs médecins à l’annonce de mauvaise nouvelle. Le dispositif « ADIAMED », un atelier de formation des internes de phase socle à l’annonce de mauvaise nouvelle par le jeu de rôle, a été déployé au sein de l’UFR3S Lille. L’objectif de ce travail est de rapporter notre expérience de cet atelier et d’évaluer sa valeur pédagogique, mesurée à travers la satisfaction des internes, le sentiment d’aisance vis-à-vis de l’annonce induit par l’atelier, et sa capacité à induire un changement dans leurs idées préconçues.
Méthodes
La formation se déroulait sur une demi-journée et était constituée d’un temps de réflexion, puis de mise en jeu de différents scénarios où les étudiants tenaient les rôles du médecin, du patient ou d’un proche. L’expérience des étudiants était recueillie via 2 questionnaires (pré- et post-formation).
Résultats
Les étudiants étaient satisfaits de l’atelier qu’ils trouvaient peu stressant et formateur. La majorité des internes se sentaient « plus capables » (53 % vs 83 %) et « plus à l’aise » (27 % vs 62 %), notamment pour « trouver les mots appropriés » (12 % vs 22 %). Les étudiants avaient tendance avant formation à surestimer leurs capacités d’annonce et revoyaient celles-ci à la baisse après avoir assisté à la formation, en particulier lorsqu’ils jouaient le rôle de patient dans la simulation.
Conclusion
Le jeu de rôle en santé semble une méthode intéressante pour la formation à l’annonce de mauvaise nouvelle. Mettre les étudiants dans le rôle du patient ou du proche est une approche active et favorisant la réflexivité.}

Traditional univariate chromatography faced challenges with co-elution, unknown interferences, and retention time shift when analyzing isomeric analytes in varying sample matrices. We presented a chemometrics-enhanced high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) strategy for simultaneous quantification of six protoberberine alkaloids and processed multi-channels chromatographic-spectral data with four second-order calibration algorithms. Chromatographic conditions were firstly optimized. Four groups of predicted samples were modeled individually with the designed calibration set. Mathematical resolutions were then obtained, and pseudo-univariate regression gave the quantitative concentration of each analyte. Four models were scored on fit, linearity, recovery, and robustness, where alternating trilinear decomposition assisted multivariate curve resolution (ATLD-MCR) exhibited an optimal and stable performance. Besides, the resolved spectra presented high consistency with the actual spectra (r≥0.9993). Limits of quantification (LOQ) fully met the pharmacopoeia stipulation and were 0.17, 0.60, 0.19, 0.74, 0.15, and 0.38 µg mL−1 for columbamine, epiberberine, jatrorrhizine, coptisine, palmatine, and berberine, respectively. The importance of this strategy is to exploit collinearity resolution and additional selectivity that permit accurate quantitation at poor chromatographic resolutions, avoiding individual pretreatment and HPLC optimizations for different samples. This study provides a universal alternative for routine quality assessment of protoberberine alkaloids in CR-related medicines.}

Despite poor survival for patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, only 10–16% of patients are reported to be included in early phase trials. This study aimed to explore the impact of molecular profiling within the prospective precision cancer medicine trial MAPPYACTS (NCT02613962) on subsequent early phase trial recruitment and treatment by matched targeted therapies in this population.
Methods and materials
Clinical data from all French patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma enrolled in MAPPYACTS were analyzed for subsequent matched/non-matched targeted treatment based on clinical tumor board (CMTB) recommendations.
Results
From 93 patients with neuroblastoma included in French centers, 78 (84%) underwent whole exome and RNA sequencing and were discussed in the CMTB. Higher rate of successful sequencing analysis was observed in patients with relapsed disease compared to those with refractory disease (p = 0.0002). Among the 50 patients that presented with a new disease relapse/progression after the CMTB recommendations, 35 patients (70%) had at least one actionable alteration identified on the tumor at the time of relapse. Eighteen patients (36%) were included in an early phase clinical trial, 11 of these with a matched agent, 7 with a non-matched treatment; 13 patients were included in the AcSé ESMART trial. Five patients (10%) received a matched targeted therapy outside a clinical trial.
Conclusion
Patients with neuroblastoma in the European MAPPYACTS trial were more likely to be included in early phase trials compared to previous reports. Early deep sequencing at first treatment failure, comprehensive therapeutic discussions in molecular tumor boards and innovative trials like AcSé -ESMART improve access to innovative therapies for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

keywords = {Biological activity, Chemical profile, , Medicinal plants, , Systematics of Acanthaceae},
abstract = {Introduction
The botanical family Acanthaceae (order Lamiales) potentially comprises 4900 species in 191 genera with extensive morphological, habit and habitat diversity. The family is widely distributed throughout the world but is especially rich in tropical and subtropical regions. Many of its species have great ornamental importance and are broadly used for medicinal purposes in several countries of Asia and Africa. Brazil is a main center of diversity of the family, where they are distributed across all its biomes, mainly in the herbaceous-shrub stratum. Medicinal investigations about Brazilian species are scarce, the exception being a single native species, Justicia pectoralis Jacq., that is widely used and studied chemically.
Aim of the review
This work compiled studies that indicated folk medicinal use, investigated biological activity, or evaluated the chemical composition of Brazilian species of Acanthaceae. Material and Methods: Medicinal uses, investigations of biological activities and chemical data were collected and summarized through bibliographic surveys. Tables were compiled to standardize the information and the appropriate references were gathered for each species. Registration of chemical components used in the treatment of ailments and in preserving health were emphasized with the aim of stimulating future investigations.
Results
The breadths of habitats and morphologies of the family are directly related to its chemical diversity, as confirmed here for Brazilian species. Although the investigated species represent less than 9% of the total richness of the family in Brazil, they encompass a great diversity of chemical substances. The data indicated folk medicinal uses for 26 species and biological tests for 23, while 30 species were investigated chemically. Ruellia and Justicia were the most researched genera with 12 and 11 species, representing approximately 14% and 7% of Brazilian species of each genus, respectively. Two species are native to other countries but become naturalized in Brazil. Studies of native species were carried out in different countries around the world, with many reports of medicinal uses and biological tests. Examples of uses include anticancer and antidepressant actions, as well as activities against respiratory problems and other diseases.
Conclusions
This work highlights the chemical and biological diversity of the studied Brazilian species of Acanthaceae, which emphasizes the need to expand studies with native Brazilian species.}

With the release of the latest and probably the most accurate photoatomic data library, EPDL2017, the need to re-evaluate all the existing and already established mass attenuation coefficients (MACs) of all radiation shielding materials arises. The MACs of several polymers, alloy-based, glasses, and building materials used in a nuclear medicine facility were investigated using the EPDL2017 library embedded in EpiXS software and were compared to MACs available in the literature. The relative differences between MACEpiXS and MACXCOM were negligible, ranging from 0.02% to 0.36% for most materials. However, for material like a glass comprising of elements Te and La evaluated near their corresponding K-edge energies, the relative differences in MACs increased up to 1.46%. On the other hand, a comparison with MACs calculated based on EPDL97 (a predecessor of EPDL2017) revealed as much as a 6.61% difference. Also, it would seem that the changes in MACs were more evident in the materials composed of high atomic number elements evaluated at x-ray energies compared to materials composed of low atomic number elements evaluated at gamma-ray energies.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Areca Thirteen Pill, also called Gao You-13 (GY-13), is a traditional Mongolian herbal formula and has been extensively used to treat depression in Mongolian areas, which belongs to Heyi disease in Mongolian medicine. Major depressive disorder is a serious psychiatric disease, only one-third of individuals with depression are responsive to current antidepressants in clinic. Growing attention has been attracted by traditional herbal medicines in fighting depression because they are considered safer alternatives to pharmacotherapy.
Aim of the study
To reveal the mechanism of GY-13 in the treatment of depression.
Materials and methods
The rat depression model was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and primary hippocampal neurons were used to construct a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model. The antidepressant effect of GY-13 was then assessed by performing sucrose preference tests, open field tests, and body weight measurements on rats. The expression of cAMP and PKA, mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis were measured.
Results
The results indicate that GY-13 significantly improves depression-like behavior, rescues decreased cAMP， PKA, recovers the mRNA levels of CREB and BDNF, and increases the proliferative activity of hippocampus. In addition, blockade of PKA reverses the effects of GY-13 treatment on CREB mRNA, BDNF mRNA levels. In vitro, GY-13 treatment increased hippocampal proliferative activity and attenuated Glu-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons as well as reduced CREB mRNA and BDNF mRNA expression levels.
Conclusions
Our research demonstrated that GY-13 treatment exerted a potent antidepressant action via activation of cAMP/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, promoting proliferation, and suppressing apoptosis. This research provides molecular biological ground for developing GY-13 into a potent alternative for the intervention of depression.}

Without patient-provided inputs to inform decisions, the current paradigm of patient-centred care makes no sense and sounds at the least irrational if not unethical. Putting PROMs on “centre stage” in cancer research and care, could allow to build a truly Evidence Based Advocacy (EBA) and therefore to empower Evidence Based Medicine (EBM).}

abstract = {Background
One-fifth of all adults in the United States have a mental health disorder. More than 60% of rural Americans live in a mental health provider shortage area. However, psychiatric pharmacist integration has not been widely used to full capacity at many rural, private institutions.
Objective
To assess the impact of psychiatric pharmacist integration into an outpatient, rural primary care office.
Practice description
A rural health institution that provides both inpatient and outpatient care.
Practice innovation
A psychiatric pharmacist was integrated within the outpatient internal medicine clinic. On referral from the primary care provider, the pharmacist, in consultation with the primary care provider, can make pharmacotherapy and monitoring recommendation and determine time to follow-up.
Evaluation methods
Single-center, retrospective cohort study from July 1, 2018, to May 23, 2022, with 3 main components: (1) patient outcomes using a within-subject comparison; (2) potential revenue from billable services and pharmacist interventions from all encounters September 12, 2019, to May 23, 2022; and (3) provider satisfaction using an adapted, anonymous survey. Descriptive statistics or percentages were used for both primary and secondary end points. A McNemar test was performed for repeated measures of nominal data, and a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to analyze continuous data. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
A statistically significant increase in guideline-driven treatments was seen after psychiatric pharmacist integration. A statistically significant improvement in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores was also seen after pharmacist integration in contrast to standard of care. Provider time and health care utilization also showed positive results after pharmacist integration. A total of $29,600 is estimated to have been billable for pharmacist services, and clinic staff perceptions of pharmacist integration proved positive.
Conclusion
Psychiatric pharmacist integration showed a statistically significant positive impact on patient care in a rural internal medicine outpatient clinic.}

abstract = {Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to stroke, heart failure, and death. When AF occurs in the context of a rapid ventricular rate/response (RVR), this can lead to complications, including hypoperfusion and cardiac ischemia. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this dysrhythmia.
Objective
This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning AF with RVR for the emergency clinician.
Discussion
Differentiating primary and secondary AF with RVR and evaluating hemodynamic stability are vital components of ED assessment and management. Troponin can assist in determining the risk of adverse outcomes, but universal troponin testing is not required in patients at low risk of acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease - especially patients with recurrent episodes of paroxysmal AF that are similar to their prior events. Emergent cardioversion is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients. Rate or rhythm control should be pursued in hemodynamically stable patients. Elective cardioversion is a safe option for select patients and may reduce AF symptoms and risk of AF recurrence. Rate control using beta blockers or calcium channel blockers should be pursued in those with AF with RVR who do not undergo cardioversion. Anticoagulation is an important component of management, and several tools (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc) are available to assist with this decision. Direct oral anticoagulants are the first-line medication class for anticoagulation. Disposition can be challenging, and several risk assessment tools (e.g., RED-AF, AFFORD, and the AFTER (complex, modified, and pragmatic) scores) are available to assist with disposition decisions.
Conclusion
An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning AF with RVR can assist emergency clinicians in the care of these patients.}

We evaluated its antipyretic activity on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fever and safety in the liver in comparison with acetaminophen (ACP). Correlation between biochemistry of liver function and the level of cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1) was also evaluated using an ELISA kit. All doses of PSD powder (PSDP) and a 95% ethanol extract of PSD (PSDE) (50, 200, and 400 mg/kg) showed a significant antipyretic effect (* p < 0.05) as compared to ACP. We investigated clinical biochemistry of liver and kidney functions, histopathology, and concentrations of CYP2E1. All treatment groups demonstrated a normal range of clinical biochemistry of liver and kidney functions in comparison with ACP on days 1, 3, 7, and 10. Serum AST, ALP, and LDH levels of PSDE and PSDP showed mean values less than that of ACP on the corresponding days (* p < 0.05). None of the treatment groups showed evidence of hepatocellular damage, nor did they affect CYPE21. The results of histopathology on liver tissue correlated with the biochemistry of liver functions which indicated no hepatotoxicity effect in liver tissue during the seven day treatment. These findings suggest that both forms of PSD remedy possessed marked antipyretic activity and were not hepatotoxic during the seven days of administration in rats.}

The two major theories utilized for diagnosis and treatment in Traditional Thai Medicine (TTM) are the Four Element Theory and the Herbal Flavor Theory. A TTM “Poh-Pu” Remedy has been effectively utilized in Thailand for cancer therapy for centuries.
Aims of study
To investigate anti-inflammatory activity and liver cancer cytotoxicity of Poh-Pu remedy. To determine relationships between the TTM Herbal Flavor theory and the Four Element theory and total flavonoid content and biological activities of Poh-Pu Remedy plant extracts.
Materials and methods
Each plant ingredient was macerated with 95% ethanol. The extracts were investigated for cytotoxic activity against liver cancer using a sulforhodamine B assay, and anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by inhibition of nitric oxide production. The total flavonoid content was determined by an aluminum chloride colorimetric assay. The relationships between the TTM theories, total flavonoid content, and biological activities were evaluated by correlation and cluster analysis.
Results
Mammea siamensis exerted potent cytotoxicity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines with an IC50 of 3.15 ± 0.16 μg/mL and low cytotoxicity to the non-cancerous cells (HaCat) with an IC50 33.39 ± 0.40 μg/mL (Selective index (SI) = 10.6). Tiliacora triandra was selectively cytotoxic to cholangiocarcinama (KKU-M156) cells with an IC50 of 12.65 ± 0.92 μg/mL (SI = 6.4). Curcuma comosa was the most potent anti-inflammatory inhibitor of nitric oxide production with an IC50 of 2.75 ± 0.34 μg/mL. Campomanesia aromatica exhibited the highest total flavonoid content of 259.7 ± 3.21 mg quercetin equivalent/g. Pungent plants were most prevalent in the TTM remedy.
Conclusion
Pungent, fragrant, bitter and nauseating plants utilized in TTM cancer remedy were successfully investigated and identified several lead plants and components with cytotoxic and antiinflammatory activity that require further study. The TTM wind element theory appeared to be aligned with cancer-related activity. Biological activity results of taste from herbs related with The TTM Herbal Flavor theory. The extra-oral locations of flavor receptors are a promising target for biological activity of TTM which require further scrutiny and identified several lead plants and components with cytotoxic and antiinflammatory activities that also require further study.}

Gut microbiota comprises of a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal ecosystem. These microorganisms can participate in gut–brain axis activities, thereby affecting cognitive function and associated behaviours. Increasing evidence has indicated that gut dysbiosis can jeopardise host immune responses and promote inflammation, which may be an initiating factor for the onset and evolution of AD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a promising resource which encompasses immense chemical diversity and multiple-target characteristics for the treatment of AD. Many TCMs regulate the gut microbiota during treatment of diseases, indicating that gut microbiota may be an important target for TCM efficacy. In this review, we summarised the role of the microbiota–gut–brain axis in the development of AD and the effects of TCM in treating AD by regulating the gut microbiota. We anticipate that this review will provide novel perspectives and strategies for future AD research and treatments.}

abstract = {Objective
We determined the distribution of constitutional types of high-normal blood pressure in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and provided evidence for the prevention of high-normal blood pressure and hypertension.
Methods
Eight digital databases were searched from January 2011 to November 2022, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, CNKI, CBM, Wangfang, and CQVIP. We performed a meta-analysis with the random-effects model or fixed-effects model to describe the distribution of constitutional types of high-normal blood pressure in TCM. The studies were assessed based on heterogeneity testing and the potential for publication bias. The meta-analysis was performed on Stata software 15.0.
Results
A total of 17 studies with 8118 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The proportion of the biased constitution (82.3%; 95% CI: 75.6%–89.1%, p < 0.001) was higher than the balanced constitution (17.3%; 95% CI: 10.7–23.8%, p < 0.001). Phlegm-dampness constitution, Yin-deficiency constitution, and damp-heat constitution accounted for 16.0% (95%CI: 10.5–21.5%, p < 0.001), 14.8% (95% CI: 11.0–18.6%, p < 0.001), 11.3% (95% CI: 8.0–14.5%, p < 0.001) of the total high-normal blood pressure cases, respectively. The subgroup analyses performed that region, age and gender were positively associated with the distribution of constitution types of high-normal blood pressure in TCM. Compared with the general population, the risk of high-normal blood pressure in people with the phlegm-dampness constitution, Yin-deficiency constitution, and blood-stasis constitution was 2.665 (95%CI: 2.286–3.106, p < 0.001), 2.378 (95%CI: 1.197–4.724, p = 0.013), 1.965 (95%CI: 1.634–2.363, p < 0.001) times of the general population, respectively. Meanwhile, the risk of high-normal blood pressure was lower in people with a balanced constitution (0.248, 95%CI: 0.165–0.372, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Phlegm-dampness constitution, Yin-deficiency constitution, and damp-heat constitution were the common constitution types of high-normal blood pressure. There might also be differences in the distribution characteristics of TCM constitution among people with high-normal blood pressure in different regions, ages, and genders. Finally, a balanced constitution might be a protective factor for hypertensive people.}

Herein, we reported genetic encoded synthesis of ELP (elastin-like polypeptide) containing ECM domains like RGD (integrin binding ligand) and YIGSR (laminin–selective receptor binding ligand) to regulate cell behaviour in more complex ways, and also better model natural matrices. Thermal responsiveness of the ELPs and structural conformation were determined to confirm its phase transition behaviour. The fusion ELPs derivatives were analysed for mechanical involvement of growth mechanism, regenerative, and healing processes. The designed fusion ELPs promoted fast and strong attachment of fibroblast cells. The fusion ELP derivatives enhanced the migration of keratinocyte cells which of crucial for wound healing. Together it provides a profound matrix for endothelial cells and significantly enhanced tube formation of HUVEC cells. Thus, strategy of using cell adhesive ELP biopolymer emphasizing the role of bioactive ELPs as next generation skin substitutes for regenerative medicine.}
