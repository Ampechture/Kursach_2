abstract = {Poland has a unique history of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) dating back to the 17th century when Polish missionary Michael (Michał) Boym was a pioneer in the field. In the 20th century, his successor, Professor Zbigniew Garnuszewski, reintroduced acupuncture to medical practice in Poland. However, other methods of TCM and its holistic approach to patient care have not found their place in modern medicine in Poland. At present, the legal status of TCM in Poland remains unregulated, with TCM included in the broad spectrum of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices. Few reports are available on the use of TCM methods among the Polish population. Integrative medicine combines conventional medicine with evidence-based CAM interventions and considers all aspects of a patient’s health, including physical, emotional, mental, social, and environmental factors. An integrative healthcare model that incorporates TCM modalities and lifestyle recommendations as well as a whole person approach may provide a more sustainable solution for the constantly underfinanced Polish healthcare system, which faces challenges of multimorbidity in an aging society and limited access to care. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, war in Ukraine, and ongoing climate crisis have underscored the need to strengthen the resilience of the Polish healthcare system and search for new solutions. A model of care that blends the best of biomedicine and TCM healing approaches may be a better option for both patients and the healthcare system in Poland.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Iron is an essential micronutrient for maintaining physiological activities, especially for highly active cardiomyocytes. Inappropriate iron overload or deficiency has a significant impact on the incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Iron overload exerts potentially deleterious effects on doxorubicin (DOX) cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) by participating in lipid peroxides production. Notably, iron overload-associated cell death has been defined as a possible mechanism for ferroptosis. At present, some traditional herbal medicines and extracts have been included in the study of regulating iron overload and the subsequent therapeutic effect on CVD.
Aim of the study
To give an outline of iron metabolism and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes and to focus on herbal medicines and extracts to prevent iron overload in CVD.
Materials and methods
Literature information was systematically collected from ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang data, as well as classic books and clinical reports.
Results
After understanding the mechanism of iron overload on CVD, this paper reviews the therapeutic function of various herbal medicines in eliminating iron overload in CVD. These include Chinese herbal compound prescriptions (Salvia miltiorrhiza injection, Gegen Qinlian decoction, Tongxinluo, Banxia-Houpu decoction), plant extracts, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and polyphenols. Among them, flavonoids are considered to be the most promising compounds because of their prominent iron chelation. Mechanically, these herbal medicines act on the Nrf2 signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, and KAT5/GPX4 signaling pathway, thereby attenuating iron overload and lipid peroxidation in CVD.
Conclusion
Our review provides up-to-date information on herbal medicines that exert cardiovascular protective effects by modulating iron overload and ferroptosis. These herbal medicines hold promise as a template for preventing iron overload in CVD.}

abstract = {Aim
A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of Chinese patent medicines when used in combination with Western medicines for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Methods
CNKI, Wanfang Academic Journal Full Text Database, VIP, Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for clinical studies on the treatment of IBS using Chinese patent medicines that were published from inception until March 15, 2023. The shortlisted data were strictly screened and the data were extracted and evaluated, followed by data analyses and collation using RevMan 5.4 and stata16 software.
Results
The final 21 randomized controlled trials(RCT), which included 14 proprietary Chinese medicines that were all orally administered, were in a total population of 2007 patients. Meta-analysis revealed that the combination of Chinese patent medicines with Western medicines could improve the overall clinical effectiveness (OR = 3.81, 95 % CI [2.84–5.12], P < 0.00001); significantly improved the abdominal pain scores (MD = -0.66, 95 % CI [-0.93, -0.40], P < 0.00001); improved the stool trait scores (MD = -0.48, 95 % CI [-0.59, -0.37], P < 0.00001); improved the IBS symptom severity scale(IBS-SSS) scores (MD = -44.36, 95 % CI [-53.64, -35.08], P < 0.00001); improved IBS quality of life(IBS-QOL) -positive (MD = 10.27, 95 % CI [3.50, 17.04], P = 0.003 < 0.05) and -negative scores (MD = -7.91, 95 % CI[-15.62, -0.02], P = 0.04 < 0.05); and improved the Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAMA) scores (MD = -3.37, 95 % CI [-6.49, -0.24], P = 0.03); albeit no statistical difference was noted in improving Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD) scores (MD = -2.83, 95 % CI [-5.74, 0.08], P = 0.06 > 0.05).
Conclusion
For treating irritable bowel syndrome, the effectiveness of combining Chinese patent medicine with Western medicine is better than that of using Western medicine alone both in terms of relieving gastrointestinal discomfort and regulating mood. However, as the sample size was limited, it is advisable to conduct large-scale, high-quality, and rigorous randomized controlled trials to enhance the clinical evidence.}

abstract = {Objective
Unfair medicines prices have been discussed widely as an obstacle for patient access. This article aims to structure the discussion about fair pricing of medicines, analyses the elements for a fair price, and assesses its practical implications.
Methods
A systematic literature research has been undertaken and complemented by gray literature. Definitions and elements of a fair price have been extracted from the sample, categorized via a thematic and a quantitative analysis, and mirrored against the traditional framework of ‘iustum pretium’ (fair price).
Results
The most often attributes of a fair price mentioned were affordability (n = 30), followed by value and research and development (R&D) investment (n = 20). Other frequently mentioned attributes are profitability (n = 19), transparency of R&D costs (n = 18), cost-effectiveness (n = 17), and manufacturing (n = 14). Nearly all definitions present fair price as a balance between different objectives.
Conclusions
Most publications stipulate that medicines are a common good and should be affordable. At the same time, most publications also propose a pricing approach based on covering costs for R&D and/or on value. Consequently, most of the attempts to clarify fair price result in a value-affordability dilemma, which does not necessarily warrant patient access. Many social health systems implement pricing regardless of the debate. This systematic review offers a set of attributes for fair price and helps refining the existing pricing and reimbursement regulations. Once complemented by empirical datapoints, it provides the basis for developing a framework for fair pricing.}

The pragmatism levels of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) mean how similar the interventions delivered in the trial setting match those in the setting where the results will be applied. We aimed to investigate the association between the consistency of pragmatism among the characteristics of RCT design and its effect size of results in Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Methods
Eight English and Chinese language databases were searched up to 31 January 2023 for RCTs on CHM for IBS. Six reviewers independently assessed the pragmatism of trials using the pragmatic-explanatory continuum indicator summary 2 (PRECIS-2) tool. The consistency of pragmatism levels among the characteristics of RCT design was calculated using the coefficient of variation. Linear regression models were adopted to explore influence factors of the pragmatism of RCTs.
Results
78 RCTs were included. The level of consistency in the pragmatism for RCT's design was significantly correlated with the effect size of the results (binary outcome, r = -0.413; P = 0.005; continuous outcome, r = -0.779, P < 0.001). PRECIS-2 score was higher in trials with individualized interventions than fixed interventions (3.29 [0.32] vs 2.90 [0.32]; Cohen's d relative effect size, 0.52; P < 0.001) and in standard or usual-treatment-controlled trials than placebo-controlled (3.05 [0.37] vs 2.83 [0.28]; Cohen's d relative effect size, 0.32; P = 0.048).
Conclusion
The consistency of pragmatism level across the 9 domains of the PRECIS-2 tool in CHM IBS RCTs was positively correlated with the effect size of the results.}

The concept of substances of medicine food homology (SMFH) has garnered significant attention in recent years. This study conducts a systematic analysis of patent literature related to SMFH, and elucidates the development trends, technical hotspots, and the overall patent protection landscape of SMFH in China over the past two decades.
Methods
The patent search focused on the SMFH varieties as the objects of inquiry, with retrieval conducted in patent databases. Subsequently, the acquired data underwent processing, analysis, and visualization.
Results
While the technical threshold for pharmaceutical applications surpasses that of the food service sector, the former may assume a prominent role in the future. Research and development (R&D) activities in the southeast of China demonstrate robust activity than other regions. Colleges and scientific research institutions exhibit substantial advantages in patent applications compared with individuals and hold greater potential for future development.
Conclusion
The findings of this patent analysis indicate that China’s SMFH industry are presently undergoing a transition from an extensive model to a high-quality model. The quality and technical standards of SMFH products are consistently improving. Consequently, there is a need for more stringent patent application requirements to align with the evolving development needs.}

Eczema and contact dermatitis are relatively common, non-life-threatening disease, but can reduce the patient's quality-of-life when it becomes chronic. This study describes two cases of bee venom acupuncture (BVA) and herbal medicine (San Wu Huangqin decoction; SWH) co-treatment for hand eczema and contact dermatitis, then confirms the effect of the combination therapy in an in vivo model of eczema.
Case presentation
A 56-year-old female (case 1) and a 33-year-old male (case 2) presented to the clinic with symptoms of itching and erythema (case 1), and scaliness (case 2) on both hands. Both were diagnosed with hand eczema and contact dermatitis based on examination of the erythema and scaliness. They were treated with BVA and SWH for three months. The lesions were healed and had not recurred after 1 and 3 years of follow-up. A mouse study was conducted by repeated application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) to induce eczema-like contact dermatitis in Balb/c mice. In a DNCB-induced eczema-like contact dermatitis model, BVA and SWH co-administration synergistically improved clinical symptoms seen in eczema. Also, they improved histological changes of the skin, suppressed immune cell infiltration, and decreased inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulin E in the serum.
Conclusion
This study suggests BVA and SWH could be an alternative treatment for eczema and contact dermatitis.}

abstract = {Background
Since the early days of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a number of persistent symptoms have been observed in the patients, continuing for weeks or even months after recovery, now named as post-COVID-19 condition, or long-COVID. The commonest symptoms are neurological (cognitive decline, headache, insomnia etc.), cardiovascular afflictions (thromboembolism, hypertension etc.), respiratory problems, and general symptoms like fatigue, malaise etc. In this context, traditional medicine systems are being explored for their holistic and multi-dimensional effects, often not attainable in synthetic drugs.
Purpose
This review is done to explore the potential medicaments (single raw/ natural ingredients only) in Unani system of medicine which may be beneficial in post-COVID-19 condition.
Methodology
We explored four important textbooks of Unani medicine for medications beneficial for conditions similar to COVID-19, in the light of guidelines of post-febrile phase in Unani medicine.
Results
After following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 159 medicaments of herbal, animal and mineral origin were identified. It was observed that 57.23 % herbs (e.g. Pistacia vera L., Pimpinella anisum L.) had efficacy in various respiratory conditions, while 38.36 % herbs (e.g. Crocus sativus L., Borago officinalis L.) were effective in various neurological conditions. Besides, many other medications are described to be effective in various ailments of gastro-intestinal tract, as vital-organ tonics, nutritive, etc. An important observation is that most herbs are effective in more than one condition. Some of the important medicaments include C. sativus, honey, Cichorium intybus L., Aucklandia costus Falc., B. officinalis, Cordia dichotoma G.Forst. etc. Pre-clinical and clinical studies on the drugs corroborate the classical Unani literature.
Conclusion
Several Unani herbs can be potentially utilized in post-COVID-19 conditions due to their multi-dimensional therapeutic and protective actions. Hence, clinical research in this direction may provide a practical solution to overcome the sequelae of COVID-19.}

There is an urgent need to transition the existing “one-size-fits-all” approach in diabetes care into precision medicine to effectively meet the challenge of this widespread disease. With the recent progress in technology and data science, significant advances in our understanding of the biology of the disease have been made, including heterogeneity in clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and genetic etiology. This provided a framework for precision medicine approaches to diagnosis and treatment. For monogenic forms of diabetes with genetic diagnosis and its direct translation to treatment, precision medicine is already applied in clinical practice; whereas for common polygenic forms of the disease (type 1 and type 2 diabetes) despite significant progress in recent years, the vision of precision medicine in action is still far-distant. In this chapter, we review the current state of precision medicine in diabetes, in the context of diagnosis, management, and prevention. We summarize the current state of diabetes classifications, including new attempts to address the heterogeneity of the disease. We also discuss the implications of genetic findings and new diabetes subgroups in precision treatment and prevention. Finally, we summarize the existing challenges and prospects for the further development of precision medicine in diabetes.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The proper application of toxic medicines is one of the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicines, and the use of traditional Chinese medicines follows the principle of dialectical treatment. It is necessary to combine different “syndrome” or “disease” states with the toxicity of traditional Chinese medicines to form a reliable toxicity evaluation system. Fuzi, the lateral root of Aconitum carmichaelii Debx, is recognized as a panacea for kidney yang deficiency syndrome, however, its toxic effects significantly limit its clinical application.
Aim of the study
Herein, our research aimed to explore the toxic effects of Fuzi on syndrome models, and tried to reveal the underlying mechanisms.
Materials and methods
Firstly, the mouse model of kidney yang deficiency syndrome was established through intramuscular injection of 25 mg/kg hydrocortisone per day for 10 consecutive days. Then, the acute toxicity of Fuzi in normal mice and kidney yang deficiency model mice was explored. Finally, the plasma metabolite concentrations and liver CYP3A4 enzyme activity were analyzed to reveal the possible mechanisms of the different pharmacological and toxicological effects of Fuzi in individuals with different physical constitutions.
Results
It was found that the treatment with Fuzi (138 g/kg) had serious toxic effects on kidney yang deficiency mice, leading to the death of 80% of the mice, whereas it showed no lethal toxicity in normal mice. This indicates that Fuzi induced greater toxicity in kidney yang deficiency mice than in normal ones. The liver CYP3A4 enzyme activity in kidney yang deficiency mice was decreased by 20% compared to the controls, resulting in slower metabolism of the toxic diester diterpenoid alkaloids in Fuzi.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study showed that changes of the metabolic enzyme activity in individuals with different syndromes led to different toxic effects of Chinese medicines, emphasizing the crucial importance of considering individual physical syndromes in the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine, and the significance of conducting safety evaluations and dose predictions on animal models with specific syndromes for traditional Chinese medicines.}

The increasing prevalence of diabetic kidney disease has brought huge economic burden to society and seriously jeopardized public health. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, non-apoptosis-regulated form of cell death. The regulation of ferroptosis involves different molecular mechanisms and multiple cellular metabolic pathways. In recent years, ferroptosis has been proved to be closely related to the occurrence and development of diabetic kidney disease, and can interact with pathological changes such as fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism, destroying the structure, form and function of the inherent cells of the kidney, and promoting the progression of the disease. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history of treating diabetic kidney disease with remarkable curative effect. Current scholars have shown that the oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine and the external treatment of Chinese medicine can regulate GPX4, Nrf2, ACSL4, PTGS2, TFR1 and other key signaling molecules, curb ferroptosis, and prevent the progressive deterioration of diabetic kidney disease. In this paper, the mechanism of ferroptosis and diabetic kidney disease and the prevention and treatment of traditional Chinese medicine are analyzed and summarized, in order to provide new ideas and new plans for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease.}

abstract = {Context
The government of Nepal adopted the 2017 Nepalese National Strategy for Palliative Care (NSPC), which proposed that Essential Palliative Care Medicines (EPCMs) listed by the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC) should be available at each healthcare institution. In 2017 after the issuing of NSPC, the Lancet Commission developed an EPCM list.
Objectives
To evaluate the inclusion of EPCMs recommended by both IAHPC and Lancet in national medicinal programmes, their availability, and affordability in Nepal.
Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive study of the availability of EPCMs in Nepal, and their inclusion in the national essential medicines list, government health insurance medicines list, government fixed rate medicines list, and free medicines list. Affordability was assessed using the World Health Organization Daily-Define-Dose and the Nepal Government-defined minimum daily wage.
Results
A total of 27 of 33 (82%) of the IAHPC-EPCMs and 41 of 60 (68%) of the recommended formulations were available in Nepal. All the Lancet Commission recommended EPCMs were available in Nepal. Morphine was available in all formulations used in palliative care. 22%, 18%, and 10% of IAHPC-EPCMs were available cost-free via district hospitals, primary healthcare centers, and health posts, respectively. The government had not included opioids on both free and fixed price lists. A total of 24 of 33 (73%) IAHPC-EPCMs were available on the Government Health Insurance Medicines List. A total of 19 of 41 (46%) available EPCMs were affordable.
Conclusion
Many EPCM formulations included in NSPC of Nepal are not available, and most available EPCMs are unaffordable if purchased out-of-pocket. While the availability is better with the government health insurance scheme, many people are not registered for this. Further improvements should follow the development of a Nepalese palliative care formulary.}

Treating older patients with acute appendicitis with multiple underlying diseases is a challenging situation in the clinical setting. Throughout the history of East Asian medicine, many texts have noted the use of herbal decoctions to successfully treat symptoms associated with appendicitis, thereby providing an alternative management strategy for treating frail patients with acute appendicitis.
Case presentation
This report presents the case of a 93-year-old male diagnosed with acute appendicitis with appendicolith who was unsuitable for surgical intervention due to poor lung condition and prolonged prothrombin time caused by Apixaban. By receiving complementary therapy consisting of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and antibiotics, he recovered successfully.
Discussion
In the early stage of acute appendicitis, infection control and gastrointestinal mobility are the most important factors to consider. Scientific research has demonstrated that many herbs used in TCM formulas possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and immune attenuation effects. For many patients who are unsuitable for surgical intervention due to unfavorable conditions, such as the prolonged prothrombin time presented in this case, complementary treatment with TCM offers adjuvant therapeutical effects associated with infection control, and improvement of the gastrointestinal environment and function of elderly patients.}

In this work, two network-based algorithms were combined to calculate the network relationships between ingredient targets and lung cancer targets in the human interactome. Based on the enrichment analysis of the constructed disease module, key targets of lung cancer were identified. In addition, molecular docking and enrichment analysis of the overlapping targets between lung cancer and ingredients were performed to investigate the potential mechanisms of ingredient candidates against lung cancer. Ten potential ingredients against lung cancer were identified and they may have similar effect on the development of lung cancer.

Neurological diseases are significant challenges to global healthcare systems, demanding innovative and effective therapeutic approaches. Traditional Chinese medicine has emerged as a promising adjunct or alternative in the treatment of various neurological disorders.
Methods
Relevant articles were searched using electronic search platforms such as PubMed, Web of Science Google, Scholar, and Scopus” from August 2023 to October 2023. Research and review articles were searched using the keywords such as “Depression”, “Brain injury”, “Brain-related disorder”, “Neurological disorder”, ”Insomnia” “Ischemic Stroke”, “Alzheimer's Disease”, “Parkinson's disease”, Cerebral Ischemia” paired with “Traditional Chinese Medicine” for the last fifteen years. Critical analysis was performed to identify the appropriate articles after that information was extracted and retrieved.
Results
In recent years, scientific research has been activated to unravel the neuroprotective and therapeutic mechanisms underlying Traditional Chinese Medicine interventions. Herbal plants, such as Huperzia serrata, and Ginkgo biloba demonstrated potential in enhancing cognitive function and mitigating symptoms in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Acupuncture, through its influence on neural pathways and neurochemical signaling, has shown promise in alleviating pain associated with neurological disorders and improving motor function in conditions like Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, Traditional Chinese Medicine shows therapeutic potential in the treatment of various patients suffering from brain-related diseases.
Discussion
Traditional Chinese Medicines play a significant role in the treatment of neurological diseases. An approach to neurological treatment that is more thorough and patient-centered may be accomplished by incorporating the holistic principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine and integrating them with contemporary medical procedures. In the field of neurological diseases, further investigation and cooperation between the Western and traditional medicine communities could bring new therapeutic innovations.}

abstract = {The co-medication strategy of Chinese Materia Medica (CMM) and western medicines under the holistic integrative medicine (HIM) model offers the advantages of increased efficacy and reduced toxicity, particularly in clinical practice for treating complex and challenging diseases. However, due to the mutual fragmentation of basic theories and principles of medication decision-making between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine, research on the mechanisms for the combined use of CMM and western medicines has become a challenging problem in modern clinical medicine research. Traditional drug combination mining models encounter numerous bottlenecks when dealing with this complex decision-making problem with multi-source information characteristics. This paper aims to mine the optimal drug combination strategy from a real-life decision-making scenario of co-medication between CMM and western medicines. It abstracts this realistic problem as a class of complex network optimal overlapping community detection problem, focusing on solving key difficulties such as the inability of existing drug complex network models to handle the multi-source information of drugs and the randomness in the community detection process. We integrate co-medication prescription information with attribute information to construct the speaker-listener label propagation algorithm based on semantic attribute features (SA-SLPA) and develop a new medicine combination identification strategy based on weighted complex networks. Using 6671 clinically real prescriptions, we conclude that the detection quality of the SA-SLPA method proposed in this paper is improved by up to 78% compared to existing methods. This improvement illustrates the scientificity and effectiveness of the model in this paper and provides new ideas for the application of theoretical models and methods of interdisciplinary disciplines such as decision science, data science, and computational science in the field of modern medicine.}

abstract = {Pregnant individuals with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. However, prepregnancy counseling and multidisciplinary care can lead to favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes. In this consult series, we summarize what is known about sickle cell disease and provide guidance for sickle cell disease management during pregnancy. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations:1.We recommend that patients with sickle cell disease be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes maternal-fetal medicine, hematology (ideally a hematologist specializing in sickle cell disease), genetics, pain management, and social work or behavioral health (as appropriate) starting in early pregnancy (best practice).2.We recommend that pregnant patients with sickle cell disease receive all routinely recommended antenatal vaccinations in addition to meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccinations if due (GRADE 1A).3.We recommend prenatal vitamins without iron unless iron deficiency is confirmed and initiation of 4 mg of folic acid for pregnant patients with sickle cell disease (GRADE 1B).4.We recommend fetal growth surveillance every 4 weeks beginning in the 28th week of gestation (GRADE 1C).5.For patients with uncomplicated sickle cell disease and a normally grown fetus, we suggest weekly or twice-weekly antenatal testing beginning at 32 to 34 weeks of gestation. For patients with complicated sickle cell disease (i.e., maternal hypertension, vaso-occlusive crises, fetal growth restriction, or other coexisting complication), we suggest initiating individualized antenatal testing at diagnosis or at a gestational age when delivery would be considered if results are abnormal (GRADE 2B).6.We recommend following evidence-based guidelines for the management of chronic and acute pain during pregnancy (best practice).7.We suggest the use of prophylactic transfusions be individualized for high-risk patients with sickle cell disease in accordance with American Society of Hematology guidelines and directed by a hematologist and maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist in shared decision-making with the patient (GRADE 2B).8.We recommend shared decision-making occur regarding the use of hydroxyurea in pregnancy, in conjunction with a sickle cell disease specialist and maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist, accounting for the timing of use and individual disease severity (GRADE 1C).9.We recommend that reliable contraception be offered to patients with sickle cell disease to decrease the risk of an unintended pregnancy and associated maternal and perinatal risks (GRADE 1B).}

abstract = {Introduction
Emergency Medicine is a relatively new specialty in South Africa. Limited data is available regarding junior doctors’ competence in managing emergencies, however previous surveys have identified limited teaching and supervision of junior doctors in Emergency Medicine. Currently there is no formal standardised assessment tool to assess an intern's Emergency Medicine competence. The aim of the study was to, through expert opinion and consensus, develop an Emergency Medicine assessment tool to identify a level of appropriate Emergency Medicine knowledge at the end of internship.
Methods
The Modified Delphi Methodology was used to create an assessment tool via interaction with a panel of experts and took place over 4 rounds via an online survey platform. The initial round identified the high-priority topics within each intern domain. A questionnaire was created based on these topics and was presented to the panel for consensus during the following round/s. Rounds continued until each question met consensus of 75 %.
Results
A total of 35 panellists consented to participate, representing 6 provinces. The majority were Emergency Medicine specialists. High-priority topics included acute respiratory distress, polytrauma, dehydration and shock in children, airway management, and the agitated patient. A 40-question, multiple choice questionnaire was created with all questions reaching consensus.
Conclusion
This study highlighted the core high-priority Emergency Medicine topics that interns should be exposed to during their internship and created a questionnaire aimed at evaluating them. The study findings provide a novel contribution to identifying gaps in Emergency Medicine knowledge during intern training, allowing for potential interventions to be implemented to improve intern EM training. The addition of a clinical skills component and increasing the question database is suggested to further develop this tool. Larger iterative studies involving the HPCSA, and health education experts provide avenues for future research.}

Non-adherence is associated with side effects of hormonotherapy. Pharmacological strategies to mitigate the side effects include coadministration of antidepressants, however patients remain non-adherent. The aim of this work was to develop medicines containing both hormonotherapy, tamoxifen (20 mg), along with anti-depressants, either venlafaxine (37.5 or 75 mg) or duloxetine (30 or 60 mg), to assess the acceptability and efficacy of this personalised approach for mitigating tamoxifen side effects in a clinical trial. A major criterion for the developed medicines was the production rate, specified at minimum 200 dosage units per hour to produce more than 40,000 units required for the clinical trial. A novel capsule filling approach enabled by the pharmaceutical 3D printer M3DIMAKER 2 was developed for this purpose. Firstly, semi-solid extrusion 3D printing enabled the filling of tamoxifen pharma-ink prepared according to French compounding regulation, followed by filling of commercial venlafaxine or duloxetine pellets enabled by the development of an innovative pellet dispensing printhead. The medicines were successfully developed and produced in the clinical pharmacy department of the cancer hospital Gustave Roussy, located in Paris, France. The developed medicines satisfied quality and production rate requirements and were stable for storage up to one year to cover the duration of the trial. This work demonstrates the feasibility of developing and producing combined tamoxifen medicines in a hospital setting through a pharmaceutical 3D printer to enable a clinical trial with a high medicines production rate requirement.}

abstract = {Background
Complementary use of medicinal plants with prescribed drugs is becoming more widespread concern among people with chronic disease like cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes and hypertension. Consequently, the purpose of this review was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of herbal medicine use among patients suffering from chronic disease.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching articles from Cochrane library, Google scholar, PubMed and African journal online. Data was extracted using Microsoft excel format and imported in to Stata software version 11 (Stata Corp LLC, TX, USA) for analysis. Statistical heterogeneity across the studies was investigated using Cochran's Q chi-square test at the significance level of <0.05 and the I2 index. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of herbal medicine use.
Results
Our systematic search yielded a total of 17,665 records from four databases (Google scholar (12,800), PubMed (3835), Cochrane library (30) and African journal online (12). The pooled estimate of herbal medicine use among patients with chronic disease in Ethiopia is found to be 56.94% (95% CI: 49.75, 64.12, P < 0.001). Being female (POR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.55, 2.75, I2 = 10.0%), rural residence (POR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.42, 5.52, I2 = 89.1%), duration of the disease greater than 5 years (POR = 6.42, 95% CI = 4.188, 9.84, I2 = 48.3%) and having complication (POR = 4.65, 95% CI = 3.75, 5.77, I2 = 0.0%) were factors associated with herbal medicine use among patients living with chronic disease.
Conclusion
The study found a high prevalence of herbal medicine use among patients living with chronic disease. Being female, rural residence, duration of disease greater than 5 years and having complication were factors that are significantly associated with herbal medicine use. The prevalence of herbal medicine use among persons with chronic disease in Ethiopia presents significant implications for healthcare practice. Healthcare professionals need to adopt a patient-centered strategy that promotes open, judgment-free discussions about herbal medicine usage.

abstract = {Background
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has emerged to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the attitudes, knowledge, and barriers of Chinese clinical and nursing students in implementing CAM during this period.
Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate the attitude, knowledge, and barriers of Chinese clinical and nursing students in using CAM in the context of COVID-19.
Methods
An online-based cross-sectional survey was carried out among Chinese medical students, majoring in clinical medicine or nursing, in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, and Zhengzhou, Henan Province from May to July 2022. A total of 402 clinical and 644 nursing students responded to a self-administered questionnaire through the Questionnaire Star and WeChat APPs. SPSS 25 (version 25) was used for data analysis. Proportions were compared by Chi-square test. Level of significance between groups was analyzed using independent student t-test and Mann-Whitney U test.
Results
The average score of attitude was 46.63 (SD: 7.38) in clinical students and 49.84 (SD: 6.76) in nursing students. The top four most commonly used CAM treatments in China were proprietary Chinese medicine, diet therapy, decoction, and acupuncture and moxibustion (59.66 %, 22.28 %, 11.66 %, 9.85 %). The students had a good mastery of knowledge about CAM-based prevention and control of COVID-19 (mean score 7.36). The score of CAM knowledge in nursing students was significantly higher than that in clinical students (7.56 VS 7.04, P = 0.000). Gender, grade, previous use, age, and knowledge score could affect students’ attitude towards CAM. The main barriers in spreading CAM use included time-consumption, bad taste, and fear of treatment-related pain (24.5 %). Compared with clinical students, nursing students were more likely to recommend CAM to patients in the future (P = 0.002).
Conclusions
During the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing students were more positive towards CAM use, had a better mastery of CAM knowledge than clinical students. CAM is expected to provide better outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Future studies should focus on the changes in students’ attitudes over time and exploration of influencing factors on CAM use.}

Operational definitions outline how a conceptual definition will be measured for consistent, reproducible data collection and analysis. This article reports the decision criteria that will be used for an operational definition of integrative medicine (IM) in a secondary analysis of an Australian national survey of general practitioner activity.
Methods
A multidisciplinary team applied an iterative approach, informed by expert knowledge and literature reviews to establish decision criteria for categorizing the terms in the Australian clinical interface terminology of the International Classification of Primary Care, second edition (ICPC-2 PLUS) and the Coding Atlas for Pharmaceutical Substances, according to whether they reflected IM, conventional/mainstream medicine (MM), or both IM and MM (IM/MM).
Results
The final decision criteria categorized all terms for examinations, investigations, advice/counselling, and drugs with synthetic ingredients, and terms for referrals to secondary care services and healthcare practitioners that are not a traditional or complementary medicine practitioner as MM. Terms that could apply to both styles of clinical practice (e.g., preventive health, lifestyle medicine, psychosocial and some drugs with natural ingredients) were categorised as IM/MM. The remaining terms, that mostly reflected the World Health Organization's theoretical definitions of traditional and complementary medicine, were categorized as IM.
Conclusion
Differentiating between integrative and conventional/mainstream medicine in general practice is context specific and not always possible. The category IM/MM proposes integrative medicine as an extension, rather than an alternative. The rationale for the integrative medicine operational definition has relevance for researchers and health services in Australia, and internationally.}

As this dynamic field continues its rapid expansion, there is an urgent need to increase the number of well-trained professionals globally. Consequently, advocating for nuclear medicine as a thriving field of study and work for women becomes paramount in ensuring the establishment of a robust workforce capable of meeting the growing demands. True gender equality will only be achieved when there is equal representation across the spectrum of the nuclear medicine professions, including nuclear medicine technologists, radiopharmacists, radiochemist, medical physicists, nuclear medicine physicians, administrators, academics, and leaders. Currently, the workforce exhibits an imbalance, with females predominating among nuclear medicine technologists, while the number of female physicians, and those in leadership positions remains comparatively lower. There are various factors which contribute to the existing inequities. Societal expectations often impose traditional gender roles that somehow discourage women from pursuing a career in the science, technology, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including nuclear medicine. Additionally, prevailing unequal work conditions and gender biases within the workplace can create barriers that hinder women's professional growth and development. Ways of addressing inequalities includes ensuring female participation at all levels of education and training and promoting the field at undergraduate level in medical school. Mentorship programs have demonstrated great success in guiding and supporting women at various stages of their careers. Therefore, there is a need for their expansion and enhancement. Furthermore, female role models play a pivotal role in shattering gender stereotypes and inspiring other women to pursue careers in nuclear medicine and its related fields. By addressing the existing imbalances and fostering an environment that actively encourages and supports women, we can harness the full potential of all professionals, thus ensuring the ongoing progress and advancement of nuclear medicine.}

This study evaluates the perception of medical doctors on herbal medicines and analyses the factors influencing their use of herbal medicines in therapeutic decisions.
Methods
A quantitative and qualitative research model (concurrent mixed method) was used in this study. Eleven participants attended a focus group discussion (FGD) representing herbal medicine-related stakeholders in Indonesia. Online surveys were conducted by emphasising the problems found in the FGD. Six main topics were selected based on their probability to determine respondents’ levels of agreement or disagreement. The qualitative data were analysed and presented as a descriptive narration, whereas the quantitative data were analysed using principal component analysis.
Results
The most discussed topics about herbal medicines in the FGD were legal aspects, prescription, bad stigma, lack of knowledge, lack of confidence, lack of evidence, and obstacles from the medical committee. We found that two factors comprised the central issue in the quantitative approach: the lack of knowledge on herbal medicines and the scientific evidence of the herbal medicine products.
Conclusions
Shifting the perception of medical doctors on herbal medicines is required. The exposure to herbal medicine research and publications for medical doctors must be intensified.}

This article explores how AI technologies can complement and enhance TCIM, aligning with the shared objectives of researchers from both fields in improving patient outcomes, enhancing care quality, and promoting holistic wellness. This integration of TCIM and AI introduces exciting opportunities but also noteworthy challenges. AI may augment TCIM by assisting in early disease detection, providing personalized treatment plans, predicting health trends, and enhancing patient engagement. Challenges at the intersection of AI and TCIM include data privacy and security, regulatory complexities, maintaining the human touch in patient-provider relationships, and mitigating bias in AI algorithms. Patients' trust, informed consent, and legal accountability are all essential considerations. Future directions in AI-enhanced TCIM include advanced personalized medicine, understanding the efficacy of herbal remedies, and studying patient-provider interactions. Research on bias mitigation, patient acceptance, and trust in AI-driven TCIM healthcare is crucial. In this article, we outlined that the merging of TCIM and AI holds great promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, personalizing treatment plans, preventive care, and patient engagement. Addressing challenges and fostering collaboration between AI experts, TCIM practitioners, and policymakers, however, is vital to harnessing the full potential of this integration.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a typical chronic microvascular complication of diabetes, characterized by proteinuria and a gradual decline in renal function. At present, there are limited clinical interventions aimed at preventing the progression of DN to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, Chinese herbal medicine presents a distinct therapeutic approach that can be effectively combined with conventional Western medicine treatments to safeguard renal function. This combination holds considerable practical implications for the treatment of DN.
Aim of the study
This review covers commonly used Chinese herbal remedies and decoctions applicable to various types of DN, and we summarize the role played by their active ingredients in the treatment of DN and their mechanisms, which includes how they might improve inflammation and metabolic abnormalities to provide new ideas to cope with the development of DN.
Materials and methods
With the keywords "diabetic nephropathy," "Chinese herbal medicine," "clinical effectiveness," and "bioactive components," we conducted an extensive literature search of several databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang database, to discover studies on herbal formulas that were effective in slowing the progression of DN. The names of the plants covered in the review have been checked at MPNS (http://mpns.kew.org).
Results
This review demonstrates the superior total clinical effective rate of combining Chinese herbal medicines with Western medicines over the use of Western medicines alone, as evidenced by summarizing the results of several clinical trials. Furthermore, the review highlights the nephroprotective effects of seven frequently used herbs exerting beneficial effects such as podocyte repair, anti-fibrosis of renal tissues, and regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism through multiple signaling pathways in the treatment of DN.
Conclusions
The potential of herbs in treating DN is evident from their excellent effectiveness and the ability of different herbs to target various symptoms of the condition. However, limitations arise from the deficiencies in interfacing with objective bioindicators, which hinder the integration of herbal therapies into modern medical practice. Further research is warranted to address these limitations and enhance the compatibility of herbal therapies with contemporary medical standards.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
Chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) has always been controversial in its therapeutic strategy. Although invasive treatment and optimal medication therapy (OMT) are the most commonly used treatments, doctors continue to debate the best strategy. However, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for CCS is effective clinically.
Methods
To identify potentially eligible observational and experimental studies, we searched Pubmed, the Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge Internet. To be eligible, studies had to report with end-of treatment outcomes, such as major adverse cardiac events (MACE), deaths from myocardial infarctions (MI), all-cause mortality, angina, cardiac mortality, the effectiveness rate of electrocardiographs, and the reduction rate of the Nitroglycerin tablets. Risk differences (RDs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated based on random-effects models or fixed-effects models. Citation screening, data abstraction, risk assessment, and strength-of-evidence grading were completed by 2 independent reviewers.
Results
In Section 1 (13 studies, involving 17,287 patients), showed no significant difference between invasive treatment and medication treatment in MACE (RD = −0.04, 95% CI = −0.08 to 0.00, I2 = 76.4 %), all-cause mortality (RD = −0.01, 95%CI = −0.022 to 0.01, I2 = 73.44 %), MI (RD = 0.00, 95%CI = −0.00 to 0.01, I2 = 0.00 %) and cardiac mortality (RD = 0.00, 95 %CI = −0.01 to 0.01, I2 = 34.9 %). In Section 2 (21 studies, including 1820 patients), compared with WM treatment, TCM + WM treatment increased ECG effectiveness by 18 %, angina effectiveness by 20 %, and stopping or reducing Nitroglycerin tablets by 20 %. In Section 3 (25 studies, including 2859 patients) showed that TCM revealed a better electrocardiogram effective rate (RD = 0.10, 95 %CI = 0.05 to 0.14, I2 = 44.7 %) and angina effective rate (RD = 0.12, 95 %CI = 0.09 to 0.15, I2 = 44.9 %). We identified that TCM treatment properties of "Circulating blood and transforming stasis" and application of warm/heat-properties medicines were frequently used in CCS treatment.
Conclusions
TCM treatment has shown superior beneficial cardioprotective in CCS therapy strategy, among which "Circulating blood and transforming stasis" and the application of warm/heat-properties medicine are its characteristics.}

abstract = {Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes traditional medicine's diverse practices, including herbal remedies, as a significant component of global healthcare. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), originating over 3,000 years ago, incorporates herbal medicine, acupuncture, and other techniques. The term "carminative" is derived from the Latin word "carminare," meaning to cleanse. Carminatives can reduce lower esophageal pressure, thereby potentially increasing the susceptibility to gastroesophageal reflux disease or heartburn.
Methods
The online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched using different via keywords: Carminatives, Chinese herb, and Herbal. The objective of this review was to provide a concise summary of the herbal ingredients that have been previously documented for their gastro-stimulating properties in carminative products.
Results
Medicinal plants are widely recognized as a crucial and valuable resource for the development of pharmaceutical products. These herbal products possess carminative properties and offer additional health benefits in a wide range of therapeutic uses of carminative like as Anti-microbial, Diuretic, Irritable bowel syndrome, etc.
Discussion
With the increasing global interest in natural medicines, there is a potential for higher demand for TCM as carminatives. Novel formulations with a blend of TCM can be created to improve their effectiveness and convenience. This review can provide chances for more research and increase understanding of TCM for usage as a carminative.
Conclusion
In conclusion traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) incorporates herbal remedies, like those with carminative properties, to address gastrointestinal discomfort and promote overall well-being. TCM's global popularity reflects its effectiveness in integrating herbal medicine, acupuncture, and other techniques. The use of carminatives in TCM aligns with their historical role in relieving digestive issues and promoting balance in bodily humors.}

Information was collated from 38 countries (33 European countries, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and Saudi Arabia) based on a survey conducted with public authorities involved in the Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Information (PPRI) network in 2023. 34 countries requested pharmaceutical companies to notify national registers of upcoming shortages and 20 countries obliged manufacturers and/or wholesalers to stock supply reserves of critically needed medicines. Further common measures included export bans for defined medicines (18 countries), regulatory measures to facilitate import and use of alternative medicines (35 countries) and multi-stakeholder coordination (28 countries). While the legislation of 26 countries allows imposing sanctions, particularly for non-compliance to reporting requirements, fines were rather rarely imposed. Since 2022, at least 18 countries provided financial incentives, usually in the form of price increases of some off-patent medicines. Overall, several policies to address medicine shortages were taken in recent years, in some countries as part of a comprehensive package (e.g., Australia, Germany). Further initiatives to secure medicine supply in a sustainable manner were being prepared or discussed.}

Sjögren's disease is a clinically and pathophysiologically heterogeneous disease to which precision medicine, on the basis of clinical and biological heterogeneity, has been not always applicable. In patients with Sjögren's disease, the relationship between dysregulated biological pathways and symptoms such as fatigue and pain or clinical manifestations is often difficult to establish. This clinical and biological dissociation also poses challenges when defining appropriate clinical endpoints for clinical trials. In the last few years, however, research efforts have been focused on gaining a better understanding of the considerable heterogeneity of Sjögren's disease by developing stratification models aimed at clustering patients with this condition into homogenous subgroups characterised by distinctive molecular signatures, biomarkers, clinical features, and outcomes. In this Review, we discuss current evidence regarding clinical, laboratory, histological, and biomolecular stratification in Sjögren's disease and examine how available stratification data can guide precision medicine and inform the design of future clinical trials.}

abstract = {Objectives
The proportion of women in orthopaedic surgery is low compared to other specialties, despite equal numbers of male and female students entering the medical profession. This gender disparity persists across various aspects of orthopaedic sports medicine, such as academic leadership, medical education, and on the sidelines. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and updated global analysis of female representation in leadership positions within orthopaedic sports medicine and arthroscopy societies throughout the world.
Methods
Publicly available websites for orthopaedic sports medicine societies throughout the world were evaluated. For societies that met inclusion criteria, the following data were collected: types of leadership positions available and breakdown of male and female orthopaedic surgeons in those positions.
Results
There were a total of 55 societies analyzed from North America (5, 9.1%), South America (8, 14.5%), Europe (18, 32.7%), Asia (13, 23.6%), Africa (2, 3.6%), the Middle East (3, 5.5%) and Australia (3, 5.5%), as well as 3 international societies (5.5%). North America had the highest percentage of women in leadership positions with 19 of 97 positions (19.6%), followed by international societies with 11 of 92 (12.0%) positions filled by women. The Middle East and Australia had the fewest number of women, with all-male leadership. Globally, female orthopaedic surgeons served in 11 of 181 (6.1%) board of directors positions, 16 of 192 (8.3%) executive committees positions, 17 of 143 (11.9%) committee chair positions, 2 of 18 (11.1%) officer positions, 1 of 12 (8.3%) council positions, and 2 of 7 (28.6%) spokesperson positions.
Conclusion
While some countries have higher representation than others, the number of women in leadership positions in orthopaedic sports medicine societies throughout the world is significantly less than their male counterparts. While this is a preliminary analysis, future studies should aim to evaluate these trends over time. Providing equitable opportunities for women to rise into high-ranking positions in orthopaedic sports medicine may contribute to the interest of women and other minorities in the field of sports medicine and help improve diversity.

This study provides our comprehensive review, which examines the current state of knowledge in the treatment of asthma. It delves into the mechanisms through which natural products ameliorate asthma symptoms, and it discusses their potential in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our analysis reveals that natural products, traditionally employed for asthma relief, exhibit diverse mechanisms of action. These include anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory, immunomodulatory effects, and reducing gene expression. In the context of modern drug discovery, these natural compounds serve as valuable candidates for the development of novel asthma therapies. The transition from traditional remedies to modern drug discovery represents a promising avenue for asthma treatment. Our review highlights the substantial efficacy of natural products in managing asthma symptoms, underpinned by well-defined mechanisms of action. By bridging the gap between traditional and contemporary approaches, we contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field, emphasizing the potential of natural products in shaping the future of asthma therapy.}

abstract = {Introduction
While traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has proved to be effective in treating atherosclerosis (AS), further analyses of the current research trends and treatment quality are essential. Based on data and visualisation analyses, this study aimed to explore the research hotspots and trends of AS treatment with TCM.
Methods
Relevant literature was searched using the evidence-based strategy system. Visual cluster analysis, association rule analysis, and study quality evaluation were performed using VOSviewer, IBM SPSS Statistics 23, Cochrane Risk Bias Assessment Scale, and Modified Jadad Scale.
Results
A total of 334 eligible papers were included. Over the past decade, the number of annual publications in this field has substantially increased, with a shift towards combining Chinese and Western medicine and using standardised and detailed outcome indicators. The frequently used herbs have warm or cold nature, sweet or bitter flavour, and belong to the liver, lung, or spleen channel. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) - Astragalus mongholicus Bunge (Huangqi) + Conioselinum anthriscoides 'Chuanxiong' (Chuanxiong) was the most commonly used combination, while Carthamus tinctorius L. (Honghua) - Prunus persica (L.) Batsch (Taoren) + Chuanxiong was associated with the highest confidence. The protocols of studies with a high risk of bias lacked standardisation, and the administration protocols of different clinical studies that used the same TCM preparations showed significant diversification. Despite this, the literature quality has shown pronounced growth in recent years.
Conclusions
Clinical research on AS prevention and treatment using TCM preparations is popular and follows TCM pathology theory; however, the overall research quality needs further improvement.}

Feasibility was verified in evaluating the therapeutic effects of transarterial embolization (TAE) performed on rabbit models with VX2 tumor. Radiation dosimetry was carried out to record the radiation exposure from multiple injections of radiopharmaceuticals. In results, the one-day examination of triple NMIs manifested the diversity of the postoperative histological changes, including the local neovascularization induced by embolization, hypoxic state of embolized tissues, and suppression of tumor metabolism. More importantly, radiation dosage from radiopharmaceuticals was limited below 5.70 ± 0.90 mSv. In conclusion, the strong timeliness and complementarity of one-day examination of triple nuclear medicine imaging made it clinically operative and worthy of popularizing. There was flexibility in combining distinct NMIs according to the clinical demands, so as to provide comprehensive information for diagnosis.}

Drawing on empirical data from a case study of intraprofessional collaboration in caring for patients with diabetes - a clinical context in which patients commonly receive care from family physicians (FPs) and specialist physicians (SPs) – Foucault's concept of governmentality and the sociology of the professions are employed to make visible the sociohistorical construction of intraprofessional collaboration within discourses of evidence-based medicine, and its implications for the [re-]negotiation of professional jurisdictions and restratification of the medical profession. This analysis contributes to the intraprofessional literature through two analytical moves. First, it outlines the discursive mechanisms through which the meso-level deployment of the referral-consultation process provides an arena for SPs to maintain and reinforce their position of influence at both the micro-level of daily clinical work and across broader health care delivery. Second, it provides an understanding of how the transmission of governmental rationality in diabetes occurs through the social relations between SPs and FPs, making the restratification of medicine possible without tension or conflict.}

Emergency medicine (EM) is a new specialty in Uganda. There is no current formal EM undergraduate curriculum. The Mbarara University of Science and Technology Emergency Medicine Interest Group (MUST-EMIG) was established to bridge this gap. This survey was done to assess the contributions of MUST-EMIG. Objectives of the study were to: discover students' reasons for joining the MUST-EMIG; assess whether interest in learning emergency medicine was affected by participation in MUST-EMIG; evaluate plans to pursue emergency medicine as a specialty before and after joining MUST-EMIG; determine whether MUST-EMIG affected students’ perception of emergency medicine's importance in Uganda's health care system; and elicit feedback from students on their experience as members of MUST-EMIG.
Methods
The MUST-EMIG executive developed a membership survey which was reviewed by MUST-EMIG's faculty advisor for suitability. Members of MUST-EMIG were voluntarily asked to participate in the online survey. Results of the survey were summarized using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
Results
49 responses (46.7% response rate) were collected and analyzed. Participants included 29 (59.2%) male and 20 (40.8%) female medical students. The majority of participants were fourth year students 22 (44.9%). 44 (89.8%) students joined MUST-EMIG to learn how to handle medical emergencies, and expressed a desire of at least 6/10 to learn more about emergency medicine after utilizing opportunities provided by MUST-EMIG. Overall, students had a good experience with MUST-EMIG. They reported that our interest group had provided them networking, unique learning, and leadership opportunities. Having an EMIG significantly affects students’ desire to pursue a career in emergency medicine and their perception of the relevance of emergency medicine.
Discussion
An EMIG helps develop interest of medical students in emergency medicine. Students passionate about emergency medicine need to be supported to help them preserve and further develop this passion.}

abstract = {Background
The efficacy of medicines depends on their accessibility and availability. Dedicated medicine shortage reporting systems (MSRS) have been set up in different countries, either mandatory or voluntary, following the recommendations of the World Health Organisation to ensure these.
Objectives
To explore how the Medicine Shortages Reporting System (MSRS) can tackle medicine shortages through improved access and sustainability.
Methods
Personnel directly involved in the reporting mechanisms for medicine shortages in eight (8) countries participated in semi-structured interviews. An interview protocol based on the Dynamic Capabilities View and Organisational Information Processing Theory (OIPT) was developed. It contained questions related to participant's views on the process involved in MSRS and how it was used to tackle shortages. Data were thematically analysed.
Results
Three core elements were identified to influence MSRS's ability to tackle shortages and ensure sustainability; (1) the ability to identify what information requirements the reporting system needs, (2) identify information processing capabilities, and (3) the ability to match requirements and information processing capabilities through a dynamic capability decision-making process. The dynamic decision-making process involves reiteratively sensing shortages by understanding and validating information received.
Conclusion
Building MSRS to tackle shortages for accessibility and sustainability is a systemic process that entails understanding the various elements and processes of MSRS. It includes defining medicine shortages, reconfiguring resources, defining accessibility and ensuring the system's sustainability. Our study provides insights into MSRS developed for mitigating medicine shortages and provides a framework for a sustainable MSRS. The findings extend the literature on medicine shortage management by identifying the various elements required to set up an MSRS. It also provides practical implications for countries that seek to establish MSRS to mitigate medicine shortages. Further studies could extend the number of participating countries to provide a clearer picture of the MSRS and how it can reduce medicine shortages.}

To examine whether there has been a change in the number of therapeutically important new medicines not being introduced into the Canadian market in light of the December 2017 announcement of regulatory changes to lower Canadian prices.
Methods
A list was compiled of medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2014-2021 but not submitted to Health Canada. The therapeutic value of these medicines was assessed based on evaluations by two independent sources. If no evaluation was available, potential therapeutic value was determined based on the presence of one or more of three medicine characteristics. Interrupted time series was used to determine if there were changes in overall new medicine introductions and therapeutically important new medicines.
Results
The FDA approved 364 new medicines of which 116 (31.9%) were not submitted to Health Canada. There was a decrease in overall annual number of submissions but that was not related to the announcement at the end of 2017. There was no change in the introduction of therapeutically important new medicines as a percent of all medicines not marketed in Canada but there was a decrease in the absolute number.
Conclusions
The number of therapeutically important medicines not being introduced into Canada is increasing but that is not related to the proposed price reforms.}

Career intentions have the potential to promote medical students' career commitment and encourage them to stay in the medical profession. Moreover, a series of dynamic career intentions during medical education can be served as an early guide to the medical students' future career choices (whether medical students finally choose to practice medicine). However, few studies focus on the dynamics of career intentions among medical students. In this study, we utilized data from a large-scale national survey of medical students conducted in China from 2020 to 2022 to curve the trajectory of the intention to practice medicine among medical students during their undergraduate medical education by using multilevel growth model. Furthermore, we applied latent Markov model to estimate the transition matrix of the intention across each academic year during the undergraduate medical education. Our findings revealed a trajectory curve with a peak during the second year in the intention to practice medicine. In addition, we identified three latent states of career intention including “strong intention”, “wavering” and “weak intention”, and further found two distinct transition patterns between individuals with strong career intentions and those without strong career intentions. The transition patterns play a crucial role in understanding the changes in the trajectory of medical students’ intentions and determining the optimal timing for interventions to prevent medical student attrition. Our study offers a comprehensive understanding for the dynamics of the career intention among medical students, which has practical implications for medical educators and institutions to address the issues of medical student attrition.}

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and its bioactive components have a long history of use in cancer treatments and are also being studied for their potential role in regulating metabolic reprogramming within TME. This review focuses on four core abnormalities altered by lipid reprogramming in cancer cells: de novo synthesis and exogenous uptake of fatty acids (FAs), upregulated fatty acid oxidation (FAO), cholesterol accumulation, which offer benefits for tumor growth and metastasis. The review also discusses how altered lipid metabolism impacts infiltrating immune cell function and phenotype as these interactions between cancer-stromal become more pronounced during tumor progression. Finally, recent literature is highlighted regarding how cancer cells can be metabolically reprogrammed by specific Chinese herbal components with potential therapeutic benefits related to lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.}

abstract = {Background
Self-care during pregnancy is a crucial topic to be discussed due to its effects on both the mother and fetus. In Sri Lanka, specifically regarding self-care with over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, usage among the pregnant population is scarce.
Objective
This study assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) on self-care with OTC medicine usage among pregnant women attending maternity clinics in the Colombo Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas, Sri Lanka.
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 399 pregnant women enrolled through simple random sampling using a self-administered questionnaire. Data were collected on knowledge, attitudes, practices, and sociodemographic characteristics. SPSS version 27 was used for descriptive statistical analysis.
Results
There were satisfactory levels of KAP on self-care with OTC medicines identified among participants. The Mean ± SD for knowledge was 4.38 ± 0.873, and for attitude and practice, 27.56 ± 3.752 and 20.35 ± 4.235, respectively. Significant positive linear correlation between knowledge and attitude (r = 0.375, p < 0.001), attitude and practice (r = 0.518, p < 0.001), and knowledge and practice (r = 0.224, p < 0.001) were observed. It refers to participants with higher levels of knowledge being more likely to exhibit certain attitudes and engage in good practice regarding self-care. However, 93% of the participants had a wrong intention that any medicine could be used at any stage of pregnancy, and 26.3% of the participants didn't know that the medications taken during pregnancy could impact the fetus. Surprisingly, 87% had misperceived that antibiotics can be purchased as OTC medicines. Additionally, the majority of the participants (96%) believed that they could use old prescriptions to purchase medicines during pregnancy.
Conclusion
Greater awareness regarding self-care with OTC medication usage is suggested to be provided during pregnancy.}

abstract = {Objective
To formulate an efficacious radioprotective combination of Chinese medicines with minimal toxicity.
Methods
Aqueous and alcoholic extracts from 38 traditional Chinese herbs were prepared. To produce drug-containing sera, rats received six doses of each extract via oral gavage at 12-h intervals. Subsequently, human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells were cultured in these drug-containing sera. The cell viability was assessed after different doses of irradiation to identify the radioprotective effects of Chinese herbal extracts. The efficacy of a selected Chinese herbal extract combination was further confirmed through cell viability analysis via in vitro colony formation and survival rate assessments in C57BL/6 mice post-irradiation.
Results
Extracts from Angelicae Sinensis Radix (ASR; two extracts), Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP), Platycladi Cacumen (PC), Schisandrae chinensis Fructus (SF), Scutellariae Radix (SR), and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizome (GRR) demonstrated radioprotective effects. The combination of the seven Chinese herbal extracts notably increased the survival and viability of the BEAS-2B cells exposed to varying doses of X-rays. Moreover, the group of mice receiving Chinese medicine combination and irradiation exhibited prolonged survival after exposure to 6.5 ​Gy X-rays with a median survival of （14 ​± ​2）d compared to （11 ​± ​2）d in the irradiated group without the herbal treatment. Additionally, the Chinese medicine combination group displayed a significantly higher 28 ​d survival rate (30%) compared to the irradiation-only group (16.6%, P ​< ​0.05).
Conclusion
The novel combination of Chinese herbal extracts from ASR, CRP, PC, SF, SR, and GRR has the potential for radiation protection applications.}

The COVID-19 pandemic had globally caused a significant burden on governments and the medical community. Drugs notably Remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon were repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. Whereas, alternative system of medicine also gained popularity emphasizing COVID-19 prevention and cure. In India, Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy, jointly referred to as Ayush, are prevalently practiced since time immemorial much before the allopathic system of medicine came into existence.
Methods
All the data in the current study was collected using scientific databases like Pub Med, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE. The information requisite to carry out the current study related to Ayush medicines in the management of COVID 19 were gathered and interpreted. All the articles published between 2020 and 2023 were attempted to be cited, and the review on this subject included over 50 research citations.
Results and discussion
Ayush medicines have been used as prophylactics for viral diseases like chicken pox, mumps, influenza, and dengue. Recent clinical trials reported their benefits as an adjunct therapy, leading to early clinical recovery in COVID-19 patients. Data from the in-silico and in-vitro models along with clinical studies supports the therapeutic application of Ayush medicines to treat COVID-19. This review addresses the Ayush therapies in COVID-19, integrating the complete spectrum of the Indian Traditional System of Medicine against COVID-19. Additionally, the health care professionals, guideline makers, and authorities will all benefit from this up-to-date analysis enumerating the varied approaches of Ayush medicines in the treatment of COVID-19.}

abstract = {Stewardship of antibiotics used in livestock production has come under increasing scrutiny, from both the animal welfare point of view and due to concerns that antibiotic use in livestock may pose a risk to human health through selection pressure to drive development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. Despite this concern, however, antibiotic consumption in the sheep sector is currently poorly described. This study determines the range and quantities of antibiotics used in the Northern Irish (NI) sheep flock as well as exploring drivers for their use. A mixed-methods approach was utilised, with an anonymous online scoping survey, analysis of the medicine records from 52 NI sheep farms and semi-structured interviews undertaken with 27 farmers. Eighteen farmers contributed both records and participated in interviews. Veterinary medicine records were derived from two sources: on-farm medicine books (seven) or veterinary practice sales data (51). As six of these farmers provided information from both sources a total of 52 unique farms participated. Overall, antibiotic use in sheep on the 52 farms sampled was low, with a median value of 11.35 mgPCU−1 (mean 13.63 mgPCU−1, sd 10.7; range 0–45.29 mgPCU−1), with all farms below 50 mgkg−1. Critically important antibiotics accounted for 0.21% of all antibiotics purchased. Lameness was the main driver of antibiotic use identified by this study. Others included a range of prophylactic treatments such as oral antibiotics to prevent watery mouth, injectable antibiotics to prevent abortion and following assisted lambing. Farmers acknowledged some of these uses had become habitual over time. The veterinary medicine sales records demonstrated significant sales of antibiotics not authorised for use in sheep, on an ongoing, rather than case-by-case, basis. Farmers were positive about their veterinarian’s ability and knowledge to improve flock welfare and productivity, but were unwilling to pay for this advice. However, veterinarians may have facilitated weak medicine stewardship through a failure to adequately challenge farmers seeking antibiotics. Farmers did not maintain accurate or up-to-date on farm medicine or production records in the majority of cases. Despite this lack of on-farm recording, veterinary sales records can be studied in consultation with farmers to provide veterinarians with a farm-specific insight into antibiotic use and related attitudes and behaviours. Farmers and veterinarians can then identify areas and behaviours to target collaboratively, improving antibiotic and wider medicine stewardship, whilst simultaneously improving flock health and productivity.}

After admission into hospital, Computed tomography showed high-density shadows in the gastrointestinal tract. Video-Electroencephalography showed no signs of seizure. Reflux esophagitis was observed in gastroscopy. And no obvious abnormalities in the colonic mucosa through colonoscopy. Bone marrow smear test showed basophilic stippling in the erythrocytes. The blood and urine lead levels of 626 and 75.9 μg/L, respectively. We therefore considered lead poisoning, and the patient improved after chelation therapy. Due to its atypical clinical manifestations, lead poisoning is easily misdiagnosed. Thus, clinicians should pay more attention to this disease. When abdominal pain, anemia, and neurological symptoms are present, the possibility of lead poisoning should be considered.}

The beneficial healing outcome with the use of ECM biomaterials is the result of their biocompatibility, their biophysical properties and their ability to modify cell behavior after injury. As a consequence of successful clinical outcomes, there has been motivation for the development of next-generation formulations of ECM materials ranging from hydrogels, bioinks, powders, to whole organ or tissue scaffolds. The continued development of novel ECM formulations as well as active research interest in these materials ensures a wealth of possibilities for future clinical translation and innovation in regenerative medicine.

abstract = {Background
Medicine-sharing behavior can be divided into two groups: borrowing medicine from someone else and lending medicine to someone else without consulting a doctor or a pharmacist. There are many reasons for the behavior that leads individuals to share their prescription medicines. However, there is a lack in the literature to investigate individuals' medicine-sharing behavior and related antecedents and outcomes of this behavior.
Objective(s)
The main objective of this study is to model individuals’ prescription medicine borrowing (PMB) behavior via the structural equation model based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).
Methods
A measurement tool was developed according to TPB. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine subfactors of PBM behavior. In the second step, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to confirm whether there is a relationship between the observed variables and their underlying latent constructs. Finally, a structural equation model was conducted to specify the relationships between latent variables. IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Software) version 22 and LISREL 8.80 were used for data analysis.
Results
Study findings reveal that the participants' attitudes and intentions towards PMB are low, and the rate of exhibiting this behavior is also low. In the proposed prescription medicine borrowing behavior model, the positive effect of attitude towards PMB, perceived behavioral control related PMB, and subjective norm about PMB on intention towards PMB were found statistically significant. Intention towards PMB has been found to have a positive statistically significant effect on PMB behavior.
Conclusions
Based on the results of this study, it is possible to say that TPB is an appropriate theory for modeling PMB. Thus, this model will shed light on healthcare providers and policy-makers to avoid individuals from the adverse effects of PMB behavior.}

abstract = {Introduction
Case reports have a long history in Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), and even into the modern day, case reports are still a preferred format for traditional East Asian medicine (TEAM) practitioners. However, the tradition of case reports in teaching and research is not nearly as common in the English-speaking world as in China, possibly due to the lack of a specific case report guideline. This study aimed to co-design a CHM guideline (CHM-CARE) to assist practitioners in compiling structured and comprehensive case reports.
Methods
A two-phased mixed approach was used to develop the case report guideline. In phase one, focus groups of TEAM practitioners were used to determine what components of existing guidelines (e.g., Case Report (CARE) and Case Report in Chinese Medicine (CARC)) were relevant to include, along with any additions or changes. Content analysis of phase 1 provided the checklist items for a two-round Delphi process (Phase 2). All checklist items from the first Delphi round with a median of three or higher were included in the second round, with consensus set at >70 % for inclusion in the final guideline.
Results
A total of 18 CHM practitioners from four countries joined five separate focus group discussions. Focus group discussions led to 98 checklist items being used in the first round of the Delphi process. Fifteen international experts on case reports participated in two rounds of Delphi. A total of 69 checklist items moved forward into the second round where 61 items (88 %) reached consensus and formed the final CHM-CARE guideline.
Conclusion
Key elements of a herbal medicine case report checklist were identified, and a 61-item case report guideline (CHM-CARE) was produced, providing clear guidelines for case reports to TEAM practitioners operating in private practice.}

abstract = {Objective
To review studies on digital medicine in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), discuss its development process, knowledge structure and research hotspots, and provide a perspective for researchers in this field.
Methods
The relevant literature in recent 20 years (January 2004 to October 2022) were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). CiteSpace was used to demonstrate our knowledge of keywords, co-references and speculative frontiers. VOSviewer was used to chart the contributions of authors, institutions and countries and incorporates their link strength into the table.
Results
A total of 5265 English articles in set timespan were included. The number of publications increased steadily annually. The United States (US) produced the highest number of publications, followed by England. Most publications were from Harvard Medicine School, followed by Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham Women's Hospital. The most authoritative academic journal was JMIR mHealth and uHealth. Noseworthy PA may have the highest influence in this intersected field with the highest number of citations and total link strength. The utilization of wearable mobile devices in the context of CVD, encompassing the identification of risk factors, diagnosis and prevention of diseases, as well as early intervention and remote management of diseases, has been widely acknowledged as a knowledge base and an area of current interest. To investigate the impact of various digital medicine interventions on chronic care and assess their clinical effectiveness, examine the potential of machine learning (ML) in delivering clinical care for atrial fibrillation (AF) and identifying early disease risk factors, as well as explore the development of disease prediction models using neural networks (NNs), ML and unsupervised learning in CVD prognosis, may emerge as future trends and areas of focus.
Conclusion
Recently, there has been a significant surge of interest in the investigation of digital medicine in CVD. This initial bibliometric study offers a comprehensive analysis of the research landscape pertaining to digital medicine in CVD, thereby furnishing related scholars with a dependable reference to facilitate further progress in this domain.}

abstract = {Objectives
Clinical study reports (CSRs) are highly detailed documents that play a pivotal role in medicine approval processes. Though not historically publicly available, in recent years, major entities including the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Health Canada, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have highlighted the importance of CSR accessibility. The primary objective herein was to determine the proportion of CSRs that support medicine approvals available for public download as well as the proportion eligible for independent researcher request via the study sponsor.
Study Design and Setting
This cross-sectional study examined the accessibility of CSRs from industry-sponsored clinical trials whose results were reported in the FDA-authorized drug labels of the top 30 highest-revenue medicines of 2021. We determined (1) whether the CSRs were available for download from a public repository, and (2) whether the CSRs were eligible for request by independent researchers based on trial sponsors’ data sharing policies.
Results
There were 316 industry-sponsored clinical trials with results presented in the FDA-authorized drug labels of the 30 sampled medicines. Of these trials, CSRs were available for public download from 70 (22%), with 37 available at EMA and 40 at Health Canada repositories. While pharmaceutical company platforms offered no direct downloads of CSRs, sponsors confirmed that CSRs from 183 (58%) of the 316 clinical trials were eligible for independent researcher request via the submission of a research proposal. Overall, 218 (69%) of the sampled clinical trials had CSRs available for public download and/or were eligible for request from the trial sponsor.
Conclusion
CSRs were available from 69% of the clinical trials supporting regulatory approval of the 30 medicines sampled. However, only 22% of the CSRs were directly downloadable from regulatory agencies, the remaining required a formal application process to request access to the CSR from the study sponsor.}

abstract = {Objective
The high incidence of Tension-type headache (TTH) has led to significant social and economic challenges. Given the widespread use of Chinese patent medicines (CPM) for TTH patients, this study aim to evaluate the efficacy of different CPMs in treating TTH by network meta-analysis.
Methods
Eight databases were conducted to identify CPMs-related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from database inception date to August 2023. The primary outcome was clinical efficiency rate. The secondary outcomes were numerical rating scale (NRS), frequency of headache, duration of headache, hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), hamilton depression Scale (HAMD) and adverse reactions. ROB 2.0 were used for quality evaluation. Stata 15.1 and R 3.5.3 software were used for Bayesian network meta-analysis.
Results
A total of forty-one RCTs were included, involving 3,996 patients and 8 CPMs. The network meta-analysis revealed that Shugan Jieyu capsule plus western medicine (WM) was the best choice of CPM for improving clinical efficiency rate [vs. WM: relative risk (RR)= 7.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.65, 56.71)]. Yangxue Qingnao granule plus WM was superior to other therapeutic combinations in reducing duration of headache [vs. WM: MD = 1.05, 95%CI(0.74, 1.40)]. Jieyu pill plus WM might have best effect in reducing HAMD [vs. WM: MD = 7.15, 95%CI(-3.77, 18.14)], HAMA scores [vs. WM: MD = -7.41, 95%CI(-13.39, -1.42)], and NRS scores [vs. WM: mean difference (MD) = 2.01, 95%CI(1.47, 2.55)]. In terms of the frequency of headache, although Yangxue Qingnao granule plus WM and Toutong-ning capsule plus WM performed best, the optimal CPMs in reducing the frequency of headache remain to be further explored. Furthermore, due to the limited safety evidence available, reliable safety conclusions could not be drawn.
Conclusion
CPM can effectively improve headache symptoms, clinical efficiency, and quality of life in patients with TTH. However, research with high quality and large sample sizes is needed for further investigation due to the limitations of this study.}

Many studies on the distribution of aqueous antibiotics have been reported. However, the pollution status of antibiotics in the environment in Chinese herbal medicine planting areas is rarely comprehensively clarified, resulting in the lack of updated pollution data and conducive suggestions for ecological cultivation and sustainable development of Chinese herbal medicine. Thus, we comprehensively investigated the distribution, profiles, sources, and risks of the antibiotics in the surface water of an important tributary of the Huaihe River Basin, located in Bozhou City, a significant Chinese herbal medicine planting region. Solid-phase extraction coupled with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (SPE-UPLC-MS) was utilized to detect the antibiotics in the water. 27 kinds of antibiotics were identified with total concentrations ranging from 75.01 to 1737.99 ng·L−1, with doxycycline (DC) and doxycycline hydrochloride (DCH) possessed the highest concentration. And DC, DCH, oxilinic acid (OA), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), clarithromycin (CLA), and roxithromycinum (ROX) were the main antibiotics detected in this basin. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that animal husbandry was the primary source of antibiotics. Furthermore, the ecological risk assessment revealed that certain antibiotics could seriously threaten the survival of aquatic organisms, implying that local Chinese herbal medicines might be at similar growth risk. The drinking risk assessment showed that antibiotics in the water posed low risks for human, and children faced a greater drinking risk than adults. The study can help to facilitate the management of aqueous antibiotic pollution for the ecological cultivation and safe production of Chinese herbal medicine.}

Allergic rhinitis (AR) causes symptoms such as hyper-rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, itching, and pain by triggering inflammation in the nasal mucosa and an immune response caused by antigen-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE). This prospective multicenter observational study aimed to evaluate the symptoms change and safety of combined Korean medicine (KM) therapy in patients with AR.
Methods
This study was conducted in HAMSOA Korean Medicine Clinics, a network specializing in treating pediatric patients in Korea, and 15 centers participated. The patients were divided into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe) according to their baseline total nasal symptom score. The patients were treated with herbal medicine, acupuncture, cupping therapy, and moxibustion therapy.
Results
The study involved 72 subjects aged 6.47 ± 2.37 years. The average Numeric Rating Scale for allergic rhinitis symptoms at the baseline and final follow-up were 4.39 ± 2.14 to 3.47 ± 2.51, respectively, indicating a significant improvement over an average of 4 weeks. The Pediatric Allergic Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire scores at the final screening improved in all three groups. The mean difference was -10.44, with a 95 % confidence interval of -15.35 to -5.54 (p < 0.01.). Furthermore, no adverse events were reported in any patient in this study.
Conclusion
The results provide preliminary evidence suggesting that KM treatment may be a safe and effective option for reducing symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis in children. Additional prospective studies are required to confirm the results of the present study.}

keywords = {Suicide, Medicines, Overdose, Patient safety, Mortality, Prevention},
abstract = {Background
In England and Wales coroners have a duty to write a report, called a Prevention of Future Deaths report or PFD, when they believe that actions should be taken to prevent future deaths. Coroners send PFDs to individuals and organisations who are required to respond within 56 days. Despite the increase in mental health concerns and growing use of medicines, deaths reported by coroners that have involved medicine-related suicides had not yet been explored. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically assess coroners’ PFD reports involving suicides in which a medicine caused or contributed to the death to identify lessons for suicide prevention.
Methods
Using the Preventable Deaths Tracker database (https://preventabledeathstracker.net/), 3037 coroners' PFD reports in England and Wales were screened for eligibility between July 2013 and December 2019. Reports were included if they involved suicide or intentional self-harm and prescribed or over-the-counter medication; illicit drugs were excluded. Following data extraction, descriptive statistics, document and content analysis were performed to assess coroners’ concerns and the recipients of reports.
Results
There were 734 suicide-related coroner reports, with 100 (14%) reporting a medicine. Opioids (40%) were the most common class involved, followed by antidepressants (30%). There was wide geographical variation in the writing of reports; coroners in Manchester wrote the most (18%). Coroners expressed 237 concerns; the most common were procedural inadequacies (14%, n = 32), inadequate documentation and communication (10%, n = 22), and inappropriate prescription access (9%, n = 21). 203 recipients received the PFDs, with most sent to NHS trusts (31%), clinical commissioning groups (10%), and general practices (10%), of which only 58% responded to the coroner.
Conclusions
One in four coroner reports in England and Wales involved suicides, with one in seven suicide-related deaths involving a medicine. Concerns raised by coroners highlighted gaps in care that require action from the Government, health services, and prescribers to aid suicide prevention. Coroner reports should be routinely used and monitored to inform public health policy, disseminated nationally, and responses to coroners should be transparently enforced so that actions are taken to prevent future suicides.}

The phenomenon that has been described as Financial Medicine has been occurring within the South African Healthcare sector for at least the last decade. Despite the ongoing effect of this phenomenon, there is no organised body of knowledge or formulated working definitions to guide knowledge sharing and theorisation within this research focus area. The practice of Financial Medicine exerts a deleterious effect on the South African prehospital healthcare system, and represents an area in dire need of focused research efforts. Establishing appropriate working definitions and associated taxonomy is an important first step in supporting further research efforts into this aspect of South African prehospital healthcare systems.
Methods
A qualitative research methodology following a constructivist grounded theory design was used. Participants voluntarily consented to be enrolled into one-on-one in-depth interviews, and were selected using purposive and theoretical sampling techniques. Data was subjected to validated coding procedures and analysed using the constant comparative analysis approach, analytical diagramming, and supported by researcher theoretical sensitivity.
Results
A working definition for Financial Medicine is provided. Six new terms are introduced, with associated working definitions, namely Financial Medicine Practices, Treatment-based profiteering, Cost-of-care-aversion, Personal-gain-at-patient-expense, Money-racketeering-in-healthcare, and Impoverishing-healthcare-earning.
Conclusion
The working definitions and suggested taxonomy presented in this article are the first step in formally conceptualising and theorising the phenomenon of Financial Medicine, in order to support further research and collaboration in this space.}

Many people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) use herbal medicines, some of which can improve glycaemic control. Providing evidence-based advice on herbal medicines could be an effective intervention to improve control of diabetes, if it is designed to address key needs and concerns of T2DM patients.
Aim
To understand the views and experiences of patients and health professionals on herbal treatments for self-management of T2DM.
Method
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SOCIOFILE and Google Scholar were searched for qualitative studies in T2DM patients about their views on herbal medicines. Included papers were analysed using thematic synthesis.
Results
Thirty-one papers (about 30 studies) were included: 20 from low-and-middle income countries, 10 from high income countries, and 1 internet-based study. Almost all studies from high income countries focussed on ethnic minorities. Many people with T2DM wanted a “cure”, and often took advice from friends and family, but also traditional healers and mass media. However, they were reluctant to discuss herbal medicines with health professionals, whom they perceived as “closed-minded”. They based their treatment decisions on personal experience (from “trial-and-error”), availability, cost and convenience of both herbal and conventional medicines. Most health professionals were reluctant to discuss herbal medicines, or recommended against their use, because of lack of knowledge and concerns about their quality, efficacy and potential interactions.
Conclusion
Evidence-based information could help to overcome the current lack of communication about herbal medicines between people with T2DM and health professionals.}

LC separation was carried out on a Kinetex C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 2.6 µm) with gradient elution. The mobile phase consisted of mixtures of acetonitrile-water-10 mM phosphate buffer pH 3.5 at ratios of 3:92:5, v/v/v for mobile phase A and 50:45:5, v/v/v for mobile phase B with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The screening method was intended for confirmation of the identity of the actives and validated for specificity and robustness, whereas the quantification method (using only a different detection wavelength) was further validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, sensitivity and precision (repeatability, intermediate precision). For all compounds, the method was found to be linear (r2 > 0.999), precise (%RSD < 1%), accurate (% recovery of 98–102%), sensitive, specific and robust.

Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT) is a common refractory autoimmune disease of the endocrine system that may eventually lead to complete loss of thyroid function, with subsequent severe effects on the metabolism. Because of the deficiency in current clinical management of AIT, the need for alternative therapies is highlighted. With its multi-component and multi-target characteristics, Chinese medicine has good potential as an alternative therapy for AIT.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study was to systematically summarize the clinical efficacy and safety evaluation of TCM and its active ingredients in the treatment and regulation of AIT. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the relevant mechanisms and molecular targets to understand the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine on AIT and explore new ideas for clinical treatment.
Materials and methods
The literature related to "Hashimoto", "autoimmune thyroiditis", "traditional Chinese medicine," and "Chinese herbal medicine" was systematically summarized and reviewed from Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, CNKI, and other databases. Domestic and international literature were analyzed, compared, and reviewed.
Results
An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that herbal medicines can intervene in immunomodulation, with pharmacological effects such as antibody lowering, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic thyroid follicular cells, regulation of intestinal flora, and regulation of estrogen and progesterone levels. The signaling pathways and molecular targets of the immunomodulatory effects of Chinese herbal medicine for AIT may include Fas/FasL, Caspase, BCL-2, and TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB et al.
Conclusions
The use of Chinese herbs in the treatment and management of AIT is clinically experienced, satisfactory, and safe. Future studies may evaluate the influence of herbal medicines on the occurrence and development of AIT by modulating the interaction between immune factors and conventional signaling pathways.}

abstract = {Objectives
Access to innovative and effective medication is a citizen’s right. The main objectives of this study were to build an indicator to measure access to medicines within hospitals, the Global Medicines Access Index, and to identify the main existing barriers.
Methods
Cross-sectional study carried out in Portuguese National Health Service hospitals. A consensus methodology (expert panel of 7 members) was used to define which dimensions should be included in the index and the weighting that each should take. The panel identified 6 dimensions: access to innovative medicines, proximity distribution, shortages, access to medicines before financing decision, value-based healthcare, and access to medication depending on cost/funding. Data were collected through an electronic questionnaire (September 2021).
Results
The response rate was 61.2%. Most hospitals used medicines with and without marketing authorization before the funding decision. Monitoring and generating evidence of new therapies results is still insufficient. The identified barriers were the administrative burden as the major barrier in purchasing medicines, with a relevant impact on shortages of medicines. Most respondents (87%) had a proximity distribution program, mainly implemented in the pandemic context, and the price/funding model was only identified by 10% as a barrier to access. The 2021 Global Medicines Access Index was 66%. Shortages and value-based use of medicines were the dimensions that had more influence in lowering the index value.
Conclusions
The new formula used to obtain a unique and multidimensional index for access to hospital medicines seems to be more sensitive and objective and will be used to monitor access.}

abstract = {Objective
The traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM), Simo decoction (Simo decoction oral solution), with its primary ingredient Arecae semen (Binglang, Areca catechu L.), known for its potential carcinogenic effects, is the subject of this study. The research aims to analyze the effectiveness and potential risks of Simo decoction, particularly as a carcinogen, and to suggest a framework for evaluating the risks and benefits of other herbal medicines.
Methods
The study is based on post-marketing research of Simo decoction and Arecae semen. It utilized a wide range of sources, including ancient and modern literature, focusing on the efficacy and safety of Simo decoction. The research includes retrospective data on the sources, varieties, and toxicological studies of Arecae semen from databases such as Pubmed, Clinical Trials, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WHO-UMC Vigibase, and China National Center for ADR Monitoring.
Results
Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with Simo decoction include skin rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, no studies exist reporting the severe ADRs, such as carcinogenic effects. Arecae semen is distributed across approximately 60 varieties in tropical Asia and Australia. According to the WHO-UMC Vigibase and the National Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring System databases, there are currently no reports of toxicity related to Arecae semen in the International System for Classification of ADRs (ISCR) or clinical studies.
Conclusion
Risk-benefit analysis in TCPM presents more challenges compared to conventional drugs. The development of a practical pharmacovigilance system and risk-benefit analysis framework is crucial for marketing authorization holders, researchers, and regulatory bodies. This approach is vital for scientific supervision and ensuring the safety and efficacy of drug applications, thus protecting public health.}

The purpose of this study was to establish minimum reporting sets (MRS) on the quality of herbal medicines used in non-clinical laboratory studies to secure the reliability and reproducibility, provididng basis for follow-up clinical studies and increasing scalability for industrialisation, in the long run.
Methods
The types of herbal medicines used in laboratory studies are classified into crude drugs, herbal extracts, and herbal medicine formulations. A modified Delphi survey was conducted on multi-disciplinary experts of traditional medicine in Korea. In the first round, a written survey was conducted to select candidates for MRS. In the second round, an expert meeting was held to discuss the items for MRS. The final agreement was reached in the third round to propose the determined MRS for non-clinical laboratory studies using herbal medicine.
Results
The agreed MRS included component observation, identification, and origin (scientific names and their origins) for crude drugs and quantitative test results on key marker compounds for herbal extracts and herbal medicine formulations, respectively. It was also agreed that herbal Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice standard test results of herbal medicine samples can replace MRS.
Conclusion
This study proposed a MRS items for herbal medicine samples used in non-clinical laboratory studies. Further studies on standards of quality for herbal medicine samples would be required in the future.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to determine the magnitude of concurrent use of herbal medicines with ART, its associated factors and effect on viral load suppression and CD4 count among people living with HIV.
Study design
This was a cross-sectional study involving 375 HIV positive patients on ART attending at care and treatment clinic (CTC).
Methods
Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews using pre-structured questionnaires and patient's files through a checklist. Adherence was assessed though pill count method while CD4 count and viral load suppression were assessed using the Tanzania National guidelines for the management of HIV and AIDS. Data were analysed using STATA version 15. Independent predictors for herbal medicine use or viral suppression were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
Results
Out of 375 PLHIV, 132 (35%) reported to use herbal medicines concurrently with ART. Predictors for herbal medicines use were existence of chronic disease (OR = 4.53; CI = 1.87–10.95) (p = 0.001), male gender (OR = 0.57; CI = 0.35–0.93) (p = 0.02) and HIV clinical stage (OR = 1.71; CI = 0.99–2.94) (p = 005). PLHIV who used herbal medicines along with ART did not have a significantly higher chance of achieving viral suppression than PLHIV who did not use herbal medicines (OR = 1.42; CI = 0.71–2.82). There was no statistically significant difference on CD4 count (p = 0.8943) and viral load (p = 0.8612) between herbal medicines users and non-users.
Conclusion
The utilization of herbal medicine among PLHIV on ART remains notably prevalent. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that despite the prevailing herbal medicine usage, there is no substantial effect on viral suppression. The primary determinants of the adoption of herbal medicines use were having chronic medical conditions and the stage of progression of the HIV infection.}
