Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Zingiberis Rhizoma was widely used in the treatment of inflammatory disease. The discovery of new multi-target compounds for new drug from the TCM was a possible direction. Aim of the study: Multi-target compounds screening based on polypharmacology was an effective method. As an interdisciplinary field, polypharmacology screen multi-target compounds by various methods. So, a flexible screening framework to avoid the disadvantage of single methods is considered to have great significance.
Materials and methods
The research propose a common framework called Traditional Chinese medicine target-effect relationship spectrum (TCM-TERS). TCM-TERS was constructed based on the pharmacophore and molecular docking models, which provided predicted activity by compounds screening. TCM-TERS merge the results of different models and visualize the targeted activity of each compounds. Then the TCM-TERS were analyzed by the analytic hierarchy process and active components were chosen by the contributing factors. The activity of components was verified on the RAW264.7 by RT-PCR.
Results
This article constructed TCM-TERS of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Zingiberis Rhizoma with the COX-2, mPGES-1, 5-LOX and SPLA2-IIA. Seven compounds were chosen with multiple targeted activity based on the TCM-TERS, which showed remarkable activity in RT-PCR.
Conclusion
The TCM-TERS was an efficient interdisciplinary method for drug discovery of the TCM, which provide a flexible method to the researcher that can screen specific compounds with multiple screening methods.}

abstract = {The emerging high-throughput technologies have led to the shift in the design of translational medicine projects towards collecting multi-omics patient samples and, consequently, their integrated analysis. However, the complexity of integrating these datasets has triggered new questions regarding the appropriateness of the available computational methods. Currently, there is no clear consensus on the best combination of omics to include and the data integration methodologies required for their analysis. This article aims to guide the design of multi-omics studies in the field of translational medicine regarding the types of omics and the integration method to choose. We review articles that perform the integration of multiple omics measurements from patient samples. We identify five objectives in translational medicine applications: (i) detect disease-associated molecular patterns, (ii) subtype identification, (iii) diagnosis/prognosis, (iv) drug response prediction, and (v) understand regulatory processes. We describe common trends in the selection of omic types combined for different objectives and diseases. To guide the choice of data integration tools, we group them into the scientific objectives they aim to address. We describe the main computational methods adopted to achieve these objectives and present examples of tools. We compare tools based on how they deal with the computational challenges of data integration and comment on how they perform against predefined objective-specific evaluation criteria. Finally, we discuss examples of tools for downstream analysis and further extraction of novel insights from multi-omics datasets.}

This study aimed to assess medical students’ acute stress responses and performance during a virtual reality (VR) high-stress scenario of a simulated mass casualty incident compared to a VR low-stress scenario. It is hypothesized that a highly stressful VR scenario leads to increase stress responses, as measured by subjective anxiety and modification of blood pressure, heart activity, respiratory rate and body temperature, and decreases the performance in managing the simulated mass casualty event and performing mass casualty triage.

abstract = {Background
A guideline panel convened by the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs, American Dental Association Science and Research Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, and Center for Integrative Global Oral Health at the University of Pennsylvania conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses and formulated evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacologic management of acute dental pain after 1 or more simple and surgical tooth extractions and the temporary management of toothache (that is, when definitive dental treatment not immediately available) associated with pulp and furcation or periapical diseases in children (< 12 years).
Types of Studies Reviewed
The authors conducted a systematic review to determine the effect of analgesics and corticosteroids in managing acute dental pain. They used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence to Decision framework to formulate recommendations.
Results
The panel formulated 7 recommendations and 5 good practice statements across conditions. There is a small beneficial net balance favoring the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone or in combination with acetaminophen compared with not providing analgesic therapy. There is no available evidence regarding the effect of corticosteroids on acute pain after surgical tooth extractions in children.
Conclusions and Practical Implications
Nonopioid medications, specifically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen alone or in combination with acetaminophen, are recommended for managing acute dental pain after 1 or more tooth extractions (that is, simple and surgical) and the temporary management of toothache in children (conditional recommendation, very low certainty). According to the US Food and Drug Administration, the use of codeine and tramadol in children for managing acute pain is contraindicated.}

The treatments may be tailored to the individual by using genetic markers or other biological markers, environmental information, behavioral information, demographic information, or any other information that might change the way the patient responds to the treatment. Using these factors, physicians can determine a type of treatment, duration of treatment, what dose to give, what kind of followup is needed, or who is most likely to have certain side effects. With this information in hand, the appropriate monitoring system can be assigned to each patient. Some research organizations are preferring the term “Precision Medicine” in place of “Personalized Medicine” as we go into the 2020s. However, the author’s perspective is that “precision medicine” is synonymous with “personalized medicine” and that over time, as our knowledge increases, we will indeed be developing treatments catered to the individual as our precision increases. These terms will be used interchangeably throughout this book. While the author’s preference is to use “precision medicine,” “personalized medicine” has significant historical context that has defined the field.}

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting motorneurons of the bulbar, cervical, thoracic, or lumbar segments. Bulbar presentation is a devastating characteristic that impairs patients’ ability to communicate and is linked to shorter survival. Early acoustic manifestation of voice symptoms, such as dysarthria, is very variable, making its detection and classification challenging, both by human specialists and automatic systems. In this context, precision medicine, defined as “prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account”, has gained a great interest in the ALS community. Specifically, the use of innovative Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Machine Learning, plays a pivotal role in finding specific patterns in the data set to help neurologists in clinical decision-making. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to find new markers, and new patterns, to promptly detect the possible presence of dysarthria and to correctly classify its severity. We have performed an acoustic analysis on different voice signals of various degrees of impairment acquired during outpatient visits at the ALS center of the “Federico II” University Hospital. From the collected signals, a new database containing different acoustic parameters was realized, on which several experiments were performed. The study led us to the discovery of markers that helped to develop a decision tree that separated healthy subjects from patients and, among patients, those with different severity of dysarthria. This model achieved good results in terms of dysarthria classification accuracy, 86.6%, which is excellent considering the small number of subjects in the data set.}

The treatment of this disease has been done by different scenario such as long-term drug therapy, organ transplantation, and using special medical equipment and devices. However, all of these scenarios have their own drawbacks, for example, drug therapy is able to control or stop the progress of disease in short term, while, organ transplantation is limited by resource of organ providing. Hence, the regenerative medicine (RM) is introduced to overcome many if not all of these limitations. The main goal of RM is to develop biological substitutes and novel treatment in order to regenerate, preserve, or improve damaged tissue, in addition to restore the function that is lost because of disease, aging, and damage or defects. RM is an interdisciplinary branch of medicine including biomaterial science (act as scaffolds for cell functionality), stem cells (provide biological functionality), and bioactive agents (provide signals and guide the stem cells fate). The gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have shown to be safe and biocompatible materials to better support the stem cells as scaffolds, and act as nano patterned surfaces, in addition to carry the growth factors and drug delivery systems in RM. In this chapter, we focus on the applications of AuNP applications in RM. Furthermore, we will discuss important physicochemical features of nanocomposites fabricated in mix with AuNPs, and how these characteristics of AuNPs could enhanced the RM products.}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a high social and economic burden owing to its high morbidity and mortality. Conventional medical management strategies have several limitations including adverse effects. Therefore, strategies involving integrated traditional East Asian medicine (ITEAM) are currently being introduced and many clinical studies on ITEAM are being conducted. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no in-depth study on patients’ experiences and perceptions of ITEAM for treating COPD. We present a protocol for a qualitative study to investigate the experiences of patients with COPD.
Methods
The study sample will include patients with COPD aged between 40 and 80 years, who have been treated with ITEAM. We will recruit 10 to 30 patients using purposive and snowball sampling. Using a semi-structured interview guide prepared in advance, in-depth, face-to-face interviews will be conducted. The collected data will be recorded and transcribed. The interview data will be subjected to qualitative content analysis to generate categories for the coding process.
Results
The findings will be disseminated through publication as an article in this journal, presentations at academic conferences, and development of clinical practice guidelines.
Conclusion
An in-depth understanding of the experiences of patients with COPD who receive ITEAM treatment can help providers improve ITEAM treatment services. Additionally, the results of this study can be used as fundamental data in future large-scale clinical studies. Our results can also be used to inform health policies for integrated management of patients with COPD.}

abstract = {Background: Visit cancellations have detrimental effects on patient health and reduce clinic productivity. We sought to understand the factors that influence cancellation rates across the major subspecialties in pediatric orthopaedics and sports medicine (OSM). Methods: In-person OSM visits from a high-volume multi-site academic pediatric hospital (01/01/2019-02/28/2020) were used to study the effect of patient demographics, distance to clinic, insurance type, visit type (new vs. follow-up) on visit cancellation (canceled by patient and no-shows). When available, chief complaint was used to categorize visits into major subspecialties: cerebral palsy, foot and ankle, hip, knee, other lower extremity, spine, and upper extremity. Logistic regression was used to identify contributors to the visit cancellations in a multivariate model. Results: 424,397 visits (15.9% canceled) were included in the analysis. Based on the multivariate analysis, being non-white (OR=1.139), Hispanic (OR=1.133), older age (OR=1.007), female (OR=1.046), living farther from clinic (OR=1.002), and having public insurance (OR=1.163) were associated with higher cancellations, whereas median household income (OR=0.994, per $10,000) and new visit (OR=0.969) were associated with lower cancellations (P<0.04). 241,305 visits were categorized into subspecialties. The effects of studied patient-related factors and visit types on cancellations were highly variable across subspecialties. When significant, having public insurance and living farther from the clinic were consistently associated with higher rates of cancellations, while being a non-English speaker and having a new visit were associated with lower rates of cancellation. The remaining factors showed variable effects. Conclusion: Disparities exist in patient-related visit cancellations in pediatric and young-adult OSM with different patterns across major OSM subspecialties. These findings highlight the importance of looking at these specific orthopedic conditions separately to develop more effective strategies to improve patient compliance and efficiently utilize healthcare resources. Level of Evidence: Level III Key Concepts•Across all pediatric and young-adult OSM visits, being non-white, Hispanic, female, living farther from clinic, and having public insurance were associated with higher odds of cancellation.•While disparities exist in patient-related visit OSM care, the factors that influence cancellation in specific subspecialties are varied and complex.•Further research that looks at specific orthopedic conditions separately will improve efficiency and effectiveness of care and increasing patient compliance.}

abstract = {Cholangiocarcinoma is a deadly cancer comprising very heterogenous subtypes with a limited therapeutic arsenal in all comers. However, recent significant advances were made with immunotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced cholangiocarcinoma, with the addition of durvalumab to cisplatin–gemcitabine chemotherapy showing a survival benefit. In the second line setting, only FOLFOX (5FU/folinic acid-oxaliplatin) is validated by a phase 3 trial, yet with a very modest benefit on survival; new options using 5FU with nanoliposomal-irinotecan may emerge in the next few years. The advent of molecular profiling in advanced cholangiocarcinoma in the last decade revealed frequent targetable alterations such as IDH1 mutations, FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, HER2 amplification, BRAF V600E mutation and others. This strategy opened the way to personalised medicine for patients which are still fit after first-line treatment and the use of targeted inhibitors in first line constitutes a huge challenge with many ongoing trials to improve patients’ care. This review exposes the recent clinical trial findings in non-molecularly selected advanced cholangiocarcinoma, offers a focus on how systematic molecular screening should be structured to allow patients to access to personalised medicine, and details which are the therapeutic options accessible in case of actionable alteration.}

The goal of this review was to critically assess EBM for debated concepts in US AIT practice for respiratory allergies in the context and quality of today’s regulatory standards. Debated topics reviewed were the efficacy and safety of AIT in various subgroups (eg, polyallergic patients, older patients, patients with asthma, and pregnant women), diagnosis topics (eg, skin prick test vs allergen-specific serum IgE, factors affecting skin prick tests, use of nasal or conjunctival allergen challenges, and telemedicine for diagnosis), and dosing topics (eg, optimal dosing for subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy tablets, US liquid allergen extract history, duration of treatment, and biomarkers of efficacy). In addition, EBM for patient-centered AIT issues (eg, adherence, use of practice guidelines, and pharmacoeconomics) and the approach to implementation of AIT EBM in future clinical practice were addressed. The EBM for each concept was briefly summarized, and when possible, a practical, concise recommendation was given.}

Methods
In total, 18 patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), who underwent orbital balance decompression surgery at the Affiliated Eye Hospital of Nanchang University between September 2018 and August 2022, were included. Orbital CT scanning was performed on all patients with TAO, and Mimics 21.0 software was used to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of the orbit based on the CT data. The osteotomy guide plate for lateral orbital decompression surgery was designed using 3-matic 13.0 software, adhering to the criteria of surgical effectiveness and safety. The surgical positioning guide was designed using Geomagic Wrap 21.0. Once printed, the surgical guide was sterilized with low-temperature plasma and applied during surgery. Of the nine patients treated using a surgical navigation system, three cases experienced cerebrospinal fluid leakage complications during the procedure, and two exhibited inadequate bone removal along the lateral wall. In contrast, among the nine patients treated with surgical guides, no intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage or evidence of insufficient lateral wall bone removal was observed, highlighting a statistically significant distinction between the two cohorts (p = 0.046). Postoperative improvements were notable in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and exophthalmos for patients afflicted with extremely severe TAO. The surgical guide, designed with digital medical technology, has been shown to be an effective and secure auxiliary tool in lateral orbital decompression surgery. It not only aids in reducing the incidence of intraoperative complications, but also enhances the accuracy and safety of surgery. These improvements offer robust support for continued exploration in this field within clinical practice.}

abstract = {Introduction
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.
Objective
This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning UGIB for the emergency clinician.
Discussion
UGIB most frequently presents with hematemesis. There are numerous causes, with the most common peptic ulcer disease, though variceal bleeding in particular can be severe. Nasogastric tube lavage for diagnosis is not recommended based on the current evidence. A hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is recommended (8 g/dL in those with myocardial ischemia), but patients with severe bleeding and hemodynamic instability require emergent transfusion regardless of their level. Medications that may be used in UGIB include proton pump inhibitors, prokinetic agents, and vasoactive medications. Antibiotics are recommended for those with cirrhosis and suspected variceal bleeding. Endoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic modality of choice and should be performed within 24 h of presentation in non-variceal bleeding after resuscitation, though patients with variceal bleeding may require endoscopy within 12 h. Transcatheter arterial embolization or surgical intervention may be necessary. Intubation should be avoided if possible. If intubation is necessary, several considerations are required, including resuscitation prior to induction, utilizing preoxygenation and appropriate suction, and administering a prokinetic agent. There are a variety of tools available for risk stratification, including the Glasgow Blatchford Score.
Conclusions
An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with UGIB.}

Individualized cancer therapy can be achieved for most cancer patients by identifying people at risk for severe toxicity and those that are likely to benefit from a particular treatment. However, extensive research is required to acquire a complete grasp of polymorphism and pharmacogenetics markers. There are genetically inherited variants in pharmacokinetic profile (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of enzymes or proteins including dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1), in modeling inherited adverse outcomes, as well as therapeutic signaling molecule (ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC of ATP-binding cassette transporters) and target enzymes in predicting drug efficacy with respect to both cytotoxic agents and targeted agents. This chapter mainly focused on how the drug transporter and drug-metabolizing enzymes genetic variance and other contributing factors influences the pharmacokinetic profile of the anticancer medicines.}

What are the views and experiences of patient and expert stakeholders on the positive and negative impacts of commercial influences on the provision of assisted reproductive technology (ART) services, and what are their suggestions for governance reforms?
Design
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 ART industry experts from across Australia and New Zealand and 25 patients undergoing ART from metropolitan and regional Australia, between September 2020 and September 2021. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
Results
Expert and patient participants considered that commercial forces influence the provision of ART in a number of positive ways – increasing sustainability, ensuring consistency in standards and providing patients with greater choice. Participants also considered commercial forces to have a number of negative impacts, including increased costs to government and patients; the excessive use of interventions that lack sufficient evidence to be considered part of standard care; inadequately informed consent (particularly with regard to financial information); and threats to patient–provider relationships and patient-centred care. Participants varied in whether they believed that professional self-regulation is sufficient. While recognizing the benefits of commercial investment in healthcare, many considered that regulatory reforms, as well as organizational cultural initiatives, are needed as means to ensure the primacy of patient well-being.
Conclusions
The views expressed in this study should be systematically and critically examined to derive insights into how best to govern ART. These insights may also inform the design and delivery of other types of healthcare that are provided in the private sector.}

To examine the impact of an integrative medicine (IM) course on self-perceived IM-related communication and research skills.
Methods
A 3-day mandatory "hybrid" (online and in-person) IM course was held within COVID-19 restrictions for 161 pre-clerkship medical students, with workshops facilitated by mentor healthcare professionals (IM and non-IM) and student-directed tasks. Self-perceived levels of 6 IM-related skills were scored (from 1 to 5) for history-taking; communicating with patients with "alternative" health-beliefs; referral to IM consultations; assessing risks/benefits; and working with non-medical IM practitioners.
Results
137 students (85.1%) completed pre-/post-course questionnaires, with overall scores improving from pre-course (1.98 ± 0.92) to post-course (3.31 ± 0.63; p < 0.0001), for the entire group and student subgroups (with vs. without prior IM experience). Multivariate analysis found no association between age, gender, primary language or prior experience with IM and improvement in skill scores.
Conclusions
The IM course increased self-perceived skill levels, reflecting the course curriculum and workshops. Further research needs to explore the application of these skills during clinical training.
Practice implications
Teaching medical students about IM in a course comprising communication and research skills was shown to be feasible and effective. The application of IM-related skills needs to be evaluated during the clinical clerkship.}

Oral mucositis (OM) is a common side effect of radiotherapy (RT) that can have severe implications in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula is widely applied in treating OM, but little substantial evidence exists to clarify it effects. The study intends to determine whether the TCM-based prescription in treating HNC with RT can improve the OM when compared with RT alone.
Methods
A single-center, randomized, two-arm parallel-group, open-label controlled clinical trial will be conducted to determine whether the Zi-Yin-Liang-Ge-San (ZYLGS), which contains Rx. Scutellariae, Rx. Glycyrrhizae, Hb. Dendrobii, Rx. Ophiopogonis, and Hb. Menthae Haplocalycis, combined with RT can improve the incidence and severity of OM. Two hundred participants will randomly 1:1 to receive at least 6 weeks of RT plus ZYLGS powder or control. The primary outcome measures are onset, gradation of OM (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0), and oral pain (visual analogue scale). The secondary outcome measures include nutritional status, the EORTC Quality of Life Core Questionnaire and head and neck module. The Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, serious adverse events, and blood and biochemical analysis will be recorded to evaluate the safety. Visits will be performed for each week during the RT treatment period and then 2 weeks in the follow-up period.
Discussion
The study's result will provide a high-level evidence for TCM-based formulation for HNC patients with RT on the effect of OM prevention and management.}

Vertically aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods and rGO were electrodeposited on the GCE electrode surface, according to structural investigations performed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). According to electrochemical experiments, ZnO NRs and rGO increase the electron transfer rate and support catalytic activity, making it easier to detect and quantify PF in the electrochemical sensor. The results exhibited that the linear range and sensitivity of ZnO-rGO/GCE were, respectively, 0.1–1305 μg/mL and 0.03792 μA/μg.mL−1. The PF sensor also achieved a low detection limit of 3.4 ng/mL. It was investigated to see how well a PF sensor worked to analyze a sample of human serum. Relative standard deviations (RSD) for sample detections for the proposed PF sensor were all below 4.13 %, according to analytical analyses utilizing the conventional addition approach, with recoveries ranging from 96.00 % to 99.25 %. These findings affirm that the proposed PF sensor exhibits a high degree of accuracy, rendering it well-suited for clinical applications and the analysis of human bodily fluids.}

Little research has been done on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19. This study was done to determine if maoto, a traditional herbal medicine commonly used for diseases with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19, can be repurposed for post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent the spread of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
A cohort analysis was done of the data of 55 health care workers (HCWs) whether to get infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a Japanese hospital experiencing a COVID-19 cluster in April of 2021. Of these subjects, maoto granules for medical use were prescribed for PEP to 42 HCWs and taken for three days in mid-April. Controls were 13 HCWs who rejected the use of maoto. Polymerase chain reaction was performed routinely once or twice a week or when a participant presented with symptoms of COVID-19.
Result
There were no background differences between the maoto and control groups by profession, sex, or mean age. No severe adverse reactions were observed. During the observation period of 1 week, significantly fewer subjects were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the maoto group (N = 3, 7.1%) than in the control group (N = 6, 46.2%). The prophylactic effectiveness of maoto was 84.5%.

There is evidence that the use of pharmacotherapy alongside behavioural treatments can improve quality of life and reduce disease risk for patients with these disorders. However, there are few approved drug therapies for obesity, and these are limited by poor efficacy and/or side effects and only one drug has been approved for the treatment of BED. There is considerable potential to use experimental medicine models to identify new drug treatments for obesity and BED, with greater efficacy and an improved side effect profile, at an early stage of development. Here, we present a model developed in our laboratory that incorporates both behavioural and neuroimaging measures which can be used to facilitate drug development for obesity and BED. The results from validation studies conducted to date using our model suggest that it is sensitive to the effects of agents with behavioural, neurophysiological and neuropharmacological mechanisms of action known to be associated with weight loss and reductions in binge eating. Future studies using the model will be valuable to evaluate the potential efficacy and side-effects of new candidate drugs at an early stage in the development pipeline for both obesity and BED.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The property theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a unique medical theory based on an extensive clinical practice for thousands of years, which guides TCM doctors choosing proper medicines to treat specific diseases. The nature and flavor of TCM are a high generalization of drug's characteristics according to the property theory. Despite intensive investigations, the modern interpretation of TCM property theory still confronts several challenges, which greatly hampers the elucidation of TCM's mechanisms as well as its application. Compelling evidence has proved that gut microbiota may be a potential indicator for TCM's efficacy and mechanism. Nevertheless, at present, the relationship between the gut microbiota and the nature and flavor of TCM has not been fully elucidated.
Aim of the study
To fill the gap in this field, we developed a comprehensive study to investigate the relationship between gut microbial community and TCM's property.
Materials and methods
We searched “PubMed” and “China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)” with the key word “gut microbiota”, and screened the published articles related to TCM. In this review, we mainly applied cold-natured and sweet-flavored TCMs as an example to explore the modulation of cold-natured and sweet-flavored TCMs on gut microbiota, and identify the potential relationship between the alterations of gut microbiota and TCM's efficacy.
Results
We found cold-natured and sweet-flavored TCMs possess several pharmacological activities and generally enrich beneficial bacteria like Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which is in good accordance with their pharmacological effects. Simultaneously, these TCMs reduce the relative abundance of some harmful bacteria belonging to Firmicutes (Streptpcoccus, Enterococcus, Turicibacter, Anaerostipes and Oscillibacter) and Proteobacteria (Helicobacter, Enterobacter, Sutterella, Klebsiella, Desulfovibrio, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter jejuni). These results indicate that there are some intrinsic correlations between gut microbiota and the property of TCM, and gut microbiota may serve as a potential indicator to reflect the property of TCM.
Conclusions
This pilot but comprehensive review provides an interesting proposal that the ancient theory of TCM property may be interpreted by the modern biological findings in gut microbiome.}

The Chinese government values the older adults' sense of gain from healthcare services. The aim of this study was to construct a Sense of Gain Scale for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) healthcare services for older adults in the community, and evaluate its reliability and validity.
Methods
Based on a literature review and expert consultation, this study developed a Sense of Gain Scale for TCM healthcare services for older adults in the community. A total of 460 participants were recruited to perform reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and Spearman correlation analysis, while another 673 participants were used for confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the validity of the scale.
Results
The Sense of Gain Scale was composed of 14 items that could be classified into the following five dimensions: satisfaction, effectiveness, accessibility, fairness, and responsiveness. The overall Cronbach's α coefficient of the scale was 0.961, with each dimension ranging from 0.861 to 0.928. The split-half reliability of the total scale was 0.971, indicating good reliability. Five common factors were extracted to explain 85.49% of the total variation. exploratory factor analysis showed that the scale had good construct validity. Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) was used to evaluate criterion validity, and the correlation coefficient between test score and criterion was > 0.6.
Conclusions
The Sense of Gain Scale has good reliability and validity, and can be used as a measurement tool to evaluate the level of sense of gain for TCM healthcare services for older adults in the community.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chronic renal failure (CRF) patients use many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices to manage their symptoms. This research was conducted descriptively to determine the relationship between the attitudes of peritoneal dialysis patients toward holistic CAM and their health literacy (HL) levels.
Methods
The study was conducted with 91 peritoneal dialysis patients who were treated in the adult peritoneal dialysis unit of a university, who met the study inclusion criteria and who agreed to participate. Data were collected using a survey form, the Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (HCAMQ) and the Health Literacy Scale (HLS). Ethics committee approval, institutional permission and informed consent of the participants were obtained.
Results
It was observed that 72.5% of peritoneal dialysis patients used CAM, and the mean HCAMQ score was 24.03 ± 7.94. Moreover, 76.9% of the patients implementing CAM used herbal methods, with 92.3% prefering CAM to strengthen immunity. In addition, 63.6% patients did not inform healthcare personnel about their CAM use. In the present study, the mean HLS score of peritoneal dialysis patients was 102.88 ± 21.06, and a statistically significant and negative correlation was observed between the mean HCAMQ and HLS scores (r = -0.240; p < 0.05). Patients who reported their use of CAM to their healthcare personnel had higher HLS scores than those who did not. Perceived health status had a significant effect on both HCAMQ and HLS.
Conclusion
The majority of peritoneal dialysis patients included in the study used CAM, and their attitudes toward CAM use were positive. Most of the patients did not report the use of CAM to healthcare personnel. The HL levels of the patients were high. A positive attitude toward HCAMQ increased as the HLS level increased.}

The aim of this study was to examine the potential application of a targeted proteomic predictive biomarker comprised predominantly of inflammatory proteins in distinguishing those who responded to a previously conducted clinical trial for Parkinson's disease (PD).
Methods
Plasma samples obtained from a biorepository were assayed from a total of n = 520 DATATOP (Deprenyl And Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy Of Parkinsonism) clinical trial participants across treatment arms. Support vector machine analyses were conducted to distinguish responder status on primary (need for Levodopa) and secondary trial endpoints (UPDRS Motor and Total Scores).
Results
For the α-tocopherol and deprenyl placebo treatment arm (TOC), the targeted proteomic biomarker was able to distinguish responder status with an accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) of 91% for the primary endpoint while it was 100% across secondary endpoints. For the deprenyl and α-tocopherol placebo treatment arm (DEP), the AUC was 93% for the primary endpoint and 99–100% for the secondary endpoints. For the combined treatment arm, AUC was 87% for the primary and 94–96% for the secondary endpoints.
Discussion
The targeted proteomic predictive biomarker was highly accurate in distinguishing responder status across treatment arms thereby supporting the application of a precision medicine approach to treating PD.}

Ayurveda is a form of traditional medicine known as the “Mother of healing,” which is the science of using poly-herbal, i.e., multiple herbs, for treatments. Currently, several mass spectrometry-based approaches are available for deciphering the signaling pathways of ayurvedic medications. These include proteomics, posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, metabolomics, targeted proteomics, and metabolomics. These techniques, along with genomics and transcriptomics, are referred to as multiomics approaches. Because of the scientific insights of ethnopharmacological research, the use of ayurvedic and traditional Indian medicine has recently gained popularity. However, with the growing popularity of traditional medicine, a quality control check concentrating on appropriate preparation and the mechanism of action of these formulations is required. These techniques can aid in understanding metabolite composition, molecular targets, and mechanism of action of ayurvedic preparations, which is necessary for their widespread use. This chapter discusses the methods commonly employed in ayurvedic research, including proteomics, PTMs research, and metabolomics.}

abstract = {Purpose
The temporal trends in prescribing anti-seizure medicines (ASMs) for pregnant women with epilepsy are unclear. In this study, we investigated the trends in ASM prescriptions in pregnant Japanese women with epilepsy.
Methods
Administrative data (as of December 2021), pertaining to Japanese pregnant outpatient women with epilepsy, aged 16–49 years, who visited hospitals between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020 were included in the study. Annual prescription trends in ASMs during this period were calculated based on the proportions. The Cochran–Armitage trend test was used to evaluate the proportion of prescriptions for each ASM.
Results
The numbers of pregnant women with epilepsy were 404, 421, 368, 378, 386 for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. As of 2020, levetiracetam had the highest proportion of prescriptions, followed by lamotrigine and valproic acid. From 2016 to 2020, the proportions of levetiracetam and lamotrigine prescribed for pregnant women with epilepsy have increased significantly from 19.1% to 30.8% and from 12.1% to 18.4%, respectively. In contrast, there was no temporal change in the proportion of valproic acid prescribed, which was 12.4% in 2016 and 10.1% in 2020.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that the trends in the prescription of ASMs in Japanese pregnant women outpatients with epilepsy have shifted toward ASMs with a lower teratogenic risk.}

abstract = {Group conflict decision-making is a crucial research direction in group decision making. Most of the existing group conflict decision theories provide models under the condition of static and complete information, but it is urgent to improve the dynamic conflict group decision-making theory with incomplete information to deal with practical management problems. This paper presents a group optimal alternative selection model with dynamic conflict characteristics under incomplete information. Firstly, a directed graph is used to describe the dynamic decision process with incomplete information, and the directed graph is transformed into a generalized conflict information system with incomplete information. Secondly, a group dynamic conflict decision-making model based on the conflict information system is built. Thirdly, dynamic decision rules for decision makers on alternatives under decision attributes are designed, then the largest coalition and the path dependence measurement of decision makers are calculated. Subsequently, taking the optimization decision-making processes of clinical treatment alternatives of integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine as the research problem, the proposed model is applied to verify the applicability and effectiveness by using the electronic medical record (EMR) of 2481 samples. Finally, the solution of the set of clinical optimal treatment alternatives and the path dependence of decision makers on the set of optimal treatment alternatives are presented. The conclusion shows that the distribution of missing information is generally consistent with the practice of clinical decision-making. In addition, the path dependence of decision makers on the optimal alternative is much higher than that on the worst alternative, the conflicts among decision makers are consistent, and decision makers gradually approach the optimal alternative through repeated comparison and verification.}

In addition to traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and smoking, patients with chronic kidney disease have a uremic phenotype marked by premature aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, persistent low-grade inflammation, gut dysbiosis and oxidative stress. These complications contribute to abnormal vascular and myocardial remodeling processes, resulting in accelerated vascular calcification, cellular and organ senescence and a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Nonpharmacological strategies, such as increasing physical activity and a healthy diet, may slow the progression of kidney disease and consequently protect the heart. Thus, a deep promotion and advocacy of nutritional guidance based on scientific data is needed.

When exacerbated, inflammatory processes can culminate in physical and emotional disorders and, if not stopped, can be lethal. The high prevalence of inflammation has become a public health problem, and the need for new drugs to treat this pathology is imminent. The use of medicinal plants has emerged as an alternative, and a survey of data that corroborates its application in inflammatory diseases is the starting point. Furthermore, Brazil harbors a megadiversity, and the traditional use of plants is relevant and needs to be preserved and carefully explored for the discovery of new medicines.
Aim of the study
This review sought to survey the medicinal plants traditionally used in Brazil for the treatment of inflammatory processes and to perform, in an integrative way, a data survey of these species and analysis of their phytochemical, pharmacological, and molecular approaches.
Materials and methods
Brazilian plants that are traditionally used for inflammation (ophthalmia, throat inflammation, orchitis, urinary tract inflammation, ear inflammation, and inflammation in general) are listed in the DATAPLAMT database. This database contains information on approximately 3400 native plants used by Brazilians, which were registered in specific documents produced until 1950. These inflammatory disorders were searched in scientific databases (PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, Scielo, Virtual Health Library), with standardization of DECS/MESH descriptors for inflammation in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese, without chronological limitations. For the inclusion criteria, all articles had to be of the evaluated plant species, without association of synthesized substances, and full articles free available in any of the four languages searched. Duplicated articles and those that were not freely available were excluded.
Results
A total of 126 species were identified, culminating in 6181 articles in the search. After evaluation of the inclusion criteria, 172 articles representing 40 different species and 38 families were included in the study. Comparison of reproducibility in intra-species results became difficult because of the large number of extraction solvents tested and the wide diversity of evaluation models used. Although the number of in vitro and in vivo evaluations was high, only one clinical study was found (Abrus precatorius). In the phytochemical analyses, more than 225 compounds, mostly phenolic compounds, were identified.
Conclusion
This review allowed the grouping of preclinical and clinical studies of several Brazilian species traditionally used for the treatment of many types of inflammation, corroborating new searches for their pharmacological properties as a way to aid public health. Furthermore, the large number of plants that have not yet been studied has encouraged new research to revive traditional knowledge.}

The purpose of this study is to explore the facilitators to integrating complementary therapies in conventional pediatric hospital practice based on the experiences of parents, healthcare providers, and complementary therapy providers.
Design
This study is part of a larger research study that examined the introduction of a pediatric integrative medicine service in an acute care children's hospital in Canada. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using semi-structured one-on-one telephone and in-person interviews with a sample of parents of children, as well as healthcare providers and complementary therapy providers.
Results
A total of 50 individuals, from key-stakeholder groups, were interviewed between May 2014 and January 2016. This study identified the following facilitators for the integration of complementary therapies within conventional care: 1) stakeholders’ open-mindedness and familiarity with care practices outside of their experiences; 2) stakeholders’ open communication, respect for eachothers’ roles in the process of care, and appreciation for the role of complementary therapies within conventional medicine; and 3) stakeholders’ receptiveness to redefining the meaning of a ‘positive outcome’ in the context of hospital care.
Conclusion
The findings of this study demonstrate that some of the existing barriers to the integration of complementary therapies in conventional hospital care could be mediated by creating an environment where the fundamental value of commitment to patient wellbeing is equally shared by all stakeholders.}

abstract = {The opioid epidemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Health systems, policymakers, payers, and public health have enacted numerous strategies to reduce the harms of opioids, including opioid use disorder (OUD). Much of this implementation has occurred before the development of OUD‒related comparative effectiveness evidence, which would enable an understanding of the benefits and harms of different approaches. This article from the American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) uses a prevention framework to identify the current approaches and make recommendations for addressing the opioid epidemic, encompassing strategies across a primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention approach. Key primordial prevention strategies include addressing social determinants of health and reducing adverse childhood events. Key primary prevention strategies include supporting the implementation of evidence-based prescribing guidelines, expanding school-based prevention programs, and improving access to behavioral health supports. Key secondary prevention strategies include expanding access to evidence-based medications for opioid use disorder, especially for high-risk populations, including pregnant women, hospitalized patients, and people transitioning out of carceral settings. Key tertiary prevention strategies include the expansion of harm reduction services, including expanding naloxone availability and syringe exchange programs. The ACPM Opioid Workgroup also identifies opportunities for de-implementation, in which historical and current practices may be ineffective or causing harm. De-implementation strategies include reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing; avoiding mandatory one-size-fits-all policies; eliminating barriers to medications for OUD, debunking the myth of detoxification as a primary solo treatment for opioid use disorder; and destigmatizing care practices and policies to better treat people with OUD.}

abstract = {Background
Preeclampsia is associated with increased risks of life-threatening, -altering, and -ending complications. Assessment of risk for preeclampsia at 35 to 36 weeks’ gestation by the Fetal Medicine Foundation 36-week competing-risk model identifies approximately 75% of women who will develop term preeclampsia, at a 10% screen-positive rate.
Objective
This study aimed to assess whether the Fetal Medicine Foundation 36-week model can provide personalized guidance to women about the probable timing of their delivery, whether or not they develop pregnancy hypertension.
Study Design
In this prospective nonintervention screening study at 2 maternity hospitals in England, women who did not have preeclampsia (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists definition) and were attending a routine hospital visit at 35 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks’ gestation underwent assessment of risk for preeclampsia, including maternal demographic characteristics, medical history, mean arterial pressure, and serum placental growth factor and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1. Fetal Medicine Foundation 36-week model risk categories for subsequent preeclampsia were defined as: A, ≥0.500; B, 0.20 to 0.499; C, 0.05 to 0.199; D, 0.020 to 0.049; and E, <0.020. Obstetrical records were examined for all women to identify their gestational age at delivery, and whether they experienced a spontaneous onset of labor (irrespective of mode of delivery) or had a medically indicated birth (either induction of labor or unlabored cesarean delivery). The cumulative incidence of delivery and risk ratios, for all deliveries and for spontaneous deliveries, was assessed.
Results
Among 29,035 women with singleton pregnancies, 1.0%, 2.9%, 3.3%, 5.0%, 9.9%, and 77.9% were in A, B, C, D, and E risk strata, respectively. In the A (vs E) stratum, 71.95% (vs 33.52%) of births were medically indicated. Compared with women in stratum E, women in higher risk strata were more likely to deliver, and to deliver following spontaneous labor, before their due date. For example, of the women in stratum A (vs E), 14.2% (vs 1.1%; risk ratio, 12.5 [95% confidence interval, 9.45–15.35]), 48.5% (vs 5.1%; risk ratio, 8.47 [7.48–9.35]), 69.6% (vs 15.5%; risk ratio, 3.86 [3.59–4.08]), and 90.1% (vs 44.8%; risk ratio, 6.72 [4.53–9.95]) gave birth before 37 0/7, 38 0/7, 39 0/7, and 40 0/7 weeks, respectively. For women in stratum A (vs E), when censored for medically indicated births, spontaneous labor occurred more commonly before 37 0/7 (risk ratio, 4.31 [1.99–6.57]), 38 0/7 (risk ratio, 3.71 [2.48–4.88]), 39 0/7 (risk ratio, 2.87 [2.22–3.46]), and 40 0/7 (risk ratio, 1.42 [1.14–1.77]) weeks.
Conclusion
Women in higher-risk strata gave birth earlier, and more frequently following medically indicated delivery, compared with those in lower-risk strata. Importantly, the proportion of women who gave birth following spontaneous onset of labor before their due date was also greater in higher-risk than in lower-risk women. The Fetal Medicine Foundation 36-week competing-risk model incorporates biomarkers of placental aging, including angiogenic imbalance; these results imply that a fetoplacental response to placental aging may be an important trigger for the onset of labor at term.}

Herbal medicine is one of the most dominant and popular types of traditional medicine. Till now, it is still an indispensable option for many people and maybe favored over modern medicine because of its availability, affordability, and considerably great extent of safety. Most pharmacological drugs are rooted, derived, or inspired by one type of medicinal plant or maybe another traditional medicine technique. One of the most substantial medicinal plants in traditional medicine is black cumin (Nigella sativa). Its fame goes back to its ancient history and its widespread use by most, if not all, cultures. It comprises several valuable compounds and nutrients, can be used in various forms and methods, has an abundance of medicinal properties that have been used in traditional medicine, and yet an area of research. This chapter displayed the evolvement of traditional medicine, uses of the black cumin, and its different properties throughout ages and cultures.}

abstract = {Mycotoxin is a common sort of harmful contaminant in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is in a great demand of controlling. On this account, a facile “turn-on” fluorescent aptasensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for simultaneous detection of patulin (PAT) and zearalenone (ZEN) was developed. In this study, the aptamers of PAT and ZEN were labeled by FAM and Cy3, respectively, serving as fluorescence probes. Both aptamers could adsorb on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) via π-π stacking, which will consequently result in the occurrence of FRET between the fluorophores and GO. In the absence of the targets, the fluorescence would be quenched “off”. In the presence of any of the dual mycotoxins, the corresponding aptamers would interact with the targets and release from GO due to the conformational variation, leading to a fluorescence “turn-on” effect. The limit of detection of this difunctional aptasensor was 2.29 nM for PAT and 0.037 nM for ZEN, respectively. This aptasensing platform exhibited satisfactory selectivity against interferents and reliability in real TCM sample detection. To our knowledge, it is the first aptasensor based on GO and FRET that realizes simultaneous detection of dual mycotoxin in TCM. Moreover, the measurement takes merely ∼60 min, does not need complicated pretreatment, and uses only inexpensive aptamer and GO as consuming materials. To sum up, this aptasensor exhibits great potential in fast, cost-effective and reliable simultaneous detection of multiple targets, and is expected to contribute to the quality and safety control of TCM.}

abstract = {Background
Little is known on drivers and detractors underrepresented in medicine (URiM) medical students face.
Methods
Using the nominal group technique (NGT), we explored experiences that strengthen or weaken the enthusiasm to pursue a career in surgery among URiM medical students (October 2021–April 2022); participants voted on the three most important experiences (weight of 3 = top rated, = 1 for the lowest rated). Responses from NGT with at least one vote were weighted, ranked, and categorized.
Results
Seventeen students participated. Experiences that strengthen enthusiasm (36 responses with at least one vote) involved mentorship and role models (weighted sum percentage, 35%), demonstrating grit (15%), lifestyle (15%), patient interactions (14%), technical skills (11%), community and team (10%), and intellectual stimulation (1%). Experiences that weaken enthusiasm (33 responses with at least one vote) include the minority experience (weighted sum percentage, 51%), quality of life (25%), toxic environment (13%), lack of information (7%), and finances (5%).
Conclusions
Mentorship, demonstrating grit, and feeling a sense of community were important positive experiences or attitudes. The minority experience, toxic environment, perceptions of self-worth, and lifestyle misconceptions perceived by URiM must be addressed to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion.}

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a key component of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications for creating new content including text, imagery, audio, code, and videos in response to textual instructions. Without human oversight, guidance and responsible design and operation, such generative AI applications will remain a party trick with substantial potential for creating and spreading misinformation or harmful and inaccurate content at unprecedented scale. However, if positioned and developed responsibly as companions to humans augmenting but not replacing their role in decision making, knowledge retrieval and other cognitive processes, they could evolve into highly efficient, trustworthy, assistive tools for information management. This perspective describes how such tools could transform data management workflows in healthcare and medicine, explains how the underlying technology works, provides an assessment of risks and limitations, and proposes an ethical, technical, and cultural framework for responsible design, development, and deployment. It seeks to incentivise users, developers, providers, and regulators of generative AI that utilises LLMs to collectively prepare for the transformational role this technology could play in evidence-based sectors.}

This review introduces four multimodal integrated approaches that contribute to the discovery of more comprehensive and accurate Q-markers, thus aiding in the establishment of new quality control patterns based on the characteristics and principles of TCM. These include the whole-process quality control strategy, chemical-activity-based screening method, efficacy, safety, and consistent combination strategy, and TCM theory-guided approach. Furthermore, methodologies and representative examples of these strategies are described, and important future directions and questions in this field are also proposed.}

abstract = {Introduction
Mentorship provides general career guidance in academic medicine. Sponsorship advocates for a sponsee by endorsing this person for a position or role. Sponsorship is less common and originates from the corporate world. The objective was to evaluate current mentorship and sponsorship practices in academic medicine in the German-speaking regions of Switzerland. The aim was to assess to which degree sponsorship is implemented in academic medicine in Switzerland.
Methods
Cross-sectional survey of current and alumni participants of career development programs at two Medical Faculties of Swiss universities. Both programs build on institutionalized mentoring. The anonymous electronic survey was based on a literature review with non-validated questions about mentorship and sponsorship.
Results
The overall survey response rate was 37.6% (38/101). The majority of respondents was female (31/38; 81.6%) and between 30 and 40 years of age (22/38; 57.9%). Almost all participants had at least one mentor (37/38; 97.4%), and mentoring addressed all or most (21/38; 55.3%) of the relevant topics regarding academic career development. More than one third of the respondents (13/38; 34.2%) did not have a sponsor, 4/38 (10.5%) were unsure whether they had a sponsor, and 5/38 (13.2%) had not yet heard about sponsorship.
Discussion
In Switzerland, mentorship is well-established in academic medicine while awareness for the benefits of sponsorship needs to be fostered in order to further advance academic careers in medicine.
Conclusion
Mentoring and sponsoring may be considered key instruments for empowerment of junior faculty/physician scientists to become leaders in the field of academic medicine.
Zusammenfassung
Hintergrund
Mentoring dient der allgemeinen Karriereberatung in der akademischen Medizin. Beim Sponsoring hingegen wird die geförderte Person gezielt für eine Position oder Rolle nominiert. Sponsoring ist weniger verbreitet und stammt aus der Unternehmenswelt. Das Ziel war die Untersuchung der aktuellen Mentoring- und Sponsoring-Praktiken in der akademischen Medizin in der deutschsprachigen Schweiz, insbesondere die Erhebung, inwieweit Sponsoring in diesem Kontext etabliert ist.
Methode
Querschnittsstudie unter aktuellen und ehemaligen Teilnehmenden von Karriereförderungsprogrammen an zwei Medizinischen Fakultäten Schweizer Universitäten. Beide Programme bauen auf institutionalisiertem Mentoring auf. Die anonymisierte, elektronische, nicht validierte Umfrage basierte auf einer Literaturrecherche zu Mentoring und Sponsoring.
Ergebnisse
Die Antwortrate der Umfrage lag bei 37,6% (38/101). Die Mehrheit der Antwortenden war weiblichen Geschlechts (31/38; 81,6%) im Alter von 30 bis 40 Jahren (22/38; 57,9%). Fast alle Teilnehmenden hatten zumindest eine Mentorperson (37/38; 97,4%), und Mentoring beinhaltete alle oder die meisten (21/38; 55,3%) relevanten Themen bezüglich Karriereentwicklung. Mehr als ein Drittel der Antwortenden (13/38; 34,2%) hatte keine Sponsorperson, 4/38 (10,5%) waren unsicher, ob sie eine Sponsorperson hatten, und 5/38 (13,2%) hatten bisher nicht von Sponsoring gehört.
Diskussion
In der Schweiz ist Mentoring in der akademischen Medizin weitverbreitet. Das Bewusstsein für die Vorteile des Sponsorings hingegen sollte weiter gestärkt werden, um akademische Karrieren in der Medizin weiterzuentwickeln und gezielt voranzutreiben.
Schlussfolgerung
Mentoring und Sponsoring nehmen eine Schlüsselfunktion in der Förderung von zukünftigen Führungskräften in der akademischen Medizin ein.}

abstract = {Background
In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) field, the benefits of observational studies was more significant. Whether the evidence from observational studies agreed with RCTs in the field of TCM was still unclear.
Methods
A meta-epidemiological study was conducted. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews including cohort studies and case-control studies of TCM were included. Ratio of odds ratio (ROR) of randomized controlled trials and observational studies were calculated individually and intercomparisons were conducted by pool analysis.
Results
A total of 11 studies and 30 outcome pairs were included in the pool analysis. Using results from the observational studies as the reference group, the polled ROR comparing randomized controlled trials with observational studies was 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.44, and 95% prediction interval 0.90 to 1.68). The ROR by subgroup analysis were 1.15 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.38; 95% prediction interval 0.95 to 1.39) and 1.12 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.46; 95% prediction interval 0.51 to 2.47) for cohort studies and case-control studies, respectively.
Conclusions
There is difference in pooled results between randomized controlled studies and observational studies on TCM. However, the prediction interval shows the difference is small, which suggests observational studies of TCM can be included in data analysis to provide evidence for TCM. Future studies are needed to verify the above conclusion.}

abstract = {Background
Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States, which is attributed to limited treatment options. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have been proposed to provide benefits in treating pancreatic cancer. Despite its importance in treatment, clinicians are not generally well equipped to counsel their patients about CAM therapies. This review identified the quantity and assessed the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) providing CAM recommendations for the treatment and/or management of pancreatic cancer.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted to identify pancreatic cancer CPGs. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched from 2011 to 2022. The Guidelines International Network (GIN) and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) websites were also searched. Eligible CPGs published by non-profit agencies on treatment and/or management of pancreatic cancer for adults were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.
Results
From 31 eligible search results, 7 CPGs mentioned CAM and 3 CPGs made CAM recommendations. The mean scaled domain percentages of the CPGs in this study (overall, CAM-specific) were as follows: scope and purpose (81.3%, 77.8%), stakeholder involvement (63.9%, 42.6%), rigor-of-development (51.0%, 40.3%), clarity-of-presentation (83.3%, 54.6%), applicability (42.3%, 30.5%), and editorial independence (58.3%, 58.3%).
Conclusions
Evaluation of the CPGs demonstrated that quality varied both within and between CPGs. CPGs that scored well could be used by patients and clinicians as the basis for discussion for the use of CAM therapies. Future research should identify other appropriate CAM therapies for further development of CPGs for pancreatic cancer.
Registration
The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42022334025).}

This strategy attenuates disease symptoms and stimulates endogenous and exogenous regeneration processes. However, several clinical trial shortcomings revealed that injecting only stem cells was insufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic benefits. This may be attributed to low cell survival, short-term cell retention, and limited functional improvements. To overcome this challenge, biofunctional hydrogels have been explored as a potential cell delivery platform and offer new possibilities for the next generation of stem cell-based therapies in clinics. Although the importance and impacts of hydrogels for stem cell delivery are clearly defined, this strategy should be carefully developed with all potential barriers in mind before moving to early-phase clinical trials. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the design principles and applications of hydrogels for stem cell delivery in tissue engineering. We discuss the importance of creating cell-instructive hydrogels that mimic the three-dimensional (3D) stem cell niches and explore various hydrogel formulations employed in tissue engineering approaches. Finally, we review the remaining challenges of the current stem cell/hydrogel strategies in clinical trials and propose potential approaches for achieving successful clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Biopharmaceutical medicines have transformed the treatment of various long-term diseases, despite their high cost and limited availability. Due to their cost saving potentials, biosimilar medicines represent a new wave of therapy for several diseases in the next few years. Thus, pharmacists are uniquely placed to promote and enhance their uptake.
Objectives
The objectives of this study were to assess Nigerian pharmacists’ biosimilar medicine knowledge, attitudes, and practices.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional, national online survey of conveniently sampled pharmacists in Nigeria. Data were collected with a validated 31-item biosimilar medicine knowledge, attitude, and practice questionnaire. The Pearson correlation (r) analysis was conducted to investigate the association among knowledge, attitude, and practice. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Of the 600 pharmacists who were invited to participate in the survey, 411 completed the questionnaire giving a response rate of 68.5%. The mean knowledge score was 6.2 ± 3.0 out of a maximum score of 14. Most of the participants (n = 268, 65.2%) had overall knowledge scores of 1 to 7. The mean attitude score was 35.0 ± 8.8 out of a maximum score of 55, whereas that of practice was 18.7 ± 5.3 out of a maximum score of 30. Knowledge was significantly positively correlated with practice (r = 0.360).
Conclusion
Most of the surveyed pharmacists had poor knowledge of biosimilar medicines, while their reported fair attitude did not translate to good practice.}

abstract = {Chordomas are malignant bone tumors that arise from remnants of the notochord. These tumors are generally slow-growing, locally aggressive, and invasive. Chordomas are typically resistant to conventional chemo- and radiotherapy. The clinical management of this disease is very challenging, usually, treatment is surgical resection, which may be combined with radiotherapy. Although chordomas have undergone histologic and genetic analysis, the molecular mechanisms that drive their pathogenesis and resistance are still largely unknown. For many years this could be attributed to the lack of accurate and reliable in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Yet, over the past decade, many efforts have been made to prioritize the generation of useful chordoma cell lines, and tumor models that have shed more light on this malignancy and have made efficacious drug discovery a greater possibility. This review summarizes and discusses recent enhancements and improvements made to generate useful chordoma models and their applications in drug discovery and precision medicine.}

Diagnostic use of radiopharmaceuticals has great clinical importance. It’s known that the biodistribution, radiolabeling, and pharmacokinetics of these products may change by interacting with other drugs. Also herbal medicines have also played an important role in the treatment of diseases, especially in recent years. However, because herbal medicines are considered as completely harmless, their unconscious use has increased. Herbal medicines also have the potential to interact with radiopharmaceuticals and therefore they should be used in a controlled manner. The aim of this study is investigating the interactions of radiopharmaceutical products and herbal medicines and presenting a review about them.}

abstract = {Introduction
Administration devices play a very crucial role in achieving a drug’s therapeutic effect. Children are often dosed with oral liquids, but dosing devices don’t have the accuracy needed, putting them at risk of inaccurate and suboptimal dosing. The availability and use of administration devices may vary throughout the world. Multiple surveys in UK, Europe and Japan have shown diverging practices by parents/caregivers. The aim of the present investigation was to conduct a larger Pan-India study through a series of workshops to understand the use and challenges of traditional devices and assess the need of innovative administration devices for liquid orals in India.
Methods
The methodology used for the workshop was contextual inquiry and survey questionnaire were used to record the responses. Parents for the workshop were recruited by advertising the survey on various social media platforms. Informed consent was taken from the parents or caregivers for their participation in the survey. Workshops were conducted pan India and both middle class and urban worker families in the occupational category were included in the study. During the workshop, the parents were briefed about the background and purpose of the study. Certain global innovative devices such as oral syringes, syringes with pacifiers were shown to the parents. Their views and opinions were taken through survey questionnaire and via interactive sessions. The questions were themed for the interactive session on 1) challenges faced, 2) willingness to use innovative devices and 3) the factors influencing their decision on the use of innovative devices.
Results
Across the four regions (4 metro cities) involved in the study, 271 caregivers agreed to participate in the workshops. 17.7 % administered solid dosage forms, 81.2 % administered liquid dosage form and the remaining 1.1 % opted for others.
Traditional devices
Caregivers reported the use of measuring cups (41.4 %) followed by household spoons (25.8 %), droppers (15.3 %), measuring spoons (2.6 %), and other dosing devices (5.5 %) for measuring oral liquids. 8.0 % did not use any of the dosing devices as they were administrating tablets and/or capsules. The ease-of-use score was the highest for the dropper (2.67 ± 0.68) and the lowest for the measuring spoon (2.00 ± 1.00). The reported challenges were categorised into five categories which also influences the preference of using administration devices. This includes device design, user experience and usability, sociocultural factors, such as beliefs, knowledge and education, regulatory, and market/distribution.
Innovative devices
The majority of the caregivers (86.7 %) were not aware of any of the innovative devices shown to them. 58.7 % were willing to use it if was recommended by the doctor, 1.5 % of caregivers would use it on pharmacists’ recommendation and 37.6 % parents would use it if came along with the medicine. The criteria considered by the parents for use of the innovative devices in the descending order were Doctor’s recommendation > Quality > Cost > Packed in medicine > Ease of use > Availability/accessibility. There were no differences observed among the low and high socioeconomic status of caregviers regarding the use of traditional devices, challenges faced and awareness about innovative devices. Overall, the study revealed heterogeneity in the SES for the use of administration devices in the four zones. The association of SES and opinion on the use of administration devices was demonstrated with no statistically significant interaction between caregiver SES and the use of administration devices.
Conclusion
The workshop revealed the prevalence of traditional dosing devices like measuring cups, household spoons among the caregivers. It highlighted key issues with the use of appropriate administration devices for correct and accurate dosing in children that remain unresolved and prevalent in India. This study reflects on the needs of the target community; thus hope will help facilitate the development of locally sustainable solutions to improve the administration of medicines in children in India.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physical and psychological effects of COVID-related elective surgery delays on young sports medicine patients.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients (10-25 years old) who had elective sports medicine surgery delayed due to the COVID crisis. Electronic surveys were sent to patients and included the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), which yields a physical component score (SF12-PCS) and a mental component score (SF12-MCS), the PROMIS Psychological Stress Experience survey (PROMIS-PSE), and self-designed questions about patient concerns regarding the COVID crisis and delayed surgery.
Results
Of the 194 eligible patients with delayed elective sports surgeries, 107 patients (55%) elected to participate (mean age 17.6 ± 3.09 years, 30% male). The mean surgical delay was 76 days (CI 57-98). Delayed surgery patients scored significantly lower than population norms on the SF12-PCS (mean 39.3, CI 37.0-41.7; P < .001). Males scored significantly higher than females on the SF12-MCS (52.8 vs 45.7; P = .002), but the overall SF12-MCS mean was not significantly different from the general population (47.4; P =.07). The mean PSE score was significantly higher than population norms (57.7, CI 56.1-59.3; P < .001), but they did not differ by age or gender. Patients who reported higher levels of concern about their surgical delay endorsed significantly lower scores on the SF-MCS (P = .006) and higher scores on the PROMIS-PSE (P < .001), indicating greater emotional symptoms. The biggest concern with COVID-related surgical delays was a concern about not being back in time for a sports season.
Conclusions
Young sports medicine patients reported significant physical and emotional symptoms associated with COVID-related surgical delays. Patients were most concerned about delays resulting in missed sport seasons. Those who reported greater levels of concern with surgical delays reported more emotional symptoms and higher levels of psychological stress. Clinical Relevance: It is important to understand the impact of delayed elective surgical treatment on young patients due to COVID. This study will allow us to make more informed choices for patients during the pandemic.}

abstract = {Background
China has become the country with the largest number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and Chinese medicine (CM) has unique advantages in preventing and treating T2DM, while accurate pattern differentiation is the guarantee for proper treatment.
Objective
The establishment of the CM pattern differentiation model of T2DM is helpful to the pattern diagnosis of the disease. At present, there are few studies on dampness-heat pattern differentiation models of T2DM. Therefore, we establish a machine learning model, hoping to provide an efficient tool for the pattern diagnosis of CM for T2DM in the future.
Methods
A total of 1021 effective samples of T2DM patients from ten CM hospitals or clinics were collected by a questionnaire including patients' demographic and dampness-heat-related symptoms and signs. All information and the diagnosis of the dampness-heat pattern of patients were completed by experienced CM physicians at each visit. We applied six machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Network [ANN], K-Nearest Neighbor [KNN], Naïve Bayes [NB], Support Vector Machine [SVM], Extreme Gradient Boosting [XGBoost] and Random Forest [RF]) and compared their performance. And then we also utilized Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method to explain the best performance model.
Results
The XGBoost model had the highest AUC (0.951, 95% CI 0.925–0.978) among the six models, with the best sensitivity, accuracy, F1 score, negative predictive value, and excellent specificity, precision, and positive predictive value. The SHAP method based on XGBoost showed that slimy yellow tongue fur was the most important sign in dampness-heat pattern diagnosis. The slippery pulse or rapid-slippery pulse, sticky stool with ungratifying defecation also performed an important role in this diagnostic model. Furthermore, the red tongue acted as an important tongue sign for the dampness-heat pattern.
Conclusion
This study constructed a dampness-heat pattern differentiation model of T2DM based on machine learning. The XGBoost model is a tool with the potential to help CM practitioners make quick diagnosis decisions and contribute to the standardization and international application of CM patterns.}
