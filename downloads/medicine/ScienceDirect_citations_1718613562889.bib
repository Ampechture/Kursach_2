abstract = {The immunomodulatory roles of Chinese herbal Medicine (CHM) in aquatic animals have been well-recorded. However, how CHM impacts the intestinal microbiota and serum metabolism is not fully understood. In this study, the effects of different additive levels of CHM on the growth performance, immunity, intestinal flora and serum metabolism of hybrid grouper (♀Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂Epinephelus lanceolatu) were investigated. The addition of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% Chinese herbal medicine compound to feed could significantly improve the weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and survival rate (SR) of grouper, reduced feed coefficient, while had no significant difference on morphometric parameter. The most significant improvement for the parameters above was observed in 1.5% group. Different addition levels of CHM could also significantly enhance the activities of ACP, AKP, SOD, CAT and LZM in serum. Accordingly, the supplementation of CHM significantly induced up-regulation of immune genes such as IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α, Nrf2, Lzm in the liver, spleen and head kidney of grouper, improved the resistance of grouper to V. harveyi as well. The intestinal flora analysis showed that at the phylum level, the main dominant species of intestinal microorganisms were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Actinobacteriota, Gemmatimonadota, Desulfobacterota, Fusobacteriota and Myxococcota. At the genus level, the high abundance was Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Escherichia, Romboutsia, Sphingomonas and Muribaculaceae. The abundance of probiotics (such as Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Streptococcaceae, etc) in CHM-supplement groups were higher (highest in 1.5% group) compared with control group. Moreover, a total of 11 common differential metabolic pathways were screened by LC-MS metabolism analysis of serum, they were Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Purine metabolism, Linoleic acid, Glycerophospholipid metabolism, Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, Arginine and proline metabolism, ABC transporters, Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, Arachidonic acid metabolism, Drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism. Also, three common differential metabolites (PI(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/18:1(11Z)), PC(20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/22:1(13Z)), PC(22:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) associated with intestinal health, growth and disease resistance was found. These data will contributes to a comprehensive understand for the regulatory roles of CHM on fish, which is also beneficial for the disease control and sustainable development of aquaculture.}

abstract = {Objective
To initially explore traditional Chinese medicine patterns in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model.
Methods
Thirty-six C57BL/6 mice were divided by the random number table method (with 12 rats per group) into three groups: a blank group, a model group, and a number 2 Feibi recipe (FBR-2) group. The pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was established by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. The FBR-2 group was treated with FBR-2 for 4 weeks. Symptoms in the mice such as mental behavior, food/water intake, body weight, body temperature, respiratory rate, and tongue image were observed. The samples were collected on the 14th day and 28th day after modeling, and lung tissues were visually assessed and microscopically evaluated by staining with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson. The expression levels of hydroxyproline, interleukin (IL)-33, IL-37, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Mice in the model group were poor in spirit, less active, slow in response, showed reduced food/water intake, body temperature, and body weight, increased respiratory rate, and their tongue color had changed from light red to dark red. However, treatment with FBR-2 significantly improved these symptoms. Extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen fiber deposition were observed in the lung tissues of the model group. Compared with the blank group, the levels of hydroxyproline, IL-33, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the model group significantly increased (all P < .05), whereas that of tissue plasminogen activator significantly decreased on the 14th day and 28th day (P = .036 and P = .005, respectively). Moreover, FBR-2 improved lung inflammation and fibrinolysis imbalance and reduced collagen fiber deposition.
Conclusion
To some extent, our bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model exhibited traditional Chinese medicine patterns of qi deficiency, blood stasis, and heat retention.}

abstract = {Introduction
Cinnabar (96% HgS) is included in Chinese medicines, including Hua-Feng-Dan. We have shown the protective effects of Hua-Feng-Dan against LPS plus rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in rats and against LPS plus MPTP-induced neuroinflammation in mice by modulation of gut microbiota. However, the effects of HgS-containing Hua-Feng-Dan in comparison to HgS and HgCl2 are unknown.
Methods
Mice were given orally with Hua-Feng-Dan at clinical doses (0.6 and 1.5 g/kg), approximate Hg as HgS or HgCl2 for 7 days. Intestinal histology and Hg accumulation were examined. Bacterial DNA from the colon contents was extracted and subjected to DNA sequencing and qPCR verification with 16S rRNA probes.
Results
Hua-Feng-Dan and HgS did not affect animal body weight gain, intestinal histology, nor produce overt intestinal Hg accumulation (2-fold). In contrast, HgCl2 reduced body weight gain, produced spotted mild inflammation, and produced 20-fold Hg accumulation in the duodenum. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) from DNA sequencing showed that at phyla levels, HgS increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes, while HgCl2 produced opposite effects; at the family levels, Hua-Feng-Dan increased Streptococcaceae and Dehalobacteriaceae, HgS had similar effects; at the genus levels, Hua-Feng-Dan and HgS increased Streptococcaceae__garvieae and Paraprevotellaceae__Prevotella, while HgCl2 increased Dehalobacteriaceae__Dehalobacterium and Odoribacteraceae__Odoribacter. HgS also increased Verrucomicrobiaceae__Akkermansia and produced many other alterations.
Discussion
Cinnabar-containing Hua-Feng-Dan had minimal effects on animal health, gut histology and Hg accumulation but produced modulations of gut microbiota. Effects of Hua-Feng-Dan on gut microbiota were different from HgS and HgCl2.}

abstract = {Objective
In this study, we aim to review the current evidence of Food is Medicine interventions on diabetes outcomes among low-income or food-insecure individuals.
Methods
Seven databases were searched from January 1, 2000 to October 26, 2021 for full-text articles written in English. The studies included experimental studies of any duration and design which addressed the effect of Food is Medicine interventions on fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels among low-income or food-insecure populations with prediabetes or diabetes of any age group. Only direction of effect of interventions on F&V intake were ascertained due to high variability in outcome measurement. A1C results were pooled using generic inverse variance with a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q and quantified by I2.
Results
Sixteen studies were included. Five of the 8 studies reported a significant increase in F&V intake. Seven of the 14 studies reported a significant decrease in A1C levels. A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (n=843) resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in A1C compared with control (mean difference, −0.47%; 95% confidence interval, −0.66 to −0.29, I2=88%, p<0.0001). Half (n=8) of the studies have a high risk of bias due to missing data, detection bias, and confounding.
Conclusions
Food is Medicine interventions are effective in increasing F&V intake and reducing A1C levels of the target population. More randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the results.
Résumé
Objectif
Dans la présente étude, nous avons pour objectif de passer en revue les données scientifiques actuelles sur les effets des interventions Food is Medicine sur les résultats cliniques liés au diabète chez les individus à faible revenu ou en insécurité alimentaire.
Méthodes
Sept bases de données ont été consultées du 1er janvier 2000 au 26 octobre 2021 pour trouver des articles complets écrits en anglais. Les études étaient des études expérimentales de toute durée et de toute conception qui portaient sur les effets des interventions Food is Medicine sur la consommation de fruits et de légumes (F&L) et les concentrations de l’hémoglobine glyquée (A1c) sur les populations prédiabétiques ou diabétiques à faible revenu ou en insécurité alimentaire de tous les groupes d’âge. Seules les directions des effets des interventions sur la consommation de F&L ont été déterminées en raison de la forte variabilité des mesures des résultats. La méthode de l’inverse de la variance générique à l’aide d’un modèle à effets fixes a permis de regrouper les résultats de l’A1c. L’hétérogénéité a été évaluée à l’aide du test Q de Cochran et quantifiée par I2.
Résultats
Seize études ont été incluses. Cinq études sur 8 indiquaient une augmentation significative de la consommation de F&L. Sept études sur 14 indiquaient une diminution significative des concentrations de l’A1c. Une méta-analyse constituée de 5 essais comparatifs à répartition aléatoire (n = 843) a permis de conclure à des réductions cliniquement significatives de l’A1c par rapport aux témoins (différence moyenne, −0,47 %; intervalle de confiance à 95 %, de −0,66 à −0,29, I2 = 88 %, p < 0,0001). La moitié (n = 8) des études comportent un risque élevé de biais en raison du manque de données, de biais de détection et de confusion.
Conclusions
Les interventions Food is Medicine sont efficaces pour augmenter la consommation de F&L et réduire les concentrations de l’A1c de la population cible. Plus d’essais comparatifs à répartition aléatoire sont nécessaires pour valider les résultats.}

However, problems such as limited adsorption capacity and difficulty in recovery restrict the application of residues. Here, Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·H2O) was used to load Fe3O4 to prepare Fe3O4-modified hydrochar (Fe-CBC). Herbal extract (silymarin) was used to prepare functionalized hydrochar (Sil-Fe-CBC) for the first time by using the residue of clematis. Sil-Fe-CBC was used to remove methylene blue (MB) and tetracycline (TC) from water. The MB adsorption quantity was increased to 124.7 mg/g within 30 min, and the removal was increased to 84.26%. The TC removal was achieved approximately 91% in 120 min at an optimum pH of 3, an H2O2 dosage of 0.4 mL, a Sil-Fe-CBC dosage of 0.6 g/L, and a temperature of 30 °C. The FTIR spectra and XRD spectrum studies confirm that the form of ·OH is linked to Fe2+ in the catalysis process via the reduction of silymarin. Silymarin functionalization is a new approach to promote the efficiency of Fenton. Herbal medicine residues are potential raw materials in hydrochar preparation, and the extracts can improve hydrochars' performance.}

To identify the 50 most highly cited research publications in the sport of basketball.
Methods
Using the Clarivate Analytics Web of Knowledge database and the search term “basketball”, we identified 2,704 articles. These articles were filtered by the total number of citations and the top 50 most cited articles with a central focus on basketball were selected for this analysis. For each article, we further identified and analyzed author name, publication year, country of origin, journal name, article type, main research topic area, competitive level, gender of study population, and the level of evidence.
Results
Medicine-related topics, particularly those involving knee injuries, are more common than nonmedical topics (coaching, sports psychology etc.) among the highest cited articles. Articles originated from 13 different countries, with 48% originating in the United States. Only four authors had more than one article included in the top 50 most cited articles.
Conclusion
A majority of the top 50 research articles were from English-speaking countries, published after 2000, primarily focused on medicine-related topics, and were Level III evidence. Publications examining knee injuries were the most highly cited and appear to be of high interest to current investigators. The prestige of an author’s name appeared to be less influential to the number of citations.
Clinical Relevance
The top 50 most cited articles list will provide researchers, medical students, residents, and fellows with a foundational list of the most important and influential academic contributions to the basketball literature.}

It possesses a diverse array of bioactivities, including anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties, as recent pharmacological research has revealed. Nevertheless, the mtDNA of Angelica species remains relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we sequenced and assembled the mtDNA of A. biserrata to shed light on its genetic mechanisms and evolutionary pathways. Our investigation indicated a distinctive multi-branched conformation in the A. biserrata mtDNA. A comprehensive analysis of protein-coding sequences (PCGs) across six closely related species revealed the presence of 11 shared genes in their mitochondrial genomes. Intriguingly, positive selection emerged as a significant factor in the evolution of the atp4, matR, nad3, and nad7 genes. In addition, our data highlighted a recurring trend of homologous fragment migration between chloroplast and mitochondrial organelles. We identified 13 homologous fragments spanning both chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. The phylogenetic tree established a close relationship between A. biserrata and Saposhnikovia divaricata. To sum up, our research would contribute to the application of population genetics and evolutionary studies in the genus Acanthopanax and other genera in the Araliaceae family.}

The two clinical “Hot Cases” performed in the examination have a low pass rate, with most candidates failing at least one of the cases. There is increasing expectation for medical specialist training colleges to provide fair and transparent assessment processes to enable defensible decisions regarding trainee progression. Examinations are a surrogate marker of clinical performance with advantages, disadvantages and inevitable compromises. This article evaluates the Hot Case examination using Kane’s validity framework and van der Vleuten’s utility equation, and identifies issues with validity and reliability which could be managed through an ongoing improvement process.}

abstract = {Background
Standardized training of resident physicians (STRP) includes clinical practice, professional required courses, and public required courses, among others. Of them, clinical practice is the most important as it allows residents to implement what they have learned in theoretical education to practice. Clinical practice includes different teaching methods, such as traditional lectures, bedside teaching, and workshops, and each method has its advantages and disadvantages in different situations of interest. Emergency medicine (EM) focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of urgent medical conditions and entails several emergency procedures. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of workshop-based STRP and traditional STRP on emergency physicians.
Methods
Overall, 125 residents who received STRP in EM between January and December 2021 were selected and randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 60; received traditional teaching) and the intervention group (n = 65; received workshop-based training). The theoretical performance, operative performance, and satisfaction of both groups were compared and analyzed.
Results
Regarding theoretical assessment, the scores of airway management, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and trauma management in the intervention group were 4.81 (t = 5.82, p < 0.001), 6.90 (t = 7.72, p < 0.001), and 5.25 (t = 6.14, p < 0.001), respectively. Regarding skill assessment, the scores for the same items in the intervention group were 4.43 (t = 5.30, p < 0.001), 4.55 (t = 5.61, p < 0.001), and 5.62 (t = 6.65, P < 0.001), respectively. Regarding satisfaction evaluation, the scores in the intervention group were 1.99 (t = 6.03, p < 0.001), 1.98 (t = 6.41, p < 0.001), and 1.96 (t = 6.14, p < 0.001), respectively. Overall, the scores were higher in the intervention group than in the control group.
Conclusion
The workshop training model effectively improves the theoretical knowledge and practical skills of EM residents undergoing standardized training. The residents found the training and its outcomes satisfactory, ultimately improving their emergency response and first-responder skills.}

Respiratory diseases (RD) constitute a significant part of the workload of family physicians. There is no consensus on what family doctors should know in this area but established methods for achieving consensus may help to overcome this.
Objectives
The purpose of the study was to obtain a national consensus on the required knowledge and skills in respiratory medicine for family medicine trainees after vocational training.
Methods
A Delphi study was conducted via e-mail with a diverse panel of experts. We developed a Learning Curriculum Framework (LCF) with 399 items adapted from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians ..÷ Respiratory Medicine Advanced Training Curriculum. The LCF was submitted to the experts in two rounds for consensus. Consensus was considered for items that had an agreement of 80% in the classifications above 4 on a scale of importance that ranged from 1 (not important) to 5 (very important).
Results
Consensus was obtained for 159 items (38.8%). These included structure and function of the respiratory tract (0.6%), presenting problems (21.4%), diagnosis (7.5%), interventions and prevention (11.3%), COPD-emphysema (12.6%), tumours (3.1%), infections (10.7%), tuberculosis (5.7%), HIV (1.3%), thromboembolic disease (2.5%), pleural-pulmonary disease (3.1%), pregnancy (0.6%) and sleep disorders (3.8%). Items on iatrogenic diseases and respiratory research did not reach consensus.
Conclusions
Consensus on the respiratory medicine curriculum may contribute to further development of the vocational training curriculum in Portugal. This approach may help teachers in other countries in Europe to develop curricula for respiratory medicine and other areas of general practice.}

abstract = {Rationale
Metoclopramide is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting. However, long-term administration of metoclopramide is associated with various adverse effects, and its therapeutic effects are short-lasting. Hence, traditional East Asian medicine has received increasing attention as a short-term strategy for treating these symptoms.
Patient concerns
The present report discusses the cases of a 71-year-old man and an 80-year-old woman diagnosed with cerebellar infarction. Both patients reported nausea and vomiting, which appeared during hospitalization following cerebellar infarction.
Diagnoses
One patient was diagnosed with a left cerebellar infarction and hemorrhagic transformation, while the other was diagnosed with a bilateral cerebellar infarction.
Interventions
Both patients took Banhabaekchulcheonma-tang (BT) and Oryeong-san (OS) extracts.
Outcomes
The patient in Case 1 experienced a rapid decrease in nausea from day 5 of BT and OS administration, and metoclopramide was discontinued on day 7. The patient in Case 2 experienced a clear decrease in the number of vomiting episodes from day 6 of BT and OS administration and did not take metoclopramide thereafter.
Lessons
Other than drugs used to mitigate symptoms, there are no suitable treatments available for nausea and vomiting caused by cerebellar infarction. In the present cases, nausea and vomiting remained unresolved even after 3 weeks of treatment with conventional therapies; however, these symptoms significantly improved after administration of the traditional East Asian herbal medicines BT and OS, and there were no recurrences. These cases demonstrate that traditional herbal medicine can reduce the side effects associated with long-term administration of metoclopramide and help patients resume their daily lifestyle. In addition, BT and OS treatment can facilitate administration of other drugs, highlighting its potential to aid in the treatment of stroke. Further research including relevant clinical trials is required to obtain more conclusive evidence.}

Although there are many advanced therapeutic approaches, the 5-year survival rate of PC is approximately 11%, so it is one of the most aggressive cancers. The absence of potential biomarkers for early detection and screening is the main reason for poor prognosis and chemoresistance. Personalized medicine (PM) is an emerging approach using the characteristics and differences of patients in the molecular, physiological, environmental, and behavioral fields for better decision-making. In addition, novel quantitative imaging methods, including radiomic and deep learning, make a new noninvasive PM for a better early diagnosis and treatment of PC. However, PM encounters challenges that should be addressed that slow down its worldwide development, including ethical issues and relatively high costs. Here we summarize the novel therapeutic approaches and emerging research models, including patient derived xenograft (PDX) and 3-dimensional organoids, based on the patient’s tumor profile, which provides a better understanding of tumor and TME behavior and its response to drugs.}

abstract = {Purpose
As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated in health care, it is incumbent on health care professional associations (HPAs) to assist their memberships in preparing for related change. HPAs hold a unique role in establishing the sociocultural, normative, and regulative elements of health care professions. An exploratory multiple-case study approach was used to consider how, when faced with AI as a disruptive technology, HPAs engage in sense-making and legitimation of the change in order to support their membership in preparing for future practice.
Methods and Materials
The Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists, Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists were selected as cases. Data collection involved key-informant interviews and document review, the anticipated effect of AI on care and practice, reflections on perceptions of the professional membership, and the role and actions of the HPA in influencing such perceptions and work. Concept coding allowed for inductive framing of individual case narratives and subsequent cross-case analysis.
Results
Eighteen interviews were conducted and documents spanning 2013 to 2020 were reviewed. Eleven coding categories and 25 subconcepts were identified, spanning the perceived effect of AI, perspectives on prevalent mindsets, and roles of HPAs in preparing their membership, including changing education needs. The HPAs studied engaged in work to support AI consideration in varying ways, with perceived roles in education, advocacy, and leadership. Emergent trends across the 4 HPAs suggested 3 factors that might influence engagement: factors related to the organization, those related to the profession, and those related to the innovation in question. All HPAs acknowledged AI's effect on practice in medical imaging and radiation medicine, while some saw it as more of a disruptive force and assigned it a greater priority in the organizations. Conceptualizations of the potential threat to the profession and the HPA's role in supporting members in navigating that future landscape were also key insights.
Conclusions
This research suggests how health care professions are engaging at the macro level in the implementation and normalization work related to AI, and sheds light on nuanced perspectives on AI of groups that would interface with it.}

abstract = {Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability, reduced productivity, healthcare seeking behavior, and a contributor to opioid overdose in the United States. For many people, pain can be satisfactorily managed by existing medicines and comprehensive psychosocial treatments. For others, available treatments are either ineffective or not acceptable, due to side effects and concerns about risks. Preliminary evidence suggests that some psychedelics may be effective for certain types of pain and/or improved quality of life with increased functionality and reduced disability and distress in people whose pain may never be completely relieved. Efficacy in these quality-of-life related outcomes would be consistent with the 'reset in thinking' about chronic pain management being increasingly called for as a more realistic goal for some people as compared to complete elimination of pain. This commentary summarizes the rationale for conducting more basic research and clinical trials to further explore the potential for psychedelics in chronic pain management. Additionally, if shown to be effective, to then determine whether the effects of psychedelics are primarily due to direct antinociceptive or anti-inflammatory mechanisms, or via increased tolerability, acceptance, and sense of spirituality, that appear to at least partially mediate the therapeutic effects of psychedelics observed in psychiatric disorders such as major depression. This commentary represents a collaboration of clinical and more basic scientists examining these issues and developing recommendations for research ranging from neuropharmacology to the biopsychosocial treatment factors that appear to be as important in pain management as in depression and other disorders in which psychedelic medicines are under development.

To understand the perceptions of program directors (PDs) and fellowship applicants regarding the virtual interview process for orthopaedic surgery sports medicine fellowship programs.
Methods
An anonymous online survey was distributed through the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) to applicants and PDs of orthopaedic surgery sports medicine fellowship programs following the 2020-2021 fellowship application cycle.
Results
A total of 40 responses were received from PDs for a response rate of 47% (40 of 85) and 72 responses were received from applicants for a response rate of 27% (72 of 271). All of the surveyed PDs (40/40, 100%) agreed/strongly agreed that the applicant’s interview carries significant weight in determining where an applicant is ranked on the match list. Fifty-eight percent (23 of 40) of PDs agreed/strongly agreed that virtual interviews negatively affected their personal connection with the fellowship interviewee. The presence of virtual interviews allowed 80% (57 of 71) of applicants to go on more interviews. Seventy-three percent (51 of 70) of applicants were able to save greater than $5,000 on travel expenses and 63% (25 of 40) of fellowship programs were able to save greater than $2,500 by conducting virtual interviews.
Conclusions
Virtual interviews allowed fellowship programs and applicants to complete more interviews, but both PDs and applicants stated that interviewing in-person was important for applicants to meet faculty and tour the institution where they may be spending a year. In contrast, significant financial savings resulted due to the transition to virtual interviews. Finally, both PDs and applicants were in favor of having the option of interviewing virtually, suggesting that virtual interviews may continue to play a role in future application cycles.
Clinical Relevance
This study may be valuable to fellowship programs that will continue to implement virtual interviews into future application cycles.}

While the largest burden of active TB resides in low to middle-income countries, the US contributes to the global epidemic and can play a significant role in interrupting the spread of TB by recognizing and treating latent TB infection (LTBI). The vast majority of active TB in the US originates from the reactivation of LTBI. This cross-sectional study examines the prevalence of LTBI in a general medicine practice and explores the efficacy of a primary care nurse-run electronic directly observed therapy (eDOT) treatment program. 1221 patients were screened for the presence of historical risk factors for LTBI. Of those screened, 192 were offered QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) testing and a CXR if indicated, resulting in 35 being offered treatment for LTBI. After an initial provider visit to decide on the treatment regimen, patients received weekly nurse calls to verify adherence, assess for side effects and answer additional patient questions. Provider follow-up appointments occurred at the midpoint and completion of treatment. 33 (94%) of patients with LTBI completed treatment. Patients found the nurse calls very helpful to reassure them about their treatment and to address treatment concerns. Primary care providers are particularly well-positioned to identify and treat LTBI. Screening is simple and treatment is generally well tolerated. Utilization of a nurse-run eDOT) program can be quite helpful in facilitating adherence and treatment completion.}

Similarly, there is a need for medical professionals to have a central role other than in the response phase. This imperative to also engage in the preparedness, mitigation, and recovery phases mandates a coalescing of expertise under a common initiative, requiring a common understanding of terrorism from a health care perspective with a definition removed from the overtly political that has hindered progress. This approach, mandated by the increasing asymmetrical nature of terrorism, supports the creation of a subspecialty area of disaster medicine called the “counterterrorism medicine initiative.”}

abstract = {This article reviews the basic theories, methods, and clinical applications of eye diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It introduces cutting-edge methods and applications and explains that the modernization of TCM eye diagnosis includes “equipment-assisted diagnosis” and “artificial intelligence-based diagnosis”. The article also notes that while there are many recent studies of the static attributes of eyes in modern TCM eye diagnosis, modern application research on the dynamic attributes of eyes in TCM diagnosis theory is relatively rare. We propose, therefore, that introducing advanced eye-movement detection technology into TCM clinical diagnosis could help to further modernize TCM eye diagnosis.}

It has shown potential in many clinical applications such as cardiac dysfunction, diabetes, osteoarthritis, etc. The secretome with different cell sources such as bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue, amnion, placenta, dental pulp, etc. has been observed with different effector biological functions. MSC-Secretome effects include immunomodulation, inflammatory responses, wound healing and repair, neuroprotection and neurotrophic effects, apoptotic and antiapoptotic effects, antitumor effects, antimicrobial effects, and angiogenesis. Clinical studies indicate that MSC-Secretome is a new booster in regenerative medicines. Quite a few clinical trials are being conducted to check the effectiveness of MSC-Secretome-based therapeutics.

abstract = {Background
This research aimed to investigate the anti-tumor effects and underlying genetic mechanisms of herbal medicine Triphala (TRP) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
Methods
The target genes of Triphala (TRP) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were identified, and subsequent functional enrichment analysis was conducted to determine the enriched signaling pathways. Based on these genes, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify the top 10 genes with the highest degree. Genes deregulated in OSCC tumor samples were identified to be hub genes among the top 10 genes. In vitro experiments were performed to investigate the influence of TRP extracts on the cell metabolic activity, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and proliferation of two OSCC cell lines (CAL-27 and SCC-9). The functional rescue assay was conducted to investigate the effect of applying the inhibitor and activator of an enriched pathway on the phenotypes of cancer cells. In addition, the zebrafish xenograft tumor model was established to investigate the influence of TRP extracts on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.
Results
The target genes of TRP in OSCC were prominently enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, with the identification of five hub genes (JUN, EGFR, ESR1, RELA, and AKT1). TRP extracts significantly inhibited cell metabolic activity, migration, invasion, and proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in OSCC cells. Notably, the application of TRP extracts exhibited the capacity to downregulate mRNA and phosphorylated protein levels of AKT1 and ESR1, while concomitantly inducing upregulation of mRNA and phosphorylated protein levels in the remaining three hub genes (EGFR, JUN, and RELA). The functional rescue assay demonstrated that the co-administration of TRP and the PI3K activator 740Y-P effectively reversed the impact of TRP on the phenotypes of OSCC cells. Conversely, the combination of TRP and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 further enhanced the effect of TRP on the phenotypes of OSCC cells. Remarkably, treatment with TRP in zebrafish xenograft models demonstrated a significant reduction in both tumor growth and metastatic spread.
Conclusions
Triphala exerted significant inhibitory effects on cell metabolic activity, migration, invasion, and proliferation in OSCC cell lines, accompanied by the induction of apoptosis, which was mediated through the inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.}

abstract = {Background
Some Western medicine schools in China established standardized patient (SP) programs for medical education. However, SP programs are rarely applied to the education of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of using standardized patient traditional Chinese medicine (SP-TCM) to improve clinical competency among TCM medical students.
Methods
This study was a prospective, 2-group, parallel-training randomized trial over the course of 5 years. Data were collected from September 2016 to December 2020. Participants in each year were randomly allocated into the traditional-method training group or the SP-TCM training group (1:1) for a 3-month curriculum. Measurement of clinical competency among all trainees was based on a standardized examination composed of scores of medical record documentation, scores of TCM syndrome differentiation and therapeutic regimen, and checklist assessment from both SP-TCMs and TCM professionals. Feedback was collected using semi-constructive questionnaires from both groups.
Results
Compared with those assigned to traditional-method training, those assigned to SP-TCM training demonstrated significantly greater post-training improvement in medical record documentation and TCM syndrome differentiation and therapeutic regimen. Moreover, SP-TCM trainees outscored those assigned to traditional training in the assessment for encounter performance given by independent SP-TCMs and TCM professionals. The SP-TCM method gained higher satisfaction of training efficacy and test performance than the traditional method.
Conclusion
This SP-TCM program demonstrated great benefits for improving clinical competency among TCM medical students.}

abstract = {Background
Phospholipid peroxidation signaling was recently revealed as a novel pathological mechanism of coronary heart disease (CHD), and small molecules involved in this redox-metabolic pathway are suggested as the potential anti-CHD drugs. Danlou Tablet (DLT), a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula characterized by multi-component and multi-target regulation, is widely used in the clinical treatment of CHD by regulating lipid metabolism. However, little information is available addressing the corresponding pharmacological mechanisms and associated active components of DLT.
Purpose
To study whether phospholipid peroxidation involves a novel mechanism of DLT for the therapeutic effect of CHD and to explain the essential active components.
Methods
Firstly, the HPLC fingerprint was constructed to ensure the controllability of the quality of DLT. Then, a CHD animal model with the characteristics of lipid disorder and myocardial ischemia was established by a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation. The therapeutic effect of DLT was further evaluated based on the results of the rat survival rate, cardiac function, cardiac histopathology, and myocardial ischemia indicators. Correspondingly, whether DLT can regulate the key indicators (ALOX15, GPX4, MDA, GSH, and NADPH) of the phospholipid peroxidation pathway was investigated, and Alox15−/− mice have been applied to confirm the mechanism of DLT. Finally, the target-mediated characterization strategy based on ALOX15, including the integration of in vivo component characterization, network pharmacology, molecular docking analysis, and activity verification, has been further implemented to reveal the key bio-active components in DLT.
Results
In this study, a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation was utilized to generate a CHD model, and DLT significantly improved the cardiac dysfunction and reduced the myocardial cell death susceptibility. Further results revealed that DLT reversed the protein expression of ALOX15 and GPX4, the key proteins of phospholipid peroxidation pathways, which subsequently influenced the parameters of phospholipid peroxidation (MDA, GSH, and NADPH). The ALOX15 knockout transgenic animal model confirmed that Alox15−/− mice lost their cardioprotective effects with DLT, suggesting that DLT exerted therapeutic effects on CHD by regulating ALOX15-mediated phospholipid peroxidation. Finally, the target-mediated characterization strategy identified that daidzein is an active component in DLT against CHD by modulating ALOX15.
Conclusion
Innovatively, ALOX15-mediated phospholipid peroxidation was identified as one of the critical mechanisms of DLT exerting cardioprotective effects. Our findings elucidate a novel mechanism of DLT and provide some new drug evaluation targets and therapeutic strategies for CHD.}

In addition to a widespread lack of knowledge of integrative physiology, several tenets of CPET interpretation have relevant controversies and limitations which should be appropriately recognized. With the intent to provide a roadmap for the pulmonologist to realistically calibrate their expectations towards CPET, a collection of deeply entrenched beliefs is critically discussed. They include a) the actual role of CPET in uncovering the cause(s) of dyspnoea of unknown origin, b) peak O2 uptake as the key metric of cardiorespiratory capacity, c) the value of low lactate (“anaerobic”) threshold to differentiate cardiocirculatory from respiratory causes of exercise limitation, d) the challenges of interpreting heart rate-based indexes of cardiovascular performance, e) the meaning of peak breathing reserve in dyspnoeic patients, f) the merits and drawbacks of measuring operating lung volumes during exercise, g) how best interpret the metrics of gas exchange inefficiency such as the ventilation-CO2 output relationship, h) when (and why) measurements of arterial blood gases are required, and i) the advantages of recording submaximal dyspnoea “quantity” and “quality”. Based on a conceptual framework that links exertional dyspnoea to “excessive” and/or “restrained” breathing, I outline the approaches to CPET performance and interpretation that proved clinically more helpful in each of these scenarios. CPET to answer clinically relevant questions in pulmonology is a largely uncharted research field: I, therefore, finalize by highlighting some lines of inquiry to improve its diagnostic and prognostic yield.}

These illustrative examples showed organizational structures and bureaucratic processes persisting unchanged as linguistic changes on equity occurred. We posit that within this global health framework of equity, non-convergence of language purporting global health equity with static praxis is damaging on many levels. We underscore that the epistemological-praxis disconnect creates organizational psychology akin to cognitive dissonance within individuals, particularly among practitioners from the global south. This dissonance perpetuates inequity across global health organizations uniquely structurally impedes decolonization by and in the institutions that promote global health, and undermines the achievement of current goals across the global health system. To truly decolonize global health, researchers must measure and study changes in how organizations operationalize their goals, structures, policies, and administrative processes to address equity and social justice across all sectors of the global health system.}

This work aims to characterize the clinical profile of individuals with frailty syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hyperglycemia during hospitalization in regard to glycemic control and treatment regimen.
Methods
This cross-sectional multicentric study included patients with DM or hyperglycemia at admission. Demographic data, blood glucose values, treatment administered during hospitalization, and treatment indicated at discharge were analyzed. The sample was divided into three groups according to score on a frailty questionnaire. Generalized additive models were used to describe the relationship between either glycemic variability (GV) or minimum capillary blood glucose and hypoglycemia. Models were adjusted for age, comorbidity, and sarcopenia.
Results
A total of 1,137 patients were analyzed. Patients with frailty syndrome had more comorbidity and sarcopenia, worse renal function, and lower albumin and lymphocyte levels. A GV between 21% and 60% was related to a higher probability of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with frailty. Regarding minimum capillary blood glucose, patients with frailty had the highest probability of hypoglycemia. This probability remained significant even in the group with frailty in which, with a reference value of 200 mg/dl, the adjusted odds ratio of a minimum capillary blood glucose of 151 mg/dL was 1.08 (95% confidence interval (1.12–1.05)). Baseline treatments showed a significant predominance of insulin use in the frailest groups.
Conclusions
Patients with frailty had more sarcopenia and undernourishment. These patients were managed in a similar manner during hospitalization to patients without frailty, despite their higher risk of hypoglycemia according to GV or minimum capillary blood glucose levels.}

Study Design
Studies reporting patients´ HL levels and health outcomes linked to the OM field were selected using Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. Rayyan and EndNote 20 software were used for article selection, and the results were descriptively analyzed.
Results
Of the 697 studies, ten assessed patients´ HL, and knowledge/awareness linked to OM conditions. Oral and oropharyngeal cancers have been the most studied pathologies. Low HL levels and sociodemographic factors were associated with knowledge gaps on oral diseases. Furthermore, subjects with limited HL use prevention and oral health promotion services less frequently than the average citizen.
Conclusion
Inadequate HL in public at large has been widely researched in the medical and dental field, with most studies showing adverse health consequences. However, further studies are needed on patients with oral and maxillofacial diseases, especially those treated at OM services. There is a need for improved oral HL amongst the public and for improved communication skills between patients and professionals.}

Non-specialist emergency medicine qualifications are an important step in developing the specialty of emergency medicine. The Diploma in Primary Emergency Care (Dip PEC) of the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa is one of the oldest registrable qualifications. Reviewing its changing role over time has lessons for academics developing Emergency Medicine training in Africa.
Methods
Through a series of meetings and stakeholder engagements, the Council of the College of Emergency Medicine conducted a three year review of the qualification focusing on the curriculum, assessment processes, success rate and role of the qualification in the South African medical context. A survey of the perceptions of graduates over the last six years was also conducted.
Results
The survey showed candidate numbers increased dramatically from 2011 to 2017, resulting in an entry cap. Lessons identified included ensuring that the qualification is responsive to the state of development of emergency medicine in the country, needing aligned and valid assessment processes and maintaining the value of the qualification in context.
Discussion
Emergency medicine qualifications are dynamic in and of themselves and how they relate to their context. Program designers must prioritize ongoing evaluation from the start.}

abstract = {Purpose
To develop a standardized method to improve readability of orthopaedic patient education materials (PEMs) without diluting their critical content by reducing the use of complex words (≥3 syllables) and shortening sentence length to ≤15 words.
Methods
OrthoInfo, a patient education website developed by the Academy of American Orthopedic Surgeons, was queried for PEMs relevant to the care of athletic injuries of the knee. Inclusion criteria were PEMs that were unique, pertained to topics of knee pathology in sports medicine, and written in a prose format. Exclusion criteria were information presented in video or slideshow format, or topics not pertaining to knee pathology in sports medicine. Readability of PEMs was evaluated using 7 unique readability formulas before and after applying a standardized method to improve readability while preserving critical content (reducing the use of ≥3 syllable words and ensuring sentence length is ≤15 words). Paired samples t-tests were conducted to assess the relationship between reading levels of the original PEMs and reading level of edited PEMs.
Results
Reading levels differed significantly between the 22 original PEMs and edited PEMs across all 7 readability formulas (P < .01). Mean Flesch Kincaid Grade Level of original PEMs (9.8 ± 1.4) was significantly increased compared to that of edited PEMs (6.4 ± 1.1) (P = 1.9 × 10–13). 4.0% of original PEMs met National Institutes of Health recommendations of a sixth-grade reading level compared with 48.0% of modified PEMs.
Conclusions
A standardized method that reduces the use of ≥3 syllable words and ensures sentence length is ≤15 words significantly reduces the reading-grade level of PEMs for sports-related knee injuries. Orthopaedic organizations and institutions should apply this simple standardized method when creating PEMs to enhance health literacy.
Clinical Relevance
The readability of PEMs is important when communicating technical material to patients. While many studies have suggested strategies to improve the readability of PEMs, literature describing the benefit of these proposed changes is scarce. The information from this study details a simple standardized method to use when creating PEMs that may enhance health literacy and improve patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Nuclear medicine has significantly contributed to precision surgery in breast cancer in the past decades. Radioguided surgery (RGS) has enabled sentinel node (SN) biopsy in assessing regional nodal involvement modifying the management of patients with early breast cancer. For the axilla the SN procedure has resulted in fewer complications and better quality of life when compared with axillary lymph node dissection. Originally, SN biopsy principally concerned cT 1-2 tumours without evidence of axillary lymph node metastases. However, in last years SN biopsy is also being offered to patients with large or multifocal tumours, ductal carcinoma in situ, ipsilateral breast cancer relapse, and to patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) for breast sparing surgery. Parallel to this evolution various scientific associations are trying to homogenise issues such as radiotracer choice, breast injection site, preoperative imaging standardisation and SN biopsy timing in relation to NST as well as management of non-axillary SN metastasis (e.g. internal mammary chain). Additionally, RGS is currently used to accomplish primary breast tumour excision either by intralesional radiocolloid injection or by radioactive iodine seed implantation which is also employed to target metastatic axillary lymph nodes. This latter procedure contributes to manage the node-positive axilla in combination with 18F-FDG PET/CT in an effort to tailor systemic and loco regional treatment.
Resumen
La medicina nuclear ha contribuido significativamente en la cirugía de precisión en el cáncer de mama en las últimas décadas. La cirugía radioguiada (CRG) ha permitido la biopsia del ganglio centinela (GC) en la evaluación de la infiltración ganglionar regional modificando el manejo de pacientes con cáncer de mama precoz. Para la axila, el procedimiento de la biopsia del GC ha significado un decremento de complicaciones y una mejor calidad de vida en comparación con la disección de los ganglios linfáticos axilares. Originalmente, la biopsia del GC se indicó principalmente en tumores cT 1-2 sin evidencia de metástasis en los ganglios linfáticos axilares. Sin embargo, en los últimos años la biopsia del GC también se está ofreciendo a pacientes con tumores grandes o multifocales, carcinoma ductal in situ, recidiva del cáncer de mama ipsilateral y a pacientes que reciben tratamiento sistémico neoadyuvante (TSN) para cirugía conservadora de mama. Paralelamente a esta evolución, varias asociaciones científicas están tratando de homogeneizar cuestiones como la elección del radiotrazador, el lugar de inyección de la mama, la estandarización de las imágenes preoperatorias y el momento de la biopsia del GC en relación con la NST, así como el manejo de la metástasis del GC no axilar (p. ej., cadena mamaria interna). Además, la CRG se usa actualmente para lograr la extirpación de tumores de mama primarios mediante inyección de radiocoloides intralesionalmente o mediante implantación de semillas de yodo radiactivo que también se emplean para marcar los ganglios linfáticos axilares metastásicos. Este último procedimiento contribuye a manejar la axila con ganglios positivos en combinación con la 18F-FDG PET/CT en un esfuerzo por adaptar el tratamiento sistémico y locorregional.}

However, studying treatments for a pre-symptomatic population presents objective difficulties. This article intends to give a perspective about opportunities and challenges of pre-symptomatic prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
The first class of virtually interviewed maternal–fetal medicine fellows has matriculated into their training programs.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of virtual interviews on the outcomes of the National Resident Matching Program within our subspecialty. We assessed maternal–fetal medicine fellowship program directors’ experience with their fellows who interviewed virtually as compared with experience with the previous year's fellows who interviewed in-person. In addition, we evaluated program directors’ satisfaction with the virtual interview process and their preferred mode of interviewing for future cycles.
STUDY DESIGN
A cross-sectional online survey was distributed through the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine to all maternal–fetal medicine fellowship program directors on October 26, 2021, approximately 4 months after the first virtually interviewed fellow matriculated into the training program. Program directors were asked to provide information about their National Resident Matching Program rank list between their final in-person and first virtual years. Program directors were asked to evaluate their experience with their fellow 4 months into the first year of fellowship compared with their expectations based on their virtual interview, and their experience at that same point in fellowship of their last fellow who interviewed in-person. For all questions, in programs with >1 fellow per year, program directors were asked to answer the questions for the fellow ranked highest on their National Resident Matching Program rank list for each year. Survey data were collected anonymously and stored securely. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were performed to compare groups, all tests were 2-sided, and the significance level was set at P<.05.
RESULTS
A total of 80 of 98 (81.6%) program directors responded. There was no difference in the position of the matched fellow on the program's National Resident Matching Program rank list between candidates interviewed in-person and candidates interviewed virtually. There was also no difference in the number of programs that took an internal or external candidate outside of the National Resident Matching Program match process or that did not fill their fellowship positions. Program directors reported no difference between fellows interviewed virtually and those interviewed in-person in meeting interview-based performance expectations with regard to clinical capabilities (P=.67), technical skills (P=.96), research potential or experience (P=.54), professionalism and ability to be a team player (P=.72), and compatibility with the division and fellowship program (P=.67). Program directors’ overall experience with virtual interviews was favorable: 70 (95.8%) program directors reported that the virtual interview experience was better than expected, slightly better than expected, or as expected. In future years, most program directors favored ongoing exclusively virtual interviewing (n=41; 56.2%) or a hybrid of virtual and in-person interviews (n=27; 37.0%). Only 5 (6.9%) reported a desire to return to exclusively in-person interviewing.
CONCLUSION
Maternal–fetal medicine fellowship program directors did not identify a difference in National Resident Matching Program results between fellows interviewed virtually and those interviewed in-person. Furthermore, there was no difference between these fellows in meeting interview-based expectations in the first year of the training program. Most program directors found the virtual interview process to be effective and support ongoing virtual interviews.}

abstract = {Introduction
Pogostemon cablin Benth, commonly referred to as Patchouli, is a fragrant herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. The main aim of cultivating this herb is to extract its oil, which is widely utilised in the manufacturing of cosmetics, fragrances, beverages, foods, and pharmaceuticals.
Materials and methods
The data was gathered from electronic repositories that included Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The study selection criteria encompassed the examination of research publications that focused on phytochemical elements, namely bioactive chemicals. Additionally, the pharmacological profile of the herb, as well as relevant book chapters containing botanical, geographical descriptions and morphology, were taken into consideration.
Results
Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a primary component found in the oil. PA, which is present in higher proportions in the patchouli plant, is employed as a quality indicator. Norpatchoulene, a chemical compound containing PA, is an extra component that contributes to the distinctive resemblance of the fragrance to patchouli oil. Oil is predominantly recognised for its aromatic properties, characterised by a warm, spicy, and alluring scent. Java accounts for more than 66 % of the worldwide oil output, with China and Malaysia occupying the second and third positions, respectively. In Chinese medicine, the utilization of this herb is employed for the treatment of many ailments, such as headaches, nausea, colds, and diarrhoea. Oil has been utilized as a hair conditioner and in aromatherapy. Guanghuoxiang or patchouli is one of the primary ingredients utilised in the composition of some renowned Chinese patent medications, such as Huoxiang Zhengqi Koufuye (oral liquid) and Baoji Pian (tablets).
Discussion
The utilisation of patchouli plants in traditional medicinal systems has been extensive in China and India, where they have been employed for the treatment of many medical conditions. The main objective of this paper is to facilitate the broad appeal of comprehensive research findings related to the pharmacology and pharmacognosy of herbs, by relying upon the existing reservoir of literature in the field.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the treatment of epilepsy.
Methods
A comprehensive search of the database in both Chinese and English was performed. Data from the selected studies were extracted and analyzed independently by two authors.
Results
30 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 2471 patients. Among them, 4 trials (n = 235) focused on TCM monotherapy, while the other 26 trials (n = 2236) assessed the benefit of TCM as an add-on therapy to antiseizure medications (ASMs). For the efficacy, the meta-analysis found (1) The effective rate in TCM monotherapy group was higher than that in control group (OR = 4.92, 95 % CI: 2.29–10.57, Z = 4.08, P 0.0001); (2) The add-on of TCM also increased the effective rate (OR = 3.37, 95 % CI: 2.65–4.30, Z = 9.85, P 0.00001) and seizure freedom rate (OR = 1.93, 95 % CI: 1.53–2.44, Z = 5.58, P 0.00001). In terms of safety, the add-on of TCM reduced the rate of total adverse events (OR = 0.46, 95 % CI: 0.31–0.67, Z = 3.96, P 0.0001) as well as adverse events of the gastrointestinal and nervous system. 26 different TCM prescriptions were used in these included RCTs. Among them, the 5 most frequently used herbs were Acorus tatarinowii (19 out of 26), Glycyrrhiza uralensis (13 out of 26), Gastrodia elata (12 out of 26), Pinellia ternata (11 out of 26) and Poria cocos (11 out of 26).
Conclusion
This study suggested that TCM may be a relatively efficacious and safe clinical strategy for the treatment of epilepsy. Several limitations still exist, such as the risk of bias in the included studies, the diversified composition of TCM prescriptions, and the relatively low quality of study design.}

However, this shift in postpartum care also comes with increased visit complexity and additional provider burden, particularly when patients have had significant pregnancy complications or have chronic diseases. To ensure that the comprehensive needs of both healthy and medically complex people are consistently met under this revised postpartum care paradigm, a postpartum visit checklist for uncomplicated postpartum patients and another checklist for those with major medical or obstetrical morbidities are presented.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Recent reviews have emphasized the need for a health equity agenda in genomics research. To ensure that genomic discoveries can lead to improved health outcomes for all segments of the population, a health equity agenda needs to go beyond research studies. Advances in genomics and precision medicine have led to an increasing number of evidence-based applications that can reduce morbidity and mortality for millions of people (tier 1). Studies have shown lower implementation rates for selected diseases with tier 1 applications (familial hypercholesterolemia, Lynch syndrome, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer) among racial and ethnic minority groups, rural communities, uninsured or underinsured people, and those with lower education and income. We make the case that a public health agenda is needed to address disparities in implementation of genomics and precision medicine. Public health actions can be centered on population-specific needs and outcomes assessment, policy and evidence development, and assurance of delivery of effective and ethical interventions. Crucial public health activities also include engaging communities, building coalitions, improving genetic health literacy, and building a diverse workforce. Without concerted public health action, further advances in genomics with potentially broad applications could lead to further widening of health disparities in the next decade.}

To be useful the interactions must initiate molecular actions that fix a disease phenotype. While much is known about the targets for successful interactions and the disease phenotypes, much less is understood of the molecular actions that connect the initial interactions to specific phenotypic changes. Towards a better understanding of these actions, the first in class drugs (233) approved between 1999 and 2020 by the United States FDA were analyzed. The analysis identifies the actions that have been successful and characteristics of those actions. The medicines clustered into a relatively few specific actions: those that act on systems through sensors/receptors and controllers (51%), those that act to disrupt essential functions (12%), and those that act to provide a molecular fix by repair, removal, or silencing (33%). Antimicrobials were clustered with those that disrupt essential functions and antivirals were clustered in the molecular category. The sensor and controller actions work through system specific regulatory nodes whereby a single modality triggers a change to a complex system. Actions that disrupt functions cause toxicity and death to cells and organisms, where in many cases, mechanisms of repair and compensation play a role in both death and specificity. The molecular actions directly address known disease causes and arise from the intersection between enabling technologies that identify disease cause, and development of new modalities and their corresponding actions that provide therapeutic solutions. Many of the medicines utilize physiologic processes involving committed transitions at the core of the actions to enhance specificity. These actions, which process the input to specific output, are important for understanding why medicines work.}

Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the effects of feed temperature, feed flow, osmotic side vacuum degree and membrane material on the treatment of cleaning wastewater from TCM processing. Besides, the fouling of membrane in MD process and the efficiency of chemical cleaning on fouling removal were also investigated. The results show that it is feasible to recover high-quality water from traditional Chinese medicine processing cleaning wastewater by VMD. Compared with feed, COD in permeate decreased by 99%. During the 10 h experiment, the flux of both membranes decreased slightly due to the accumulation of fouling layer on the membrane surface.

This has led to increased boarding and crowding in EDs, requiring new methods of providing intensive care. Many hospitals nationwide have developed ICU boarding mitigation strategies at the hospital and ED level or implemented ED-based resuscitative care units to improve patient care and disposition. However, these have been described in the setting of larger medical centers without broader application to rural, community ED environments. The authors herein have created an ED model utilizing a physician and nurse on-call team to provide improved care to critically ill patients requiring resuscitation when an ICU bed is not immediately available.
Goals
The goal of this paper is to describe a novel approach to providing critical care in a rural health system. A community health system-based resuscitation team named Emergency Medicine Stabilization Team, or EMSTAT, was developed as a mobile team consisting of one emergency physician and one emergency or critical care nurse. The authors present data from the first 12 months of the program including diagnoses, procedures, temporal trends, and lengths of stay.
Results
Over the course of twelve months, EMSTAT was contacted for 195 patients and ultimately traveled to bedside for 131 cases. The three most common diagnoses seen were sepsis, respiratory failure, and diabetic emergencies. 99 documented procedures were performed; the most common were central venous catheters, arterial lines, and intubations. 104 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, while the other 27 were either downgraded to a lower level of care, discharged, transitioned to palliative care, or died.
Discussion
Over a twelve-month period, the authors describe a novel rural community-based mobile critical care team. This team demonstrated the ability to quickly arrive at bedside, continue resuscitation, acquire a disposition, and provide individualized critical are. This model serves as a roadmap for developing similar community based-resuscitation programs.}

Objective
The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in cancer patients in the Teaching Hospital Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara, Medan, Indonesia.
Methods
This descriptive study was conducted at H. Adam Malik Hospital and USU General Hospital, Medan, from March 2020 to August 2021. The main inclusion criteria for the participants were COVID-19 and confirmed cancer. A total sampling technique was used.
Results
Among the 3308 COVID-19 patients studied, the mean age was 44 years, ranging from 1 day to 92 years. Male participants were slightly more prevalent (51.8% vs 48.2%). Twenty-five of these patients (0.75%) had both COVID-19 and cancer, and thus met the inclusion criteria. The most common types of cancer were leukemia (20.0%), breast cancer (20.0%), ovarian cancer (16.0%), lymphoma (8.0%), and osteosarcoma (8.0%). The proportions of patients with mild, moderate, and severe degrees of COVID-19 where 48.0%, 24.0%, and 28.0%, respectively. Seven patients required intensive care, and five died.
Conclusion
The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with cancer was relatively low. Nevertheless, almost a third of cancer patients with COVID-19 developed severe disease and had poor prognoses. Vaccination among cancer patients is important to protect them from poor outcomes if exposed to COVID-19.}

In this study, we prepared a kind of novel microecologics, namely Chinese medicine–probiotic compound microecological preparation (CPCMP), which is composed of 5 traditional Chinese medicine herbs (Galla Chinensis, Andrographis paniculata, Arctii Fructus, Glycyrrhizae Radix, and Schizonepeta tenuifolia) fermented by Aspergillus niger and a kind of compound probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum A37 and L. plantarum MIII). The effects of the CPCMP in broilers on growth performance, serum parameters, immune function, and intestinal health were investigated. A total of 450 one-day-old male Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into 6 treatment groups with 5 replicates, 15 birds per replicate. Treatments consisted of: blank control, CPCMP, positive control, commercial CPCMP, traditional Chinese medicine, and probiotics groups, which were birds fed with basal diet supplemented with no extra additives, 0.2% CPCMP, 0.0035% chlortetracycline, 0.2% commercially available CPCMP, 0.2% fermented traditional Chinese medicines, and 0.2% compound probiotics, respectively. CPCMP obviously increased the average body weight and average daily gain (P < 0.05, compared with any other group) and decreased the feed:gain ratio of broilers (P < 0.05, compared with the blank control, commercial CPCMP, traditional Chinese medicine, or probiotics group). Moreover, it significantly increased glutathione peroxidase and secretory immunoglobulin A levels and spleen/bursa indices (P < 0.05 for all, compared with the blank control, commercial CPCMP, traditional Chinese medicine, or probiotics group). Villus heights in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were also elevated by CPCMP treatment (P < 0.05, compared with any other group). Furthermore, CPCMP substantially increased jejunal mRNA levels of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (P < 0.05, compared with the blank control, positive control, or probiotics group) and facilitated the growth and colonization of beneficial cecal bacteria, such as Olsenella, Barnesiella, and Lactobacillus. Overall results show that the CPCMP prepared in our work contributes to improving growth performance, serum parameters, immune function, and intestinal health of broilers and exerts synergistic effects of traditional Chinese medicines and probiotics to some extent. Our findings suggest that CPCMP is a promising antibiotic substitute in the livestock and poultry industry in the future.}

abstract = {This paper examines discussions of women's and men's reproductive aging in a series of western European medical texts written in the period 1100–1300. It uses the modern image of the biological clock to explore how far physicians in earlier periods understood reproductive aging to be a process of slow decline before a final age at which fertility ended (menopause for women, or a less defined ‘old age’ for men), and how far they viewed women's reproductive aging as different from men's. The article argues that, in contrast to modern medical and popular understandings, medieval physicians assumed men and women were broadly fertile up to a final cut-off point, and had little interest in viewing age-related fertility decline as a slow process beginning well before menopause. This was true in part because there was no realistic prospect of treatment for age-related reproductive disorders. The article also argues that in many respects – although not all – medieval writers viewed men's and women's reproductive aging as similar processes. Overall the model of reproductive aging they offered was flexible and offered room for individual variation. In this way the article demonstrates how changing understandings of the body, reproduction, and aging, demographic and social change, and changing medical treatments influence concepts of reproductive aging.}

abstract = {Guanxinning injection (GXNI) is a traditional Chinese medicine preparation derived from Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Chuanxiong Rhizoma. It is produced through a series of processes involving water extraction, ethanol precipitation, and other techniques. GXNI is primarily used for treating angina pectoris in coronary heart disease, and it has shown remarkable efficacy in clinical practice. One of the key components responsible for its pharmacological effects is salvianolic acids. However, these components are known for their poor stability and susceptibility to pH and temperature variations. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on ensuring the quality and stability of salvianolic acids in GXNI. In this study, we employed Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to analyze the intermediate products formed during the manufacturing of GXNI. We thoroughly examined the spectra of these intermediates and developed a precise 1H-qNMR method for the accurate quantification of various classes of chemical components present in GXNI. Additionally, we applied this method to investigate how the composition of GXNI evolves and transfers throughout the entire production process. To further enhance our understanding, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify critical steps in the production process and to identify potential quality markers (Q-markers) associated with these processes. Our study sheds light on the dynamic changes in composition that occur during the production of GXNI. This research serves as a foundation for establishing a comprehensive quality evaluation system for GXNI, ensuring its efficacy and safety in clinical applications.}

abstract = {Background
Safety concerns, caused by complex and unpredictable adulterants, run through the entire industrial chain of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). However, the conventional circulation traceability system only focuses on a certain end or link at the back end of the TCM industrial chain, ignoring the integrity of the links cross the entire industrial chain and lacking traceability. In consequence, a strict and rational supervision system is urgently required for the entire industrial chain.
Hypothesis/Purpose
We hypothesize that DNA barcoding would be a suitable measure for the traceability of adulterants in the entire TCM industrial chain.
Methods
In this study, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma was selected as a model to establish a traceability system for the entire TCM industrial chain. A total of 110 samples, including leaves, seeds, roots, decoction pieces, and traditional Chinese patent medicines (TCPMs), were collected upstream, midstream, and downstream of the entire industrial chain of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma. The ndhF-rpl32 fragment rather than the universal DNA barcodes, which could not distinguish the three original species of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, was selected as a specific DNA barcode to evaluate the practical application of DNA barcoding in the chain.
Results
The results showed that the ndhF-rpl32 fragment in all samples could be amplified and bi-directionally sequenced. Based on the standard operating procedures of DNA barcoding, the ndhF-rpl32 fragment clearly distinguished the seven Rheum species collected upstream of the entire industrial chain. For the samples collected midstream and downstream of the entire industrial chain, 25% of the 36 commercial decoction pieces samples were identified as adulterants, whereas the eight TCPM samples were all derived from genuine Rhei Radix et Rhizoma.
Conclusions
This study shows that DNA barcoding is a powerful and suitable technology that can be applied to trace TCMs in the entire industrial chain, thereby assuring clinical medication safety.}

To evaluate the quality and characteristics of systematic reviews, including meta-analyses, in the clinical orthopaedic sports medicine literature from 2015 to 2019 and to compare the results to previous findings from a similar analysis from 2009 to 2013.
Methods
All clinical orthopaedic sports medicine and meta-analyses published from 2015 to 2019 published in The American Journal of Sports Medicine, Arthroscopy, The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy, and Sports Health were reviewed. These were evaluated according to guidelines from Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, and the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool. Results were compared to the quality of publications from 2009 to 2013.
Results
A total of 516 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included in this study. Of these, 17.1% of studies included Level I or II evidence only, whereas 79.1% included Level IV or V studies. When compared to the previous study from 2009 to 2013, which demonstrated 32% of Level I or II evidence studies and 53% Level IV or V, there was a significant decrease in the level of evidence in the more recent study period (P < .001). The average Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses scores were 81% and the average Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews scores 56%, which are declines from 87% and 73%, respectively (P < .001, P < .001).
Conclusions
There has been a significant increase in the volume of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in orthopaedic sports medicine. This has coincided with significant declines in the level of evidence, as well as declines in methodologic and reporting quality.
Clinical Relevance
Clinicians increasingly use systematic reviews to drive their treatment decisions. Therefore, the quality of systematic reviews in orthopaedic sports medicine merits assessment.}

We aimed to investigate the quality of evidence and the expected added clinical value of treatments recommended by the Danish Medicines Council (DMC).
Study design
This was an observational study.
Methods
The DMC prepares reports on drugs considered for possible new standard treatments in Danish hospitals. These reports evaluate the available evidence on efficacy and safety. The quality of evidence is systematically rated by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, and estimates of added clinical value are presented. The recommendations take into account expected economic implications of new treatments. The publicly available reports up until December 29, 2021, were downloaded from the DMC Web page. Reports on drugs marked “recommended” were included. Data on quality of evidence, expected clinical value, and economic implications were imputed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
Results
Seventy-nine reports were included in the analysis. In 79% of these, the quality of evidence was rated low (24%) or very low (55%), whereas no recommendations were based on evidence rated as high quality. Three (5%) of recommended treatments were expected to add large clinical value.
Conclusions
Most recommendations by the DMC are based on evidence formally rated as low or very low quality by GRADE, and no recommendations were based on evidence rated as high quality. The added clinical value of the treatments was often not documented and rarely large. Continued attention to improve the clinical evidence behind national recommendations is necessary.}

This study aimed to reveal the classical signal pathways and important potential targets of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and provide support for further investigation on TCM and its active ingredients.
Materials and methods
Literature survey was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CNKI, and other databases, with “Alzheimer’s disease,” “traditional Chinese medicine,” “medicinal herb,” “Chinese herb,” and “natural plant” as the primary keywords.
Results
TCM could modulate signal pathways related to AD pathological progression, including NF-κB, Nrf2, JAK/STAT, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, autophagy-lysosome pathway-related AMPK/mTOR, GSK-3/mTOR, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, as well as SIRT1 and PPARα pathway. It could regulate crosstalk between pathways through a multitarget, thus maintaining chronic inflammatory interaction balance, inhibiting oxidative stress damage, regulating ubiquitin-proteasome system function, modulating autophagy, and eventually improving cognitive impairment in patients with AD.
Conclusion
TCM could be multilevel, multitargeted, and multifaceted to prevent and treat AD. In-depth research on the prevention and treatment of AD with TCM could provide new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis of AD and developing new anti-AD drugs.}

However, research has seldom assessed the influence of pig slurry properties on the fate of veterinary medicines even though such an understanding is essential for a more robust environmental risk assessment. Changes within manure degradation rates have the potential to alter the concentration of antibiotics applied to land, and the outcome of the risk assessment. The aim of this work was to investigate whether commonly reported redox potentials affect the degradation rates of acetyl-salicylic acid, ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, and tylosin. The employed redox potentials were −100 mV (reduced), −250 mV (anaerobic) and −400 mV (very anaerobic). A compound specific relationship was observed where the degradation of ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole was inhibited under reduced conditions over that of very anaerobic; the respective DT50 values were 0.7–1.84 h, 1.35–3.61 h, 22.2–49.8 h, 131–211 h and 35.4–94 h. In contrast, tylosin was found to degrade faster at reduced conditions over very anaerobic (DT50 6.88–19.4 h). The presented research demonstrates the importance of redox potential on degradation rates and suggests we need stringent and harmonized redox control to improve the environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicines. Environmental relevance and significance: Given the significant effect of anaerobic redox potentials on veterinary medicine fate tighter regulation is required in manure degradation trials.}

abstract = {Introduction
This critical review of randomized controlled trials (RTCs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal products used in the topical treatment of psoriasis.
Method
Selected databases were systematically searched using keywords. RCTs focusing on mild to moderate psoriasis using herbal topical treatments in comparison either to standard medications or placebo were included. The methodological and reporting quality of included trials was assessed through Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (ROB2) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement (with elaborations for herbal interventions), respectively. Meta-analysis was conducted via Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4 software. 14 RCTs published from 2010 to 2020 were included in this review.
Results
There is some evidence to suggest that topical herbal treatments are useful in the treatment of psoriasis. The meta-analysis favoured herbal treatment over conventional medicines and placebo and the herbal treatments caused fewer side effects. Indigo naturalis, Hypericum perforatum L. oil (Hypericaceae) and Curcuma longa L. Zingiberaceae (Turmeric) were particularly promising, due to their possible anti-inflammatory effects.
Conclusions
There is some evidence to suggest the use of topical herbal medicines in the treatment of psoriasis. However, the quality of included RCTs was poor and at a higher risk of bias in many domains. Therefore, larger, better designed and long-term RCTs should be conducted to enhance the quality of the evidence.}

abstract = {Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with no treatment currently available to modify its progression. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained attention for its unique theoretical basis and clinical effects. Many studies have reported on the clinical effects and pharmacological mechanisms of Chinese herbs in PD. However, few studies have focused on the treatment mechanisms of anti-PD TCM drugs from the perspective of TCM itself. Purpose: To elaborate the treatment mechanisms of anti-PD TCM drugs in the perspective of TCM. Methods: We performed a literature survey using traditional books of Chinese medicine and online scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and others up to July 2021. Results: TCM theory states that PD is caused by a dysfunction of the zang-fu organs (liver, spleen, kidney, and lung) and subsequent pathogenic factors (wind, fire, phlegm, and blood stasis). Based on the pathogenesis, removing pathogenic factors and restoring visceral function are two primary treatment principles for PD in TCM. The former includes dispelling wind, clearing heat, resolving phlegm, and promoting blood circulation, while the latter involves nourishing the liver and kidney and strengthening the spleen. The anti-PD mechanisms of the active ingredients of TCM compounds and herbs at different levels include anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidative stress, as well as the restoration of mitochondrial function and the regulation of autophagy and neurotransmitters. Conclusion: Chinese herbs and prescriptions can be used to treat PD by targeting multiple pharmacological mechanisms.}

This study aimed to investigate the duodenoprotective properties of HQJZT against Indomethacin (IND)-induced duodenal ulceration in rats, and the mechanisms involved, particularly through NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways. Our results showed that HQJZT completely protected the duodenal mucosa from ulceration caused by IND, as indicated by improved macroscopic and histological appearances. There was a significant decrease in ulcer index and microscopic score, an increase in villus height and crypt depth, and a normalization of the tissue architecture of the duodenum in rats following HQJZT treatment. Blood flow into the duodenal mucosa was significantly increased after HQJZT administration. HQJZT significantly increased PGE2 and NO levels in the duodenal mucosa. A significant reduction in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α was observed in the duodenal mucosa under treatment with HQJZT. Mechanistically, the administration of HQJZT significantly lowered the duodenal protein expression of inflammation-related genes, including p-NF-κB and p-IκBβ, compared with the ulcer control group. Furthermore, the STAT signaling pathway-related protein markers p-JAK and p-STAT were significantly reduced in the HQJZT (1.30 and 2.60 g/kg) groups. As a result of these findings, HQJZT alleviates duodenal mucosal ulcers caused by IND. A protective effect of HQJZT on duodenal ulcers is attributed to its ability to improve mucosal blood flow, stimulate the production of cytoprotective mediators, minimize proinflammatory cytokines, and block the activation of NF-κB and STAT signaling pathways.}

Disrespectful care refers to forms of verbal and non-verbal communication that affect patients’ dignity, individuality, privacy, intimacy, or personal beliefs. There are many possible underlying causes for substandard and disrespectful care in labour, including difficulties in modifying behaviours, judgmental or paternalistic attitudes, personal interests and individualism, and a human tendency to make less arduous, less difficult, or less stressful clinical decisions. The term “obstetric violence” is used in some parts of the world to describe various forms of substandard and disrespectful care in labour, but suggests that it is mainly carried out by obstetricians and is a serious form of aggression, carried out with the intent to cause harm. We believe that this term should not be used, as it does not help to identify the underlying problem, its causes, or its correction. In addition, it is generally seen by obstetricians and other healthcare professionals as an unjust and offensive term, generating a defensive and less collaborative mindset. We reach out to all individuals and institutions sharing the common goal of improving women’s experience during labour, to work together to address the underlying causes of substandard and disrespectful care, and to develop common strategies to deal with this problem, based on mutual comprehension, trust and respect}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The meridian (GuiJing) theory is a unique theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) which has been guiding the clinical practice of TCM for thousands of years, but physiological foundation of TCM's meridian remains to be clarified. Recent investigations have marked gut microbiota as a key mediator for the pharmacological effects of various TCMs. However, most studies focus on the response of gut microbes to a single drug or formula, the interactive effects of different drugs on gut microbiota are scarcely investigated.
Aim of the study
In this work, we evaluated the co-regulatory effects of different TCMs on gut microbiota when they were individually combined with Coptis chinensis (HL), and assessed the relationship between gut microbiota and the GuiJing of TCMs.
Materials and methods
Normal C57BL/6 mice were gavaged with HL extract for 14 days to disrupt the gut microbial community. Simultaneously, animals were treated with different TCMs which all possess antimicrobial activity but belong to different meridians. The gut microbiota was analyzed by full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to get a thorough bacterial profile at the species level.
Results
Administration of HL dramatically disrupted the gut microbiota and decreased the alpha diversity. Co-administration of different TCMs alleviated the adverse impact of HL on gut microbiota in a meridian-dependent manner. TCMs belonging to Shaoyin meridian moderately shifted the gut microbiota, while TCMs belonging to Taiyin and especially Jueyin meridians remarkably recovered the gut microbial community to the normal status. Decreased Firmicutes (Clostridia and Bacilli) and Actinobacteria (Bifidobacteriales) and increased Proteobacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) were main features of HL-induced gut dysbiosis. TCMs belonging to Shaoyin, Taiyin and Jueyin meridians gradually reversed the abundance of these bacteria to their normal levels. Simultaneously, the promoting effect of HL on beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Blautia coccoides was substantially preserved when co-administration of these TCMs, suggesting that co-treatment with these TCMs may reduce the toxicity of HL without deteriorating its beneficial effects.
Conclusion
Combination of special TCMs may alleviate the adverse effect of HL on gut microbiota while preserving its beneficial actions. Gut microbiota may be a potential biological indicator of the meridian of TCMs.}

abstract = {Purpose
Incidental radiologic findings are commonplace, but the episodic nature of emergency department (ED) care makes it challenging to ensure that patients obtain appropriate follow-up. Rates of follow-up range from 30% to 77%, with some studies demonstrating that more than 30% have no follow-up at all. The aim of this study is to describe and analyze the outcomes of a collaborative emergency medicine and radiology initiative to establish a formal workflow for the follow-up of pulmonary nodules identified during ED care.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed of patients referred to the pulmonary nodule program (PNP). Patients were divided into two categories: those with follow-up and those who do not have post-ED follow-up. The primary outcome was determining follow-up rates and outcomes, including patients referred for biopsy. The characteristics of patients who completed follow-up compared with those lost to follow-up were also examined.
Results
A total of 574 patients were referred to the PNP. Initial follow-up was established in 390 (69.1%); 30.8% were considered lost to follow-up, and more than half of these patients did not respond to initial contact. There were minimal differences in characteristics between patients in these two categories. Of the 259 patients who completed PNP follow-up, 26 were referred for biopsy (13%).
Conclusions
The PNP provided effective transitions of care and potentially improved patient health care. Strategies to further enhance follow-up adherence will provide iterative improvement of the program. The PNP provides an implementation framework for post-ED pulmonary nodule follow-up in other health care systems and can be modified for use with other incidental diagnostic findings.}

This case report aimed to highlight the challenges associated with prescribing exercise to type 2 diabetes patients undergoing metformin treatment. A 67-years old woman was followed-up for five months, including assessment of the acute and chronic glucose and lactate metabolism induced by concomitant exercise and metformin. The findings were four-fold: 1) During a high-intensity interval training bout, blood glucose systematically decreased, while blood lactate concentrations fluctuated randomly; 2) Basal blood lactate levels were well above 2 mmol/L on days with medication only; 3) Combined exercise and metformin administration induced additive effects on the normalization of glucose and 4) high levels of physical activity had a positive impact on the continuous glucose fluctuations, while decreased levels of physical activity induced a large fluctuation of glucose due to home confinement of an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our findings showed that when combined with exercise and metformin treatment for T2D patients, exercise may contribute to improving glycemic control while metformin may elevate lactate levels in the long term. The observed results underline the need to prescribe exercise and monitor lactate levels for reducing possible risks associated with metformin treatment and reinforce the importance of tailoring exercise therapy.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The rhizome of Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit, called Pinelliae Rhizoma (PR) and Banxia in Chinese, is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with the functions of “removing dampness-phlegm” and “downbear counterflow and check vomiting”. PR has potential toxic effects that can be detoxified by Fuzhi processing (repeated processing using one or multiple adjuvants) with specific adjuvants.
Aim of the study
This paper aims to provide a summary of traditional and current processing methods used to detoxify PR.
Materials and methods
The available references of the processing methods of PR from the classic books of Materia Medica, literature, online databases and masters or doctoral theses are collected and summarized. We also discussed the possible processing mechanisms of how we can achieve a safer and effective application of PR via these processing methods.
Results
PR cannot be administered orally before processing. PR contains nucleoside alkaloids, cerebrosides, fatty acids, lectin, polysaccharides, and calcium oxalate crystals. To date, although the active substances of PR are still unclear, the toxic components are almost completely clarified as needle-like calcium oxalate crystals (NCOCs) and lectin proteins. Furthermore, the toxic effects of PR include causing death in animals, inflammation, conjunctival irritation, pregnancy toxicity, teratogenicity, visceral toxicity, aphonia and vomiting. From ancient times to now, Fuzhi methods have remained the predominant method for PR processing, and the main adjuvants used are ginger juice, alum, licorice and lime. In addition, detoxification mechanisms are related to removing or damaging the NCOC and lectin in PR based on processing with adjuvants. Currently, Fuzhi processing has been greatly improved, and novel processing technologies with novel adjuvants have been used for PR processing. However, there are still some flaws in PR processing, which should be urgently solved in the future, and clarifying the characteristic bioactive compounds in PR corresponding to its function or effects is the most important step for PR processing.
Conclusion
Our present paper reviewed the previous literature regarding all aspects of the processing of PR, and this paper will be helpful for achieving a safer and effective application of PR and its processed products and will also be beneficial for the further optimization of processing technology and clinical medication safety of PR.}

With high mortality and morbidity rates, lung cancer (LC) has become one of the major threats to human health. The treatment strategies for LC currently face issues, such as drug resistance and body tolerance. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is characterized by novel pharmacological mechanisms, low toxicity, and limited side effects. TCM includes a substantial number of biologically active ingredients, several of which are effective monomeric agents against LC. An increasing number of researchers are focusing their efforts on the discovery of active anti-cancer ingredients in TCM.
Aim of the review
In this review, we summarized the anti-LC mechanisms of five types of TCM monomeric compounds. Our goal is to provide research ideas for the identification of new prospective medication candidates for the treatment of LC.
Materials and methods
We collected reports on the anti-LC effects of TCM monomers from web databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Europe PubMed Central. Among the keywords used were “lung cancer,” “traditional Chinese medicine,” “pharmacology,” and their combinations thereof. Then, we systematically summarized the anti-LC efficacy and related mechanisms of TCM monomers.
Results
Based on the available literature, this paper reviewed the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of five types of TCM monomers on LC. The characteristics of TCM monomers include the capabilities to suppress the tumor cell cycle, inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, promote autophagy, inhibit tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and enhance efficacy or reduce drug resistance when combined with cytotoxic agents and other methods to arrest the progression of LC and prolong the survival of patients.
Conclusions
TCM contains numerous flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, polyphenols, and other active compounds that are effective against LC. Given their chemical structure and pharmacological properties, these monomers are suitable as candidate drugs for the treatment of LC.}

abstract = {Summary
Aim
To describe what is known from scientific literature on the use of laryngoscopy to enhance singing pedagogy and foster improvements in vocal development.
Design
The scoping review methodological framework by Arksey and O’Malley was used.
Review methods
A systematic search was conducted and peer-reviewed scientific papers were screened through the Rayyan software. Data were extracted and synthesized thematically as narrative text.
Data sources
Searches were carried out on January 2023 in the Web of Science, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, ERIC, Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase and Academic Search Elite databases using relevant keywords to capture evidence, limited to peer-reviewed scientific papers in Nordic or English language.
Results
A total of 1413 studies were screened and assessed for eligibility. Two studies met the inclusion criteria reporting results on the use of laryngoscope in development of singers’ voices. Different designs were applied and the charted data characteristics varied. Two populations were explored; one cohort of trained professional female musical theater singers and one cohort of students (both sexes) recruited from a music school. Results from examinations with laryngoscopy regarding vowel quality, register quality, anterior-posterior compression scores, and maximum phonation time are presented. None of the retrieved studies aimed to apply laryngoscopy to enhance singing pedagogy.
Conclusion
Use of laryngoscopy to enable the singer to directly see their song instrument in order to foster improvements in vocal development, have been subject to little exploration. Only two studies were retrieved in our systematic search, none aimed to study potential pedagogical aspects of applying laryngoscopy. These findings support further investigation of the users’, especially singers’ and voice teachers’ perspective, to guide and inform best practice for use of laryngoscopy as a pedagogical tool in a song development context.}
