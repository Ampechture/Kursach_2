abstract = {Over the years, much research has been focused on the use of small molecules such as peptides or aptamers or more recently on the use of variable antigen-binding domain of heavy chain only antibodies in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The use of these molecules originated as an alternative for the larger conventional antibodies, of which most drawbacks are derived from their size and complex structure. In the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, biological functionalities are often conjugated to biomaterials in order to (re-)create an in vivo like situation, especially when bioinert biomaterials are used. Those biomaterials are functionalized with these functionalities for instance for the purpose of cell attachment or cell targeting for targeted drug delivery but also for local enrichment or blocking of ligands such as growth factors or cytokines on the biomaterial surface. In this review, we further refer to peptides, aptamers, and variable antigen-binding domain of heavy chain only antibodies as biological functionalities. Here, we compare these biological functionalities within the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and give an overview of recent work in which these biological functionalities have been explored. We focus on the previously mentioned purposes of the biological functionalities. We will compare structural differences, possible modifications and (chemical) conjugation strategies. In addition, we will provide an overview of biologicals that are, or have been, involved in clinical trials. Finally, we will highlight the challenges of each of these biologicals.
Statement of significance
In the field of tissue engineering there is broad application of functionalized biomaterials for cell attachment, targeted drug delivery and local enrichment or blocking of growth factors. This was previously mostly done via conventional antibodies, but their large size and complex structure impose various challenges with respect of retaining biological functionality. Peptides, aptamers and VHHs may provide an alternative solution for the use of conventional antibodies. This review discusses the use of these molecules for biological functionalization of biomaterials. For each of the molecules, their characteristics, conjugation possibilities and current use in research and clinical trials is described. Furthermore, this review sets out the benefits and challenges of using these types of molecules for different fields of application.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Over the past two decades, hydrogels have come to the forefront of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their biocompatibility, tunable degradation and low immunogenicity. Due to their porosity and polymeric network built up, it is possible to incorporate inside drugs, bioactive molecules, or other biochemically active monomers. Among biopolymers used for the fabrication of functional hydrogels, silk fibroin (SF) has received considerable research attention owing to its known biocompatibility and tunable range of mechanical properties. However, its relatively simple structure limits the potential usability. One of the emerging strategies is a chemical functionalization of SF, allowing for the introduction of methacrylate groups. This allows the versatile processing capability, including photo-cross-linking, which makes SF a useful polymer as a bioink for 3D printing. The methacrylation reaction has been done using numerous monomers such as methacrylic anhydride (MA), 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (IEM), or glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). In this Review, we summarize the chemical functionalization strategies of SF materials and their resulting physicochemical properties. More specifically, a brief explanation of the different functionalization methods, the cross-linking principles, possibilities, and limitations of methacrylate compound functionalization are provided. In addition, we describe types of functional SF hydrogels and link their design principles to the performance in applications in the broad fields of biofabrication, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. We anticipate that the provided guidelines will contribute to the future development of SF hydrogels and their composites by providing the rational design of new mechanisms linked to the successful realization of targeted biomedical application.}

However, are chemical index components and quality control of TCMs “never change a winning team”? In this study, under the ponderation of the applicability of QC markers strategy, spectrum-effect relationship and OPLS-DA between GC×GC-MS fingerprint and inhibitory effect on the expression of extracellular secretory TNF-α of volatile oil from Bupleuri radix (BVO) was studied with the purpose of discovery of QC markers and establish a bioactive compounds-based QC method. 290 compounds of BVO were identified by GC×GC-MS. Besides, BVO had significant inhibitory effects on the expression of extracellular secretory TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of different batches of BVOs could be distinguished with this bioassay-based method, which has been validated in terms of intermediate precision, repeatability, linearity, range and credibility tests. The QC markers of BVO were investigated by Spearman’s correlation test and OPLS-DA. It is regrettable that there were no ideal QC markers of BVO could be found. In conclusion, quality control method relayed on chemical QC markers is not feasible for TCMs with complex composition but lack of ingredients that dominate in content, just like BVO. Alternatively, a bioassay-based method established in our study is suitable for quality control of BVO.}

Cytokine expression analysis in psoriatic skin also supported the observed therapeutic outcomes.

1. Reviewing the currently existing Hospice and Palliative Care Fellowship websites, participants will be able to see what components are necessary to create an excellent website which will encourage applicants to apply to their program. 2. Utilizing a comprehensive review, the current Hospice and Palliative Fellowship Program Websites will be evaluated, allowing participants insight into common weaknesses in information presentation on these websites.
Key Message
Many Hospice and Palliative Care Fellowship websites do not provide enough information for potential fellows to make informed decisions on whether or not to apply to these programs. Updating these websites will provide potential applicants with the necessary information to pursue this path. This will hopefully lead to an increase the number of providers for these underserved populations.
Introduction/Context
Access to adequate fellowship information is imperative for resident physicians or attending physicians applying to hospice and palliative care fellowship [1]. Without adequate information, candidates are less likely to apply to programs, deterring potential fellows from pursuing potential fellowship education opportunities [2].
Objective
To examine electronically accessible information to those interested in pursuing a hospice and palliative care medicine fellowship (HPF) in their medical training journey.
Methods
Using the Electronic Residency Application Services (ERAS) [3], a list of websites from institutions offering Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited HPF programs, which participate in the Match was created. Every website was evaluated for application information such as application deadlines, program director/coordinator contact information, and a list of application requirements.
Results
A total of 190 HPF websites were initially included. 16 were excluded due to not participating in the Match or being unregistered. Websites without valid links on ERAS or following Google searches were subsequently excluded, removing another 6 programs. 1 final website was removed due to appearing to be a duplicate of another. Data from the 167 remaining websites was then recorded and analyzed. Overall, the websites lacked crucial information for potential hospice and palliative medicine fellows.
Conclusion
Many of the websites do not provide enough information for potential fellows to apply to these programs. Updating these websites will provide potential applicants with the necessary information to pursue this path. This will increase the number of providers for these underserved populations.

abstract = {Objective
To explore the methodology of the evidence-based expert consensus formulation process of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nursing taking stroke as an example.
Methods
First, preliminary and comprehensive presentation of all stroke-related symptoms and corresponding TCM nursing techniques involved were revealed through bibliometric analysis. Then, selection of stroke symptoms and TCM nursing techniques for inclusion in the consensus was performed using an expert consultation method. Next, we determined the search strategy for a precise evidence search; conducted an evaluation of evidence quality and the grade of the evidence; and completed evidence extraction, evidence analysis, and evidence synthesis based on the included symptoms and TCM nursing techniques. The Delphi method was then applied to determine the strength of each recommendation and the choice of nursing care points by referring to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations grid. Finally, we conducted an external expert validation of the Delphi results to form an expert consensus guideline.
Results
Through the bibliometric analysis, 22 stroke symptoms and 18 TCM nursing techniques were identified in the literature. Then, after expert consultation, 22 symptoms and 111 pairs of symptoms combined with TCM nursing techniques were selected for the evidence search. Evidence integration yielded 10 stroke symptoms corresponding to 29 bodies of evidence; these 10 symptoms were retained through the Delphi consultation, and recommendation strength results for 26 recommendations were obtained. A total of 9 symptoms were further retained for expert external validation to form 24 recommendations, with a recommendation process score range of 7.64–9.99 points and a more scientific and standardized recommendation-formation process.
Conclusion
Owing to the current limited conditions of evidence-based resources for TCM nursing, the present consensus-building process represents only a preliminary exploration of an evidence-based expert consensus for TCM nursing to provide a reference for a more scientific and standardized methodology.}

Sanguisorba officinalis (called DiYu in Chinese, DY) is well known as herbal medicine, which could inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, hemostasis and regulate the immune response. Moreover, the active ingredients in DY could remarkably reduce drug resistance. In this study, we investigated the effects of probiotic fermentation cultures on A. hydrophila through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Three lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG), Lactobacillus casei (LC) and Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), were selected to ferment the Chinese herbal medicine DY. The assays of antagonism showed that all three fermented cultures could influence the ability of A. hydrophila growth, among which L. rhamnosus fermented DY cultures appeared to be the strongest inhibitory effect. In addition, the biofilm determination revealed that L. rhamnosus fermented DY cultures could significantly inhibit the biofilm formation of A. hydrophila compared to the other groups. Furthermore, protease, lecithinase and urease activities were found in the three fermentation cultures. Three probiotics fermented DY cultures were orally administration with crucian carp to evaluate the growth performance, immunological parameters and pathogen resistance. The results showed that the three fermentation cultures could promote the growth performance of crucian carp, and the immunoglobulins, antioxidant-related enzymes and immune-related genes were significantly enhanced. Besides, the results showed that crucian carp received L. rhamnosus (60.87%), L. casei (56.09%) and L. plantarum (41.46%) fermented DY cultures had higher survival rates compared with the control group after infection with A. hydrophila. Meanwhile, the pathological tissue results revealed that the probiotic fermented cultures could largely improve the tissues damage caused by the pathogenic bacteria. In conclusion, this study proved that the fermentation cultures of three probiotics could effectively inhibit the growth of A. hydrophila, regulate the level of immune response and improve the survival rate against A. hydrophila in crucian carp. The present data suggest that probiotic fermented Sanguisorba officinalis act as a potential gut-targeted therapy regimens to protecting fish from pathogenic bacteria infection.}

Cyperi Rhizoma (CR) derives from the rhizome or tuber of Cyperus rotundus L. of Cyperaceae. It is an herbal medicine which has been widely used in different healthcare systems like in China, India, Iran, and Japan. In Chinese medicine, CR could promote the flow of Qi in the Liver and Sanjiao channels, regulate menstruation and alleviate pain. Clinically, CR is used for depression, flatulence, hypochondriac pain, and dysmenorrhea. Thus, it has a long history and significant curative effect for the treatment of various Qi stagnation symptoms.
Aim of this review
This review focuses on explaining the major antidepressant mechanisms of CR, and assessing the shortcomings of existing work. Besides, clinical applications, pharmacological effects and their corresponding chemical compositions and quality control of CR have been researched.
Materials and methods
The search terms “Cyperus rotundus L.” was used to obtain the literatures from electronic databases such as Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The information provided in this review to illustrate material basis of CR were only limited to papers which reported on the chemical compositions and pharmacological effects simultaneously.
Result
The study showed that CR has significant application in Qi stagnation, like depressed liver, stomach, and bowel disorders, etc. in different countries or districts. Aqueous extract, EtOH extract, essential oil, total oligomeric flavonoids and five other extracts were effective constituents displaying pharmacological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, neuroprotective, antihemolytic, and anti-inflammatory effect. 41 kinds of specific components like α-cyperone, nootkatone exhibited corresponding pharmacological activities mentioned above. Different concentrations of ethanol extract, essential oil, decoction of CR and monomer composition like α-cyperone, rotunduside G had anti-depressant effects.
Conclusions
In the present study, we have provided scientific information and research developments on traditional uses, phytochemical compositions and corresponding pharmacological activities, and quality control status on CR. The antidepression effect and its corresponding chemical compositions were generalized separately. The pharmacological activities studies should be more focused on the reflection of traditional clinical values. CR could be a significant potential herbal medicine to develop antidepressant drugs with lower side effects.}

In this work, subcritical water treatment was carried out batch-wise in a stainless tube reactor in the pressure range of 0.792–30.0 MPa, varying the temperature (127–327 °C) and time (1–60 min) of extraction. This resulted in new and green material sources, including organic acids, amino acids, and sugars. Amazingly, at very low extraction times (below 5 min) and high temperatures (above 277 °C), about 99% of HMWs were efficaciously converted to clean products by subcritical hydrothermal treatment. The results of hydrothermal extraction after 5 min indicated that at low temperatures (127–227 °C), the total organic carbon in the aqueous phase increased as the residual solid phase decreased, reaching a peak around 220 °C. Acetone soluble extracts or fat phase appeared above 227 °C and reached a maximum yield of 21% at 357 °C. Aspartic acid, threonine, and glycine were the primary amino acids; glycolic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, and acetic acid were obtained as the main organic acids, glucose, fructose, and cellobiose were substantial sugars produced from the aqueous phase after 5 min of hydrothermal subcritical hydrolysis extraction.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The diabetic wound is one of the common chronic complications of diabetes, which seriously affects patients’ quality of life and even causes disability and death. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a unique and precious resource in China, which has a good curative effect and safety. At present, it has been found that Chinese herbal compounds and effective active ingredients can effectively promote diabetic wound healing, and its mechanism needs to be further studied. Signaling pathways are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic wounds, which is one of the main targets for the pathologic mechanism of diabetic wounds and the pharmacological research of therapeutic drugs.
Aim of the review
This study has been carried out to reveal the classical signaling pathways and potential targets by the action of TCM on diabetic wound healing and provides evidence for its clinical efficacy.
Materials and methods
“diabetic wound”, “diabetic foot ulcer”, “traditional Chinese medicine”, “natural plant” and “medicinal plant”, were selected as the main keywords, and various online search engines, such as PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI and other publication resources, were used for searching literature.
Results
The results showed that TCM could regulate the signaling pathways to promote diabetic wound healing, such as Wnt, Nrf2/ARE, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, Notch, TGF-β/Smad, HIF-1α/VEGF, which maintaining inflammatory interaction balance, inhibiting oxidative stress and regulating abnormal glucose metabolism.
Conclusion
The effect of TCM on diabetic wound healing was reflected in multiple levels and multiple pathways. It is envisaged to carry out further research from precision-targeted therapy, provide ideas for screening the core target of TCM in treating diabetic wounds and create modern innovative drugs based on this target.}

It has a high incidence and disability rate worldwide. However, currently there is still a lack of highly effective treatment methods for COPD, only symptom relief is possible. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new treatment options. Almost all cells can secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), which participate in many physiological activities by transporting cargoes and are associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases. Recently, many scholars have extensively studied the relationship between COPD and EVs, which has strongly demonstrated the significant impact of EVs from different sources on the occurrence and development of COPD. Therefore, EVs are a good starting point and new opportunity for the diagnosis and treatment of COPD. In this review, we mainly describe the current mechanisms of EVs in the pathogenesis of COPD, also the relationship between diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. At the same time, we also introduce some new methods for COPD therapy based on EVs. It is hoped that this article can provide new ideas for future research and contribute to the development of precision medicine.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Qi-Sai-Er-Sang-Dang-Song Decoction (QSD, ཆུ་སེར་སེང་ལྡེང་སུམ་ཐང་།), a Tibetan classical herbal formula, is commonly used in Tibetan hospital preparation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its efficacy is to relieve inflammation, dispel cold, remove dampness, and alleviate pain. However, its anti-RA mechanism is still unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the effect of QSD on rheumatoid arthritis and explore its anti-inflammatory mechanism against human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLSs) by regulating the notch family of receptors (NOTCH1)/Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/nucleotide-binding (NLRP3) pathway.
Materials and methods
We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-TOF mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) to identify the chemical composition of QSD. Then, HFLSs were exposed to drug-containing serum. The effect of QSD drug-containing serum on HFLS viability was detected using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Next, we explored the anti-inflammatory effect of QSD using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-18 (IL-18), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The expression of NOTCH-related proteins, a member of the NOTCH1, Cleaved NOTCH1, hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES-1), NF-κB p65, NF-κB pp65, NLRP3, and delta-like 1 (DLL-1), was examined using western blotting. Furthermore, the relative mRNA expression levels of NOTCH1, NF-κB p65, NLRP3, DLL-1, and HES-1 were detected using real-time quantitative (RT-qPCR). To explore the mechanism underlying the anti-RA effect of QSD, we the used the NOTCH signaling pathway inhibitor LY411575 and transfection with a NOTCH1 siRNA. In addition, we employed immunofluorescence to determine the expression of HES-1 and NF-κB p65 in vitro.
Result
Our results revealed that QSD ameliorated inflammation in HFLSs. Compared with the model group, the QSD drug-containing serum group had obviously down-regulated levels of IL-18, IL-1β, and IL-6. Consistently, the CCK-8 results showed that the QSD drug-containing serum had no obvious toxicity towards HFLSs. Moreover, both LY411575 and siNOTCH1, QSD could reduce NOTCH1, NLRP3, and HES-1 protein expression levels, and LY411575 could significantly inhibit the expression levels of NF-κB p65, NF-κB pp65, and Cleaved NOTCH1 (p < 0.05). siNOTCH1 could also suppress the expression of DLL-1. The RT-qPCR results indicated that QSD could downregulate the relative mRNA expression levels of NOTCH1, NF-κB p65, NLRP3, DLL-1, and HES-1 in HFLSs (p < 0.05). In the immunofluorescence experiment, the fluorescence intensities of HES-1 and NF-κB p65 in HFLSs were found to decrease after exposure to QSD drug-containing serum (p < 0.05). Ultimately, 44 chemical components were detected in QSD using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS.
Conclusion
This study reveals that the QSD can markedly ameliorate inflammation induced by TNF-α on HFLS. The effect of QSD on HFLS may be exerted by inhibition of the NOTCH1/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.}

The emerging discipline of regenerative medicine has significant promise for the treatment of conditions that cannot be cured at the present time. Altering the stem cell microenvironment, also known as the niche, in order to make it easier for the body’s own endogenous stem cells to repair damaged tissue is an alternative therapeutic strategy that is gaining popularity among researchers. Cell transplantation is becoming an increasingly popular method for repairing damaged tissue. This sector of the market is quite dynamic, and there are several prospects for action. These include the administration of small molecules, biologics, or biomaterials that target specific aspects of the niche, such as cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions, in order to stimulate the expansion or differentiation of stem cells, or in order to cause differentiated cells to revert back to stem cell status. Finding cells that are capable of repairing or replacing the function that has been lost in tissues and organs as a result of illness or aging as well as the trophic and immunomodulatory effects is the first problem faced by regenerative medicine. We anticipate that effective therapies in the field of regenerative medicine will require a variety of factor combinations to target stem cells and niche cells. These combinations will be delivered at various periods to affect recovery in accordance with the dynamic of stem cell–niche interactions.}

The Chinese medicine Daji (the aerial part of Cirsium japonicum DC.) and its charred product (Cirsii Japonici Herba Carbonisata) have been widely used as hemostatic agents or diuretic agents to prepare a variety of Chinese herbal formula. Pectolinarigenin (PEC), one of the most abundant constituents in both Daji and its charred product, has been considered as the key effective substance responsible for the major pharmacological activities of Daji, including hemostasis, hepatoprotective, anti-tumor and anti-osteoporosis effects. However, the major metabolic pathways of PEC in humans and the influence of PEC metabolism on its biological activities are poorly understood.
Aim of the study
To characterize the main metabolic pathway(s) and key enzymes of PEC in human biological systems, as well as to reveal the influence of PEC metabolism on its biological activities.
Materials and methods
The metabolic stability assays of PEC were investigated in human liver microsomes (HLM). The O-glucuronide of PEC was biosynthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The key enzymes responsible for O-glucuronidation of PEC in humans were assigned by performing UGT reaction phenotyping, chemical inhibition and enzymatic kinetic assays. The agonist effects of PEC and its O-glucuronide on nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARα and PPARβ) were tested at the cellular level.
Results
PEC could be readily metabolized to form a mono-O-glucuronide in both human liver microsome (HLM) and human intestinal microsome (HIM). The mono-O-glucuronide was bio-synthesized by mouse liver S9 and its structure was fully characterized as PEC-7-O-β-D-glucuronide (PEC-O-7-G). UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 are key enzymes responsible for PEC-7-O-glucuronidation in HLM, while UGT1A1, UGT1A9 and 1A10 may play key roles in this reaction in HIM. Biological tests revealed that PEC displayed strong agonist effects on Nrf2, PPARα and PPARβ, whereas PEC-7-O-glucuronide showed relatively weak Nrf2 agonist effect and very weak PPAR agonist effects, indicating that PEC-7-O-glucuronidation strongly weaken its agonist effects on Nrf2 and PPAR.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that 7-O-glucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway of PEC in human tissues, while UGT1A1, 1A3 and 1A9 are key contributing enzymes responsible for PEC-7-O-glucuronidation in human liver. It is also found that PEC 7-O-glucuronidation significantly weakens the Nrf2 and PPAR agonist effects. All these findings are very helpful for the pharmacologists to deep understand the metabolic rates of PEC in humans.}

abstract = {Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Antenatal corticosteroid administration before preterm birth reduces the risks of perinatal death, respiratory morbidity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage and reduces the costs of perinatal care. Antenatal corticosteroids are optimally effective when administered within 7 days before preterm birth. However, only 20% to 40% of early preterm infants receive antenatal corticosteroids within 7 days before birth, in part because it is difficult to predict the precise timing of preterm birth. Until 2020, The Joint Commission had a Perinatal Care quality metric measuring the rate of antenatal corticosteroid administration at any time before early preterm birth. This metric incentivized providers to use antenatal corticosteroids liberally. The Joint Commission retired the metric in 2020 after the rate reached more than 97% in The Joint Commission–accredited hospitals. However, the metric did not evaluate whether the timing of antenatal corticosteroid administration was optimal, that is, within 7 days of birth. A 2016 multistakeholder Cooperative Workshop recommended the development of a new quality metric to assess the rate of optimally timed antenatal corticosteroids among early preterm births. In this statement, we outline proposed specifications for such a metric and discuss potential uses, advantages, limitations, and barriers. Furthermore, we propose a balancing metric that tracks the percentage of patients treated with antenatal corticosteroids who ultimately give birth at term. We suggest that the use of these new metrics may incentivize more conservative antenatal corticosteroid timing, which could, in turn, lead to meaningfully improved outcomes for preterm neonates.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used as an "immune booster” for disease prevention and clinical treatment since ancient China. However, many studies were focused on the organic herbal extract rather than aqueous herbal extract (AHE; decoction). Due to the COVID-19 pandemics, this study tended to decipher phytochemical contents in the decoction of herbs and derived bioactivities (e.g., anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties). As prior works revealed, the efficacy of Parkinson's medicines and antiviral flavonoid herbs was strongly governed by their bioenergy-stimulating proficiency.
Methods
Herbal extracts were prepared by using a traditional Chinese decoction pot. After filtration and evaporation, crude extracts were used to prepare sample solutions for various bioassays. The phytochemical content and bioactivities of AHEs were determined via ELISA microplate reader. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were used as a novel platform to evaluate bioenergy contents with electron-transfer characteristics for antiviral drug development.
Significant findings
Regarding 18 TCM herbal extracts for the prevention of SARS and H1N1 influenza, comparison on total polyphenol, flavonoid, condensed tannins and polysaccharides were conducted. Moreover, considerable total flavonoid contents were detected for 11 herb extracts. These AEHs were not only rich in phytonutrient contents but also plentiful in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Herbs with high polyphenol content had higher antioxidant activity. Forsythia suspensa extract expressed the highest inhibition against nitric oxide production for anti-inflammation. MFC bioenergy-stimulating studies also revealed that top ranking COVID-19 efficacious herbs were both bioenergy driven and electron mediated. That is, electron transfer-controlled bioenergy extraction was significant to antiviral characteristics for anti-COVID-19 drug development.}

The purpose of the Summer Genetics Scholars Program of the ACMG Foundation for Genetic and Genomic Medicine is to expose medical students to medical genetics and genomics early during school with the aim of increasing the number of physicians pursuing a career in this field. This survey study evaluated the Summer Genetics Scholars Program on the achievement of its goals.
Methods
Former Summer Genetics Scholars who had completed medical school were sent a 13-question survey aimed at evaluating the program and obtaining feedback about their experiences.
Results
Of 125 former scholars, 55 completed the survey with 2 additional participants partially completing the survey. The vast majority of former participants report either being very satisfied or satisfied with their experience (96%).
Conclusion
Whereas most participants found their experience to be beneficial, evaluation of the initial 6 years of the program did not show an increase in the number of students entering residencies in medical genetics and genomics. It likely is too early to assess the program’s true influence on entry into the field because data were only available for the first 6 years of the Summer Genetics Scholars Program, and many residents typically choose to complete another primary specialty before medical genetics and genomics.}

Regarding safety, not only does DET create the uncontested perinatal risks of twin pregnancies, but compelling evidence has added that singleton pregnancies after a vanishing twin also have poorer perinatal outcomes. SET is as effective as DET, as shown by meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, comparing two cycles of SET versus DET and shown by cumulative live birth rates of entire ART trajectories of up to six cycles. Proposing SET, which is safer than DET and as effective, as the gold standard is not irreconcilable with patient-centred care if patients are thoroughly informed on the reasoning behind the proposition and welcomed to challenge whether it fits their personal values. The cost-efficiency of SET is clearly higher, which has even induced certain countries to start reimbursing ART on the condition that SET is used. In conclusion, SET should be the gold standard offered to all patients. The question is not whether to apply SET but how to apply it in terms of patient selection, patient-centred counselling and coverage of treatment.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases affect human health globally. Naoxintong capsules (NXTs), a famous Chinese Patent Medicine, has been especially applied to treat cerebral infarction and coronary heart disease in clinical practice. The anticoagulant activity of this prescription plays an important role in this course of treatment.
Aim of the study
Thrombin and factor Xa (FXa) are two key targets considering the anticoagulant activity. The purpose of this investigation is to screen the quanlity markers as key thrombin and FXa inhibitors for the anticoagulant activity oriented quality control of Chinese patent medicine.
Materials and methods
Simple multi-polar solvent extraction processes using various proportions of solvents were conducted and their thrombin/FXa inhibitory activities were evaluated in vitro. Bivariate correlation analysis (BCA), grey correlation analysis (GCA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) were adopted for screening the potential active markers related to the anticoagulant activity. The chemical structures of these active compounds were identified by UHPLC–Q-TOF-MS/MS and their thrombin/FXa inhibitory activity was determined. The molecular docking technology was applied to explore the interaction between the compounds and targets. The contribution of these anticoagulant active ingredients in NXT was also investigated. Last but not the least, the contents of these markers in NXT were determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method.
Results
The results showed that the NXT extract exhibited great activity against thrombin and FXa, especially extracted by 75% methanol (v/v). Six marker compounds with potential anticoagulant activity were screened out. Therein, four of the active compounds owing thrombin inhibitory activity (paeoniflorin, lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid B, Z-ligustilide) and five of the active compounds owing FXa inhibitory activity (3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, rosmarinic acid, lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid B and Z-ligustilide). In addition, these active compounds accounted for a large proportion of thrombin/FXa inhibitory activity of NXTs. The binding energy also showed the strong interaction formed by close connection of the compounds to the residues of targets.
Conclusions
The proposed integrated stategy could be an efficient strategy to screen potential thrombin/FXa inhibitors for the bioactivity related quanlity control of Chinese patent medicine.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Plants of genus Chrysosplenium have a long history of application and are distributed in many countries, especially in Tibetan regions of China. The genus has been used locally in the treatment of various hepatobiliary diseases such as “Chiba disease” (related to cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, acute icteric hepatitis, and acute liver necrosis in modern medicine).
Aim of the review
This review summarizes and critically analyzes the aspects of the botanical morphology and distribution, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, quality control, and development status of preparations of the genus Chrysosplenium. Moreover, the future research direction and focus of the genus are also discussed. We hope to provide a valuable reference for researchers who are interested in the genus Chrysosplenium.
Materials and methods
The relevant information of the genus Chrysosplenium was gathered through electronic databases from 1968 to 2021, including PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Springer, CNKI, and Wan Fang, as well as PhD, MSc thesis, Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition), Tibetan medicine monographs. In addition, plant names were verified by “The Plant List” (The Plant List Database, http://www.theplantlist.org).
Results
Based on existing studies of chemical compositions, more than 90 compounds have been identified from Chrysosplenium species, including flavonoids, triterpenoids, volatile oils, steroids, alkaloids, and other compounds. The highly hydroxylated and methoxylated flavonoids and triterpenoids are the main active components. In addition, many studies have shown that the extracts and some components isolated from the genus Chrysosplenium have a variety of pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-viral, hepatoprotective, and insecticidal properties. Furthermore, there are only 9 preparations with Chrysosplenium species as one of the medicinal materials. Among these preparations, C. nudicaule is used more and other Chrysosplenium species are rarely involved.
Conclusions
Most medicinal species of Chrysosplenium have not only good therapeutic effects in traditional uses, but also a great potential for development in modern pharmaceutical studies. However, the material basis and mechanism of action of this genus have not been well explained. Therefore, further systematic and comprehensive research on the genus Chrysosplenium is still required to provide a scientific basis for its clinical applications.}

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) had a multidimensional impact on human life. It affects the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) which is a perceived measure of physical and mental health. We estimated the EuroQol utility value for COVID-19 and the associated factors for those managed at Siddha COVID care centres in Tamil Nadu.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted by a telephonic interview of 2000 randomly selected COVID-19 adults tested positive during June 2020 to Jan 2021. We collected sociodemographic, clinical and EQ-5D-5L profile. Mean EQ-5D-5L summary utility values and EQ-VAS scores were estimated. Multivariate regression was used to examine the factors associated with EQ-5D-5L. Study protocol was approved by the Institutional ethics committee of Government Siddha Medical College, Chennai (GSMC–CH–3401/ME-2/050/2021). The committee waived the written informed consent considering the pandemic situation of emerging infectious diseases.
Results
We interviewed 1047 participants. Of the total 68% were males with the median age (IQR) of 38 (29–51) years. The mean EQ-5D-5L utility score and EQ-VAS scores are 0.98 ± 0.05 and 92.14 ± 0.39 respectively. COVID-19 asymptomatic group reported a mean utility score of 0.99 ± 0.03 which is relatively more than the symptomatic group (0.97 ± 0.06),. EQ-VAS score was also reported high among the asymptomatic (95.45 ± 5.95) than the symptomatic (91.40 ± 8.69COVID-19.
Conclusion
The severity of illness and the comorbidity are significantly associated with a low HRQoL of COVID-19 patients.}

In addition to effects as a direct result of these hazards, indirect epidemiological, social, political, and economic effects of climate change are also probable and can be expected to contribute to the dynamics of disaster in societies under climate-related stress. Decisions regarding energy infrastructure will also affect disaster risk. There is a long history of industrial disasters involving carbon-intensive energy systems based on coal, oil, and gas, while renewable systems bring both opportunities for resilience and new challenges. Disaster medicine professionals have a key role to play in addressing effects of climate change as they occur. Direct effects are well studied, and the potential risk trajectories for these hazards can now be integrated into long-term planning in many locations. Though indirect effects such as changes in disease burden, civil strife, and human mobility are more difficult to characterize and predict, they have substantial implications. The practice of disaster medicine in a changing climate requires an approach guided by the best available scientific evidence and a willingness to adjust to changing risks and risk projections as they evolve.}

How do medical providers determine which data are relevant to patient care, which are irrelevant, and which may be inappropriately used to justify potentially harmful interventions? One of the most prominent medical fields to address these questions head on – clinical genomics – is actively debating how to assess the value of genomic data. In-depth interviews with clinicians and a content analysis of policy documents demonstrate that while many clinicians believe that collecting as much patient data as possible will lead to better patient care, a sizeable minority of clinicians preferred to collect less data. These clinicians worried that large genomic tests provided too much data, leading to confusion and inappropriate treatment. Clinical geneticists have also started developing the concept of “actionability” to assess which types of genomic data are worth collecting and interpreting. By classifying data as useful when it can or should lead to action, clinicians can formalize and institutionalize what types of data should be ignored. But achieving consensus about what counts as “actionable” has proven difficult and highlights the different values and risk philosophies of clinicians. At the same time, many clinicians are fighting against the ignorance arising from genomic databases predominantly filled with samples from European ancestry populations. Debates about how and when to institutionalize ignorance of health data are not unique to clinical genomics, but have spread throughout many fields of medicine. As the amount of health data available to clinicians and patients grows, social science research on the politics of knowledge and ignorance should inform debates about the value of data in medicine.}

abstract = {Although much of the foundational basic scientific and clinical research was conducted in the United States, the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) birth occurred in the United Kingdom. Why? For centuries, all research surrounding the field of “reproduction” has elicited bipolar passionate responses by the American public, and the issue of “test tube babies” has been no different. The history of conception in the United States is defined by complex interrelationships among scientists, clinicians, and politically charged decisions by various branches of the US government. With a focus on research in the United States, this review summarizes the early scientific and clinical advances important to the development of IVF and then addresses the potential future developments in IVF. We also consider what future advances are possible in the United States given the current regulations, laws, and funding.}

abstract = {Background
Bailing Capsule (BLC), Jinshuibao (JSB), Huangkui Capsule (HKC), Uremic Clearance Granule (UCG), Tripterygium glycosides (TG), Compound Xueshuantong Capsule (CXC), and Shenyan Kangfu Tablet (SYKFT) as classic Chinese patent medicines (CPMs), have been widely used and shown beneficial effects on the treatment of early diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the comparative efficacy of seven CPMs in the treatment of early DKD remains unknown.
Objective
To evaluate and compare the efficacy of seven CPMs (BLC, JSB, HKC, UCG, TG, CXC, SYKFT) combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on early DKD by a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods
A comprehensive and systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Clinical Trials.gov, China Biology Medicine, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal, and Wanfang databases from inception to March 14, 2021, for full-text RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of seven CPMs combined with ACEI/ARB on patients with early DKD. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Agreement between reviewers was measured using kappa statistics. Mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) were calculated to evaluate continuous variables and dichotomous, respectively. The random effect modeling NMA was performed and the ranking probability of interventions in various outcomes was also conducted based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Begg’s and Egger’s tests were used to evaluate publication bias. The certainty of the evidence for outcomes was evaluated according to the GRADE system.
Results
A total of 62 RCTs with 5362 patients with early DKD were identified. The value of Kappa calculated for the various parameters extracted by the two investigators was 0.821 (P < 0.001). Among these CPMs, UCG + ACEI/ARB showed the best effectiveness for urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) (MD 32.25, 95% CrI 19.11–45.67, low certainty) with SUCRA 92%. JSB + ACEI/ARB showed the highest effectiveness for 24-h urinary total protein (24-h UTP) (MD 76.92, 95% CrI 53.54–100.58, low certainty) with SUCRA 97%. CXC + ACEI/ARB showed the highest effectiveness for serum creatinine (SCr) (MD 26.02, 95% CrI 6.10–45.95, low certainty) with SUCRA 96%. HKC + ACEI/ARB showed the highest effectiveness for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (MD 1.46, 95% CrI 0.42–2.54, very low certainty) with SUCRA 86%. BLC + ACEI/ARB showed significant differences in triglyceride (TRIG) (MD − 1.17, 95% CrI − 1.93 to − 0.43, low certainty) with SUCRA 90%, total cholesterol (TC) (MD − 1.17, 95% CrI − 1.97 to − 0.39, very low certainty) with SUCRA 90%, and C-reaction protein (CRP) (MD − 0.90, 95% CrI − 1.51 to − 0.32, very low certainty) with SUCRA 76%.
Conclusions
CPMs + ACEI/ARB might be positive efficacious interventions from which patients with DKD will derive benefit. UCG + ACEI/ARB, JSB + ACEI/ARB, CXC + ACEI/ARB, and HKC + ACEI/ARB might be potentially the preferred intervention for reducing UAER, 24-h UTP, SCr, and BUN levels, respectively. BLC + ACEI/ARB has a better impact on lowing TRIG, TC, and CRP levels in patients with early DKD. However, more high-quality, large-scale, multi-center RCTs and stronger head-to-head trials are required to confirm these findings.}

The purpose of this study and method was to improve clinical diagnosis by providing a simple Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool to increase efficiency and accuracy in clinical diagnostics, while reducing misdiagnosis. We used a classification scheme for oral lesion image classification based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Convolutional networks are considered the state-of-the-art technique for classification problems when the input is high-dimensional data such as images. At the first training batch we used two lesions in lichen planus, mucocele, for proof of concept, our testing model achieved an accuracy of 84.9% in lichen planus recognition and 76.02% for mucocele. The purpose of this study was to create and apply an Artificial Intelligence tool (Oromed AI®) to aid in oral medicine diagnostics. For proof of concept to train the AI system and show it can work we chose mucocele and lichen planus and then we will add additional conditions. Methods: Our dataset comprised 1089 high and medium resolution images of oral lesions consisting of 558 labeled as mucocele and 531 as lichen planus. These images are taken by clinical experts in oral medicine and pathology with training in intraoral photography. Images for which there was a disagreement between pathologists were discarded. We used a classification scheme for the clinical images of oral lesions based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Results: Convolutional networks are considered the state-of-the-art technique for classification of problems when the input is high-dimensional data such as images, and CNN proved useful in our AI modeling. Our testing model and Oromed AI software achieved an accuracy of 84.9% in lichen planus recognition and 76.02% for mucocele. Conclusions: AI can aid in oral medicine diagnosis by providing rapid real-time analyzing capability to assist clinicians in diagnostics. AI is not meant to replace gold standard diagnosis such as biopsy and histopathologic examination, but rather serve as a clinical adjunct or tool for aiding in initial differential diagnosis.}

We model the costs and benefits of providing these services in a multi-period setting for healthcare payers and providers compared to a central planner baseline model. We also consider how patients’ risk level and potentially shorter skilled nursing facility stays can increase the benefit of these services. While many payers worry that reimbursing for question response services will cause excessive payouts, we find that payers would benefit from providing a per-call subsidy to providers to incentivize optimal question response service staffing levels. We also find that payers could provide a per-patient subsidy for patients discharged early from skilled nursing facilities that would more than cover the costs of providing the question response service for all patients. These models are grounded in data and multiple discussions with regional home health providers that provide these question response services.}

Species-specific safety limits for As and Cd based on health risk assessment are an effective measure for the safety of PN consumption. To decrease the uncertainty of risk assessment, the gastrointestinal bioaccessibilities of As and Cd in PN, the influence of pharmaceutical processes, and individual variations in the dosage and duration of PN preparations were introduced for probabilistic health risk estimation. The As and Cd concentrations in PN materials from three major medicinal material markets were in the ranges of 0.11–1.26 and 0.07–1.97 mg/kg, respectively. The gastrointestinal bioaccessibilities of As and Cd in PN determined by an in vitro experiment were 64.7 ± 3.9% and 84.1 ± 10.1%, respectively. There was almost no noncarcinogenic health risk; however, long-term consumption of the PN preparation may induce 3.53% of consumers to have carcinogenic risks exceeding 1 × 10−4. The safety limits of As and Cd in PN were then determined to be 1.5 and 3.6 mg/kg, respectively, based on this acceptable carcinogenic risk level. Furthermore, the bioaccumulation of As and Cd in PN and their impacts on pharmaceutical components were studied based on our investigation in 19 PN plantations in major production areas. The safety limits of As and Cd in the soils were thus determined to be 5.5 and 7.3 mg/kg, respectively. The establishment of species-specific safety limits for commonly used herbal medicine was proposed because current standards cannot ensure the safe usage of PN.}

Practice consolidation is common and has been shown to affect the quality and cost of care across multiple health care delivery settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, and physician practices. Despite a long history of large practice management group formation in emergency medicine and intensifying media attention paid to this topic, little is known about the recent practice consolidation trends within the specialty.
Methods
All data were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Physician Compare database, which contains physician and group practice data from 2012 to 2020. We assessed practice size changes for both individual emergency physicians and groups.
Results
From 2012 to 2020, the proportion of emergency physicians in groups sized less than 25 has decreased substantially from 40.2% to 22.7%. Physicians practicing in groups of more than or equal to 500 physicians increased from 15.5% to 24%.
Conclusion
Since 2012, we observed a steady trend toward increased consolidation of emergency department practice with nearly 1 in 4 emergency physicians nationally working in groups with more than 500 physicians in 2020 compared with 1 in 7 in 2012. Although the relationship between consolidation is likely to draw the most attention from policymakers or payers seeking to negotiate prices in the near term and advance payment models in the long term, greater attention is required to understand the effects of practice consolidation on emergency care.}

To assess the effect of long-run changes in the drugs included in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) on mortality in Thailand.
Methods
Using longitudinal data on many diseases, I estimate difference-in-differences (2-way fixed effects) models to investigate whether diseases for which there were larger increases in the number of NLEM drugs had larger subsequent reductions (or smaller increases) in mortality. This design controls for the effects on mortality of general economic and societal factors (e.g. income, education, and behavioral risk factors), to the extent that those effects are similar across diseases.
Results
The addition of drugs to the NLEM between 2003 and 2014 reduced the number of years of potential life lost before age 75 in 2016 by about 650 thousand. The addition of a new (post-2002) drug for a disease to the NLEM is estimated to have reduced the number of deaths from that disease two years later by 25%, while the addition of an old (pre-2003) drug is estimated to have reduced the number of deaths two years later by 5%.
Conclusion
The expansion of the NLEM reduced the number of deaths and the number of years of potential life lost before ages 75 and 65 2–5 years later. A preliminary estimate of pharmaceutical expenditure per life-year before age 75 gained in 2016 from drugs added to the NLEM between 2003 and 2014 is 888 USD.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Non-exclusive voluntary licensing that is access-oriented has been suggested as an option to increase access to medicines to address the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, there has been little research on the effect of licensing, mainly focused on economic and supply chain considerations, and not on the benefits in terms of health outcomes. We aimed to study the economic and health effect of voluntary licensing for medicines for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Methods
A robust modelling framework was created to examine the difference between scenarios, with (factual) and without (counterfactual) a Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) licence for two medicines, dolutegravir and daclatasvir. Data were obtained from MPP licensees, as well as a large number of external sources. The primary outcomes were the cost savings and health impact between scenarios with and without MPP licences across all LMICs. Through its licences, MPP had access to the volumes and prices of licensed generic products sold in all covered countries on a quarterly basis. These data informed the volumes, prices, and uptake for the past factual scenarios and were the basis for modelling the future factual scenarios. These scenarios were then compared with a set of counterfactual scenarios in the absence of the studied licences.
Findings
Cumulatively, between 2017 and 2032, the model's central assumptions predicted an additional uptake of 15·494 (range 14·406–15·494) million patient-years of dolutegravir-based HIV treatments, 151 839 (34 575–312 973) deaths averted, and US$3·074 (1·837–5·617) billion saved through the MPP licence compared with the counterfactual scenario. For daclatasvir-based HCV treatments, the cumulative effect from 2015 to 2026 was predicted to be an additional uptake of 428 244 (127 584–636 270) patients treated with daclatasvir, 4070 (225–6323) deaths averted, and $107·593 (30·377–121·284) million saved with the licence compared with the counterfactual scenario.
Interpretation
The chain of effects linking upstream licensing to downstream outcomes can be modelled. Accordingly, credible quantitative estimates of economic and health effects arising from access-oriented voluntary licensing were obtained based on assumptions that early generic competition leads to price reductions that influence procurement decisions and enable the faster and broader uptake of recommended medicines, with beneficial economic and health effects.

abstract = {Background
Various forms of value-based pricing policies for new medicines have recently been introduced in OECD countries. While these initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on societal outcomes such as availability, affordability and value for money, scientific evidence on this impact is scarce due to confidential agreements.
Objective
We aimed to assess the impact of value-based policy interventions in price negotiations on patient benefit in an experimental setting.
Methods
An online experiment was conducted (n = 269). Participants were randomly assigned into the active role of either a buyer or seller in two intervention groups (cost-benefit, risk-sharing) and one control group. Decisions had real monetary consequences on other participants and through donations to a patient association.
Results
Patient access, benefit and value for money were higher in the cost-benefit group than in the risk-sharing group. An available alternative to the agreement led to higher price offers. This effect was weaker in the cost-benefit group.
Conclusions
Outcomes of price negotiations on patient benefit depend on the alternatives available for failed or delayed negotiations. A shared but voluntary valuation framework might increase patient access, benefit, and value for money. The cost containment effect of risk-sharing agreements may be offset by the negative impact on overall patient benefit. Further development of the approach could provide support for policy design of pharmaceutical pricing regulations.}

abstract = {Background
Diabetes mellitus-related coronary heart disease (DM-CHD) is the most common cause of death in diabetic patients. Various studies have shown that Chinese medicine Fufang-Zhenzhu-Tiaozhi capsule (FTZ) has therapeutic effects on cardiovascular diseases. More research is required to determine the mechanism of FTZ protection against coronary atherosclerosis.
Objective
To investigate the unique mechanism of FTZ in treatment of DM-CHD minipigs with coronary atherosclerosis.
Methods
High-fat/high-sucrose/high-cholesterol diet combined with streptozotocin and coronary balloon injury were used to induce DM-CHD minipig model, which was then randomly divided into: DM-CHD model, DM-CHD treated with FTZ or positive drug (Metformin + Atorvastatin, M+A). After twenty-two weeks, ultrasonography, electrocardiography, and image detection were employed to detect cardiac functions and assess coronary artery stenosis and plaque. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated high glucose or/and FTZ. Pigs tissues and treated-cells were collected for further testing.
Results
In DM-CHD minipigs, FTZ treatment significantly reduced disordered glycolipid metabolism similar as M+A administration. FTZ and M+A also alleviated coronary stenosis and myocardial injury. In addition, IκB and NF-κB phosphorylation levels, as well as the protein levels of IL-1β, Bax, cleave-Caspase 3, Bcl-2, and α-SMA were dramatically increased in the DM-CHD coronary artery, whereas CD31 and VE-cadherin expressions were decreased. Similar to M+A, FTZ reversed these protein levels in the DM-CHD coronary artery. Furthermore, FTZ ameliorated the damage and high migration activity of HUVECs induced by high glucose.
Conclusions
FTZ improves coronary atherosclerosis through modulating inflammation, alleviating apoptosis, and inhibiting EndMT of coronary artery to protects against DM-CHD.}

There is considerable interest in applying this approach to treatments designed to slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, effective disease-modifying treatment (DMT) remains the greatest unmet therapeutic need in this field. In contrast to the enormous progress in oncology, precision medicine in the field of neurodegeneration faces multiple challenges. These are related to major limitations in our understanding of many aspects of the diseases. A critical barrier to advances in this field is the question of whether the common sporadic neurodegenerative diseases (of the elderly) are single uniform disorders (particularly related to their pathogenesis) or whether they represent a collection of related but still very distinct disease states. In this chapter, we briefly touch on lessons from other fields of medicine that might be applied to the development of precision medicine for DMT in neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss why DMT trials may have failed to date, and particularly the importance of appreciating the multifaceted nature of disease heterogeneity and how this has and will impact on these efforts. We conclude with comments on how we can move from this complex disease heterogeneity to the successful application of precision medicine principles in DMT for neurodegenerative diseases.}

However, the underlying scientific principles of processing have remained largely unknown, hindering the development of TCM. This study examined Crataegi Fructus, which has four processed products (raw, fried, charred, and carbonized), as an example to investigate the processing mechanisms that cause differences in their clinical use. The differences between the four processed products were analyzed in terms of physical properties and chemical compositions using a metallographic microscope, scanning electron microscope, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The study also proposed a new method for investigating processing mechanisms using near-infrared spectroscopy with Aquaphotomics. The results showed that there were significant differences after processing, with a loose and porous structure formed, and the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural content increased. Additionally, raw Crataegi Fructus was found to promote an active hydrogen-bonded network, which may account for the circulation-promoting effect, while carbonized Crataegi Fructus formed a stable hydrogen-bonded network structure, thus exerting its hemostatic effect. The scientific principle of “Carbonized-processing promoting hemostatic effect” in the processing of TCM was first revealed by Aquaphotomics in this study, providing a valuable reference for future studies on the processing mechanisms of TCM.}

abstract = {Introduction
The Exceptional Responders Initiative (ERI) at the National Cancer Institute attempts to correlate unusually good outcomes in patients with cancer with genetic targets in tumors and the therapies the patients received. It is not known if other factors might contribute to exceptional responses or outcomes. We explored aspects of the medical history, lifestyle changes, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and communication between health care practitioners and patients who experienced an exceptional response following cancer treatment.
Methods
All subjects whose case was submitted to the ERI were eligible to participate in the survey. A 121-question survey questionnaire was developed to assess aspects of the subject's past medical history, lifestyle (e.g., diet, exercise, spirituality) and use of CAM.
Results
Thirty subjects completed and returned the questionnaire from approximately 88 patients invited to participate (approximate response rate = 34%). Approximately 68% were female and 32% were male. Fifty percent of subjects changed their diet after their cancer diagnosis. Eighteen patients (60%) reported using a CAM therapy (not including oral vitamins/minerals or spiritual practices) during their Exceptional Response (ER).
Conclusion
Multiple factors, including features of the tumor itself, the patient, or the environment, could affect tumor response or patient survival, either solely or in combination with the treatments received. Many patients use other medications, change their diet or physical activity or use CAM interventions after their cancer diagnosis. Investigators attempting to understand the exceptional response phenomenon should acquire rich data sets of their subjects that include information about these factors.}

the biomedical model of medicine was replaced by the biopsychosocial model in order to better accommodate psychological and social aspects of illness. The introduction of machine learning techniques provides the perspective of truly personalized medicine. This poses new challenges to our medical model.
Aim
to explore the implications of personalized medicine for the biopsychosocial model.
Methods
scholarly reflection.
Results
The ability of machine learning technology to integrate a wide diversity of data makes it possible to develop predictive models for presentation, course and treatment response in individual patients. Such models are based on individual risk factors and protective factors that may have diverging influences in different individuals. In a medical model adjusted to accommodate the possibilities of personalized medicine, it should be possible to highlight the importance and impact of each single factor in each individual patient. At present, the biopsychosocial model is not well prepared for this. When adopting machine learning technology in clinical practice, new skills and expertise will be required from physicians. They should be able to weigh and explain algorithms supported decisions to their patients. Moreover, new research should be designed in such a way that data will be suited for machine learning and can be integrated with existing databases in order to increase their size and scope.
Conclusion
Currently, the biopsychosocial model is not well prepared to accommodate the possibilities of personalized medicine. Adaptations are needed to deal with the highly individual aspects of the patient's disease.}

In the Amazon rainforest, the shamans of the Mayantuyacu site use the healing virtues of decoctions and teas from different parts of the Couroupita guianensis Aubl. (Lecythidaceae) trees as remedies in Ashaninka medicine. However, composition of the remedy and the underlying mechanism remain unclear.
Aim of the study
This study was designed to compare the metabolite profile of Couroupita guianensis bark decoction produced by Amazonian shamans with that obtained under standardised laboratory conditions and to investigate biological properties of both decoction and isolated constituents in skin wound healing process and inflammation.
Materials and methods
The chemical analyses were carried out by Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with UV and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry detectors (UHPLC-UV-HRMS). 1D and 2D-NMR experiments were performed to identify the main decoction constituents. The decoction and pure compound effect on keratinocyte migration was determined by the in vitro wound healing model; the mechanism of action was elucidated by western blot analysis.
Results
UHPLC-UV-HRMS analysis revealed the occurrence of polyphenolic compounds as catechins, ellagitannins and, notably, of unusual sulphated derivatives of ellagic acid isolated for the first time from Couroupita guianensis bark. A new natural sulphated molecule [4-(2″-O-sulphate- β-D-glucuronopyranosyl) ellagic acid] was identified as the potential active compound responsible for the efficacy of bark decoction stimulating wound healing in human HaCaT keratinocytes. The molecular mechanism involved the induction of pro-migratory pathways mediated by ERK and AKT phosphorylation and the increase of MMP2 expression in HaCaT cells. At the same time, the treatment inhibited inflammation interfering with NFkB activation.
Conclusion
Beyond identifying a new bioactive compound, the overall results scientifically validate the traditional use of Couroupita guianensis bark decoction as an anti-inflammatory remedy. Moreover, the beneficial effects on keratinocytes suggest promising therapeutic applications in skin diseases.}

abstract = {Introduction
When using Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) to treat endometriosis, the effects of CHM on the ovarian function have received little attention. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects and safety of CHM on the ovarian function in patients with endometriosis.
Methods
Eight electronic databases were searched from their inception to March 2, 2021. We compared those receiving CHM with controls, all studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statistical analysis was performed using standard mean difference of hormonal levels: Estradiol(E2), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH). Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted.
Results
A total of 844 patients from 11 RCTs were included. In E2 levels, the analysis revealed a significant effect in favor of CHM group compared with the control group (SMD = 3.05, 95%CI = 0.29 to 1.32, P = 0.002). After subgroup analyses, there were still significant effects in both non-operative subgroup (SMD = 2.04, 95%CI = 0.04 to 1.88, P = 0.04) and post-operative subgroup (SMD = 2.19, 95%CI = 0.08 to 1.42, P = 0.03). There were no significant differences between the two subgroups in both FSH levels (P > 0.05) and LH levels (P > 0.05), and the subgroup analyses showed similar results. No adverse events were reported.
Conclusions
CHM may improve ovarian function in patients with endometriosis through increasing E2 levels whether there is surgery or not, which may indicate a referable and safe treatment for endometriosis. Due to the weak evidence, high-quality clinical trials are needed to support this conclusion. (PROSPERO ID is CRD42021240162)}

Lagotis integra W. W. Smith (L. integra W. W. Smith) is an important origin plant of the famous Tibetan medicine HERBA LAGOTIS. It was documented to treat “Chi Ba” disease clinically, the symptoms of which are similar to ulcerative colitis (UC).
Aims of this study
To screen out the active components and study the mechanisms of L. integra W. W. Smith treating UC.
Materials and methods
The components of L. integra W. W. Smith were comprehensively analyzed using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS method. The mechanisms were investigated using network pharmacology method including target prediction, protein-protein interaction network analysis and gene enrichment analysis. Then, the mechanisms were verified using Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced UC model. Finally, the core active components were further screened out through molecular docking.
Results
The results showed that 32 major components were identified including 8 flavonoids, 9 phenylpropanoid glycosides, 13 iridoid glycosides and 1 phenolic acid. 76 potential core therapeutic targets and top 5 key targets, which were AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and caspase-3 (CASP3), were screened out according to network pharmacology analysis. Animal experiments confirmed that those compounds could downregulate the expression levels of the 5 key target proteins in colonic tissue of mice to exert excellent anti-UC effect. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components were echinacoside, hemiphroside B, plantamajoside, plantainoside D, 10-O-trans-isoferuloyl catalpol and scutellarioside II.
Conclusions
For the first time, our study provides insights into the effective materials and molecular mechanisms of L. integra W. W. Smith treating UC, which contributes to the understanding of its pharmacodynamics.}

abstract = {Background
It is estimated that approximately 50% of patients with diabetes use some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to manage their condition.
Objectives
The objective of this study was to undertake a systematic review to explore factors that influence the use of CAM by diabetic patients.
Methods
A systematic review of literature was conducted using Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. Nine databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 2010 to March 2021 using medical subject headings and natural language keywords. Data in relation to factors associated with use of CAM in diabetic patients 18 years of age and older were extracted and further categorised as per the theoretical domains framework (TDF).
Results
Forty-three studies from 28 countries were included. A total of 84 factors were identified. Key factors related to the ‘intentions (to treat and relieve symptoms) and goals’ domain of the TDF. Accessibility and affordability compared to physician visits and modern medicines (TDF- environmental context and resources), ‘Social influences’ from family members, friends, religious and spiritual scholars were amongst other factors reported to be important. Users also reported lack of trust in modern medicines and perceived CAMs to be safer and free from adverse effects.
Conclusions
Decisions to use CAM in diabetes are multifactorial. Healthcare professionals' awareness of patients' CAM use and associated factors can inform counselling practices and promote treatment optimisation, adherence and patient safety through avoidance of drug-CAM interactions. Alleviating patients’ concerns and reluctance to use prescribed treatments are imperative to achieve therapeutic goals. Improving access and affordability is imperative where high costs prevent use of prescribed medicines leading to many patients using CAM as a standalone therapy.

There are multiple kinds of disorders due to many reasons involving road accidents, tumors, infections, and various other diseases. The accessories in podiatric medicine include the components of prostheses, orthosis, and implants. These accessories were earlier made by the conventional subtractive methods of manufacturing, but accuracy, cost, and time constraints in these methods were observed. 3D Printing (3DP) is a more effective way of making the accessories of podiatric medicine due to the ease of making the complex shapes which here depends upon the anatomical features of various patients. This short chapter discusses the various classifications of the accessories and recent advancements in 3DP.}

abstract = {Precision medicine (PM), a paradigm that seeks to understand and address interindividual differences in health and disease, including the differentiation of one's biological and environmental factors, has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. Sex and gender characteristics are among the most important determinants of health and need to be taken into consideration when designing strategies for pandemic management. Artificial intelligence–driven technologies play a crucial role in advancing PM by enabling the identification of biomedically relevant patterns from vast amounts of health data, leading to individually tailored preventative and restorative interventions. However, despite significant scientific advances in the field, most currently used biomedical AI technologies do not adequately account for sex and gender differences, resulting in potentially biased outcomes that can have far-reaching negative implications. The impact of biases during the pandemic in data collection, analysis, and deployment using AI-driven technologies is examined, focusing on how these biases can impact the health outcomes of vulnerable populations. Finally, a holistic and intersectional approach is outlined, which recognizes the importance of sex and gender differences in health and disease and integrates them into the design and utilization of biomedical AI technologies, crucially advancing PM and achieving equitable and effective healthcare outcomes and pandemic management.}

abstract = {Biomarker testing has increasingly been adopted in oncology for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes. Several tumor types undergo reflexive biomarker testing, including immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing (NGS), to screen for hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes and identify optimal treatment regimens. Routine clinical biomarker testing, however, does not identify less common hereditary cancer syndromes, which instead requires comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). This report describes the case of a patient with occupational exposure to asbestos who developed peritoneal mesothelioma and experienced a dramatic response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Shortly thereafter, he was diagnosed with metastatic sinonasal melanoma. The uncommon co-occurrence of these two primary malignancies prompted analysis of the patient’s mesothelioma by CGP, which identified a pathogenic BAP1 splice site mutation (c.438-1G > A, NM_004656.4, 71 % allele frequency). The melanoma was subsequently evaluated using a clinical NGS panel and found to harbor the same mutation (84 % allele frequency), strongly suggesting that the pathogenic variant is present in the patient’s germline (diagnostic of BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome). These results enabled recommendation of germline testing and suggestion of active clinical trials of targeted therapy to the treating physician, highlighting the important role of CGP in the delivery of precision medicine.}
