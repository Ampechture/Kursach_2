abstract = {Introduction
In recent years, with the advancement of life sciences, the theories of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been scientifically elucidated, particularly the integration of the TCM theory of "the lung and large intestine are interrelated" and the modern scientific theory of the "lung-gut axis". The theory emphasizes the close relationship between the lung and gut, with the lung-gut microbiota, metabolites and mucosal immunity acting as bridges.
Methods
Databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), ScienceDirect, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were used for search of literature by keywords such as “Traditional Chinese medicine”, “Gut Microbiota”, "Metabolites", “Mucosal Immunity”, and “Respiratory Diseases” and so on, and articles were selected according to their credibility and impact and then reviewed.
Results
TCM has made significant progress in the treatment of respiratory diseases based on the lung-gut axis theory. TCM can repair damaged intestinal mucosal barriers, maintain the stability of the lung-gut microbiota and related metabolites, improve mucosal immune function, and thereby reduce the incidence of respiratory system diseases.
Discussion
TCM can maintain intestinal homeostasis through multi-target and multi-pathway, thereby improving the clinical symptoms of respiratory diseases. TCM therapy based on the lung-gut axis theory is a new direction for exploring new treatment methods.}

Some patients may opt for Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) of their own free will. However, there is no real-world evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of CHM. We aimed to explore the effectiveness of CHM for DKD in comparison to ARBs. We enrolled 732 DKD patients (72 used only CHM and 661 used ARBs) from 2007 to 2016, and all patients were followed until December 2016 at China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan. A total of 355 ARB users and 71 CHM users were analyzed after propensity score matching. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after treatment was 84.9 ± 28.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 in CHM users, which was higher than that (67.8 ± 35.4 ml/min/1.73 m2) in ARB users (p < 0.001). The change in the eGFR was −6.0 ± 21.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 in CHM users and −12.9 ± 24.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 in ARB users (p = 0.029). The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels of patients taking CHM were 22 ± 16 mg/dl and 0.9 ± 0.4 mg/dl, respectively, and were lower than those (30 ± 28 mg/dl and 1.7 ± 2.0 mg/dl) of patients taking ARBs (p = 0.025 and p = 0.003). Using linear regression with adjustments for age, sex, BMI, baseline eGFR, and HbA1c levels, we found that the declines in the eGFR/baseline eGFR and changes in the urine albumin–creatinine ratio (ACR) were comparable between the two groups (p = 0.86 and 0.73). This study suggests that CHM may have comparable effectiveness to ARBs, which provides insights for further investigations.}

In the present study, we confirmed the anti-inflammation effect of Daruqi on inflammation induced by LPS using animal models. Then, THP-1 cells treated with LPS was used as a positive control to explore the effective component of Daruqi on inflammation. We identified that Oxymatrine was the essential effector of Daruqi. Furthermore, the mechanism of Oxymatrine on inflammation was verified through proteomics analyses and validation assays. Our results demonstrated that Oxymatrine significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokine, including IL-8, IL-1α, and IL-1β, in LPS induced THP-1 cells. Based on tandem mass tag −labeled quantitative proteomics, 428 differentially expressed proteins were screened, involved in TNF signaling pathway, Ferroptosis, IL-17 signaling pathway, etc. Among these differential expressed proteins (DEPs), 23 proteins were verified with parallel reaction monitoring analysis. The results showed that LPS treatment potentiated the protein level of PLEK, ACSL5 and CYBB, which could be reversed by Oxymatrine. By contrast, the protein expression of SPRYD4 and EMR2 was suppressed after LPS treatment, which could be rescued by Oxymatrine. In summary, Oxymatrine has excellent protective effects in LPS induced THP-1 cells. The five proteins, including PLEK, ACSL5, CYBB, SPRYD4 and EMR2, might serve as the targets of Oxymatrine, and as candidates regulating inflammation in future therapies.}

To determine medical school characteristics that may result in graduates entering the specialty of public health and general preventive medicine (PH&GPM), the authors conducted an analysis comparing the presence of affiliated preventive medicine residency programs and combined Master of Public Health degree programs with the likelihood of graduates entering the specialty of PH&GPM.
Methods
Using data from the American Board of Preventive Medicine and publicly available information on medical schools and residencies, in spring 2022, the authors compared medical schools that produced PH&GPM physicians with the presence of a PH&GPM residency program, the presence of any preventive medicine residency (public health and general preventive medicine or occupational medicine or aerospace medicine), and the presence of a combined Doctor of Medicine‒Master of Public Health or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine‒Master of Public Health program.
Results
Between 2017 and 2021, there were 385 physicians newly board certified in PH&GPM, 210 medical schools, and 75 preventive medicine residencies. The 385 physicians graduated from 110 of the 210 medical schools. Analyses showed statistically significant associations between medical schools that graduated PH&GPM physicians and the presence of PH&GPM residencies (OR=3.74; 95% CI=1.61, 8.69), all preventive medicine residencies (OR=2.75; 95% CI=1.37, 5.51), and combined degree programs (OR=4.37; 95% CI=2.45, 7.79).
Conclusions
Because PH&GPM residency programs affiliated with medical schools are a significant factor associated with PH&GPM physicians obtaining board certification, such analyses may provide critical guidance in the utilization of resources intended to produce more physicians certified in this specialty.}

abstract = {Background
Anticoagulants are the main drugs used for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. Currently, anticoagulant drugs are primarily multitarget heparin drugs, single-target FXa inhibitors and FIIa inhibitors. In addition, some traditional Chinese drugs also have anticoagulant effects, but they are not the main direction of treatment at present. But the anticoagulant drugs mentioned above, all have a common side effect is bleeding. Many other anticoagulation targets are under investigation. With further exploration of coagulation mechanism, how to further determine new anticoagulant targets and how to make traditional Chinese medicine play anticoagulant role have become a new field of exploration.
Purpose
The purpose of the study was to summarize the recent research progress on coagulation mechanisms, new anticoagulant targets and traditional Chinese medicine.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using four electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang database and ClinicalTrials.gov, from the inception of the study to 28 Feb 2023. Key words used in the literature search were “anticoagulation”, “anticoagulant targets”, “new targets”, “coagulation mechanisms”, “potential anticoagulant”, “herb medicine”, “botanical medicine”, “Chinese medicine”, “traditional Chinese medicine”, “blood coagulation factor”, keywords are linked with AND/OR. Recent findings on coagulation mechanisms, potential anticoagulant targets and traditional Chinese medicine were studied.
Results
The active components extracted from the Chinese medicinal herbs, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Chuanxiong rhizoma, safflower and Panax notoginseng have obvious anticoagulant effects and can be used as potential anticoagulant drugs, but the risk of bleeding is unclear. TF/FVIIa, FVIII, FIX, FXI, FXII, and FXIII have all been evaluated as targets in animal studies or clinical trials. FIX and FXI are the most studied anticoagulant targets, but FXI inhibitors have shown stronger advantages.
Conclusion
This review of potential anticoagulants provides a comprehensive resource. Literature analysis suggests that FXI inhibitors can be used as potential anticoagulant candidates. In addition, we should not ignore the anticoagulant effect of traditional Chinese medicine, and look forward to more research and the emergence of new drugs.}

abstract = {Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, a plant widely used in traditional medicine, is known for its array of biological activities. A key bioactive compound, geniposide (GE), an iridoid glycoside, significantly contributes to the medicinal properties of the plant, with potential side effects. Thus, a reliable and efficient method for GE detection is required to ensure the quality of medicinal-grade G. jasminoides Ellis. This study developed such a method by first synthesizing GE–bovine serum albumin conjugates to function as immunizing agents in mice. This led to the production of a monoclonal antibody (mAb 3A6) against GE from the fusion of splenocytes from immunized mice with myeloma cells (P3U1), resulting in a hybridoma that produces mAb 3A6. Thereafter, we developed a mAb 3A6-based indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA). The icELISA exhibited satisfactory sensitivity (0.391–12.5 μg/ml) and repeatability (coefficients of variation <10%). The accuracy of this method was validated through a spike-recovery assay (recovery of 101–112%). Furthermore, the icELISA was employed to determine the GE content in plant and Kampo medicine samples. The GE content positively correlated with those determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet. The proposed icELISA is rapid, cost-effective, and reliable for high-throughput GE detection in G. jasminoides Ellis, thereby contributing to the improved quality control and standardization of this valuable medicinal plant.}

abstract = {Background
To explore the underlying molecule mechanism of herbal medicine in preventing ventricular remodeling (VR), we take a herbal formula that is clinically effective for preventing VR as an example, which composed of Pachyma hoelen Rumph, Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz., Cassia Twig and Licorice. Due to multi-components and multi-targets in herbal medicine, it is extremely difficult to systematically explain its mechanisms of action.
Methods
An innovative systematic investigation framework which combines with pharmacokinetic screening, target fishing, network pharmacology, DeepDDI algorithm, computational chemistry, molecular thermodynamics, in vivo and in vitro experiments was performed for deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms of herbal medicine for treating VR.
Results
ADME screening and SysDT algorithm determined 75 potentially active compounds and 109 corresponding targets. Then, systematic analysis of networks reveals the crucial active ingredients and key targets in herbal medicine. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis identifies 33 key regulators during VR progression. Moreover, PPI network and biological function enrichment present four crucial signaling pathways, i.e. NF-κB and TNF, PI3K-AKT and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways involved in VR. Besides, both molecular experiments at animal and cell levels reveal the beneficial effect of herbal medicine on preventing VR. Finally, MD simulations and binding free energy validate the reliability of drug-target interactions.
Conclusion
Our novelty is to build a systematic strategy which combines various theoretical methods combined with experimental approaches. This strategy provides a deep understanding for the study of molecular mechanisms of herbal medicine on treating diseases from systematic level, and offers a new idea for modern medicine to explore drug interventions for complex diseases as well.}

abstract = {Summary
The high failure rate of clinical trials in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) is due to a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, and this deficit may be addressed by applying artificial intelligence (AI) to “big data” to rapidly and effectively expand therapeutic development efforts. Recent accelerations in computing power and availability of big data, including electronic health records and multi-omics profiles, have converged to provide opportunities for scientific discovery and treatment development. Here, we review the potential utility of applying AI approaches to big data for discovery of disease-modifying medicines for AD/ADRD. We illustrate how AI tools can be applied to the AD/ADRD drug development pipeline through collaborative efforts among neurologists, gerontologists, geneticists, pharmacologists, medicinal chemists, and computational scientists. AI and open data science expedite drug discovery and development of disease-modifying therapeutics for AD/ADRD and other neurodegenerative diseases.}

abstract = {Background
Osteoporosis is a chronic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and increased risk of fracture. In Taiwan, Guilu Erxian Jiao (GEJ) is the commonly used formula of Chinese herbal medicines for patients with osteoporosis. However, the effect of GEJ on subsequent fractures in the long term is unclear. This is the first long-term case-control study of the effects of GEJ on the rates of fracture in patients with osteoporosis.
Methods
We collected data from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2019 from the Chang Gung Research Database. We interpreted from the reports of DXA to confirm whether the patients met the criteria for osteoporosis (T score ≤ -2.5). Eighty-five patients were enrolled in the GEJ group. After two propensity score matchings, 425 patients were identified as the non-GEJ group. We assessed four outcomes to confirm the effects of GEJ in patients with osteoporosis, including the change in the T-score, new occurrences of fractures, cumulative rate of fracture, and how many doses of GEJ need to be administered to effectively reduce fractures
Results
There was no significant difference in either the improvement in the T score or the 5-year overall fracture (p = 0.335) between these two groups. At the fracture-prone sites, the fracture in lumbar vertebrae was less in the GEJ group (p = 0.034). A total of 600 GEJ pills are required to effectively reduce the incidence of fractures (p value= 0.0039).
Conclusions
Patients who take at least 600 GEJ pills would have a decreased fracture risk at fracture-prone sites.}

This study aims to assess students' knowledge of forensic medicine concepts and their opinions regarding the course taught during the degree course in Medicine and Surgery in an Italian university. Consequently, the study aims to assess the impact of the course on the students’ knowledge and attitude in choosing a medical residency.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted through an anonymous web-based survey of medical students at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. Descriptive and univariate analysis were conducted.
Results
1166 students completed the survey. The forensic medicine course appears to be extremely important in providing training in the fundamental concepts of forensic medicine, especially professional liability, defensive medicine, and forensic pathology. Attending autopsies is important during the course, and their number should be more than ten. Additionally, univariate analysis demonstrates that students' awareness of forensic medicine topics, such as the function of the forensic physicians, professional liability, and defensive medicine, improves in the fifth or sixth year of the course. After the course, more students would choose to pursue a nonclinical and nonsurgical specialty, and forensic medicine specifically, for their residency.
Conclusions
The forensic medicine course has the task of defining the duties and responsibilities of forensic physicians, providing indispensable tools for future medical practitioners, regardless of their future specialisation, and limiting the increasing use of defensive medicine. In conclusion, we recommend further multicenter studies to evaluate the role and direct effect of undergraduate forensic medicine courses on students and on the quality of practice.}

To develop and test a post competency scale for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians undergoing standardized training to provide an applicable tool for scientific evaluation.
Methods
Based on literature analysis, behavioral event interviews, and expert consultations, measurement questions were formulated and the initial scale was designed. A questionnaire survey was conducted from July 2022 to May 2023 among TCM physicians undergoing standardized training in China. The rationality of the scale was confirmed through item purification, factor analysis, and tests of reliability and validity.
Results
The post competency scale consisted of three dimensions (TCM fundamentals and research abilities, TCM thinking and skill abilities, and personal traits and communication abilities) with 21 items. Exploratory factor analysis identified three common factors, accounting for a cumulative variance contribution rate of 62.165%. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the fit indices of the three-factor model fell within a relatively ideal level. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.885. Through convergent validity analysis, the standardized loading coefficients of the 21 items were >0.5, and the average extracted variance (AVE) of the three factors was also >0.5. Moreover, the square roots of the AVE values for each dimension exceeded the correlation coefficients between it and the other dimensions.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that the post competency scale of TCM physicians undergoing standardized training can provide a reliable scientific basis for training and assessment within China.}

abstract = {Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, imposing an enormous economic burden on individuals and human society. Laboratory studies have identified several drugs that target mitophagy for the prevention and treatment of CVD. Only a few of these drugs have been successful in clinical trials, and most studies have been limited to animal and cellular models. Furthermore, conventional drugs used to treat CVD, such as antiplatelet agents, statins, and diuretics, often result in adverse effects on patients' cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory systems. In contrast, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained significant attention for its unique theoretical basis and clinical efficacy in treating CVD.
Purpose
This paper systematically summarizes all the herbal compounds, extracts, and active monomers used to target mitophagy for the treatment of CVD in the last five years. It provides valuable information for researchers in the field of basic cardiovascular research, pharmacologists, and clinicians developing herbal medicines with fewer side effects, as well as a useful reference for future mitophagy research.
Methods
The search terms "cardiovascular disease," "mitophagy," "herbal preparations," "active monomers," and "cardiac disease pathogenesis" in combination with "natural products" and "diseases" were used to search for studies published in the past five years until January 2024.
Results
Studies have shown that mitophagy plays a significant role in the progression and development of CVD, such as atherosclerosis (AS), heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI), cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia. Herbal compound preparations, crude extracts, and active monomers have shown potential as effective treatments for these conditions. These substances protect cardiomyocytes by inducing mitophagy, scavenging damaged mitochondria, and maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. They display notable efficacy in combating CVD.
Conclusion
TCM (including herbal compound preparations, extracts, and active monomers) can treat CVD through various pharmacological mechanisms and signaling pathways by inducing mitophagy. They represent a hotspot for future cardiovascular basic research and a promising candidate for the development of future cardiovascular drugs with fewer side effects and better therapeutic efficacy.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Vitamin D analogues are the first-line topical agents for the long-term management of psoriasis. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) bath therapy is commonly employed for psoriasis. However, the effects and safety of CHM bath therapy for psoriasis vulgaris, using topical calcipotriol as the comparator, remain inconclusive. Furthermore, the combination of herbs, a distinctive feature of CHM, is essential for its therapeutic effects due to the individual and synergistic properties of the herbs involved.
Aim of the study
The review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CHM bath therapy for psoriasis vulgaris, using calcipotriol as the comparator. Potential herbs and herb combinations of CHM bath therapy were also explored for further drug discovery.
Materials and methods
Nine databases were searched from inception until March 05, 2024. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating CHM bath therapy, using calcipotriol as the comparator, were included. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4, Stata 12.0 and SPSS Clementine 12.0 software. The evidence certainty for outcomes was assessed using the approach proposed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. Moreover, association rule analysis on herbs identified in the systematic review was conducted to explore the potential herbs and herb combinations.
Results
A total of 17 RCTs involving 1,379 participants were included in this systematic review. The findings of this review revealed that: 1) CHM bath therapy produced comparable effects to calcipotriol in reducing Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI), and itch visual analogue scale (VAS) at the end of the treatment phase; as well as exhibited a superior long-term effect than calcipotriol through decreasing relapse rates at the end of the follow-up phase; 2) CHM bath therapy showed an additional benefit when combined with calcipotriol in managing psoriasis vulgaris at the end of the treatment phase, in terms of PASI, PSSI, itch VAS, IL-17, IL-23, CD3+ and CD4+ T cells. The certainty of the evidence was rated as ‘very low’, ‘low’ or ‘moderate’ based on the GRADE assessment, considering some concerns or high risk of bias of included studies, substantial heterogeneity, and existing publication bias of some outcomes. Additionally, the proportions of participants reporting adverse events were similar in both groups. Association rule analysis of all included herbs identified 23 herb combinations including Prunus persica (L.) Batsch and Carthamus tinctorius L., as well as 11 frequently used herbs, such as Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad., Dictamnus dasycarpus Turcz. And Sophora flavescens Ait.
Conclusions
The effects of CHM bath therapy were comparable with those of topical calcipotriol but demonstrated a longer-lasting effect. Combining CHM bath therapy with calcipotriol also provided an additional benefit for adult psoriasis vulgaris. However, the certainty of the evidence was downgraded due to the methodological limitations of included studies. To confirm the findings of this review, future investigations should involve double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCTs. Importantly, it appears worthwhile to consider further research for drug development utilising the identified herbs or herb combinations.}

Qu's formula 3 (QUF3) is a patented Chinese herbal medicine used to alleviate anxiety disorders during in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). This study aimed to identify the potential active constituents and molecular mechanisms of action of QUF3 in alleviating anxiety disorders during IVF-ET.
Methods
The active constituents of QUF3 were identified from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform and literatures. Potential targets of anxiety disorder and IVF-ET were identified using GeneCards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and the UniProt Database. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to identify the potential mechanisms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to visualize and verify the results.
Results
Quercetin, sophoranol, luteolin, kaempferol, and neurotoxin inhibitors were identified as the TOP 5 active constituents of QUF3. Forty common targets were shared among QUF3, anxiety disorders, and IVF-ET. Tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor A, epidermal growth factor, interleukin-1B, cellular tumour antigen p53, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and oestrogen receptor were identified as the TOP 8 potential targets through PPI analysis. A total of 697 biological processes, 20 cellular components, and 54 molecular functions were identified. Further, 91 KEGG pathways were revealed to be enriched. The TOP 5 active constituents were verified to have good binding activity with the TOP 8 potential targets using molecular docking and MD simulations.
Conclusions
The mechanism of QUF3 in alleviating anxiety disorders in patients undergoing IVF-ET may be related to the interleukin-17 and tumour necrosis factor signalling pathways, inhibiting inflammatory responses and antioxidants, which may provide a solid foundation for the clinical application and further study of QUF3.}

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common psychiatric disorder in women after childbirth. Per data from epidemiologic studies, PPD affects about 5%–26.32% of postpartum mothers worldwide. Biological factors underlying this condition are multiple and complex and have received extensive inquiries for the roles they play in PPD. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), which is widely used as a complementary and alternative therapy for neurological disorders, possesses multi-component, multi-target, multi-access, and low side effect therapeutic characteristics. CHM has already shown efficacy in the treatment of PPD, and a lot more research exploring the mechanisms of its potential therapeutic effects is being conducted.
Aim of the review
This review provides an in-depth and comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms of PPD, as well as samples the progress made in researching the potential role of CHM in treating the disorder.
Materials and methods
Literature was searched comprehensively in scholarly electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CNKI and WanFang DATA, using the search terms “postpartum depression”, “genetic”, “hormone”, “immune”, “neuroinflammation”, “inflammation”, “neurotransmitter”, “neurogenesis”, “brain-gut axis”, “traditional Chinese medicine”, “Chinese herbal medicine”, “herb”, and an assorted combination of these terms.
Results
PPD is closely associated with genetics, as well as with the hormones, immune inflammatory, and neurotransmitter systems, neurogenesis, and gut microbes, and these biological factors often interact and work together to cause PPD. For example, inflammatory factors could suppress the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin by inducing the regulation of tryptophan-kynurenine in the direction of neurotoxicity. Many CHM constituents improve anxiety- and depression-like behaviors by interfering with the above-mentioned mechanisms and have shown decent efficacy clinically against PPD. For example, Shen-Qi-Jie-Yu-Fang invigorates the neuroendocrine system by boosting the hormone levels of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axes, regulating the imbalance of Treg/T-helper cells (Th) 17 and Th1/Th2, and modulating neurotransmitter system to play antidepressant roles. The Shenguiren Mixture interferes with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway to enhance the number, morphology and apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampus of PPD rats. Other herbal extracts and active ingredients of CHM, such as Paeoniflorin, hypericin, timosaponin B-III and more, also manage depression by remedying the neuroendocrine system and reducing neuroinflammation.
Conclusions
The pathogenesis of PPD is complex and diverse, with the main pathogenesis not clear. Still, CHM constituents, like Shen-Qi-Jie-Yu-Fang, the Shenguiren Mixture, Paeoniflorin, hypericin and other Chinese Medicinal Formulae, active monomers and Crude extracts, treats PPD through multifaceted interventions. Therefore, developing more CHM components for the treatment of PPD is an essential step forward.}

Korean medicine, a form of complementary medicine, has been systematically established in Korea, and related national statistical data are being produced. The aim of this study was to derive a developmental strategy for complementary medicine by investigating the willingness of inpatients and outpatients to recommend Korean medicine as well as their intention to revisit.
Methods
Data from 1010 outpatients and 904 inpatients included in the 2017 Korean Medicine Utilization and Herbal Medicine Consumption Survey were analyzed. The correlations between revisit intention, willingness to recommend, and variables including demographic characteristics, medical use, and satisfaction were measured using the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis.
Results
Male, single, and non-capital area users were less likely to revisit and make recommendations. Users who were dissatisfied with the attitude of Korean medicine doctors, attitude of employees, facility conditions, treatment results, medical expenses, and explanation of treatments had fewer intentions for future use and recommendations. Cupping, pharmacopuncture, and Chuna manual therapy were positively correlated with the intention to revisit and recommend Korean medicine.
Conclusion
Satisfaction with treatment results was the most widely affecting variable, and satisfaction with facility conditions was an important determinant. Employee attitudes were a determinant of their willingness to recommend treatment.}

In recent years, several trials have explored the treatment of premature ovarian insufficiency using Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture, but the efficacy and safety of this combination remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining Chinese herbal medicine with acupuncture to treat premature ovarian insufficiency. From eight different databases, we retrieved randomized controlled trials wherein Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture had been compared with western medicine in the treatment of premature ovarian insufficiency. The bias risk assessment stipulated by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool was utilized to evaluate the quality of the chosen randomized controlled trials. This meta-analysis was executed with the help of Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 10.0. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. A total of 10 randomized controlled trials involving 594 premature ovarian insufficiency patients were included in the analysis. Compared with western medicine, co-treatment with acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine exhibited a significantly higher total effective rate (relative risk: 1.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.12–1.31; P < 0.01, I2 = 0%), but lower levels of luteinizing hormone (standardized mean difference: −0.57; 95% confidence interval: −1.06, −0.08; P < 0.05, I2 = 80%), follicle-stimulating hormone, and Kupperman index score. Moreover, the combined intervention increased estradiol level in the serum. Overall, the data demonstrate that acupuncture plus Chinese herbal medicine is an efficacious and safe treatment option for POI patients. These findings must be verified by conducting large-scale, multicenter, high-quality, and long-term randomized controlled trials.}

But there is still a long way to totally cure these diseases. TCM has been used to treat various joint diseases for thousands of years in Asia. In this review, we summarize clinical efficacies of TCM in inflammatory arthritis treatment after reviewing the results demonstrated in meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical trials. We pioneered taking inflammatory arthritis-related cell targets of TCM as the entry point and further elaborated the molecular targets inside the cells of TCM, especially the signaling pathways. In addition, we also briefly discussed the relationship between gut microbiota and TCM and described the role of drug delivery systems for using TCM more accurately and safely. We provide updated and comprehensive insights into the clinical application of TCM for inflammatory arthritis treatment.

abstract = {Introduction
Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) encompasses utilization of traditional approaches in treating illnesses. The literature on CAM in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) shows varying awarness and practice. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards CAM in the UAE.
Methods
The study utilized a cross-sectional design and collected data between January and March 2023 from adults in the UAE. Using convenience sampling, participants were invited to participate from public areas. A total of 964 individuals participated in the study by filling the survey electronically. Data were collecting using the CAM knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) questionnaire. This study received ethical approval from Research Ethics and Integrity Committee at the Higher Colleges of Technology.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 31.32 years (+-10.66). The majority of the participants were Emirati (89.5 %), female (71.6 %), married (54.4 %) and held a bachelor's degree (40.4 %). Data on CAM knowledge showed that 66.7 % of the participants recognized CAM, mostly from family and friends (38 %). More than half (56.5 %) of the participants recognized the types of CAM, with Hijama as the most well known type. The majority of the participants (80.1 %) had a positive attitude toward CAM practice. Separated participants were 3.187 times less likely to exhibit positive attitude toward CAM than single participants (OR = -3.187., 95 %CI [.005, 0.345]) and Muslims were 3.517 times more likely to exhibit positive attitude toward CAM (OR = -3.517., 95 %CI [4.717, 240.673]). Moreover, 39.3 % of the participants tried CAM mostly to relieve pain (54.8 %). There was a significant correlation between age and knowledge about CAM (r = 0.147, p < 0.001) and between knowledge and attitude toward CAM (r = 0.149, p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between attitude toward CAM and knowledge about Hijama (r = 0.136, p < 0.001), acupuncture (r = 0.192, p < 0.001), dietary supplements (r = 0.180, p < 0.001), and herbal medicine (r = 0.161, p < 0.001).
Conclusion
In the UAE, there is considerable knowledge and acceptance of CAM. Recommendations are geared toward the involvement of healthcare professionals in CAM prescription and control. Community awareness about CAM is recommended to bridge the gap between safety, risks and benefits.}

They are famous for their local knowledge about the traditional use of medicinal plants to treat various diseases. The “Kem-kem” traditional medicine is one of the traditional healing practices that involve using plants passed down through generations from their ancestors. One of the plant genus group in the Rutaceae family utilized in the traditional “Kem-kem” healing practice is a citrus known as “Rimo”. This study aims to document the local knowledge about the diversity of Citrus spp. as Kem-kem's herbal medicinal plant. This study was conducted from April to July 2023 in the Kabanjahe and Berastagi districts, Karo Regency, North Sumatra. Data was collected using interviews with traditional healers, herbal medicine vendors, and direct observations at traditional markets, involving a total of 8 Citrus spp. The Karo uses “Rimo” with different local names as sources of traditional medicinal ingredients in practicing “Kem-kem”. There are 15 local names comprising eight species of Citrus. Four are hybrids, i.e., Citrus x aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle, Citrus × aurantium L, Citrus × junos Siebold ex Yu.Tanaka, and Citrus × taitensis Risso. Two of the remaining species are recognized in infraspecific rank, one variety (Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis (Hoola van Nooten) Swingle) and one form (Citrus × aurantium f. deliciosa (Ten.) M.Hiroe). They were used as material sources for Kem-kem traditional medicine to treat at least nine health problems. There are two species with six local names included in the Least Concern (LC) category, namely C. medica (Rimo Gawang, Rimo Hantuantu, Rimo Kayu), C. medica var. sarcodactylis (Rimo Kuku Harimau), and C. medica (Rimo Telur Buaya), C. maxima (Burm.) Merr. (Rimo Malem). Nine local names are included in the Not Evaluated (NE) category, namely C. × junos (Rimo Kejaren), C. × taitensis (Rimo Jungga), C. × aurantium f. deliciosa (Rimo Keling), C. × aurantium (Rimo Kersik), Citrus hystrix DC.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic intestinal disease of unknown cause and has been classified as one of the modern intractable diseases by the World Health Organization (WHO). Ferroptosis, as an iron-ion-dependent mode of programmed cell death, is closely related to iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and imbalance of the antioxidant system, and plays an important role in the development of UC. In this paper, we will review the regulatory pathways of ferroptosis, the relationship between ferroptosis and the pathogenesis of UC, and the treatment of UC by TCM from the perspective of ferroptosis inhibition, and summarize the mechanism of action of the active ingredients of TCM and TCM compounds to improve UC through ferroptosis inhibition, and look forward to the prospect of the application of ferroptosis inhibition by TCM in the treatment of UC.
Aim of this review
This paper aims to elucidate the mechanism of action of TCM active ingredients and TCM combinations in the treatment of UC by inhibiting ferroptosis. The active ingredients of TCM have the significant advantages of multi-targets and multi-pathways, and ferroptosis is the current research hotspot in the prevention and treatment of UC, so the inhibition of ferroptosis by TCM is a key direction for future research.
Materials and methods
The keywords “ferroptosis”, “ulcerative colitis” and “TCM” were searched in Pubmed, CNKI, and Wed of Science databases. Papers related to clinical trials and pharmacological research up to August 2023 were screened for inclusion. Combined with the theory of TCM, we systematically summarized the effects of TCM active ingredients and TCM combinations in inhibiting ferroptosis and thus preventing UC.
Results
A large number of studies have shown that TCM active ingredients and TCM combinations inhibit the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in the course of UC mainly by interfering with iron metabolism, correcting lipid metabolism and peroxidative accumulation, and regulating the processes of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), to improve colonic mucosal damage and promote the repair of colonic mucosal tissue.
Conclusion
Since the study of ferroptosis in UC is still in the exploratory stage, many issues still deserve attention in the future. This paper reviews the mechanism of ferroptosis inhibition by TCM active ingredients and TCM combinations to prevent and treat UC. In the future, we should also further increase the number of clinical experimental studies to explore whether more TCM medicines can play a therapeutic role in UC by inhibiting ferroptosis, and explore more pathways and genes targeting the inhibition of ferroptosis, to seek more TCM therapies for UC. We believe that the use of TCM active ingredients and TCM combinations to regulate ferroptosis is an important direction for future UC prevention and treatment.}

We began to offer the online pathology elective for Academic Year 2022–2023. Using the online free service of PathElective, this course provided a valuable exposure to pathology with multiple modules in anatomic, clinical, and digital/molecular pathology, before and after assessments, recorded videos by pathology experts, handouts, and reading assignments. During the first week, three introductory modules were required followed by weeks 2–4, in which the students would complete a total of 10 modules of their own choice. In total, 14 students participated in this virtual rotation from August 2022–May 2023. All chose cardiac pathology as the most popular module. Three of the 14 students matched into pathology residencies. This small cohort of 4th year medical students at our osteopathic medical school successfully completed a virtual elective rotation with the resources of PathElective.

abstract = {Background
Almost 100 novel cancer medicines have been approved in Europe over the last decade. Limited public health care resources in countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) call for a prioritization of access to effective medicines. We investigated how both reimbursement status and waiting time to reimbursement correlate with the magnitude of clinical benefit provided by novel medicines in four selected countries (Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia).
Materials and methods
A total of 124 indications of 51 cancer medicines with marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency in 2011-2020 were included and followed up until 2022. Data on reimbursement status and waiting time to reimbursement (i.e. time from marketing authorization to national reimbursement approval) were collected for each country. Data were analyzed in relation to clinical benefit status (i.e. substantial versus nonsubstantial clinical benefit) of indications according to the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS).
Results
The degree of reimbursement differed between countries with 64% of indications with reimbursement in Czechia, 40% in Hungary, 51% in Poland, and 19% in Slovakia. In all countries, a significantly greater proportion of indications with a substantial clinical benefit was reimbursed (P < 0.05). The median waiting time to reimbursement ranged from 27 months in Poland to 37 months in Hungary. No significant differences in waiting time in relation to clinical benefit were observed in any country (P = 0.25-0.84).
Conclusions
Cancer medicines with a substantial clinical benefit are more likely to be reimbursed in all four CEE countries. Waiting times to reimbursement are equally long for medicines with or without a substantial clinical benefit, indicating a lack of prioritization of fast access to medicines delivering a substantial benefit. Incorporation of the ESMO-MCBS in reimbursement assessments and decisions could aid in better utilization of limited resources to deliver more effective cancer care.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine and dermatology brings additional challenges related to bias, transparency, ethics, security, and inequality. Bias in AI algorithms can arise from biased training data or decision-making processes, leading to disparities in health care outcomes. Addressing bias requires careful examination of the data used to train AI models and implementation of strategies to mitigate bias during algorithm development. Transparency is another critical challenge, as AI systems often operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand how decisions are reached. Ensuring transparency in AI algorithms is vital to gaining trust from both patients and health care providers. Ethical considerations arise when using AI in health care, including issues such as informed consent, privacy, and the responsibility for the decisions made by AI systems. It is essential to establish clear guidelines and frameworks that govern the ethical use of AI, including maintaining patient autonomy and protecting sensitive health information. Security is a significant concern in AI systems, as they rely on vast amounts of sensitive patient data. Protecting these data from unauthorized access, breaches, or malicious attacks is paramount to maintaining patient privacy and trust in AI technologies. Lastly, the potential for inequality arises if AI technologies are not accessible to all populations, leading to a digital divide in health care. Efforts should be made to ensure that AI solutions are affordable, accessible, and tailored to the needs of diverse communities, mitigating the risk of exacerbating existing health care disparities. Addressing these challenges is crucial for AI's responsible and equitable integration in medicine and dermatology.}

abstract = {Background
Overall, the potential utility of iVR technology in orthopaedic surgery is promising. The attitudes of medical students and surgical trainees on VR simulated surgical training have been overwhelmingly positive. However, further research and understanding of the attitudes of practicing orthopaedic surgeons and Fellows are needed to appreciate its benefits for clinical practice.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess the attitudes of Canadian orthopaedic surgeons and Fellows on the value of iVR for surgical training, clinical practice, and distance learning.
Methods
Forty-three orthopedic surgeons and Fellows attended a VRthrscopy™ Knee Module (Conmed Corporation, Largo, USA) demonstration. The view and audio from the lead headset were cast to a large screen so the audience could follow the procedure in real-time. Immediately after the presentation, the audience members were given a paper questionnaire assessing their perceptions and attitudes toward iVR or use in orthopaedic learning, clinical practice and distance education and mentoring.
Results
iVR was perceived to be valuable for the field of orthopaedic surgery. All 13 questions were rated with mean Likert scores of five or greater indicating observed value for all 13 questions. The respondents indicated that iVR had value (score of 5 or greater) in each questionnaire domain, with agreement ranging from 78-98% for teaching and learning, 66-97% for clinical practice, and 88-100% for distance education and mentoring questions.
Conclusion
This study has demonstrated that a group of Canadian sport medicine orthopedic surgeons and Fellows had favourable attitudes towards, and perceived that iVR has value in, orthopaedic surgical training, clinical practice, and distance learning and mentorship. The potential for utilizing iVR technology for distance learning, mentorship and global education appears promising.}

abstract = {Aim
This study aimed to determine the attitudes of patients with type 2 diabetes toward insulin treatment and complementary alternative medicine and to examine the relationship between them.
Method
A cross-sectional design was used in the study. A total of 293 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The study data were collected by using a Descriptive Information Form, Complementary, Alternative and Conventional Medicine Attitude Scale (CACMAS), and the Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale (ITAS). The factors related to the attitudes of patients with type 2 diabetes toward insulin were examined by using multiple linear regression analysis.
Results
It was determined that 36.5% of the patients used CAM, 49.8% received insulin therapy, and that 38.6% received oral antidiabetic treatment. Patients' mean score on the total CACMAS was 106.8 ± 19.7, indicating a moderately positive attitude. Their mean score on the total ITAS was 57.1 ± 11.6, suggesting that they had a negative attitude toward insulin therapy. In regular drug use, negative attitudes toward insulin decreased (β = −0.151, p < 0.001), and when dissatisfaction with conventional medicine increased, negative attitudes toward insulin increased, as well (β = −0.432p<0.05).
Conclusion
While almost all of the patients (93.9%) had a negative attitude toward insulin, they had a moderately positive attitude toward the use of CAM. A significant portion of them (36.5%) stated that they used CAM. There was a weak positive correlation between attitude toward CAM and negative attitude toward insulin.

In addition, inhalation technology, which is an active area of research and innovation to deliver medications via the lung to the bloodstream, offers potential advantages such as rapid onset of action, enhanced bioavailability, and reduced side effects for local treatments. Certain inhaled macromolecules and particles can also end up in different organs via lymphatic transport from the respiratory epithelium. While the majority of research on inhaled medicines is focused on the delivery technology, particle engineering, combination therapies, innovations in inhaler devices, and digital health technologies, researchers are also exploring new pharmaceutical technologies and strategies to prolong the duration of action of inhaled drugs. This is because, in contrast to most inhaled medicines that exert a rapid onset and short duration of action, long-acting inhaled medicines (LAIM) improve not only the patient compliance by reducing the dosing frequency, but also the effectiveness and convenience of inhaled therapies to better manage patients’ conditions. This paper reviews the advances in LAIM, the pharmaceutical technologies and strategies for developing LAIM, and emerging new inhaled modalities that possess a long-acting nature and potential in the treatment and prevention of various diseases. The challenges in the development of the future LAIM are also discussed where active research and innovations are taking place.}

abstract = {Background
Acute gouty arthritis (AGA) is an inflammatory joint disease with a high prevalence. Typical medical interventions, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine and glucocorticoids, can have serious adverse reactions. Huzhang Granule (HZG), a compound Chinese herbal medicine, has been used to treat AGA for more than 30 years with satisfactory effects and no significant adverse reactions. However, the efficacy and safety of HZG in AGA patients remains unknown.
Objective
The present investigation was designed to examine the efficacy and safety profile of HZG in managing AGA patients.
Design, setting, participants and interventions
The current study was conducted as a noninferiority, randomized controlled clinical trial on 180 eligible enrolled participants. Participants were randomly assigned into the HZG and etoricoxib groups. Treatments were administered for 5 d, during which the HZG group received HZG and placebo etoricoxib, while the etoricoxib group received etoricoxib and placebo HZG in the same ratio (1:1).
Main outcome measures
The primary outcome was pain experienced by the patient in the gout-afflicted joint from days 2 to 5 of the treatment window. The pain level was measured via a visual analogue scale, ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm. The secondary outcomes comprised joint tenderness and swelling, reduction of inflammatory biomarkers, and the patient’s and investigator’s global evaluations of therapeutic response.
Results
The mean reduction in pain was −51.22 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], [−53.42, −49.03] mm) for the HZG and −52.00 mm (95% CI, [−54.06, −49.94] mm) for the etoricoxib groups. The mean difference between the two groups was 0.78 mm (95% CI, [−2.25, 3.81] mm). All additional efficacy endpoints, covering decreased inflammation and pain relief, yielded compelling proof of noninferiority. Patients in the HZG group exhibited a comparatively lower rate of adverse events compared to those in the etoricoxib group (4.44% vs 13.33%; P ≤ 0.05).
Conclusion
HZG and etoricoxib groups demonstrated similar levels of analgesic effectiveness. The safety and efficacy of HZG indicates that it can be used as a potential therapeutic option for treating AGA.

A thorough and systematic review of registered clinical trials on herbal medicine implemented in the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 is lacking today. This article aims to sum up the characteristics of registered clinical trials of COVID-19 in India using Alternative and Complementary Systems of Medicines as an intervention. Analyses of this data can help point the direction in which current research is heading in terms of medicinal plants included in the preparation of herbal medications to aid phytochemical-based antiviral drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
The thorough search of the registered clinical trials data from March 2020 to February 2021 for COVID-19 has been performed involving Alternative and Complementary Systems of Medicines as an intervention. Extracted data were critically analyzed and in silico evidence for antiviral activity of these medicinal plants against SARS-CoV-2 was gathered and reported.
Results
Of the 228 clinical trials of Alternative and Complementary System of Medicines retrieved from the CTRI database, interventions were mostly immunomodulators and antiviral agents. Critical analysis of phytoconstituents of interventions shows recurrent presence of 21 medicinal plants in these trials. In silico studies point towards their antiviral ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion
Discoveries from this study gave an idea about the future COVID-19 contemplates & trials and phytopharmaceuticals that can be considered for further research in this direction.}

abstract = {Background
Noninferiority trials are increasingly common in cardiovascular medicine, but their reporting and interpretation are challenging, particularly when an absolute risk difference is used as noninferiority margin.
Objectives
This study aimed to investigate the effect of using absolute rather than relative noninferiority margins in cardiovascular trials.
Methods
We reviewed noninferiority trials presented at major cardiovascular conferences from 2015 to 2022 and published within the same period. Based on the actual versus anticipated event rates in the control group, we recalculated the absolute noninferiority margin and re-assessed the trial results. The primary outcome of interest was the proportion of trials with a different interpretation after recalculation. Additionally, we analyzed the conclusion statements of these trials to determine if cautionary notes for the interpretation of study results were included.
Results
We analyzed a total of 768 trials, of which 88 had a noninferiority design and 66 used an absolute noninferiority margin. Of 48 comparisons from 45 trials qualifying for the analysis, 11 (22.9%) had divergent results after recalculation of the absolute noninferiority margin based on the observed rather than anticipated event rate. Ten trials originally claiming noninferiority, did not meet it after the margin recalculation. All of them did not include statements suggesting cautionary interpretation of the study results in the conclusion section. Compared with the other trials, these displayed a larger median difference between anticipated and recalculated noninferiority margins (44.7% [IQR: 38.6%-56.7%] vs 15.3% [IQR: −1.5% to 28.9%]; P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Recalculating noninferiority margins based on actual event rates, rather than anticipated ones, led to different outcomes in approximately 1 out of 4 cardiovascular trials, with most divergent trials lacking cautionary interpretation. These findings emphasize the importance of using or supplementing the relative noninferiority margin, particularly in studies with significant deviations between observed and expected event rates. This underscores the critical need for enhanced methodological and reporting standards in noninferiority trials, especially those employing absolute margins.}

MIRI has been shown to be closely associated with circadian rhythm disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are a key component in the maintenance of normal cardiac function, and new research shows that mitochondria have circadian properties. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), as a traditional therapeutic approach characterised by a holistic concept and evidence-based treatment, has significant advantages in the treatment of MIRI, and there is an interaction between the yin-yang theory of TCM and the circadian rhythm of Western medicine at various levels. This paper reviews the clinical evidence for the treatment of MIRI in TCM, basic experimental studies on the alleviation of MIRI by TCM through the regulation of mitochondria, the important role of circadian rhythms in the pathophysiology of MIRI, and the potential mechanisms by which TCM regulates mitochondrial circadian rhythms to alleviate MIRI through the regulation of the biological clock transcription factor. It is hoped that this review will provide new insights into the clinical management, basic research and development of drugs to treat MIRI.}

Many studies in recent years have focused on so-called “emerging micropollutants” emanating from domestic activity and found primarily in cleaning products, cosmetics, and medicines. This awareness of potential risks to the natural environment has evolved considerably since the 1970s. Sustained population growth in urban areas has forced public policy makers to pay more attention to the links between health and the environment, and specifically to the complexity of medicine consumption. Using a practice theory approach, this article aims to identify how sustainable daily medicine consumption practices are. Our research is based on the analysis of medicine consumption in relation to four interdependent elements: prescription, treatment, unused medication, and representations of environmental issues. First, the background of practice theory and sustainable medicine consumption are discussed. This approach is then applied to quantitative data from a questionnaire survey on consumers that we conducted in a French coastal area subject to specific demographic pressure and micropollution of the water. A multivariate statistical exploratory analysis of the data set highlights the structure of the practices concerned, and the extent to which environmental issues are considered when unused medication is disposed of. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of our approach in understanding the complex nature of sustainable medicine consumption, which involves diverse communities of practice. We also underline the need for public policy to target all stakeholders in the medicine consumption process, from medical professionals to end users.}

This review focused on biodegradation strategies of environmental pollutants and reviewed the enzymatic degradation of VMs including antimicrobial drugs, insecticides, and disinfectants. We reviewed the sources and catalytic mechanisms of peroxidase, laccase, and organophosphorus hydrolases, and summarized the latest research status of immobilization methods and bioengineering techniques in improving the performance of degrading enzymes. The mechanism of enzymatic degradation for VMs was elucidated in the current research. Suggestions and prospects for researching and developing enzymatic degradation of VMs were also put forward.

Natural medicine monomers (NMMs) have shown promising efficacy and safety profiles in HCC treatment, garnering attention from researchers. In recent years, the development of novel targeted drug delivery systems (TDDS) combining NMMs with nanocarriers has emerged. These TDDS aim to concentrate drugs effectively in HCC cells by manipulating the characteristics of nanomedicines, leveraging receptor and ligand interactions, and utilizing endogenous stimulatory responses to promote specific nanomedicines distribution. This comprehensive review presents recent research on TDDS for HCC treatment using NMMs from three perspectives: passive TDDS, active TDDS, and stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems (SDDS). It consolidates the current state of research on TDDS for HCC treatment with NMMs and highlights the potential of these innovative approaches in improving treatment outcomes. Moreover, the review also identifies research gaps in the related fields to provide references for future targeted therapy research in HCC.}

Alongside advancements in imaging, the electronic systems that support this technology have become more advanced. However, it is currently difficult for these individual systems to communicate with each other “out of the box.” There is also minimal standardization of the type and format of data transmitted within these systems. Clinicians and system vendors must work collaboratively to create clinical and technical standards to serve as the foundation for increased interoperability among the various systems within each institutional network. Therefore, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Clinical Informatics Committee established an Ultrasound Electronic Health Record Subcommittee to facilitate collaboration between clinicians, including maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists, and ultrasound network component vendors. Based on the work of this subcommittee, the purpose of this document is to provide: (1) a basic understanding of ultrasound network architecture and capabilities, and (2) best-practice recommendations for electronic health record order design, obstetrical clinical data standards, and billing and coding practices.}

To summarizes the available evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).
Methods
We searched for systematic reviews, and meta-analyzes published up to April 2023 in the Pubmed and Web of Science databases. The latest original research on related topics was also reviewed. The search was restricted to English-language papers. Two independent reviewers performed a quality assessment of the identified literature.
Results
The results of 35 systematic reviews and meta-analyzes were included in this study. Preliminary evidence suggests that CAM, including acupuncture, physical activity (PA), herbal and nutritional supplements, mind-body therapies, touch therapy, and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, have shown tremendous potential for the prevention and treatment of CIPN. Of these, there is strong evidence supporting acupuncture, PA, and herbal medicine. However, existing clinical studies are also limited by the heterogeneity of study methods, insufficient sample size, and poor study design. Further studies are needed to validate the efficacy of CAM in patients with CIPN and to elucidate potential therapeutic mechanisms.
Conclusions
Current research has reached a preliminary conclusion suggesting the potential efficacy of certain CAMs in the management of CIPN. Future clinical trials should incorporate more robust study design protocols and larger sample sizes to enhance the validity of findings.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Di-Long (Pheretima vulgaris) is a classic animal sourced traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used for the treatment of joint inflammation and arthralgia for over two thousand years due to its effects of Tong-Luo-Zhi-Tong (dredging collaterals and alleviating pain). Our previous study showed that Chinese medicine Di-Long has significant anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) effects.
Aim of the study
Considering Di-Long as a potential source of active compounds with specific anti-RA therapeutic effects, this research was to obtain the anti-RA target-specific active fraction from Di-Long extracts (DL), and to further explore the chemical basis and verify the anti-RA mechanism of this active fraction.
Materials and methods
Transcriptomic was applied to obtain the main anti-RA targets of DL on human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and validated by qPCR. The target-corresponding active fraction was isolated from DL by ethanol precipitation and gel chromatography, and analyzed by nanoliter chromatography-mass spectrometry. Anti-RA effects of this active fraction was investigated by collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, and anti-RA mechanisms were verified in cocultured model of rat FLS and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Results
We confirmed that CXCL10/CXCR3 was the main anti-RA target of DL. The active fraction - A (2182 - 890 Da) was isolated from DL based on its CXCL10 inhibiting effects in RA-FLS. Fraction A contains 195 peptides (192 were newly discovered), 26 of which might be bioactive and were considered to be the chemical basis of its anti-RA effects. Fraction A significantly ameliorated the joint destruction and overall inflammation in CIA mice, and downregulated CXCR3 expression in mice joint. Fraction A inhibited the chemotaxis of Th-cells in rat peripheral blood lymphocytes towards the TNF-α-induced rat FLS through CXCL10/CXCR3 pathway.
Conclusions
Our work indicated that active fraction from DL containing small peptides exhibits promising therapeutic effects for RA through inhibiting CXCL10/CXCR3 chemotaxis.}

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to the expansion of virtual medicine as a method to provide patient care. We aimed to determine the impact of pediatric and young adult virtual medicine use on fossil fuel consumption, greenhouse gas, and nongreenhouse traffic-related air pollutant emissions.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective analysis of all virtual medicine patients at a single quaternary-care children’s hospital with a geocoded address in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts prior to (March 16, 2019–March 15, 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 16, 2020–March 15, 2021). Primary outcomes included patient travel distance, gasoline consumption, carbon dioxide and fine particulate matter emissions as well as savings in main hospital energy use.
Results
There were 3,846 and 307,273 virtual visits performed with valid Massachusetts geocoded addresses prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. During 1 year of the pandemic, virtual medicine services resulted in a total reduction of 620,231 gallons of fossil fuel use and $1,620,002 avoided expenditure as well as 5,492.9 metric tons of carbon dioxide and 186.3 kg of fine particulate matter emitted. There were 3.1 million fewer kilowatt hours used by the hospital intrapandemic compared to the year prior. Accounting for equipment emissions, the combined intrapandemic emission reductions are equivalent to the electricity required by 1,234 homes for 1 year.
Conclusions
Widespread pediatric institutional use of virtual medicine provided environmental benefits. The true potential of virtual medicine for decreasing the environmental footprint of health care lies in scaling this mode of care to patient groups across the state and nation when medically feasible.}

However, implementing these screening concepts in real-world settings poses challenges. This work proposes an approach towards precision medicine that combines genetic and nongenetic factors to facilitate clinical decision-making. The approach focuses on raising the performance of four potential interaction screenings in the prescribing process, including drug–drug interactions, drug–gene interactions, drug–herb interactions, drug–social lifestyle interactions, and two potential considerations for patients with liver or renal impairment. The work describes the design of a curated knowledge-based model called the knowledge model for potential interaction and consideration screening, the screening logic for both the detection module and inference module, and the personalized prescribing report. Three case studies have demonstrated the proof-of-concept and effectiveness of this approach. The proposed approach aims to reduce decision-making processes for healthcare professionals, reduce medication-related harm, and enhance treatment effectiveness. Additionally, the recommendation with a semantic network is suggested to assist in risk–benefit analysis when health professionals plan therapeutic interventions with new medicines that have insufficient evidence to establish explicit recommendations. This approach offers a promising solution to implementing precision medicine in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Objective
To screen active constituents of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) as potential virulence inhibitors of Salmonella pathogenicity island III (SPI-3).
Methods
The potential binding of TCM constituents to the MgtC protein of SPI-3 was clarified using molecular docking. The β-galactosidase assay was used to evaluate the effect of the TCM constituents on mgtC transcription. Finally, the effect of the drug on bacterial growth was investigated by assessing the growth curves and transcription levels of the key metabolic genes.
Results
All 27 candidate TCM constituents showed that they could potentially bind to MgtC. The addition of ferulic acid, p-hydroxycinnamic acid, arctiin, and palmatine resulted in a more than 15% reduction in the transcriptional activity of mgtC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of those four constituents on mgtC transcription were as follows: ferulic acid, 16 μM; p-hydroxycinnamic acid, 40 μM; arctiin, 80 μM; and palmatine, 160 μM. Additionally, we confirmed that none of these four constituents inhibited bacterial growth.
Conclusion
In this study, we established a screening method for Salmonella virulence inhibitors based on the β-galactosidase assay, targeting SPI-3. Twenty-seven TCM constituents were screened, and four were found to have potentially potent inhibitory effects on Salmonella virulence. This provides lead compounds from herbal medicines for the development of novel antibiotics in the future. This method can also be used to screen for the virulence inhibitors of other pathogenic bacteria.}

An online survey was conducted, inviting 1350 US oncologists, with data collected on demographics, practice background, comfort level with diagnosing and treating oral conditions, referral practices for oral conditions, and more.
Results
Of the invited 1350 oncologists, 192 responded (14% response rate). Among respondents, 46% were familiar with the OM specialty. Of these, 73% had previously sought consultation from OM specialists. The primary reasons for referral included dental clearance before initiating chemotherapy (38.5%), dental clearance before initiating radiotherapy (37%), and managing oral ulcers and oral potentially malignant disorders equally (32.2%). Regarding referrals to providers outside of OM, oncologists primarily referred patients with oral lesions to otolaryngologists (64.6%), followed by oral and maxillofacial surgeons (55.2%) and general dentists (45.3%).
Conclusion
Our study showed that over half of US oncologists were unfamiliar with the OM specialty. However, the referral rate to OM providers was high among oncologists who had prior OM knowledge. It is advisable to enhance the collaboration between OM and oncology specialists to ensure optimal care for patients with cancer.}

The Delphi method has been extensively used to reach a consensus in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome diagnosis research when subjective judgment is not uniform and objective evidence is lacking. The conduct and reporting of the Delphi method in TCM syndrome diagnosis research have never been critiqued. Our study aims to explore the consistency of using this technique and assess the reporting quality.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was employed to scope articles reporting the conduct of the Delphi method in TCM syndrome diagnosis research. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang and SinoMed databases with the restriction of Chinese and English language from their inception to March 25, 2023. A standardized extraction form was designed to collect demographics and methodological processes reflecting the rigor and transparency in TCM syndrome diagnosis research.
Results
A total of 1832 studies were screened, and 50 were included. The median number of panels was 30 (IQR 20–34.5) and only 12 (24.0 %) studies were with a heterogeneous sample of panels. Two rounds was most common (37/50; 74.0 %), followed by three (7/50; 14.0 %), and only 13 (26.0 %) studies determined the number of rounds a priori. The reporting quality varied, with 18.0 % (9/50) reporting anonymity, 30.0 % (15/50) describing the controlled feedback, 20.0 % (10/50) reporting the procedure duration (7.14 ± 3.29 months) and 26.0 % (13/50) predefining the consensus.

abstract = {Background
Guidelines for the management of febrile infants emphasize patient-centered communication. Although patient-centeredness is central to high-quality health care, biases may impact physicians’ patient-centeredness. We aimed to 1) identify physicians’ assumptions that inform their communication with parents of febrile infants and 2) examine physicians’ perceptions of bias.
Methods
We recruited physicians from 3 academic pediatric emergency departments (EDs) for semistructured interviews. We applied a constant comparative method approach to conduct a thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Two coders followed several analytical steps: 1) discovery of concepts and code assignment, 2) identification of themes by grouping concepts, 3) axial coding to identify thematic properties, and 4) identifying exemplar excerpts for rich description. Thematic saturation was based on repetition, recurrence, and forcefulness.
Results
Fourteen physicians participated. Participants described making assumptions regarding 3 areas: 1) the parent’s affect, 2) the parent’s social capacity, and 3) the physician’s own role in the parent-physician interaction. Thematic properties highlighted the importance of the physician’s assumptions in guiding communication and decision-making. Participants acknowledged an awareness of bias and specifically noted that language bias influenced the assumptions that informed their communication.
Conclusions
ED physicians described subjective assumptions about parents that informed their approach to communication when caring for febrile infants. Given the emphasis on patient-centered communication in febrile infant guidelines, future efforts are necessary to understand how assumptions are influenced by biases, the effect of such behaviors on health inequities, and how to combat this.}

One such development is the use of Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitors (FAPI) as a novel radiotracer. FAPI PET imaging has shown promising results in various malignancies, including sarcomas, which are a diverse group of cancers originating from mesenchymal cells. This paper aims to explore the potential of FAPI PET imaging in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring of sarcomas. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of FAPI PET in sarcomas. Furthermore, FAPI PET imaging has shown potential in assessing treatment response, with changes in FAPI uptake correlating with treatment outcomes. However, there are challenges to be addressed. The heterogeneity of sarcomas, both inter- and intra-tumoral, may affect the uniformity of Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) expression and thus the effectiveness of FAPI PET imaging. Additionally, the optimal timing and dosage of FAPI for PET imaging in sarcomas need further investigation. In conclusion, the introduction of FAPI PET imaging represents a significant advancement in the field of nuclear medicine and oncology. The ability to target FAP, a protein overexpressed in the majority of sarcomas, offers new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of these complex and diverse tumors. Its potential applications in diagnosis, staging, and theranostics are vast, and on-going research continues to explore and address its limitations. As we continue to deepen our understanding of this novel imaging technique, it is hoped that FAPI PET imaging will play an increasingly important role in the fight against cancer. However, as with any new technology, further research is needed to fully understand the potential and limitations of FAPI PET imaging in the clinical setting.}

General practitioner (GP) prescribing of psychotropic medicines to paediatric patients is increasing across countries, sparking the need for additional research into this field. We examined prescribing rates, GP and patient characteristics and indications associated with prescribing psychotropic medicines to paediatric patients in Australian general practice, using data from the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) program. We extracted all encounters with children aged 3 to 17 from 2000 to 2016. Psychotropic medicines were defined as those in the ATC codes N05 (Psycholeptics) and N06 (Psychoanaleptics). Of the 144,397 encounters, GPs prescribed 1829 psychotropic medicines to paediatric patients at an average rate of 1.16 prescriptions per 100 encounters (95% confidence interval 1.09–1.23). We found that the rate of psychotropic medicines prescribed to paediatric patients in Australian general practice increased. Patients who were adolescent, female, socio-economically disadvantaged or from an English-speaking background were significantly more likely to be prescribed a psychotropic medicine. GP practices in remote or regional areas and Australian graduate GPs were more likely to prescribe psychotropic medicines to paediatric patients. Depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and autism were the most common psychiatric indications managed with psychotropic medicines. Antidepressants, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and other psychotropic medicines were prescribed, signifying a high rate of off-label use. Sertraline was the most common psychotropic medicine prescribed, followed by fluoxetine and methylphenidate. Future studies involving data from other prescribers, e.g. paediatricians and psychiatrists, and studies linking prescribed medicines to their indications may widen our understanding of psychotropic medicine prescribing in Australian paediatric patients.}

Therefore, the primary purpose of this research is to discuss the development of a new and appropriately customised model that could enhance the practice of integrated healthcare in Ghana. The model we present has flexibility and far-reaching applicability in other African countries because such countries share similar socio-cultural and economic characteristics. As such, governments and health practitioners could adapt this model to improve the practice of integrated healthcare in their specific settings.

abstract = {Introduction
People-centered care (PCC) strategies are believed to improve overall health outcomes. Medicines use is essential for the treatment of many patients with chronic conditions. Non-adherence rates are high and result in poor health outcomes, and increased healthcare utilization and costs. This study aimed to explore the relationship between PCC and adherence to medicines for persons with chronic medicines use, as well as the extent to which patients' beliefs about medicines are influenced by their level of perceived PCC.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey design was performed with adults using at least 3 chronic medicines per day. To measure the degree of medicines adherence, patients' ideas about medication, and PCC, four validated questionnaires were used: The Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5), Beliefs about medicines questionnaire (BMQ), Client-Centered Care Questionnaire (CCCQ) and the Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9). Socio-demographics, health status, and drug-related burden were questioned as potential factors to impact the relationship between PCC and adherence.
Results
A sample of 459 persons participated. The mean score on the CCCQ (adjusted to pharmacotherapy) was 52.7 on 75 (sd = 8.83, range [18–70]). The top 20% scored 60 or more, the 20% lowest scores were 46 or less. Adherence levels were high, with a mean score of 22.6 on 25 on the MARS-5, and 88% scoring 20 or more. An increase in PCC corresponded to a higher chance of medicines adherence (OR 1.07, 95%CI [1.02–1.12]), corrected for age, the burden due to chronic diseases, the impact of side effects on daily life, and participants' beliefs about medicines. PCC showed positive correlations with the necessity of medicines use (r = 0.1, p = 0.016) and the balance between necessity and concerns (r = 0.3, p < 0.001); and negative correlations with levels of concerns (r = −0.3, p < 0.001) and scores on harmfulness (r = −0.3, p < 0.001) and overuse of medicines (r = −0.4, p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Patients with chronic medicine use perceived an average high level of people-centeredness in the pharmaceutical care they received. This PCC was weakly positively associated with adherence to their medicines. The higher PCC was evaluated, the more patients believed in the necessity of the medicines use and the better the balance between necessity and concerns. The people-centeredness of pharmaceutical care showed several shortcomings and can still be improved. As such, healthcare providers are advised to actively engage in PCC, and not to wait passively for information provided by the patient.}

Sepsis is characterised by a dysregulated host immune response to infection. Despite recognition of its significance, immune status monitoring is not implemented in clinical practice due in part to the current absence of direct therapeutic implications. Technological advances in immunological profiling could enhance our understanding of immune dysregulation and facilitate integration into clinical practice. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current state of immune profiling in sepsis, including its use, current challenges, and opportunities for progress. We highlight the important role of immunological biomarkers in facilitating predictive enrichment in current and future treatment scenarios. We propose that multiple immune and non-immune-related parameters, including clinical and microbiological data, be integrated into diagnostic and predictive combitypes, with the aid of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. These combitypes could form the basis of workable algorithms to guide clinical decisions that make precision medicine in sepsis a reality and improve patient outcomes.}

TCM-AI interdisciplinary models have been proposed to model TCM knowledge, diagnosis, and treatment experiments in clinical practice. Among them, numerous models have been developed to simulate the syndrome differentiation process of human TCM doctors for automatic syndrome diagnosis. However, these models are designed for normal scenarios and trained using a supervised learning paradigm which needs tens of thousands of training samples. They fail to effectively differentiate syndromes in rare disease scenarios where the available TCM electronic medical records (EMRs) are very limited for each unique syndrome. To address the challenge of rare diseases, this study proposes a simple yet effective method called Transfer Learning based Dual-Augmentation (TLDA). TLDA aims to augment the limited EMRs at both the sample-level and feature-level, enriching the pathological and medical information during training. Extended experiments involving 11 comparison models, including the state-of-the-art model, demonstrate the effectiveness of TLDA. TLDA outperforms all comparison models by a significant margin. Furthermore, TLDA can also be extended to other medical tasks when the EMRs for diagnosis are limited in samples.}

Surgical methods mainly depend on the operative procedures, the surgeons and postoperative interventions. In non-surgical methods, cell therapy with stem cells and cell-free therapy with secretome of stem cell origin are current directions. Exosomes are the main paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) containing biological components such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Compared with MSCs, MSC-exosomes (MSC-exos) possess the capacity to escape phagocytosis and achieve long-term circulation. In addition, the functions of exosomes from various cell sources in soft tissue injuries in sports medicine have been gradually revealed in recent years. Along with the biological and biomaterial advances in exosomes, exosomes can be designed as drug carriers with biomaterials and exosome research is providing promising contributions in cell biology.

Emergency medicine (EM) was formally recognized as a specialty in Egypt in 2002. Many institutions of higher education do not yet have an operational academic department of emergency medicine. This study attempts to quantify the awareness and attitude of Ain Shams University medical students towards emergency medicine as both a specialty and a career.
Methods
A paper-based survey was delivered to undergraduate medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt between December 2021 and April 2022. The survey was designed to assess awareness towards the scope of practice of emergency physicians as well as general attitude toward emergency medicine as a specialty and career choice.
Results
A total of 391 students and interns/house officers participated in this study. 53.2% of participants were females and the mean age was 21.65 ± 2.25 years. Only 30 participants (7.7%) were classified as having “Excellent knowledge” of emergency medicine, 92 (23.5%) as “Good knowledge”, 158 “40.4%” as “Fair knowledge” and 111 (28.4%) as “Poor knowledge”. The difference in scores between academic years was not statistically significant (p = 0.239). 91.8% of respondents favored the creation of student interest groups in EM and 40% of respondents found it difficult to reach information regarding EM.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates a lack of awareness and knowledge towards emergency medicine as a specialty across all academic years at our institution. Formal recognition of EM as a specialty doesn't guarantee widespread knowledge among medical students, particularly at institutions without academic EM departments.}

abstract = {Purpose
Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer often experience unique physical and psychosocial complications. They may turn to traditional, complementary and integrative medicines (TCIM) to address these concerns. To examine the pattern of TCIM use among AYA patients with cancer and explored their preferences regarding TCIM education.
Methods
Between August 2021 and December 2022, 246 patients diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years old were recruited from hospitals in Hong Kong. They completed a structured questionnaire on TCIM use, symptom burden, psychological status and preference on education content. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of TCIM use, adjusting for age and sex.
Results
Overall, 60.2% reported TCIM use, most commonly vitamins (24.0%) and Chinese herbal medicine (22.0%). The most common reasons for using TCIM were to improve general health (70.9%) and manage chronic symptoms (33.1%). Among patients on active treatment, TCIM users tend to report higher anxiety symptoms (aOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02–1.27). TCIM users who were post-treatment were more likely to have chronic comorbidities (aOR = 3.54, 95% CI = 1.29–11.5). AYA patients indicated that they would like TCIM information to address specific needs, particularly fatigue (53.7%) and psychological problems (54.1%).
Conclusions
The use of TCIM is common among AYA patients with cancer, especially among patients with high symptom burdens. A tailored education programme should be provided based on patients’ preferences and needs. Healthcare professionals including oncologists and oncology nurses should communicate with AYA patients about TCIM use and address their needs by making evidence-based referrals/recommendations based on treatment status and symptom burden.}

abstract = {Objectives
Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) are commonly prescribed by clinicians in China as adjuvant therapy for diabetic retinopathy (DR). The study of network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of three CPMs plus calcium dobesilate (CD) for DR, and to explore optimal CPM for treatment of DR. Methods. Bayesian network meta-analyses were designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of different CPMs for the treatment of DR. Systematic Review Registration CRD42022323996. Results. A total of 23 eligible RCTs involving 1824 patients were enrolled. Compared with CD alone, Cmpound Danshen Dripping Pills (DS) + CD or Qiming Granule (QM) + CD considerably enhanced best corrected visual acuity (BCVA); DS + CD or Compound Xueshuantong Capsule (XST) + CD significantly reduced macular thickness; CPMs + CD significantly reduced the level of VEGF. In addition, DS + CD or XST + CD over QM + CD in reducing macular thickness. As for the adverse events, the differences across different CPMs were not statistically significant, and no statistically significant difference between the CPMs and CD. Conclusion. DS plus CD or QM plus CD may be better effective in improving BCVA; DS plus CD or XST plus CD may be better effective in reducing macular thickness; The combination therapy all may be better effective in reducing the level of VEGF. As for safety profile that CPMs plus CD did not increase the incidence of adverse events. The results of this study might support DS as a relatively prior adjuvant therapy option for patients with DR.}

abstract = {Aim
This work aims to evaluate whether electronic consultations (e-consults) are a clinically useful, safe tool for assessing patients between primary care and internal medicine.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study of all e-consults ordered by the Primary Care Department to the Internal Medicine Department between September 2019 and December 2023. The results of initial consultations, emergency department visits and subsequent admissions, and survival were assessed and complaints and claims filed were reviewed.
Results
A total of 11,434 e-consults were recorded (55.4% women) with a mean age of 62.1 (SD19.4) years and a wide range (15–102 years). The mean response time was 2.55 (SD 1.6) days. As a result of the e-consults, 5645 patients (49.4%) were given an in-person appointment. For the remaining 5789 (50.6%), a written response was provided. Among those given appointments, the time between the response and in-person appointment was less than five days (95% of cases). Compared to those not given appointments, in-person appointments were older (p < 0.0001), visited the emergency department more times (one month: p = 0.04; three months: p = 0.001), were admitted to the hospital more times (one month: p = 0.0001; three months: p = 0.0001), and had higher mortality at one year (12.7% vs. 9.8% p = 0.0001). In the Cox analysis, only in-person appointments (RR = 1.11; p = 0.04)) and age (RR = 1.09; p < 0.01) were independent factors of mortality. No complaints or claims of any kind were registered.
Conclusions
These data suggest that e-consults are a clinically useful, safe tool for assessing patients referred from primary care to internal medicine departments.
Resumen
Objective
Evaluar si la consulta electrónica (e-consulta) es una herramienta clínicamente útil y segura en la valoración de pacientes entre Atención Primaria y Medicina Interna.
Methods
Estudio retrospectivo de cohortes de la totalidad de e-consultas remitidas desde Atención Primaria a un Servicio de Medicina Interna entre septiembre de 2019 y diciembre de 2023. Se evaluaron los resultados de las primeras consultas, las visitas a Urgencias e ingresos posteriores, la supervivencia y se revisaron las quejas y reclamaciones presentadas.
Results
Se registraron 11.434 e-consultas (55,4% mujeres) con edad media 62,1 (DE 19,4) años y gran dispersión (15 a 102 años). El tiempo medio de respuesta fue de 2,55 (DS 1,6) días y, como consecuencia, se citaron presencialmente 5645 pacientes (49,4%). En los 5789 (50,6%) restantes se ofreció una respuesta escrita. Entre los citados, el tiempo hasta la valoración presencial fue inferior a 5 días (95% de los casos). Con respecto a los no citados, los citados eran de mayor edad (p < 0.0001), acudieron más veces a urgencias (al mes p = 0.04- ; 3 meses p = 0,001-), ingresaron más veces (al mes p < 0.0001; 3 meses p < 0.0001) y mostraron mayor mortalidad al año (12,7% vs. 9.8%; p < 0,0001). En el análisis de Cox solo la citación presencial (RR = 1,11; p = 0,04)) y la edad (RR = 1,09; p < 0,01) fueron factores independientes de mortalidad. No se registraron quejas o reclamaciones de ningún tipo.
Conclusions
Nuestros datos sugieren que la e-consulta es una herramienta clínicamente útil y segura en la valoración de pacientes remitidos desde Atención Primaria a Medicina Interna.}

abstract = {The number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rising at an alarming rate. Regular physical activity and exercise are cornerstones in the therapy of T2DM. While a one-size-fits-all approach fails to account for many between-subject differences, the use of personalized exercise medicine has the potential of optimizing health outcomes. Here, a road map for personalized exercise therapy targeted at patients with T2DM is presented. It considers secondary complications, glucose management, response heterogeneity, and other relevant factors that might influence the effectiveness of exercise as medicine, taking exercise-medication-diet interactions, as well as feasibility and acceptance into account. Furthermore, the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based applications in assisting sports therapists to find appropriate exercise programs is outlined.}
