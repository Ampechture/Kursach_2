abstract = {As per the data provided by WHO, worldwide around 10 million people are dying annually due to cancer. Major failure of conventional therapy is known to be the increased chemoresistance in the cancer cells. Apart from multidrug resistance, other challenges include toxicity and economic expenses. The present investigation throws a detailed insight into plausible causes of the disease, cellular process of carcinogenesis, mechanism of action of conventional therapeutics followed by the alternative approach of chemotherapy based on natural bioactive compounds. Mother nature has an enormous treasure of solutions in the form of phytochemicals, secondary plant metabolites in fruits, vegetables, and plants to be used as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutics for cancer drug research and development. These bioactive compounds can be applied as multitargeted agents in single or in combination and also as complementary alternative medicine (CAM) along with conventional drugs that suppress the survival and oncogenic pathways.}

abstract = {Highly efficacious drugs are widely available for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, accurately selecting a likely effective drug for individual RA patients has been challenging. Biomarkers are required since clinical phenotypes are not reliable to guide the choice of drugs. Previously identified genetic variants for predicting treatment response have failed in replication in independent cohorts of RA patients. Recent studies aimed at the discovery of biomarkers to predict treatment response have focused on integrative omics analysis, expanded to the microbiome, and further finer definition of synovial pathotypes. Treatment responders and non-responders of RA patients can be distinguished by distinct signatures at baseline in their gut microbiota compositions, peripheral blood transcriptome profiling or histomorphological and molecular pathotypes of synovitis. These distinct biological signatures are promising for developing clinically applicable tools for decision in the selection of drugs for RA, albeit further validations in independent cohorts are required.}

Recently the combination of Gallium-68 (Ga-68) for Positron-Emission Tomography with Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) for therapy has found wide application, in particular when used for labelling of somatostatin analogs and PSMA ligands. Preparation of theranostic radiopharmaceuticals can be done by different approaches like manual processes, kit-based procedures or fully automated syntheses and the requirements for the setup of a “Theranostic Radiopharmacy” are mainly dependent on the level of practices intended to be covered and the regulatory environment, in which the radiopharmacy operates.}

abstract = {Background
Pharmacist-led transitions of care (TOC) interventions have been associated with improved health outcomes. Community pharmacists’ (CP) TOC communications have been described whereas limited evidence is available for hospital pharmacists (HP) and none for non-dispensing pharmacists, integrated into Family Medicine Groups (FMG).
Objective
To assess information needs and perceptions about TOC communications of HP, FMG pharmacists (FMG-P) and CP and to identify optimal TOC practices and their barriers.
Methods
In a cross-sectional design, a survey was distributed via email to the 70 pharmacists who participated in a multicenter, single group, longitudinal TOC intervention study for older adults at risk of medication-related harm. All pharmacists were surveyed on their TOC practices before the TOC study, as part of usual care. Pharmacists who followed TOC study patients were also surveyed on their TOC practices during the TOC study.
Results
Survey responses were received from 35 pharmacists (50%), including 8 HP, 6 FMG-P and 21 CP. The frequency of communication between pharmacists of different settings increased significantly during the TOC study, with more than 80% of pharmacists reporting satisfaction with the quality of the information provided. At hospital discharge, in optimal TOC, the FMG-P and CP reported that the most important information to transfer was the reasons of hospitalization, patient weight and height, and the therapeutic intent of the medications. The main barriers to TOC implementation were the lack of clinical information about patients for FMG-P and CP and understaffing for HP. FMG-P and CP reported a similar high degree of interest in assuming responsibility for the new extended scope of practice activities of medication adjustments according to therapeutic targets or laboratory results and the implementation of a plan for gradual dose increases or drug tapering.
Conclusions
The surveyed pharmacists reported an increased frequency of communication and satisfaction with the information exchanged between the pharmacists of different settings during the TOC study compared to usual care, before the study. The pharmacists extended scope of practice offers new opportunities to optimize TOC interventions.}

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and loss of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally. CVDs like Heart Failure (HF) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF) are associated with physical effects on the heart muscles. As a result of the complex nature, progression, inherent genetic makeup, and heterogeneity of CVDs, personalized treatments are believed to be critical. Rightful application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can lead to new insights into CVDs for providing better personalized treatments with predictive analysis and deep phenotyping. In this study we focused on implementing AI/ML techniques on RNA-seq driven gene-expression data to investigate genes associated with HF, AF, and other CVDs, and predict disease with high accuracy. The study involved generating RNA-seq data derived from the serum of consented CVD patients. Next, we processed the sequenced data using our RNA-seq pipeline and applied GVViZ for gene-disease data annotation and expression analysis. To achieve our research objectives, we developed a new Findable, Accessible, Intelligent, and Reproducible (FAIR) approach that includes a five-level biostatistical evaluation, primarily based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. During our AI/ML analysis, we have fitted, trained, and implemented our model to classify and distinguish high-risk CVD patients based on their age, gender, and race. With the successful execution of our model, we predicted the association of highly significant HF, AF, and other CVDs genes with demographic variables.}

Graphene was the name given to a single layer of graphite, one of the allotropes of carbon. Graphene, which was two-dimensional and one atom thick of the carbon element, was a natural nanopore and the most researched material of the 21st century. Graphene was one of the most important materials used in the field of nanomaterials. It had superior thermal, optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. It was an extraordinarily light and strong material among all known materials, and it was also a material that could be easily modified for the desired area. In this article, it was seen that graphene nanopore and graphene material would be among the most important materials in the field of health in the future. In the health field, this carbon-based graphene, and the discovery of graphene nanopores were researched and used by many disciplines such as the treatment of many diseases, drug delivery applications, biotechnology, the treatment of hereditary diseases and even to create of biosensors to be used to detect diseases. Graphene and its derivatives were significant materials that could be used in the field of health. Graphene also became the most essential material of recent times as its structure showed stability when it entered the body. It was compatible with cells and could move quickly in cells with its small and porous nature. Due to its structure, this material was the only substance that could replace all materials used in the field of health. In other words, a single material had all the desired properties to solve health problems and improve them.}

A retrospective survey was performed, selecting participants by using a purposive sampling method, and including the medical records of all patients diagnosed with sepsis admitted to the ED at Singburi Hospital, Thailand. Data were analysed using the ROC curve and the Area Under Curve (AUC) to calculate the accuracy of each patient’s mortality prediction. A total of 225 patients diagnosed with sepsis was identified, with a mortality rate of 59.11% after admission to the medical service and intensive care unit. The AUC analysis showed that the accuracy of the model generated from the REMS (88.6%) was higher than that of the SCS (76.7%). The authors also recommend that key variables identified in this research should be used to develop screening and assessment tools for sepsis in the context of the ED.}

Omics and electronic health record (EHR) data are essential big biomedical data having a strong association with precision medicine. In this chapter, we review the importance of analyzing EHR and omics data in precision medicine.

While each of these is a potential therapeutic target for diseases, they lack effective or long-acting inhibitors. Rapid advances in RNA-based technologies are creating powerful tools to control the expression of proteins. RNA agents can be long-acting and tailored to either decrease or increase production of a specific protein. Advances in nucleic acid delivery, such as by lipid nanoparticles, have enabled the delivery of RNA to the liver, where most proteins of coagulation and fibrinolysis are produced. This review will summarize the classes of RNA that induce 1) inhibition of protein synthesis, including small interfering RNA and antisense oligonucleotides; 2) protein expression, including messenger RNA and self-amplifying RNA; and 3) gene editing for gene knockdown and precise editing. It will review specific examples of RNA therapies targeting proteins in the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems and comment on the wide range of opportunities for controlling fibrinolysis for biological applications and future therapeutics using state-of-the-art RNA therapies.}

abstract = {Background
Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common allergic airway disorder that is often poorly managed. There is an urgent need to enhance medication adherence in order to improve treatment outcomes in patients with AR. The efficacy of wearable smart watches in improving medication adherence is currently unclear.
Objectives
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel smart watch in improving medication adherence and symptom control in patients with AR. The reliability of self-reported medication use was also investigated.
Methods
This randomized, open-label, parallel controlled, pilot study enrolled adult patients with AR caused by cypress pollen. Patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to an intervention group and control group. Smart watches were only distributed to patients in the intervention group. During the cypress pollen season, all patients were required to take oral antihistamines daily and use nasal corticosteroids and antihistamine eye drops as needed. Daily AR symptom scores and medication usage were recorded in both groups. The smart watch was able to identify medication-taking behaviors of patients via artificial intelligence (AI) and relay this information to physicians, who sent short message service reminders to patients who forgot to take oral antihistamines for more than 2 days.
Results
During the pollen season, the adherence rate to oral antihistamines in the intervention group (n = 17) was significantly higher than that in the control group (n = 38) (63.3% ± 28.5% versus 43.2% ± 30.2%, P = 0.02). The daily symptom score of the intervention group was lower than that of the control group (2.4 ± 1.1 versus 3.9 ± 1.0, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the on-demand medication score between the 2 groups (1.3 ± 0.4 versus 1.5 ± 0.5, P = 0.13). The consistency rate between self-reported nasal corticosteroid usage and the gold standard (ie, human observation of medication usage in the videos recorded by the smart watch) was 20.0% (0%, 53.7%), and the consistency rate between self-reported antihistamine eye drop usage and the gold standard was 24.3% (2.1%, 67.1%).
Conclusions
This pilot study showed that the application of smart watches in patients with AR was associated with improved medication adherence and symptom control. Furthermore, the reliability of self-reported medication usage was limited.}

Because SCAD is an uncommon condition, many providers are unfamiliar with EBM treatment standards which could affect the implementation of recommended treatment. This study documented the frequency of failure to meet EBM SCAD treatment standards and factors contributing to conformance failure. Patients who presented to a tertiary referral hospital from January 1, 2005, to July 6, 2020, were included. The electronic medical record was reviewed for EBM treatment. Patients who did not meet the criteria of EBM were contacted by phone for a phone interview. The study period included 118 patients with SCAD, 3 of whom (2.5%) died and were not eligible for this study. In the final cohort of 115 patients, the average age was 55 years, female gender (97%) and EBM standards were met in 30%. Of patients who participated in the phone interview, 38 (33%) reported frustration with SCAD misdiagnosis (39%), inadequate mental health resources (37%), and communication failure regarding the need for cardiologist follow-up (26%). Cardiac rehabilitation use was impacted by location, time of day, availability, and cost. The most common medication-limiting factor for β-blocker usage was fatigue (15%). Most (59%) patients did not undergo fibromuscular dysplasia imaging. In conclusion, in this 15-year SCAD study from a single tertiary care hospital SCAD registry, only 30% met the current EBM for SCAD. Unique solutions that are both patient-informed and evidence-driven are needed to achieve the best clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {Since the mid-twentieth century, the radionuclide thyroid scan has been utilized in the management of benign thyroid disorders. In current medical practice, patients with hyperthyroidism are referred for thyroid scintigraphy, while patients with goiters and thyroid nodules are most often evaluated by ultrasound or computed tomography. Since thyroid scintigraphy reflects the functional state of the gland, it provides information that anatomical imaging lacks. Therefore, radionuclide imaging of the thyroid is the imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of the hyperthyroid patient. In addition, patients with so-called subclinical hyperthyroidism often present a diagnostic dilemma to the clinician since the causative factor must be determined for proper patient management. The aim of this manuscript is to illustrate the imaging characteristics of thyroid disorders commonly seen in clinical practice resulting in thyrotoxicosis or pending thyrotoxicosis, so that correlation with clinical presentation and pertinent laboratory data will lead to the correct diagnosis.}

There are reports of increasing prevalence of resistance to antifungals in human pathogens and concern that their use in agriculture is driving clinical resistance in patients. While crop protection products are the most obvious source in agriculture, a further source may be biosolids from wastewater treatment. In the UK, these are applied to land to provide nutrients and improve soil structure for crops. In this study, biosolids from ten sites in England and one in Wales were analysed for clinical antifungals. Ketoconazole and miconazole were detected in all samples with a median concentration of 0.87 and 0.54 mg kg−1 dry weight (DW), respectively. Clotrimazole was detected at seven of eleven sites at a median level of 1.32 mg kg−1 DW and its absence at four others was considered treatment related. Two prescription-only and systemic medications, itraconazole and posaconazole, were frequently detected with median concentrations of 0.14 mg kg−1 DW and 0.09 mg kg−1 DW, respectively. The biosolid levels of itraconazole found in this study were two orders of magnitude higher than an indicative Predicted No Effect Concentration for resistance selection (PNEC-R) in soil. Neither fluconazole, griseofulvin, and voriconazole nor flucytosine and nystatin were found above the limit of detection of 0.01 or 0.1 mg kg−1 as received, respectively. The findings show that biosolids represent a viable pathway for antifungal agents to reach soil.}

Dehydroandrographolide (Deh) from Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.
Purpose
To explore the role of Deh in acute lung injury (ALI) of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and its inflammatory molecular mechanism.
Methods
Liposaccharide (LPS) was injected into a C57BL/6 mouse model of ALI, and LPS + adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was used to stimulate BMDMs in an in vitro model of ALI.
Results
In an in vivo and in vitro model of ALI, Deh considerably reduced inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis and attenuated mitochondrial damage to suppress NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis through the suppression of ROS production by inhibiting the Akt/Nrf2 pathway. Deh inhibited the interaction between Akt at T308 and PDPK1 at S549 to promote Akt protein phosphorylation. Deh directly targeted PDPK1 protein and accelerated PDPK1 ubiquitination. 91-GLY, 111-LYS, 126-TYR, 162-ALA, 205-ASP and 223-ASP may be the reason for the interaction between PDPK1 and Deh.
Conclusion
Deh from Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall presented NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in a model of ALI through ROS-induced mitochondrial damage through inhibition of the Akt/Nrf2 pathway by PDPK1 ubiquitination. Therefore, it can be concluded that Deh may be a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of ALI in COVID-19 or other respiratory diseases.}

We have performed a retrospective analysis of anti-HLA class I MHC and class II MHC antibodies measured using a single antigen bead (SAB) assay and a panel reactive antibody (PRA) assay.
Material and methods
A group of 256 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was tested for anti-HLA antibodies in the tissue typing laboratory between 2017 and 2020. In the cohort, the serum samples of patients waiting for transplantation were tested. Both the PRA and SAB tests of these patients were analyzed using the Luminex (Immucor) method. The threshold of positivity was accepted as median fluorescence intensities (MFI) ≥1000 for PRA screening and MFI ≥750 for SAB screening.
Results
Overall, antibodies to HLA antigens were detected in 202 (78.9%) out of 256 patients in the PRA study. Antibodies against both class I/II antigens were detected only in 15.6% of these patients, whereas antibodies against only against class I HLA in 31.3% and only against class II HLA in 32.0%. By comparison, the SAB study found that 66.8% of patients were positive for HLA antigens. Furthermore, donor-specific antibodies (DSA) were detected in 52.0% of PRA-positive patients and 52.6% of SAB-positive patients. It was shown that 168 patients (83.2%) out of 202 PRA-positive patients were found to be SAB-positive. In addition, 51 patients negative in the SAB assay (94.4%) were also negative in the PRA assay. Statistical analysis established a significant correlation between the PRA and SAB positivity (p > 0.001). It was also shown that MFI ≥3000 PRA positivity for class I HLA antigens (p = 0.049) and MFI ≥5000 PRA positivity for class II antigens (p < 0.001) correlated with the SAB positivity in patients.
Conclusion
Our results showed the importance of both PRA and SAB assays to define the status of sensitization in patients.}

Technological advances and the increased focus on precision medicine have recently paved the way for the development of digital pathology-based approaches for quantitative pathologic assessments, namely whole slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)–based solutions, allowing us to explore and extract information beyond human visual perception. Within the field of immuno-oncology, the application of such methodologies in drug development and translational research have created invaluable opportunities for deciphering complex pathophysiology and the discovery of novel biomarkers and drug targets. With an increasing number of treatment options available for any given disease, practitioners face the growing challenge of selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient. The ever-increasing utilization of AI-based approaches substantially expands our understanding of the tumor microenvironment, with digital approaches to patient stratification and selection for diagnostic assays supporting the identification of the optimal treatment regimen based on patient profiles. This review provides an overview of the opportunities and limitations around implementing AI-based methods in biomarker discovery and patient selection and discusses how advances in digital pathology and AI should be considered in the current landscape of translational medicine, touching on challenges this technology may face if adopted in clinical settings. The traditional role of pathologists in delivering accurate diagnoses or assessing biomarkers for companion diagnostics may be enhanced in precision, reproducibility, and scale by AI-powered analysis tools.}

NPs can be designed to improve their characteristics and better meet the specific need of the researcher. They can be formulated with organic and/or inorganic materials with different physical properties and applications. Then, NPs size, shape, chemical composition and charge influence not only their biodistribution and clearance but also their ability to concentrate in the relevant target. The ultra-small size of these particles can access difficult to reach-site offering an efficient based-drug delivery system. The nano-encapsulation of drugs is the relevant factor that has highlighted the importance of the nanomedicine, with several formulations approved by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in recent years. Efficient drug loading into NPs allows for improved drug accumulation at the targeting site, increased efficacy and prolonged circulation. The possibility to modify their surface also enhances the ability of NPs to specifically target the interested region. These unique features of NPs offer the opportunity to radiolabel them with radioactive isotopes and combine the diagnostic and therapeutic potential in a single system, defining the NPs as a theranostic tool.}

abstract = {Summary
Precision medicine is an emerging approach to managing disease by taking into consideration an individual’s genetic and environmental profile toward two avenues to improved outcomes: prevention and personalized treatments. This framework is largely geared to conditions conventionally falling into the field of medical genetics. Here, we show that the same avenues to improving outcomes can be applied to conditions in the field of behavior genomics, specifically disorders of spoken language. Babble Boot Camp (BBC) is the first comprehensive and personalized program designed to proactively mitigate speech and language disorders in infants at predictable risk by fostering precursor and early communication skills via parent training. The intervention begins at child age 2 to 5 months and ends at age 24 months, with follow-up testing at 30, 42, and 54 months. To date, 44 children with a newborn diagnosis of classic galactosemia (CG) have participated in the clinical trial of BBC. CG is an inborn error of metabolism of genetic etiology that predisposes up to 85% of children to severe speech and language disorders. Of 13 children with CG who completed the intervention and all or part of the follow-up testing, only one had disordered speech and none had disordered language skills. For the treated children who completed more than one assessment, typical speech and language skills were maintained over time. This shows that knowledge of genetic risk at birth can be leveraged toward proactive and personalized management of a disorder that manifests behaviorally.}

abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling and progressive neurological disease. Some patients find the conventional treatment disappointing and tend to seek salvation in traditional and complementary medicine (T & CM), hoping for better outcomes. This study aims to assess the prevalence of T & CM use among MS patients, understand its perception and misconceptions among MS patients, and assess the level of awareness regarding its use among MS patients.
Material(s) and Method(s)
A cross-sectional study targeting MS patients in Saudi Arabia was conducted from January 2020 to November 2020. A total of 164 MS patients participated. Electronic self-administered questionnaires collected the data through social media.
Result(s)
More than half of the MS patients reported using conventional treatment (71.3%), 14.6% of the MS patients used a combination of both conventional and T & CM, only 3.7% used T & CM alone, while 10% reported taking no treatment. However, 32.9% of patients had used T & CM at some point, with the majority (53.7%) using them in the first 5 years after diagnosis. Patients using conventional treatment (65.2%) were more satisfied than patients using traditional treatment (48.1%).
Conclusion(s)
Patients with multiple sclerosis in the sample studied were more satisfied with conventional treatment methods; thus, only 32.9% had used T & CM since they were diagnosed with MS. Diet, vitamin supplements, and herbal treatments were the most commonly used options in T & CM. Patients reported a lack of guidance by T & CM providers compared to conventional treatment providers. Therefore, T & CM providers need to guide MS patients regarding their treatment regimen and provide better support for patients who may consider seeking other treatment modalities.}

However, there is a need to better understand what methods are being used and for what diseases and purposes. Our analysis of the literature found that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were the neuroimaging techniques used most often in clinical trials for the most prevalent CNS diseases: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), depression, and schizophrenia. Moreover, the number of initiated clinical trials using MRI, PET, and SPECT increased over the period 1981–2021. Such insights indicate that the significant increase in the use of neuroimaging studies could decrease the attrition of novel drug candidates in late clinical development.}

To understand the journey to good data, a high-level data framework is reviewed, specifically the concepts of common data elements, analysis-ready data structures, and common data models. Initiatives such as the federal USCDI and the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application programming interfaces are acknowledged as accelerators of data liquidity that will enable AI. Finally, the need for transformation of healthcare itself is recognized—specifically, a call for the reengineering of healthcare where the capture of good data occurs at the point of care via a computationally intensive environment that actually reduces clinician burden.}

In cell encapsulation for disease therapy, type I collagen is an important biomaterial due to its ability to mimic the extracellular matrix. Telopeptides (carboxy-terminal, CTX, and amino-terminal, NTX) protruding from the triple helix structure of type I collagen are cross-link sites, but also mediate the signal transmission in tissue homeostasis. It is worth investigating the features of the hydrogel microenvironment shaped by the tissue-derived type I collagen with various telopeptide levels, which is paramount for encapsulated cell development. Here, we found the fate of encapsulated human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) behaved differently towards decreasing CTX levels in the collagen hydrogels. Even among collagen hydrogels with a small magnitude of CTX variation, similar stiffness and microstructure, the apparent CTX modulation on the proliferation, cell-interaction, and genes expression of encapsulated hADSCs, as well as morphology and tubule structure formation of endothelial cells were observed, suggesting the biological roles of CTX and its modulation on microenvironment for cell development.}

The European Society for Medical Oncology convened an expert working group to review the analytical and clinical validity and utility of ctDNA assays. For patients with advanced cancer, validated and adequately sensitive ctDNA assays have utility in identifying actionable mutations to direct targeted therapy, and may be used in routine clinical practice, provided the limitations of the assays are taken into account. Tissue-based testing remains the preferred test for many cancer patients, due to limitations of ctDNA assays detecting fusion events and copy number changes, although ctDNA assays may be routinely used when faster results will be clinically important, or when tissue biopsies are not possible or inappropriate. Reflex tumour testing should be considered following a non-informative ctDNA result, due to false-negative results with ctDNA testing. In patients treated for early-stage cancers, detection of molecular residual disease or molecular relapse, has high evidence of clinical validity in anticipating future relapse in many cancers. Molecular residual disease/molecular relapse detection cannot be recommended in routine clinical practice, as currently there is no evidence for clinical utility in directing treatment. Additional potential applications of ctDNA assays, under research development and not recommended for routine practice, include identifying patients not responding to therapy with early dynamic changes in ctDNA levels, monitoring therapy for the development of resistance mutations before clinical progression, and in screening asymptomatic people for cancer. Recommendations for reporting of results, future development of ctDNA assays and future clinical research are made.}

Moreover, the natural surfactant rejection and the FO fouling impact were evaluated by separate FO operation with synthetic TCM wastewater, and MD wetting was also assessed. Results show that the UF-FO-MD hybrid system successfully isolated the macromolecular substances, bioactive compounds and water in the TCM wastewater for recovering useful resources. Natural surfactants in the TCM wastewater could be effectively rejected by FO, avoiding the subsequent MD wetting problem which has occurred in our previous study on the resource recovering with the UF-MD hybrid system. However, FO membrane fouling might be an issue affecting the recovery efficiency of bioactive compounds from TCM wastewater. The bioactive compounds could not be completely concentrated due to potential adsorption on the fouling layer.}

Insulin resistance is a common denominator of obesity, and Type 2 DM affecting the liver, pancreatic beta-cell, skeletal muscles. Active compound berberine (BBR) in Chelidonium majus has been investigated previously on various metabolic pathways. However, Homeopathic preparations of Chelidonium majus (HPCM) with active compound BBR has not been investigated to manage obesity and Type 2 DM. As the pancreas and liver share similar regenerating factors, they can be further investigated as a target site for deciphering the mechanism of action of HPCM in obesity and Type 2 DM. Therefore, we hypothesize that HPCM at ultra-low concentrations might show anti-obesity action that may act by either activating AMP protein kinase pathway or inhibition of phosphodiesterase in adipocytes or inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis or by promoting fatty acid beta-oxidation in skeleton muscles. We further hypothesize that, the same drug might show anti-diabetic activity by enhancing insulin secretion or by stimulating glycolysis, or suppressing adipogenesis by inhibiting PPAR gamma and C/EBP alpha function. The dual activity of HPCM may be attributed to synergistic action of all the active ingredients in ultra-low concentration.}

The impact of a children’s zoo may be easily overshadowed by more charismatic programs involving endangered species. However, the connection between people and animals provided by a children’s zoo could inspire valuable appreciation for animals, nature, and conservation. Therefore veterinary professionals also need to be well-informed on how to maintain a healthy animal collection that meets or exceeds all animal welfare standards while decreasing zoonotic risks. Following all Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) policies and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations while focusing on a strong preventive medicine program are the mainstays of achieving this goal. Several relevant new and emerging diseases, zoonotic or species specific, are also summarized in this chapter. In all cases, diligence in taking precautionary measures to prevent disease transmission may include appropriate quarantine, routine health assessments, thoughtful exhibit design, and adequate handwashing stations. When accomplished successfully, a children’s zoo may have a lasting impression on zoo guests that may influence positive change for future generations.}

In Mexico, Agastache mexicana subsp. mexicana (PT) and subsp. xolocotziana (WT), and Dracocephalum moldavica (BT), are used together as the “three toronjiles” to treat gastrointestinal spasms.
Aim of study
To evaluate if the spasmolytic activity of these three medicinal species is better in combination or in an individual manner.
Materials and methods
Spasmolytic effect of PT, WT and BT alone or combinate were evaluated in rings of the guinea-pig ileum contracted with potassium chloride (KCl), electrical field stimulation (EFS), or acetylcholine (ACh). Chemical analysis by thin layer and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography of the aqueous extracts of each species were done for their comparison, and their acute toxicity were determined in mice.
Results
PT and WT diminished in a dose-dependent manner the contractions induced by KCl, EFS, and ACh. Whereas BT did not altered contractions in any experimental protocol. A combination of the PT (EC50) and WT (EC50) diminished the contractions induced by KCl or EFS. Interestingly, the addition of BT extract (10 μg/ml) to the combination (PT EC30 + WT EC30) blocked the inhibitory effect produced on the contracted tissue in the presence of KCl, EFS, or ACh. Moreover, addition of BT extract (100 μg/ml) to the same combination blocked the inhibitory effect on the pre-contracted tissue only in the presence of EFS. None of the aqueous extracts produced toxicity in its individual administration in mice. Chemical analysis demonstrated similarities between PT and WT, but differences with BT.
Conclusions
The results of this study confirmed that either combined or by themselves aqueous extracts of PT and WT produced a spasmolytic action on guinea pig ileum, suggesting that this combination of medicinal plants could relieve gastrointestinal diseases in human, but when BT aqueous extract is added to those obtained with PT and WT, the spasmolytic activity diminished or even was blocked. Our results give evidence that mixture of several plants might produce disadvantages in the medicinal properties of their individual activity.}

abstract = {The annual production of Chinese medicine industry waste (CMIW) is extremely large, and their improper disposal can lead to resource wastage and environmental pollution. CMIW is rich in lignocellulose, which can be converted into a porous carbon-based adsorbent for pollutant removal. In this study, hydrochar magnetic adsorbents were prepared from CMIW via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) without adding magnetic substances. The mechanism of magnetic formation and adsorption properties was investigated. The results showed that the saturation magnetization of hydrochar was significantly higher than that of CMIW. This hydrochar could be easily separated and recycled from mixed solution by external magnetic fields. The existence of iron in CMIW was the root of magnetism formation. The Fe3+ in CMIW was reduced to Fe3+/Fe2+ in hydrochar during HTC process. XRD spectra elucidated the presence of Fe3O4 phase in hydrochar. XPS spectra exhibited the lattice oxygen, Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2 and SEM showed the granular aggregates were on the surface of hydrochar, which indicated the presence of Fe3O4. The formation of Fe3O4 caused hydrochar to exhibit strong magnetism. HTC230-3 hydrochar exhibited both the strongest magnetism and the highest methylene blue (MB) removal rate at an adsorption temperature of 30 °C. The surface structure of hydrochar was rough and porous, resulting in an abundance of adsorption sites and a high adsorption capacity. The adsorption of MB on CMIW hydrochar was not only attributed to the physical adsorption caused by micropores and mesopores but also mainly related to abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. The adsorption of MB was in accordance with the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich models. This work provided an innovative insight for high value and efficient utilization of CMIW, achieving the goal of environmentally friendly and treating waste with waste.}

abstract = {Background
Early prevention of Spontaneous Abortion (SA) is essential for the treatment of recurrent spontaneous abortion.
Objective
In this retrospective study, a variety of machine learning methods were used to develop predictive models and diagnose the potential risk of SA.
Methods
A total of 663 pregnant women participated in the case-control study, 586 of which were SA patients and 77 were normal parturition women. The research data included 25 features of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) constitution and clinical data related to SA. This work utilized 8 machine learning techniques including logistic regression, gradient boosting decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, classification and r-egression tree, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, random forest and XG-Boost to predict SA. The performances of the applied models were evaluated by using the method of 10-fold cross-validation and by computing the diagnostic test characteristics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the AUC of ROC curve.
Results
The F1 scores of these eight machine learning techniques were all above 97.5%. Among them, gradient boosting decision tree had the best prediction result on SA. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the AUC of ROC curve of gradient boosting decision tree were 97.9%, 99%, 98.6%, 98.8%, and 97.3%, respectively.
Conclusion
The paper has accurately predicted the risk of SA combined with TCM constitution and clinical data.}

abstract = {Background: Organ transplantation represents the gold standard for numerous end-stage organ failure conditions. There is an overwhelming need for transplantable organs, which is predicted to increase given factors like the reduction in chronic disease mortality, the increase in life expectancy, and the expanding of conditions like diabetes and obesity to pandemic levels. Methods: Regenerative medicine (RM) inspired technologies challenge the efficacy of the current allograft transplantation model. Herein, we succinctly illustrate the state of the art of the most promising technologies including decellularization to fabricate an acellular scaffold, three-dimensional printing, and organoids manufactured from a patient’s own cells with interspecies blastocyst complementation. RM technologies are also aiming at repairing and regenerating poor quality organs that would otherwise be underutilized or discarded. Results: These RM technologies surpass the requirement of a living donor in the allograft transplantation model; and, instead, focus on a personalized medicine approach, with technologies manufactured for each individual patient. One goal of transplantation is to achieve an immunosuppression-free state (IFS) to improve quality of life, reduce complications and toxicities, and eliminate the cost of lifelong antirejection therapy. Using a patient’s cells to bioengineer complex organs may make posttransplant IFS possible. Conclusions: The future of organ bioengineering relies on furthering our understanding of mechanisms of organogenesis, in vivo regenerative capabilities, regenerative immunology, and long-term monitoring of implanted bioengineered organs. As well, the future of transplant medicine relies on how quickly we will be able to foster progress in RM by joining forces with RM societies.}

This ability of stem cells is responsible for maintaining the tissues so that they can carry out their functions. Aberration in the functioning of stem cells can lead to various diseases, and hence, these stem cells can be used as model systems that can contribute to research for expanding our knowledge of disease biology and ultimately offering avenues for the treatment of various diseases. However, the complexity of the pathways operative in these stem cells necessitates them to be robustly examined prior to their application. A key challenge for stem cell biologists is the vast amount of data being generated by scientists all over the world. Combining this plethora of resources and presentation of the knowledge in a single schema is useful for the overall understanding of complexities associated with stem cell biology. Integrative bioinformatic approaches hence provide a valuable platform for this purpose, and this chapter highlights the utility of systems biology to the advancement of our understanding of stem cells.}

They facilitate intercellular communication by transporting DNA, mRNA, microRNA, long non-coding RNA, circular RNA, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They contribute to the onset and progression of Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors. In addition, they can be used as biomarkers of tumor proliferation, migration, and blood vessel formation, thereby affecting the Tumor Microenvironment (TME). This paper reviews the recent advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of exosomes in various CNS tumors, the promise and challenges of exosomes as natural carriers of CNS tumors, and the therapeutic prospects of exosomes in CNS tumors. Furthermore, we hope this research can contribute to the development of more targeted and effective treatments for central nervous system tumors.}

One of the central aspects of clinical governance is continuous professional education, including case-based review and case-based learning. In this article, we present the case-based education process in use at London's Air Ambulance, a mature advanced prehospital system in London, UK. The case review process begins with an on-scene hot debrief, an informal process often involving other emergency services. This is usually followed by internal team feedback and debrief and patient follow-up. All cases are then reviewed over the next 24 to 48 hours by the duty prehospital consultant (attending) in the rapid review process. After this, certain cases are volunteered or selected for discussion in the twice weekly death and disability (D&D) meeting or the monthly dispatch meeting. A small subset of cases is highlighted through this process for full formal audit and presentation at the monthly clinical governance meetings based on their educational value. Another subset of cases involving a fatality is also discussed at the monthly clinical pathology correlation meeting with the input of local forensic pathologists. Organization of the process, structure of the meetings, and educational value are described in detail.}

abstract = {Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive form a leukemia that remains difficult to treat, often with rapid and frequent disease relapse due to drug-resistant clonal selection. A range of combination therapies have been designed to overcome this hurdle, however, identifying the most appropriate combination therapy at each line of treatment remains a challenge. Functional precision medicine platforms that use ex vivo drug sensitivity data from primary patient samples have shown potential to guide treatments in a range of cancers. We have recently developed an ex vivo combinatorial drug sensitivity platform, quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP), that analyses a predesigned array of 155 test combinations performed on a primary patient sample to rank and compare all possible therapeutic combinations from a 12-drug set. In this study, we evaluated the use of QPOP to predict treatment outcomes in an AML cohort treated with a variety of combination therapies. Furthermore, we also explored QPOP's combination therapy ranking function to identify novel or under-utilized combinations that may benefit larger groups of AML patients when appropriately guided. Methods: Prospective clinical feasibility study of QPOP in AML was performed at National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore. Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirations were collected from AML patients, recruited between 26 th November 2019 and June 15 th 2023. Following CD34+ cell selection, the enriched malignant blast population was subjected to an array of 155 test combinations derived from an orthogonal array composite design. Phenotypic cell viability data from this test was subsequently used by QPOP to derive drug combination scores and rankings for all possible combinations. Median turnaround time for QPOP patient-specific reports was 8 (±2.1) days. Patients were treated with current standard of care options as guided by the clinician. The primary outcomes of this study were to determine the concordance between treatment outcomes as guided by clinicians and QPOP drug combination scores and rankings. Secondary outcomes of this study were to identify high-ranking, potentially effective combinations that may be nover or under-utilized for future studies. Results: 40 patients were recruited to the study with 49 samples analyzed by QPOP. Samples collected until 21 January 2022 were also used to refined ex vivo drug dosing levels for 12-drug, 3-level test combination arrays. Excluding patients diagnosed as non-AML and patient without available clinical concordance data, QPOP response concordance was evaluable for 19 patients. A 75% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 72.7% negative predictive value (NPV) was determined for a QPOP normalized cell viability (NCV) cutoff of 0.65. The area under the curve of the receiver operator curve, AUC = 0.75, suggesting acceptable predictivity. Concordance analysis of with samples (n = 10) collected after 21January 2022 demonstrated an 80% PPV, 80% NPV, AUC = 0.80 for an NCV cutoff of 0.62, suggesting that current ex vivo dosage settings for test array can further improve test accuracy. Combination therapy with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax and hypomethylating agent azacytidine is standard-of-care for AML. QPOP NCV cutoff of 0.62 also exhibited 100% concordance (5/5) with venetoclax+azacytidine treatment further demonstrating the accuracy of QPOP to predict treatment outcomes in AML. Amongst top ranked QPOP-derived combinations, venetoclax/fludarabine was amongst the most frequently reoccurring top-ranked combinations. With appropriate functional combinatorial precision medicine testing, patients who may benefit from addition of venetoclax to fludarabine-based chemotherapy regimens, such as fludarabine/busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning chemotherapy, may be accurately identified. Conclusions: This clinical study demonstrates the feasibility of QPOP to predict treatment outcomes and accurately identify both response and resistance to combination therapy. Following platform workflow optimization, initial concordance analysis suggests excellent predictivity. Expansion of this clinical study is needed to confirm these results. This study also suggests that underutilized combinations may be effective across a larger population of AML patients with appropriate ex vivo drug testing and deserve further clinical interrogation.}
