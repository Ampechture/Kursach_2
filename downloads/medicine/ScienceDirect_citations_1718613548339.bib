abstract = {Background
Pinellia ternata (P. ternata, Banxia)-containing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used in China as an adjuvant treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). However, evidence of its efficacy and safety remains limited.
Purpose
To investigate the efficacy and safety of P. ternata-containing TCM combined with 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs) in the treatment of CINV.
Study design
Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods
All relevant RCTs were systematically retrieved from seven internet databases (up to February 10, 2023). P. ternata-containing TCM combined with 5-HT3RAs to treat CINV was included in all RCTs. The clinical effective rate (CER) was defined as the primary outcome, while appetite, quality of life (QOL), and side effects were secondary outcomes.
Results
The meta-analysis included 22 RCTs with 1,787 patients. Our results indicated that P. ternata-containing TCM combined with 5-HT3RAs significantly improved the CER of CINV (RR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.37-1.57, p < 0.00001), appetite (RR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.42-2.20, p < 0.00001), QOL (RR = 7.67, 95% CI = 1.56-13.78, p = 0.01), the CER of several 5-HT3RA medications (RR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.37-1.57, p < 0.00001), and acute and delayed vomiting (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.36, p < 0.0001) compared with the 5-HT3RAs alone, while the combination therapy decreased the incidence of side effects induced by 5-HT3RAs for CINV (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.42-0.59, p < 0.00001).
Conclusion
According to the findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis, P. ternata-containing TCM combined with 5-HT3RAs was safer and more effective than 5-HT3RAs alone for CINV patients. However, due to the limitations of the included studies, more high-quality clinical trials are required to further validate our findings.}

In addition to respiratory symptoms, some COVID‑19 patients also show various gastrointestinal symptoms and even consider gastrointestinal symptoms to be the first manifestation. A large amount of evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection could disrupt the gut microbiota balance, and disorders of the gut microbiota could aggravate the condition of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, maintaining the gut microbiota balance is expected to become a potential new therapeutic target for treating COVID-19. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has significant effects in all stages of the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. It can adjust the gut microbiota and is an ideal intestinal microecological regulator. This review summarizes the advantages and clinical efficacy of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 and expounds on the relationship between TCM and the gut microbiota, the relationship between COVID-19 and the gut microbiota, the mechanism of gut microbiota disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2, the relationship between cytokine storms and the gut microbiota, and the role and mechanism of TCM in preventing and treating COVID-19 by regulating the gut microbiota to provide new research ideas for TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.}

Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI), is the primary and first-line anti-influenza drug. In recent years, more and more oseltamivir resistant strains appeared frequently.
Purpose
To identify anti-influenza candidates to overcome oseltamivir resistance from traditional Chinese medicine.
Methods
High-throughput screening platform was used to screen candidates with oseltamivir sensitive and resistant neuraminidase (NA) inhibitory activities from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and in validation of potential active components in vitro. Molecular docking is used for virtual screening of TCM compound libraries and analysis of the molecular mechanism of active compounds.
Results
Six out of 188 TCM formula granules were screened out with good inhibitory activities in oseltamivir sensitive (H5N1) and resistant NA (H274Y mutant). A compound library containing 679 candidates in the above six plants were docked into binding pockets of H5N1 NA and its H274Y mutant. The results indicated that diverse structural types, including flavonoids glycosides, alkaloids, caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, etc. showed good docking scores on the two NAs. Furthermore, 10 representative compounds tested in vitro showed inhibitory activities in both oseltamivir sensitive and resistant NA. The docking simulations revealed that natural TCM molecules bind with NA in an absolute different mode compared with oseltamivir, which occupy the extra cavities adjacent to the active site of NA, thus might make them non-susceptible to be influenced by mutation around the active sites.
Conclusions
The combination of high-throughput screening and molecular docking can efficiently screen out candidates that have the potential to overcome oseltamivir resistance from TCM.}

The proposed recommendations, such as a coherent multi-sectorial and government-led strategy, call for a fundamental rethink of approaches towards strong regulations, policies, legislations, community-based approaches, collaborations and investments, which all must be scaled up before this the situation gets out of control. These recommendations are of paramount importance and have the potential to ensure access to genuine medicines and also to avert therapeutic failure and intoxication from dangerous substances. In addition, there will be added benefits to the economic, social, health and well-being of the region. Concerted efforts towards medicine regulations have enormous potential to contribute towards averting many preventable deaths and reducing disease burden in the region.

abstract = {Background
Transfers to emergency departments (EDs) from long-term care (LTC) can expose residents to care discontinuities and risks. Virtual platforms can increase the breadth of care available for residents within their facility, thus replacing transfers to EDs when safe and appropriate. The authors aimed to assess whether leveraging a virtual care platform at an LTC facility would reduce the number of transfers to EDs.
Methods
Data on the number of transfers to EDs were collected from January 2019 to October 2021 at an LTC facility. In June 2020 the home began using a virtual care platform that allowed residents to speak with specialist physicians through video and receive management plans remotely. The authors evaluated the Internal Medicine Virtual Specialist Program (IMVSP) using a pre-post study design by comparing the number of transfers to EDs and the proportion of transfers resulting in hospital admission before and after program implementation. Unstructured phone interviews were conducted with employees at the home to understand their experiences.
Results
The median number of transfers to EDs per month after program implementation showed a 13.0% reduction. The median proportion of these transfers resulting in hospital admission per month increased by 26.1%. Employees at the LTC home were satisfied with the program.
Conclusion
The IMVSP reduced transfers to EDs and allowed for a higher proportion of transfers that resulted in hospital admission. Early access to specialist care via virtual platforms has important implications for improving accessibility to high-quality care for LTC residents and reducing risks associated with transfers.}

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) in combination with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating chronic urticaria (CU).
Methods
We thoroughly searched Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wangfang database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and Chinese biomedical literature database (SinoMed) for relevant studies from inception until May 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ACE combined with CHM for CU were included. Literature search, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were independently conducted by two authors.
Results
A total of 15 RCTs with 1065 participants were included in this review. Five trials reported that the combined therapy showed a higher total effective rate, and four trials reported that the combined therapy was associated with a lower level of serum immunoglobulin E. Furthermore, two, four, and four trials reported that the combined therapy was more effective in reducing itching degree, size, and number of wheals, respectively. The combined therapy was reported to be associated with a lower recurrence rate in three trials, and with a fewer adverse reaction rate in two trials.
Conclusions
ACE in combination with CHM appears to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with CU. Given the relatively low quality of the included trials, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm our findings.}

abstract = {Introduction
Globally, abdominal adhesions constitute a significant burden of morbidity and mortality. They represent the commonest complication of abdominal operations with a lifelong risk of multiple pathologies, including adhesive small bowel obstruction, female infertility, and chronic pain. Adhesions represent a problem of the entire abdomen, forming at the time of injury and progressing through multiple complex pathways. Clinically available preventative strategies are limited to barrier technologies. Significant knowledge gaps persist in the characterization and mitigation of the involved molecular pathways underlying adhesion formation. Thus, the objectives of this scoping review are to describe the known molecular pathophysiology implicated in abdominal adhesion formation and summarize novel preclinical regenerative medicine preventative strategies for potential future clinical investigation.
Methods
A literature review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Extension for Scoping Reviews. Included peer-reviewed publications were published within the last 5 y and contained in vivo preclinical experimental studies of postoperative adhesions with the assessment of underlying mechanisms of adhesion formation and successful therapy for adhesion prevention. Studies not involving regenerative medicine strategies were excluded. Data were qualitatively synthesized.
Results
A total of 1762 articles were identified. Of these, 1001 records were excluded by the described screening criteria. Sixty-eight full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, and 11 studies were included for review.
Conclusions
Novel and reliable preventative strategies are urgently needed. Recent experimental data propose novel regenerative medicine targets for adhesion prevention.}

The MCOFs were constructed by using 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxaldehyde (Dt) and 4′,5′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-[1,1′′,2′,1′′-triphenyl]-4,4′′-diamine (BAPTPDA) as monomers. The morphological structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the stability of BAPTPDA-Dt was characterized by various techniques such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that nickel foam (NF) was covered by covalent organic frameworks and that NF@COF (BAPTPDA-Dt) exhibited excellent stability. The adsorption capacity of MCOF for PAHs ranged from 30.8 to 262.5 mg g−1. A number of parameters that might affect the extraction efficiency of D-μ-SPE were optimized, which resulted in a more efficient and time-saving extraction process (2 min) with less consumption of organic reagents (1 mL). The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the 16 PAHs was performed by GC–MS with the limits of detection ranging from 0.55 to 5.93 µg/L.

The recoveries for the three spiked sample concentrations (20, 200 and 500 µg/L) varied from 80.8 % to 126.7 %. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for PAHs were all less than 7.79 %. The total contents of the 16 PAHs contained in the five herbs (Gardenia, Plantain Seed, Rhizoma Alismatis, Evodia Fruit and Peucedani Radix) were in the range of 308–1070 µg kg−1. The results indicated that the established method has significant repeatability and reproducibility.}

abstract = {Objective
This systematic review aimed to identify the prevalence of CAM use in patients with neurological disorders, and also to know most frequent types of CAM used.
Methods
Five databases: PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Latindex and Scielo (in English and Spanish) were searched from January 2010 to May 2021. Only original cross-sectional, retrospective and cohort studies were included, whose primary objective was to describe the frequency of CAM use in neurological disorders and/or the related factors to its use in adults. Based on the data, a descriptive analysis was performed, covering the characteristics of studies, measuring methods, prevalence, types and related factors. To control the risk of bias, a quality assessment of each study was performed using STROBE checklist.
Results
For the final analysis, 40 studies were included. Most common pathologies observed in the studies were multiple sclerosis, headache, stroke, Parkinson and epilepsy. The STROBE score of studies ranged from 13 to 22 points, with an average of 18.2. Prevalence of CAM use was highly variable from one study to another (16% in stroke patients, to 100% in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal cord injury patients). Biological therapies (dietary supplements and herbal medicine) were the most commonly CAM types used. The associated factors identified were female sex, an age between 40 and 50 years, and higher socioeconomic level. Not all studies investigated about the results of CAMs but these ranged from 35% to more than 80% of reporting positive effects.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CAM use in neurological diseases is highly variable (16%−100%); the most used type of CAM was biological therapies and the associated factors were female sex, age between 40 and 50 years old and high socioeconomic level.}

abstract = {Objectives
We analyze how shortages led to changes in access to and expenditure for pharmaceutical care in the Swiss health system between 2015 and 2020.
Methods
We combined cross-sectional and longitudinal data to study medicine shortages by incidence, duration, intensity, and pharmaceutical expenditure. We assessed 4119 markets defined by active ingredient, dosage form, and strength. We classified markets by essential medicine status and other characteristics. We differentiated shortages by the degree to which alternative options are still available. We investigated the first lockdown period of the pandemic, considering also the shortage of COVID-19–specific medicines.
Results
A total of 1964 markets never reported shortages, and 1336 markets reported some shortages; 819 markets reported shortages lasting at least 14 days. Markets with a higher number of manufacturers, a lower co-payment share, and lower prices more frequently reported shortages. We did not find differences by essential medicine status. In 50% of instances, the average price of substitutes available was lower than the price of the product on shortage. The total pharmaceutical expenditure attributed to shortages increased by CHF 17.00 million (€15.63 million) in 2018.
Conclusions
Medicine shortages have substantially reduced access to pharmaceuticals. Switzerland has experienced shortages on a scale similar to that in other countries. Prices of substitutes available at the time of shortages can be higher or lower, indicating an unelastic demand for medicines.}

However, when the matrix effect cannot be ignored, a matrix-matching calibration must be established for each single plant, which is time-consuming and laborious. To increase laboratory productivity and simplify analysis procedures, we proposed a strategy for the determination of multiple pesticide residues from different food-medicine plants using a single matrix-matching calibration. Herein, the matrix effects of 30 organophosphorus pesticides, 15 triazine pesticides and 12 pyrethroid pesticides in 11 food-medicine plants as determined by GC-MS/MS were investigated. Performance characteristics of the established method were validated according to SANTE/11813/2017 guidelines set by the European Commission. To better verify the influences of plants varieties and the physicochemical characteristics of pesticides on matrix effects, hierarchical cluster analysis was employed. There was little difference between plants with the same medicinal parts in the same family, indicating that these types of samples were more likely to be classified into the same category. The results show that matrices can be grouped into different clusters when analyzing different pesticide types. Any type of plant can be chosen from its cluster as a representative matrix to generate a matrix-matching solution, simplifying analysis without sacrificing accuracy. The establishment of the method aims to provide new research ideas for future analysis of pesticide residues in complex matrices.}

Alarming rates of burnout in surgical training pose a concern due to its deleterious effects on both patients and providers. Datum remains lacking on rates of burnout in surgical residents based on race and ethnicity. This study aims to document the frequency of burnout in surgical residents of racially underrepresented backgrounds and elucidate contributing factors.
Methods
A 35-question anonymized survey was distributed to general surgery residents from 23 programs between August 2018 and May 2019. This survey was designed from the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory, and included additional questions assessing participant demographics, educational, and social backgrounds. Responses were analyzed utilizing chi-square tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. There was also a free response portion of the survey which was evaluated using thematic analysis.
Results
We received 243 responses from 23 general surgery programs yielding a 9% (23/246) program response rate and 26% (243/935) response rate by surgical residents. One hundred and eighty-five participants (76%) identified as nonunderrepresented in medicine and 58 (24%) of participants identified as underrepresented in medicine. Fifty-three percent were male and 47% female. Overall, sixty-six percent of all surgical residents (n = 161) endorsed burnout with racially underrepresented residents reporting higher rates of burnout at 76% compared to 63% in their nonunderrepresented counterparts (P = 0.07).
Conclusions
Although the generalizability of these results is limited, higher rates of reported burnout in racially underrepresented trainees noted in our study illuminates the need for continual dialogue on potential influencing factors and mitigation strategies.}

Purpose
Amid calls for greater diversity in precision medicine research, the perspectives of Indigenous people have been underexplored. Our goals were to understand tribal leaders’ views regarding the potential benefits and risks of such research, explore its priority for their communities, and identify the policies and safeguards they consider essential. This article reports on the participants’ perspectives regarding governance and policy, stewardship and sharing of information and biospecimens, and informed consent.
Methods
After informal local dialogs with 21 tribal leaders, we convened a 2.5-day deliberation with tribal leaders (N = 10) in Anchorage, Alaska, in June 2019 using a combination of small group and plenary discussion, ranking, and voting exercises to explore the perspectives on precision medicine research.
Results
Tribal sovereignty was central to participants’ ideas about precision medicine research. Although views were generally positive, provided that the appropriate controls were in place, some kinds of research were deemed unacceptable, and the collection of certain biospecimens was rejected by some participants. Differences were observed regarding the acceptability of broad consent.
Conclusion
Tribal leaders in this study were generally supportive of precision medicine research, with the caveat that tribal oversight is essential for the establishment of research repositories and the conduct of research involving Indigenous participants.}

Before this shift toward next-generation sequencing in public health settings, individual patients met geneticists after showing symptoms and through limited family screening. In the new era of precision public health, everyone is a possible participant in genetic sequencing, simply by being born (newborn screening), by donating blood (biobanking), or through population screening. These initiatives are increasingly offered to individuals throughout their life and more individuals are encountering opportunities to use DNA sequencing. This article raises awareness of these growing areas and calls for different models of public engagement and communication about genomics, including screening asymptomatic populations, obtaining consent for unspecified and unforeseen future uses of genomic data, and managing variants of uncertain significance. Given that such communication challenges loom large, established norms of practice in genomic medicine and research should be reconsidered.}

Many organs may be involved, and although the manifestations are highly variable, the kidneys, joints, and skin are commonly affected. Immunologic abnormalities, including the production of antinuclear antibodies, are also characteristic of the disease. Maternal morbidity and mortality are substantially increased in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and an initial diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy is associated with increased morbidity. Common complications of systemic lupus erythematosus include nephritis, hematologic complications such as thrombocytopenia, and a variety of neurologic abnormalities. The purpose of this document is to examine potential pregnancy complications and to provide recommendations on treatment and management of systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend low-dose aspirin beginning at 12 weeks of gestation until delivery in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to decrease the occurrence of preeclampsia (GRADE 1B); (2) we recommend that all patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, other than those with quiescent disease, either continue or initiate hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pregnancy (GRADE 1B); (3) we suggest that for all other patients with quiescent disease activity who are not taking HCQ or other medications, it is reasonable to engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to initiate new therapy with this medication in consultation with the patient’s rheumatologist (GRADE 2B); (4) we recommend that prolonged use (>48 hours) of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) generally be avoided during pregnancy (GRADE 1A); (5) we recommend that COX-2 inhibitors and full-dose aspirin be avoided during pregnancy (GRADE 1B); (6) we recommend discontinuing methotrexate 1-3 months and mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid at least 6 weeks before attempting pregnancy (GRADE 1A); (7) we suggest the decision to initiate, continue, or discontinue biologics in pregnancy be made in collaboration with a rheumatologist and be individualized to the patient (GRADE 2C); (8) we suggest treatment with a combination of prophylactic unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose aspirin for patients without a previous thrombotic event who meet obstetrical criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (GRADE 2B); (9) we recommend therapeutic unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin for patients with a history of thrombosis and antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies (GRADE 1B); (10) we suggest treatment with low-dose aspirin alone in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibodies without clinical events meeting criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (GRADE 2C); (11) we recommend that steroids not be routinely used for the treatment of fetal heart block due to anti-Sjögren’s-syndrome-related antigen A or B (anti-SSA/SSB) antibodies given their unproven benefit and the known risks for both the pregnant patient and fetus (GRADE 1C); (12) we recommend that serial fetal echocardiograms for assessment of the PR interval not be routinely performed in patients with anti-SSA/SSB antibodies outside of a clinical trial setting (GRADE 1B); (13) we recommend that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus undergo prepregnancy counseling with both maternal–fetal medicine and rheumatology specialists that includes a discussion regarding maternal and fetal risks (GRADE 1C); (14) we recommend that pregnancy be generally discouraged in patients with severe maternal risk, including patients with active nephritis; severe pulmonary, cardiac, renal, or neurologic disease; recent stroke; or pulmonary hypertension (GRADE 1C); (15) we recommend antenatal testing and serial growth scans in pregnant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus because of the increased risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and stillbirth (GRADE 1B); and (16) we recommend adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (GRADE 1B).}

However, reports have revealed that a large number of herbal medicines are implicated in the hepatic damage, which is referred to as Herbal medicines-induced liver injury (HILI). Traditional diagnostic methods for HILI include histological and serological assessments, which fail to offer real-time and unambiguous visualization of hepatotoxicity in vivo. Herein, we constructed a second near-infrared (NIR-II) luminescent nanoprobes to achieve accurate, high-efficiency, and non-invasive detection of HILI by the assembly of lanthanide-based NIR-II luminescence nanoparticles with a chromophore with absorption band in the NIR-II region. Specifically, the NIR-II luminescence of the lanthanide nanoparticles can be effectively quenched by the chromophores on the surface of nanoparticles via an absorption competition-induced quenching effect, and subsequently recovered by the pathophysiological biomarker peroxynitrite (ONOO−) generated in early HILI. It is demonstrated that the nanoprobes are capable for the screening of liver toxins in a noninvasive pattern, which is more convenient than the conventional diagnostic approaches. Finally, our luminescence detection approach offers an immediate testing technique for the identification of hepatotoxic components of herbal medicine such as colchicine, monocrotaline and stibene glucoside, providing a high-throughput screening strategy for herbal medicine-induced hepatotoxicity.}

To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine Cutaneous Regions Therapy (TCMCRT) as an adjunctive treatment for chronic heart failure.
Methods
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE database were searched to screen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TCMCRT for chronic heart failure versus conventional western treatment for chronic heart failure. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias in RCTs. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software to systematically evaluate the effects of conventional western treatment combined with TCMCRT on the cardiac function efficacy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), 6-min walk test (6MWT), Minnesota Heart Failure Quality of Life Scale (MLHFQ) and Adverse effects, as well as to evaluate the safety of this treatment modality.

18 RCT studies were finally included, with a total of 1388 patients, including 695 in the experimental group and 693 in the control group. The results of the Meta-analysis showed that the efficacy of improved cardiac function was better in the experimental group than in the control group [RR = 1.24, 95%CI (1.16, 1.32), P < 0.00001]. Improvement of LVEF in the experimental group was better than the control group [MD = 0.04, 95%CI (0.02, 0.05), P < 0.00001]. LVEDD were better in the experimental group than in the control group after treatment [MD = −3.63, 95% CI (−6.14, −1.12), P = 0.005]. The experimental group improved NT-proBNP better than the control group [MD = −586.26, 95%CI (−857.83, −314.68), P < 0.0001]. The experimental group improved 6MWT better than the control group [MD = 38.76, 95%CI (20.77, 56.75), P < 0.0001]. The experimental group improved MLHFQ values better than the control group [MD = −5.93, 95%CI (−7.70, −4.16), P < 0.00001]. Nine of the included studies mentioned the occurrence of adverse reactions, but none reported serious adverse reactions.
Conclusion
The available evidence suggests that TCMCRT has good efficacy in the adjuvant treatment of chronic heart failure. However, due to the limitations of this study, more high-quality studies are needed to further validate this conclusion.}

abstract = {Introduction
Previously, wilderness medicine (WM) fellowships offered spots to applicants using an offer date. Due in part to increases in the number of WM fellowships and applicants, in 2021, the WM program directors (PDs) agreed to conduct the first WM fellowship match through the Wilderness Medical Society graduate medical education committee. This article outlines the process used and demonstrates its feasibility.
Methods
To create an independent matching process, a simulation was performed using imaginary programs and participants. Using the same algorithm utilized by the National Resident Matching Program, this process was completed manually and by computer to ensure accuracy. The PDs shared an email with the applicants they interviewed and submitted their names. Applicants registered for the match and generated a match list. The PDs then submitted a rank list of applicants they interviewed through a similar Google form. These lists were used to run the matching algorithm both manually and by computer. Any programs that did not “fill” or applicants who did not “match” were contacted to participate in a secondary match. Following the match, a survey was sent to PDs and participants for process improvement.
Results
The match filled 11 of 14 participating programs and 15 of 19 applicants. The results obtained via a computer algorithm were consistent with multiple human validations. The survey results were mostly positive, with 2 neutral responses and no negative responses.
Conclusions
The inaugural WM fellowship match was successful in matching the majority of programs and participants and was well-received by both directors and applicants.}

Abundant of literatures verified the retina protection effect of LF on AMD-like animal models. However, previous studies on LF attenuating retinal damage mainly focused on its protection effect on pigment epithelial cells and optic ganglion cells while few reports on Müller cells. In the current study, we found that LF extracts attenuated oxidation damages and inhibited cell apoptosis of retina on a mouse retinal injury model induced by sodium iodate. LF extracts also increased expressions of Müller cell biomarker glutamine synthetase of eyeballs of model mice, which indicated that LF extract protected Müller cell from oxidation injury induced by sodium iodate. In Müller cell MIO-M1 cultures, LF also significantly inhibited cellular apoptosis induced by NaIO3 by regulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and the aqueous extracts exerted better active tendency than ethanol extracts. These data implied that the antioxidant effect of LF on protecting Müller cell might contribute to its retina repair function, thereby providing more scientific evidences for the development of LF as an alternative therapy or preventive measures for AMD.}

Some Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) have shown inhibitory effects with respect to the EMT. The current study attempted to establish a multiparametric high-content method to screen for active monomeric compounds in TCM with the ability to target cellular EMT by assessing phenotypic changes. A total of 306 monomeric compounds from the MedChemExpress (MCE) compound library were screened by the high-content screening (HCS) system and 5 compounds with anti-EMT activity, including camptothecin (CPT), dimethyl curcumin (DMC), artesunate (ART), sinapine (SNP) and berberine (BER) were identified. To confirm anti-EMT activity, expression of EMT markers was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, and cell adhesion and migration measured by cell function assays. The results revealed that CPT, DMC, ART, SNP and BER inhibited transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced expression of vimentin and α-SMA, upregulated expression of E-cadherin, increased cell adhesion and reduced cell migration. In summary, by quantifying the cell morphological changes during TGF-β1-induced EMT through multi-parametric analysis, TCM compounds with anti-EMT activity were successfully screened using the HCS system, a faster and more economical approach than conventional methods.}

This decision withdraws approval for all formulations of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (both intramuscular and subcutaneous) and applies to both brand name (Makena) and generic versions of the medication. We agree with the Food and Drug Administration determination and discourage continued prescribing of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate, including through compounding pharmacies. We do not recommend changing indications for cerclage, indications for vaginal progesterone in patients with a short cervix, or recommendations against activity restriction based on the Food and Drug Administration withdrawal of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate from the market. We recommend that discussion of the use of vaginal progesterone for primary prevention of recurrent preterm birth without input of cervical length or in those with a cervical length of ≥25 mm includes a shared decision-making process, especially if a progesterone formulation for preterm birth prevention was received in a previous pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration determined that it would be inappropriate to delay the effective date of the withdrawal to allow patients currently receiving 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate to finish treatment. We agree with the Food and Drug Administration that there is no evidence of benefit with continued treatment. Patients currently receiving 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate can be counseled that the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has not identified evidence of harm from discontinuation before 37 weeks of gestation.}

Control of pathogens has been the central dogma of treating infectious diseases in modern medicine, but the pathogen-directed medicine is facing significant challenges, including a lack of effective antimicrobials for newly emerging pathogens, pathogen drug resistance, and drug side effects. Here, a mathematic equation (termed equation of host-pathogen interactions, HPI-Equation) is developed to dissect the key variables of host-pathogen interactions. It shows that control of pathogens does not necessarily lead to host recovery. Instead, a combination of promoting a host's power of self-healing and balancing immune responses provides the best benefit for host. Moreover, the HPI-Equation elucidates the scientific basis of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a host-based medicine that treats infectious diseases by promoting self-healing power and balancing immune responses. The importance of self-healing power elucidated in the HPI-Equation is confirmed by recent studies that the tolerance mechanism, which is discovered in plants and animals and conceptually similar to self-healing power, improves host survival without directly attacking pathogens. In summary, the HPI-Equation describes host-pathogen interactions with mathematical logic and precision; it translates the ancient wisdoms of TCM into apprehensible modern sciences and opens a new venue for integrating TCM and modern medicine for a future medicine.

While many studies have focused on studying aging across multiple organs, assessment of the contribution of individual organs to overall aging processes is a cutting-edge issue. An organ’s biological age might influence the aging of other organs, revealing a multiorgan aging network. Recent data demonstrated a similar yet asynchronous inter-organs and inter-individuals progression of aging, thereby providing a foundation to track sources of declining health in old age. The integration of multiple omics with common clinical parameters through artificial intelligence has allowed the building of organ-specific aging clocks, which can predict the development of specific age-related diseases at high resolution. The peculiar individual aging-trajectory, referred to as ageotype, might provide a novel tool for a personalized anti-aging, preventive medicine. Here, we review data relative to biological aging clocks and omics-based data, suggesting different organ-specific aging rates. Additional research on longitudinal data, including young subjects and analyzing sex-related differences, should be encouraged to apply ageotyping analysis for preventive purposes in clinical practice.}

These include scaffolds for cell growth. Direct laser writing (DLW) based on femtosecond laser multi-photon polymerization (MPP) was shown to be an attractive technology for such structure fabrication as it combines vast selection of materials and the possibility to choose feature size in scaffold to be smaller, bigger, or around the same size as a cell. At the same, there are issues related to throughput which limit the widespread implementation of MPP for scaffold manufacturing. It is further compounded by some material limitations making it difficult to print mechanically flexible scaffolds for soft tissue regeneration. In this paper, we propose printing mechanically flexible scaffolds out of mechanically rigid material SZ2080 by employing chainmail architecture. We explore capabilities to optimize the printing procedure of this kind of scaffold, achieving printing times of less than 10 min for a 1 × 1 mm scaffold while maintaining micro-level precision. The superb biocompatibility of such scaffolds is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively and is proven to be independent of the used photoinitiator. Finally, manipulations of scaffolds with cells are performed with no adverse impact on the cell viability or proliferation after such procedures. Overall, this work proposes a methodology for rapid printing of shape-shifting scaffolds which could be used in regenerative medicine both for cell cultivation and potential direct implantation into soft tissue.}

The incidence of cardiovascular events remains not unusual in patients following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Chinese patent medicine (CPM) therapy based on syndrome differentiation in addition to conventional medicine (CM) had been expected to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
Purpose
To assess the effectiveness and safety of CPM based on syndrome differentiation in patients following PCI due to ACS.
Study design
Nationwide prospective cohort study.
Methods
CPM study was conducted in 40 centers in mainland China. Patients following PCI due to ACS entered to syndrome differentiation-based CPM (SDCPM) or CM group according to whether they received CPM or not. The CPM comprised Guanxin Danshen dripping pills, Qishen Yiqi dripping pills, or Danlou tablets, and was used correspondingly with the syndrome differentiation of traditional Chinese medicine. The follow-up time was 36 months. The primary endpoint was composed of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and urgent revascularization. The secondary endpoint included rehospitalization due to ACS, heart failure, stroke, other thrombotic events. Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to evaluate quality of life.
Results
Between February 2012 and December 2018, ascertainment of the primary endpoint was completed in 2,724 patients of follow-up. 1,380 patients were in SDCPM group. At a median follow-up of 541 (interquartile range 513 – 564) days, the primary endpoint occurred in 126 (8.61%) patients in SDCPM group and 167 (11.62%) patients in CM group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70; [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 – 0.89]; p = 0.003). The secondary endpoint occurred in 144 (9.84%) patients in SDCPM group and 197 (13.71%) patients in CM group (adjusted HR = 0.66; [95% CI 0.53 – 0.82]; p < 0.001). The SAQ score in SDCPM group was higher than CM group (366.78 ± 70.19 vs 356.43 ± 73.80, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences of adverse events between two groups.
Conclusion
In patients following PCI due to ACS, SDCPM in addition to CM treatment reduced the primary and secondary endpoints, as well as improved the quality of life without adverse events.}

abstract = {Objective
Based on intra-set correlation analysis, this paper deconstructs the clinical medical records of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Master ZHOU Zhongying in treating thyroid cancer, and analyzes the experience in “mechanism-syndrome-medicine-prescription” for thyroid cancer.
Methods
Through Medcase data processing platform, based on Frequent Pattern (FP)-Growth enhanced correlation analysis algorithm, the medical records of Professor ZHOU Zhongying for the treatment of thyroid cancer from June 1, 2001 to February 28, 2015 were analyzed within the set.
Results
This study involved 43 medical records, 43 patients, and 167 visits. After processing intra-set correlations, 28 groups of highly correlated symptoms, 21 groups of highly correlated tongue images, 10 groups of highly correlated pulse conditions, 28 groups of highly correlated pathogenesis, 34 groups of highly correlated herbs, and 26 groups of highly correlated western medicine diagnosis were selected. Professor ZHOU Zhongying treats thyroid cancer according to syndrome differentiation. Symptoms with more association rules included neck swelling, neck pain, cough, and dry mouth; tongue images with more association rules included dark purple tongue, dark red tongue, and fissured tongue; pulse conditions with more association rules were wiry pulse, thready pulse, small pulse, and slippery pulse; the pathogenesis with more association rules was phlegm and blood stasis, damp-heat accumulation, and impairment of both Qi and Yin; herbs with more association rules were Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix), Zeqi (Sun Euphoribiae Herb), and Tiandong (Asparagi Radix); western medicine diagnosis with more association rules included thyroid cancer, insomnia, and chronic gastritis.
Conclusion
Thyroid cancer mostly presents as deficiency in origin and excess in manifestations. The basic pathogenesis is phlegm and blood stasis, damp-heat accumulation, and impairment of both Qi and Yin, which are closely related to liver, kidney, and spleen. Professor ZHOU Zhongying adopts both attack and supplement approaches as the general treatment principle, with a strong emphasis on regulating Qi and relieving depression, eliminating phlegm and resolving stagnation, eliminating dampness and turbidity, clearing fire and destroying poison, moistening dryness and softening hard mass, invigorating Qi and nourishing Yin, and paying attention to nourishing liver and kidney, invigorating spleen and stomach, while protecting the heart and lungs.}

abstract = {Objective
Jiedu Recipe (JR), a Chinese herbal remedy, has been shown to prolong overall survival time and decrease recurrence and metastasis rates in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This work investigated the mechanism of JR in HCC treatment.
Methods
The chemical constituents of JR were detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The potential anti-HCC mechanism of JR was screened using network pharmacology and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) microarray chip assay, followed by experimental validation in human HCC cells (SMMC-7721 and Huh7) in vitro and a nude mouse subcutaneous transplantation model of HCC in vivo. HCC cell characteristics of proliferation, migration and invasion under hypoxic setting were investigated using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide, wound healing and Transwell assays, respectively. Image-iT™ Hypoxia Reagent was added to reveal hypoxic conditions. Stem cell sphere formation assay was used to detect the stemness. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers like E-cadherin, vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin, and pluripotent transcription factors including nanog homeobox, octamer-binding transcription factor 4, and sex-determining region Y box protein 2 were analyzed using Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot was performed to ascertain the anti-HCC effect of JR under hypoxia involving the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Results
According to network pharmacology and mRNA microarray chip analysis, JR may potentially act on hypoxia and inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that JR significantly decreased hypoxia, and suppressed HCC cell features of proliferation, migration and invasion; furthermore, the hypoxia-induced increases in EMT and stemness marker expression in HCC cells were inhibited by JR. Results based on the co-administration of JR and an agonist (LiCl) or inhibitor (IWR-1-endo) verified that JR suppressed HCC cancer stem-like properties under hypoxia by blocking the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Conclusion
JR exerts potent anti-HCC effects by inhibiting cancer stemness via abating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway under hypoxic conditions.

In view of this, our group proposed a scientific hypothesis that “CHMs with similar nature should have similar materialbasis”. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we developed a novel multi-wavelength high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint similarity metric scheme for cold-hot nature identification. We explored a multi-wavelength distance metric learning model to compute the similarity of CHM ingredients, and developed an improved k-nearest neighbor algorithm based on multi-wavelength HPLC fusion (KMHF) to predict cold-hot nature of CHMs. Firstly, multi-wavelength HPLC fingerprints were used to extract the characteristic information of CHM ingredients. Secondly, we defined the similarity of CHM ingredients as semantic relevance and fingerprint similarity. We studied a multi-wavelength distance metric to measure the similarity of CHM ingredients. The learned distance metric could discover complementary characteristics of different wavelength HPLC through an optimization algorithm. Finally, an improved multi-wavelength k-nearest neighbor algorithm KMHF was proposed to analyze the relationship between cold-hot nature and CHM ingredients. Numerous experiments were designed to test the feasibility of the proposed KMHF algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the performance of our KMHF algorithm outperforms that of the compared algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the hypothesis that CHMs with similar cold-hot nature have similar material basis. The KMHF model is evaluated to be feasible for nature identification.}

In doing so, we apply Cross-Quantilogram Dynamic Connectedness based on Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) approaches to analyse historical high-frequency time-series data. TVP-VAR results show that health-tech equity is the highest volatility transmitter while Medicare price is the highest volatility receiver. We also find medicine producer price is the net volatility contributor while the retail price of medicine is the net volatility receiver. The Cross-Quantilogram analysis confirms a strong bivariate quantile dependence between respective markets at a higher quantile of each market. Cross-quantilogram demonstrates a higher level of connectedness among the markets when considering medium and long memory. We observe health-tech equity turned to be a profound volatility contributor, while medicine price (both producer and retail prices) and Medicare appeared to net volatility receiver during the time of COVID19 Pandemic. The financial performance of health-tech equity returns elevates the price volatility of medicine and eventually Medicare cost, which imply that equity return should be incorporated forming medicine prices.}

With the continuous expansion of culture scale and the deterioration of culture environment, various diseases have broken out frequently, leading to huge economic losses to fish farming. Antibiotics and chemicals are common options to prevent and control of fish diseases, but their use is now restricted or even banned due to serious problems such as drug residues, pathogen resistance, and environmental pollution. Herbs and their extracts have increasingly become promising supplements and alternatives, because of their effectiveness, safety, environmental friendliness and less drug resistance. The application of herbal medicines in prevention and control of fish diseases is mainly attributed to the powerful immune enhancement, antioxidation or direct anti-pathogenic efficacies of their effective components, including mainly polyphenols, polysaccharides, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and essential oils. Recently these herbal active ingredients have been extensively studied for their efficacies in prevention and control of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal diseases in fish. In the present paper, we comprehensively summarize the research progress of the active ingredients of herbal medicines used for prevention and control of fish diseases, especially of their action mechanisms, and highlight the potential application of the herbal medicines in fish aquaculture.}

Cadmium (Cd) is an internationally recognized heavy metal contaminant. In this paper, 270 reports on Cd in TCMMs were screened from 1969 publications covering 243 species in 81 families. According to the source of the TCMMs, the data were divided into the following categories: aboveground part, bark, flower and fruit, herb, leaf and rhizome. The temporal dynamics of the Cd content and its correlations with the habitats and categories (parts) of TCMMs were also studied. The results show that 22.05 % of the investigated TCMM samples exceeded the relevant domestic standards (Cd≤0.3 mg/kg), among which the maximum Cd content was 17.75 mg/kg. Myrtaceae and Syzygium aromaticum were the family and species with the highest mean Cd content, respectively. Regarding the source of TCMMs of great concern, the mean Cd content of TCMMs decreased in the order of herb > aboveground part > flower and fruit > leaf > rhizome > bark. In addition, in terms of the spatiotemporal distribution, the spatial distribution of the mean Cd content of TCMMs was significantly higher on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, followed by Southwest China. When comparing different times, more serious Cd pollution of TCMMs existed after 2000, and the highest mean Cd content was observed in 2000–2004. In summary, soil acidity must be decreased and the cultivation conditions of Cd-hyperaccumulators such as Ligusticum chuanxiong and Lonicera japonica must be modified, in conjunction with a scientific health risk assessment, to ensure the sustainable development of TCMMs.}

abstract = {Introduction
Obesity is currently a major global concern, requiring the development of effective therapeutics. This study determines the inhibitory activity against FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) of food plant-derived bioactive compounds of TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) importance, by in silico approaches.
Methods
Food plant-derived phytochemicals, such as curcumin (CCMN), cajaisoflavone (CJIF), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3OG) and pelargonidin-3-glucoside (P3GS), were selected as ligands, and docked to FTO. The reference FTO-inhibitor used was meclofenmic acid (MCFA). MDS (molecular dynamic simulations) was accomplished with 10 ns run for the docked complex of FTO with the most potential phytocompound. The phytochemicals were subjected to bioactivity scoring, Lipinski's rule of five screening, and ADMET prediction. Law
Results
Molecular docking demonstrated binding energies of -9.4, -8.8, -8.7 and -8.2 kcal/mol for CCMN, CJIF, C3OG and P3GS, respectively. The reference inhibitor MCFA had binding energy of -7.8 kcal/mol, and therefore, the FTO inhibition capacity of the ligands were in order of CCMN > C3OG > P3GS > CJIF > MCFA. The FTO residues His231, Ser229, Val228, Leu109, Tyr108 and Pro93 played crucial role in protein-ligands interaction displaying hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. MDS-based MM/GB(PB)SA binding free energies authenticated CCMN (-6.67/-8.77 kcal/mol) as a stronger FTO inhibitor than MCFA (0.19/-0.02 kcal/mol). Pharmacological properties of the phytochemicals predicted were comparable to MCFA standard.
Discussion
TCM compounds of botanical origin are important for the effective management of obesity. In the current study, all the phytochemicals, the potential TCM ingredients, with acceptable pharmacological properties displayed excellent binding affinity and stronger inhibitory activity against FTO, compared to MCFA. FTO_CCMN displayed more energetic stability compared to FTO_MCFA using MM/GB(PB)SA approaches. Overall, this study paved the basis of FTO-associated obesity management with food plant-based therapeutics of TCM importance in the globe.}

Symptom-based diagnostic criteria of depression leads to notorious heterogeneity and subjectivity.
Methods
The study was conducted in two stages at two sites: development of a neuroimaging-based subtyping and precise repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) strategy for depression at Center 1 and its clinical application at Center 2. Center 1 identified depression subtypes and subtype-specific rTMS targets based on amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in a cohort of 238 major depressive disorder patients and 66 healthy controls (HC). Subtypes were identified using a Gaussian Mixture Model, and subtype-specific rTMS targets were selected based on dominant brain regions prominently differentiating depression subtypes from HC. Subsequently, one classifier was employed and 72 hospitalized, depressed youths at Center 2 received two-week precise rTMS. MRI and clinical assessments were obtained at baseline, midpoint, and treatment completion for evaluation.
Results
Two neuroimaging subtypes of depression, archetypal and atypical depression, were identified based on distinct frontal-posterior functional imbalance patterns as measured by ALFF. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was identified as the rTMS target for archetypal depression, and the occipital cortex for atypical depression. Following precise rTMS, ALFF alterations were normalized in both archetypal and atypical depressed youths, corresponding with symptom response of 90.00% in archetypal depression and 70.73% in atypical depression.
Conclusions
A precision medicine framework for depression was developed based on objective neurobiomarkers and implemented with promising results, actualizing a subtyping-treatment-evaluation closed loop in depression. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted.}

This mini-review aims to discuss the (i) TCM theory, (ii) pharmacology mechanisms, and (iii) toxicology of the commonly used TCMs, such as “Celastrol”, “Astragalus”, “Curcumin” in the treatment of liver diseases, and further (iv) describe the help of modern “Nanotechnology” with these TCMs in future development for curing liver diseases.
Methods
Nine electronic databases were searched between 2012 and 2022, including WanFang Data, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer Link, SciFinder, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), without regard to language constraints. The searched keywords include “Celastrol + liver diseases”, “Astragalus + liver disease” "Curcumin + liver diseases", etc. All eligible studies are analyzed and summarized in this review.
Results
Celastrol, Astragalus, and Curcumin were reported to be effective Chinese herbals for the prevention and treatment of liver diseases through cyclic adenylate monophosphate (cAMP)–protein kinase A (PKA)–nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), miR-712-PPAR-γ-PI3K/AKT-GLUT4, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. Nanoformulations could improve physiochemical features and enhance the efficacy of Chinese herbs.
Conclusion
Celastrol, Astragalus, and Curcumin as commonly used TCMs for the treatment of liver diseases possess a wide extent of pharmacological functions, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer properties. Nanoformulations of Chinese herbs show great promise in the development of traditional Chinese medicines for treating liver diseases.}

The study purpose was to assess current beliefs among family medicine and internal medicine physicians regarding effectiveness of various types of cancer screening. A national sample of 582 physicians from the American Medical Association’s Physician Masterfile were surveyed. Participants were asked about their perceived effectiveness of screening for colon, lung, breast, prostate, and cervical cancer among average, healthy individuals. Chi-square tests were conducted to assess relationships between perceiving screening tests to be ‘very effective in reducing cancer-related mortality’ and demographic characteristics. A substantial majority of physicians perceived colonoscopy (83.8%) and Pap smear (82.9%) to be very effective. Perceiving low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), Pap smear, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as ‘very effective’ differed by gender, with females less likely to endorse LDCT and Pap smear but more likely to endorse PSA. Perceiving PSA as ‘very effective’ differed by age and graduation year, with younger or more recently graduated physicians being less likely to perceive PSA as ‘very effective’. Non-Hispanic Black/African-American physicians were more likely to perceive mammography as ‘very effective’ than other groups. Physicians’ perceived effectiveness about cancer screening tests varies widely and may influence their recommendations or usage of these tests. Understanding physicians’ beliefs can help in improving uptake of evidence-based screening tests by providers and patients to promote early detection and successful treatment.}

An estimated 25% of the adult Swiss population use complementary and alternative medicines (CAM), but their use in people with substance use disorder (SUD) in Switzerland is unknown. In this population, few patients seek care, around 15% (“treatment gap”). The aim of this study is to investigate the use of CAM, the reasons for their use, as well as the wishes and beliefs related to CAM in patients seeking care for alcohol and/or tobacco use disorder in an outpatient unit of Geneva University Hospitals.
Methods
Cross-sectional observational study based on standardized interview and questionnaire.
Results
Of 40 patients recruited, 62.5% used or had used CAM, at least half for comorbid disorders and not specifically for their SUD. Almost all wanted the integration of CAM into the health system and believed that their general practitioner should be able to redirect them to a CAM specialist if indicated.
Conclusion
Promoting knowledge and use of CAM could potentially facilitate their entry in care and reduce the treatment gap in patients with SUD. Research on interest in CAM for patients with SUD should not only focus on reduction of substance use, but also on the improvement of comorbid disorders and symptoms.}

With the rapid development of genomics, personalized diagnosis and treatment using specific genes may be a robust strategy to break through the bottleneck of traditional tumor treatment. Nevertheless, efficient in vivo gene delivery has been frequently hampered by the inherent defects of vectors and various biological barriers. Encouragingly, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) with good modularity and programmability are excellent candidates capable of addressing traditional gene transfer-associated issues, which enables SNAs a precision nanoplatform with great potential for diverse biomedical applications. In this regard, there have been detailed reviews of SNA in drug delivery, gene regulation, and dermatology treatment. Still, to the best of our knowledge, there is no published systematic review summarizing the use of SNAs in oncology precision medicine and immunotherapy, which are considered new guidelines for oncology treatment. To this end, we summarized the notable advances in SNAs-based precision therapy and immunotherapy for tumors following a classification standard of different types of precise spatiotemporal control on active species by SNAs. Specifically, we focus on the structural diversity and programmability of SNAs. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions were discussed in the concluding remarks. This review will promote the rational design and development of SNAs for tumor-precise medicine and immunotherapy.}

abstract = {Background
Development of clinically effective neuroprotective agents for stroke therapy is still a challenging task. Microglia play a critical role in brain injury and recovery after ischemic stroke. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHMs) are based on a unique therapeutic principle, have various formulas, and have long been widely used to treat stroke. Therefore, the active compounds in TCHMs and their underlying mechanisms of action are attracting increasing attention in the field of stroke drug development.
Purpose
To summarize the regulatory mechanisms of TCHM-derived natural compounds on the microglial response in animal models of ischemic stroke.
Methods
We searched studies published until 10 April 2023 in the Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect using the following keywords: natural compounds, natural products or phytochemicals, traditional Chinese Medicine or Chinese herbal medicine, microglia, and ischemic stroke. This review was prepared according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines.
Results
Natural compounds derived from TCHMs can attenuate the M1 phenotype of microglia, which is involved in the detrimental inflammatory response, via inhibition of NF-κB, MAPKs, JAK/STAT, Notch, TLR4, P2X7R, CX3CR1, IL-17RA, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and pro-oxidant enzymes. Additionally, the neuroprotective response of microglia with the M2 phenotype can be enhanced by activating Nrf2/HO-1, PI3K/AKT, AMPK, PPARγ, SIRT1, CB2R, TREM2, nAChR, and IL-33/ST2. Several clinical trials showed that TCHM-derived natural compounds that regulate microglial responses have significant and safe therapeutic effects, but further well-designed clinical studies are needed.
Conclusions
Further research regarding the direct targets and potential pleiotropic or synergistic effects of natural compounds would provide a more reasonable approach for regulation of the microglial response with the possibility of successful stroke drug development.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Ginseng has been used for thousands of years, it is described as both a tonic for restoration of strength and a panacea. However, the adverse effect is also reported clinically. In the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the occurrence of adverse reactions is closely related to warm property of ginseng, which can easily lead to fireness (火, in Chinese). Several presumptions indicated that fireness of ginseng may be associated with the pathophysiology of inflammation, imbalance of metabolism, the disorder of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis.
Aim of the study
The tonifying effect of ginseng medicines was always focused on with little attention for their adverse effects. We selected red ginseng (RG), ginseng (GS), American ginseng (AG), and ginseng leaves (GL) as typical ginseng medicines to clarify correlations of adverse effect and tonifying effect of ginseng medicines.
Materials and methods
The RG, GS, AG, and GL decoctions were orally administered to rats for 30 days consecutively. The appearance indicators such as saliva secretion, urinary output, fecal moisture, heart rate were determined, and hair condition, nose color were also observed. Furthermore, some biochemical indexes such as IL-6, T3, T4, TSH, ACTH, CORT, Ach, DA, EPI, NE, SP, VIP, cAMP, cGMP, AQP-5, AMPK, and the activity of SOD, GSH-PX, Na+-K+-ATPase were measured by biochemical reagent kits or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The metabolites profile was analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Finally, the diversity of gut microbiota was also analyzed with the 16S rDNA sequencing.
Results
The study revealed the tonifying effects of ginseng medicines mainly on exciting nervous system, promoting immunity and antioxidative ability. While, the adverse effects were mainly associated with the abnormal nervous system, thyroid system, adrenal system, and oxidative stress. The GS group showed fireness symptoms, such as vertical and dirty hair, epistaxis, higher rectal temperature, lower salivary secretion, lower urinary output, lower fecal moisture. While the GL group showed the opposite symptoms. The levels of hormones, activities of the antioxidative enzyme, and Na+-K+-ATP enzyme were changed differently. From the second week to the fourth week, the levels of T3, T4, TSH, ACTH, CORT, and the activity of SOD, GSH-PX, Na+-K+-ATP enzymes were first increased, then decreased, and finally recovered to normal levels. We also found that the ginseng medicines mainly adjust the amino acid and TCA cycle metabolism exhibiting their tonifying and adverse effects. Meanwhile, GS and AG can modulate gut microbiota imbalance by increasing the gut microbial diversity as well as selectively promoting some probiotic populations, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
Conclusions
This is the first time to report the correlations between tonifying effects and adverse effects of four ginseng medicines. The present study demonstrated that the adverse effects of ginseng medicines mostly depended on their dosages, the higher dosage is, the more serious the adverse effects are. The adverse effects of ginseng and ginseng leaves are much more serious than red ginseng and American ginseng. The tendency of water regulation of ginseng and ginseng leaves was opposite may be related to their nature property.}

Such disorders typically manifest during development or postnatal growth and result in significant morbidity and mortality. The development of curative treatments for connective tissue disorders is hampered in part by the inability of many mature connective tissues to efficiently regenerate. To be most effective, therapeutic strategies designed to preserve or restore tissue function will likely need to be initiated during phases of significant endogenous connective tissue remodeling and organ sculpting postnatally and directly target the underlying ECM protein mutations. With recent advances in whole exome sequencing, in-vitro and in-vivo disease modeling, and the development of mutation-specific molecular therapeutic modalities, it is now feasible to directly correct disease-causing mutations underlying connective tissue disorders and ameliorate their pathogenic consequences. These technological advances may lead to potentially curative personalized medicine approaches for connective tissue disorders that have previously been considered incurable. In this review, we highlight innovative therapeutic modalities including gene replacement, exon skipping, DNA/mRNA editing, and pharmacological approaches that were used to preserve or restore tissue function in the context of connective tissue disorders. Inherent to a successful application of these approaches is the need to deepen the understanding of mechanisms that regulate ECM formation and homeostasis, and to decipher how individual mutations in ECM proteins compromise ECM and connective tissue development and function.}

The formation of CKs is influenced by both the pyrolysis temperature (600–800 °C) and activation of potassium citrate, which etches pores on biochar derived from licorice residues and induces the formation of nanoflower-like hierarchical porous carbon. The use of CK-600 as a negative electrode material in a three-electrode system resulted in an outstanding specific capacitance of 221 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 82 % capacity retention even at 10 A g−1, and long-term stability. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor CK-600//CK-600 device delivered a high energy density (7.57 Wh kg−1). Porous carbon produced through a simple one-step pyrolysis is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, thereby enhancing the comprehensive value of Chinese medicine residues.}

abstract = {Background
The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend administration of antimicrobials within the first hour of recognition of sepsis. Over the last decade, several studies have demonstrated improved time-to-antibiotic administration and antibiotic appropriateness when a pharmacist was involved in the care of patients with sepsis. To our knowledge, no studies evaluating the appropriate use of antibiotics in sepsis driven entirely by an Emergency Medicine (EM) Clinical Pharmacist Practitioner (CPP) have been published. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an EM CPP-driven protocol on antimicrobial interventions in patients with sepsis in the emergency department (ED).
Methods
This was a retrospective comparison of patients with sepsis for whom antimicrobials were ordered in the ED without pharmacist intervention to patients whose antimicrobials were ordered by an EM CPP via a sepsis consult to pharmacy. An EM CPP reviewed individual patient profiles for pertinent historical admissions, culture data, and allergy profiles to guide antimicrobial selection for the suspected source of infection and entered orders under their scope of practice with formal documentation in the electronic medical record (EMR). The primary objective of this study was to compare the rates of appropriate empiric antibiotic utilization in septic patients admitted from the ED pre- and post-protocol implementation. Secondary endpoints included the following, broadening of ED-initiated empiric antibiotics on hospital admission, time-to-antibiotic administration, in-hospital mortality, Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) association with in-hospital mortality, and hospital length of stay.
Results
A total of 144 patients were included: 80 patients prescribed antibiotics without pharmacist intervention and 64 prescribed antibiotics by an EM CPP. Appropriate empiric antibiotic selection in the ED improved from 57.5% (46/80) to 86% (55/64) with EM CPP intervention (difference 28.5%; p < 0.01). Time-to-first antibiotic administration decreased by 64 min (p < 0.01). Administration of antibiotics within 60 min, broadening of antibiotics on admission, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality did not significantly differ across groups.
Conclusions
In this small, single-center study, an EM Clinical Pharmacist Practitioner-driven protocol for patients with sepsis in the emergency department improved the rate of appropriate empiric antimicrobial selection and time-to-antibiotic administration.}

abstract = {Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), involved in multiple pathophysiological processes including inflammation, is a thermally activated, non-selective cation channel. It has been identified that TRPV1 is highly involved in some common respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary infection by participating in neurogenic and immunogenic inflammation, sensitization, and oxidative stress. In recent years, the hypothesis of transient receptor potential (TRP) has been introduced in studies on the theory of five flavors and four properties of Chinese medicinal. However, the hypothesis is undetermined due to the multi-component and multi-target characteristics of Chinese medicinal. This study describes the relations between TRPV1 and four types of respiratory diseases based on the literature in recent five years. In the meantime, the therapeutic effect of Chinese medicinal by intervening TRPV1 was reviewed, in an attempt to provide certain evidence for future studies on the medicinal property-effect relationship, mechanism of drug action, the syndrome differentiation in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for respiratory diseases and to help for new drug development.}

abstract = {Background
Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is expanding as a diagnostic tool in pediatric emergency medicine. Pediatricians are apprehensive to take on the risk of malpractice from incorrect interpretation of PoCUS imaging, therefore limiting its use. Although current studies provide reassurance to this concern, none look directly at the risk for pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Our study aims to evaluate the current medicolegal risk landscape posed by PoCUS in pediatric emergency medicine.
Methods
A search of case law was performed utilizing the LexisNexis caselaw database for the period of January 2011 through December 2021. Initial search results were reviewed by the attorney co-authors for relevance to medical malpractice surrounding PoCUS. The remaining cases were reviewed by physician co-authors to ensure their relevance to both ultrasound and the acute care setting. Identified cases were then classified into categories as per the reason for the claim.
Results
No cases of malpractice litigation were identified that directly related to PoCUS. Ten cases of ultrasound in the acute care setting were identified, 7 of which were in pediatric patients. The majority of these cases related to appendicitis or testicular torsion. Of these 10 cases, 2 cases claimed failure to consider the ultimate diagnosis, but ultrasound would have been an appropriate study had the diagnosis been considered. Of the 8 remaining cases, 6 were based on failure to perform or delay performing ultrasound, 1 claimed that improper ultrasound study was initially performed, and 1 case was based on an improper diagnosis made by ultrasound.
Discussion
PoCUS does not appear to pose a significant risk of malpractice litigation in pediatric emergency medicine.}

abstract = {The cult (system of religious beliefs and rituals) of saints in Western Europe appeared in the 3rd century CE and gained momentum from the 4th to the 6th centuries. Its importance for European society in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages was undeniable; holy medicine was the only hope for sick people because the number of physicians was insufficient, and usually physicians were helpless in the face of most of the ailments that plagued society at that time. The number of saints had increased over the years, and people sought medical help from them through prayer and other religious practices. Some saints “specialized” in the treatment of various wounds, including skin diseases. Our research revealed many saints who were patrons of wounds and skin. They can be collected in three groups: patron saints against snakebites and dog bites; patron saints of the treatment of wounds, ulcers, burns, and frostbite; and patron saints against spreadable diseases such as ergotism, leprosy, and scabies. The large number of saints who were patrons against snakebites and dog bites shows the relevance and importance of the problem. In our research, we tried to find out whether the cult of saints led to the development of hospitals for the treatment of skin diseases like ergotism in the hospital of Brother St. Anthony or only in miracles of healing emphasizing the power of faith in the cure of diseases.}

However, there are still many issues in the promotion and development of TCM, such as a lot of unique TCM treatments are taught only between the master and an apprentice in practice, it takes dozens of years for a TCM practitioner to master them and the complicated TCM treatment principles. Intelligent TCM models, as a promising method, can overcome these issues. The performance of previously proposed AI models for intelligent TCM is restricted since they rely on clinical medical records, which are limited, hard to collect, and unavailable for intelligent TCM researchers. In this work, we propose a two-stage transfer learning model to generate TCM prescriptions from a few medical records and TCM documentary resources, called TCMBERT for short. First, the TCMBERT is trained on TCM books. Then, it is fine-tuned on a limited number of medical records to generate TCM prescriptions. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in all comparison baselines on the TCM prescription generation task. The TCMBERT and the training process can be used in TCM tasks and other medical tasks for dealing with textual resources.}

Personalized medicine consists of a targeted drug that is only prescribed if a companion diagnostic test detects the corresponding biomarker. This concept promises improved treatments of various diseases. However, personalized medicine also presents pharmaceutical firms with new challenges resulting from interdependencies in the drug and diagnostic test development processes. Although pharmaceutical firms generally benefit from competition among diagnostic firms, the threat of substitutes from competitors could cause diagnostic firms to step back from new product development in the first place, leading to lost revenues for the pharmaceutical firm. We consider a pharmaceutical firm that may inform two competing differentiated diagnostic firms about a drug under development, such that these firms can develop a corresponding diagnostic test. We show which diagnostic firm the pharmaceutical firm should inform first and how granting early exclusivity to a single diagnostic firm can maximize pharmaceutical profits from personalized medicine.}

Many studies have demonstrated the powerful neuroprotection abilities of multiple traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) against NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated ischemic cerebral injury. These TCMs may be in the form of TCM prescriptions, Chinese herbal medicines and their extracts, and TCM monomers.
Aim of the study
This review aimed to analyze and summarize the existing knowledge on the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). We also summarized the mechanism of action of the various TCMs on the NLRP3 inflammasome, which may provide new insights for the management of IS.
Materials and methods
We reviewed recently published articles by setting the keywords “NLRP3 inflammasome” and “traditional Chinese medicines” along with “ischemic stroke”; “NLRP3 inflammasome” and “ischemic stroke” along with “natural products” and so on in Pubmed and GeenMedical.
Results
According to recent studies, 16 TCM prescriptions (officially authorized products and clinically effective TCM prescriptions), 7 Chinese herbal extracts, and 29 TCM monomers show protective effects against IS through anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptotic, and anti-mitochondrial autophagy effects.
Conclusions
In this review, we analyzed studies on the involvement of NLRP3 in IS therapy. Further, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the current knowledge to provide a reference for the further application of TCMs in the treatment of IS.}

abstract = {Objectives
There are no international guidelines on how the requirements for added clinical value (endpoints) should be prepared in terms of drug safety by entities performing health technology assessments (HTAs). The study aimed to review the Danish Medicines Council's drug safety endpoints
Methods
Safety endpoints prepared by the Danish Medicines Council's expert committees were reviewed from their assessment reports for 50 treatments, of which 25 were for the treatment of cancer and 25 were for the treatment of other types of diseases. Similarities and differences were identified
Results
The 139 endpoints for safety were grouped into 14 categories. The use of endpoints varied and all endpoints were based on an expert assessment. Serious adverse reactions/events were used as an endpoint in most of the cases: 43.2% (N=60)/15.8% (N=22), following treatment discontinuation based on four different causes 16.4% (N=32). A numerical grading scale for adverse events were predominately used for endpoints for cancer treatment (19.8%, N=20 vs. 2.1%, N=2)
Conclusions
The variation in the use of endpoints reflects the complexity of safety assessments and the need for more standardization to promote stringency and transparency. The authors propose five recommendations for actions, which may promote more generalizability and transparency. International HTA entities and researchers are also encouraged to investigate the possibilities of establishing a universal grading system for adverse events and to develop international guidelines for safety assessment in HTAs.
Public interest abstract
New medicines often have to be evaluated against the treatment already available in order to compare effectiveness, safety and price. If one treatment is superior, it will often be referred to as having added clinical value. This evaluation is known as a health technology assessment (HTA). All medicines can cause side effects and the assessment of safety in HTAS is therefore essential. No international guidelines for drug safety assessment in HTAs however exist. The requirements for safety prepared by the Danish Medicines Council's expert committees were therefore reviewed from their assessment reports for 50 treatments in order to present their approach to drug safety assessment. A total of 139 safety requirements, also referred to as endpoints, were identified. The use of endpoints varied which reflects the complexity of safety assessments and the need for more standardization to promote stringency. The authors propose five recommendations for actions, which may promote more generalizability and transparency in Denmark and internationally.}
