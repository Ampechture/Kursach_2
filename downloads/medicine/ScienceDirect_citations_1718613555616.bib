Unscrupulous businesses persistently introduce novel illegal adulterants, making it necessary to develop methods to screen compounds not present in the current library. Conventional cosine similarity for mass spectral libraries matching is limited in their ability to identify structurally similar compounds. In our previous study, comparison of performance among four advanced similarity algorithms revealed that Spec2Vec exhibited the best performance in terms of both detection capability and false discovery rate, making it the chosen method for identifying illegal adulterants. However, Spec2Vec still exhibited worse performance compared to MS2DeepScore and entropy similarity in the aspects of detection capability and false discovery rate, respectively. In this study, our objective was to optimize the performance of spectral similarity for a specific compound class by fine-tuning a pretrained Spec2Vec model. Additionally, we implemented the chemical classification tool CANOPUS to address the issue of similarities in backbone structures between illegal adulterants and compounds found in herbal medicine, which can lead to false positives. We utilized glucocorticoids as potentially illicit adulterants to provide a proof-of-concept, and the results demonstrated that the fine-tuned Spec2Vec model not only exhibits a significant improvement in detection ability compared to the original model but also achieves comparable performance to MS2Deepscore. Moreover, the fine-tuned Spec2Vec model shows notably fewer false positives in comparison to MS2Deepscore. Overall, this proposed pipeline demonstrates high effectiveness and competitiveness in inspecting illegal adulterants, enhancing the analysis of large-scale MS data.}

According to the ROC area under the curve (AUC), the cold-hot herb property classification model was screened. The a priori and K-means algorithms were used to mine key molecules related to cold-hot properties.The AUC of the ML models and fusion models under the ROC curve after 10 rounds of folding cross-verification was above 0.75. Mining obtained 15 cold key compounds (CKCs), 26 hot key compounds (HKCs), a CKC structure similarity of 0.75 on average, and an HKC structure similarity of 0.69 on average. The average similarity between the molecular structures of CKCs compounds and HKCs compounds was 0.18, lower than 0.5. Twelve physical and chemical indices, such as molecular weight (MW) and molecular hydrophobicity (Alogp), had a statistically significant difference in molecular characteristics (P<0.05).In this study, the classification model and algorithm (RF&GNB Ensemble Classifier) of TCM cold-hot properties constructed from the molecular level of compounds are robust. At the same time, it was found that Chinese herbs with the same medicinal properties had a common molecular structure, while Chinese herbs with different medicinal properties had different molecular structures. In terms of physicochemical characteristics, compounds have statistically significant differences.}

First, the chemical compositions in Jinlian Qingre granules (JQG) were analyzed and identified using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Next, the HPLC fingerprint of JQG was established, and chemometrics were employed to evaluate JQG quality. Then, potential anti-inflammatory bioactive constituents were screened using a fingerprinting-effect relationship model utilizing partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a back propagation neural network optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA-BPNN). On this basis, Q-markers of JQG were determined and analyzed using quantitative analysis of multi-components by the single marker (QAMS) employing three components as reference substances (RS). 24 chemical constituents in JQG were characterized using UHPLC-HRMS. Twenty-four common peaks were assigned to the fingerprint. Six compounds, mangiferin, 2′'-O-beta-L-galactopyranosylorientin, orientin, veratric acid, vitexin, and harpagoside, identified from the common peaks associated with anti-inflammatory efficacy, could be used as Q-markers of JQG. The content determination results displayed no significant difference in the content of Q-markers in 20 batches of JQG samples measured using the external standard method and QAMS. Q-markers could be efficiently screened and determined by integrating multidisciplinary technologies. This comprehensive strategy could be beneficial for the thorough evaluation of CMP.}

This leads to a working disease nosology based on gradients of four types of genetic architecture: monogenic, polygenic, GTD, and mixed. We present four scenarios under which GTD may occur; namely, subsets of traditionally Mendelian disease, modifiable Tier 1 monogenic conditions, variable penetrance, and situations where a genetic mutational spectrum produces qualitatively divergent pathologies. The implications of the new nosology in precision medicine are discussed, in which therapeutic options may target the molecular cause or the disease phenotype.}

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common gynecological endocrine and metabolic disorder. Chinese herbal medicine has some advantages in the treatment of PCOS with its unique theoretical system and rich clinical practice experiences.
Aim of the study
The present study was to investigate the potential mechanisms of Bu-Shen-Jian-Pi Formula (BSJPF) on the treatment of PCOS.
Material and methods
The combination of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS) rapid analysis, network pharmacology, molecular docking analysis and bio-experiments were firstly conducted to identify the main effective components of BSJPF, and to predict the potential mechanisms. The ovarian granulosa cell line (KGN) was treated with testosterone to construct the PCOS model in vitro, and the cells were further treated with the lyophilized powder of BSJPF. The levels of proliferation, autophagy and apoptosis were detected to explore the mechanisms of BSJPF on treating PCOS.
Results
Firstly, thirty-six active compounds were identified in BSJPF and thirty-one potential targets on PCOS were found. Then, PI3K and PDK1 were verified to have good binding activity with the active compounds through molecular docking analysis. In bio-experiments, BSJPF significantly alleviated the arrested proliferation of KGN cells in G0/G1 phase and reduced the active levels of autophagy and apoptosis of KGN cells induced by testosterone. Additionally, the inhibition of autophagy diminished apoptosis, while the repression apoptosis enhanced autophagy. Finally, BSJPF significantly decreased the FOXO1 expression levels induced by testosterone, especially for nuclear FOXO1, and significantly activated the PI3K/AKT pathway.
Conclusions
BSJPF significantly alleviated the activated autophagy and apoptosis in KGN induced by testosterone through PI3K/AKT1/FOXO1pathway, which is an effective treatment for PCOS.}

Non-invasive imaging enables timelier diagnosis, reducing diagnostic delay, risk and expense of surgery. This review updates literature exploring the diagnostic value of specialist endometriosis magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI), nuclear medicine (NM) and computed tomography (CT). Searching after the 2016 IDEA consensus, 6192 publications were identified, with 27 studies focused on imaging for endometriosis. eMRI was the subject of 14 papers, NM and CT, 11, and artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing eMRI, 2. eMRI papers describe diagnostic accuracy for endometriosis, methodologies, and innovations. Advantages of eMRI include its: ability to diagnose endometriosis in those unable to tolerate transvaginal endometriosis ultrasound (eTVUS); a panoramic pelvic view, easy translation to surgical fields; identification of hyperintense iron in endometriotic lesions; and ability to identify super-pelvic lesions. Sequence standardization means eMRI is less operator-dependent than eTVUS, but higher costs limit its role to a secondary diagnostic modality. eMRI for deep and ovarian endometriosis has sensitivities of 91-93.5% and specificities of 86-87.5% making it reliable for surgical mapping and diagnosis. Superficial lesions too small for detection in larger capture sequences, means a negative eMRI doesn’t exclude endometriosis. Combined with thin sequence capture and improved reader expertise, eMRI is poised for rapid adoption into clinical practice. NM labeling is diagnostically limited in absence of suitable unique marker for endometrial-like tissue. CT studies expose the reproductively aged to radiation. AI diagnostic tools, combining independent eMRI and eTVUS endometriosis markers, may result in powerful capability. Broader eMRI use, will optimize standards and protocols. Reporting systems correlating to surgical anatomy will facilitate interdisciplinary preoperative dialogues. eMRI endometriosis diagnosis should reduce repeat surgeries with mental and physical health benefits for patients. There is potential for early eMRI diagnoses to prevent chronic pain syndromes and protect fertility outcomes.}

Despite this, these actors are for the most part excluded from health systems and policy research. In this paper, we ask ‘what happens to the conceptualisations of a health system when medicine sellers and their practices are foregrounded in research?’ We respond by arguing that these sellers sit uncomfortably in the mechanical logic in which health systems are imagined as bounded institutions, tightly integrated and made up of intertwined and interconnected spaces, through which policies, ideas, capital and commodities flow. They challenge the functionalist holism that runs through the complex adaptive systems (CAS) approach. We propose that health systems are better understood as social fields in which unequally positioned social agents (the health worker, managers, patients, carers, citizens, politicians) compete and cooperate over the same limited resources. We draw on ethnographic research from Uganda (2018–2019) to analyse the responses of different actors to a new policy that sought to rationalise the medicines retail sector and exclude drug shops from urban centres. We examine the emergence of new lobby groups who contested the policy and secured the rights of ‘drug shop vendors’ to trade on the basis that these shops are increasingly populated by trained nurses and clinical officers, who are surplus to the capacity of the formal health system and so look to markets to make a living. The paper adds to the growing anthropological literature on health systems that allows for a focus on social change and a form of holism that enables phenomena to be connected to diverse elements of the context in which they emerge.}

abstract = {Background
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a massive threat to public health worldwide. Siddha system of medicine is one of the traditional medicines of South India. The recommended formulations in Siddha Sasthric Medicines- Fixed Regimen (SSM-FiRe) are Amukkura tablets, Kaba Sura Kudineer (KSK) for asymptomatic COVID-19 positive (RT-PCR) patients, and Athimathuram tablets, Adathodai Manappagu syrup, Thippili Rasayanam, Brahmananda Bairavam tablet, and Notchi Kudineer for mild symptomatic patients. The core objective of the trial was to document the efficacy of SSM-FiRe in the prevention of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 disease progression to the next level of severity, reduce the severity of symptoms and revert to RT-PCR Negative.
Methods
An exploratory, prospective, open-labeled, single-arm, non-randomized trial was designed as per GCP guidelines to assess the efficacy of SSM-FiRe. Sixty RT-PCR positive participants who were asymptomatic or with mild COVID-19 symptoms were recruited for the study at the Siddha COVID Care Centre, Vyasarpadi, Chennai from June to August 2020. Nasal and oropharyngeal swab tests were performed on the 0, 7th, and 14th days. All participants were treated with SSM – FiRe regimen. All the participants were also assessed based on Siddha Yakkkaiyin Ilakkanam, which included Clinical symptoms and vitals. Laboratory investigations such as Haemogram, Liver Function Test, Renal Function Test, HbA1C, Electrolytes, Inflammatory markers, Cardiac profile, Immunoglobulins, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests were performed.
Results
83% of COVID-19 patients turned RT-PCR negative on the 7th day and in most of the cases, symptoms were reduced within the first 5 days of admission. The RT-PCR cycle threshold (ct) value increased significantly (<0.001) after treatment and all the participants were RT-PCR negative, except one, who was positive even after 14 days. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies developed significantly (p-value – 0.006). LFT, RFT, CBC, Total proteins, and electrolytes continued to be in the normal range after treatment, indicating the safety of the intervention.
Conclusion
Asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 disease can be well managed by SSM – FiRe treatment, Further studies could be taken up to strengthen the findings.}

abstract = {Objectives
In Portugal, the dispensing of most outpatient specialty medicines is performed exclusively through hospital pharmacies and totally financed by the National Health Service. During the COVID-19 first wave, the government allowed the transfer of the dispensing of hospital-only medicines (HOMs) to community pharmacies (CPs). This study aimed to measure the value generated by the intervention of CP in the dispensing of HOM.
Methods
A single-arm, before-and-after study with 3-month follow-up was conducted enrolling a randomly selected sample of patients or caregivers with at least 1 dispensation of HOM through CP. Data were collected by telephone interview. Main outcomes were patients’ self-reported adherence (Measure Treatment Adherence), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D 3-Level), satisfaction with the service, and costs related to HOM access.
Results
Overall 603 subjects were recruited to participate in the study (males 50.6%) with mean 55 years old (SD = 16). The already high mean adherence score to therapy improved significantly (P < .0001), and no statistically significant change (P > .5757) was found in the mean EQ-5D score between baseline (0.7 ± 0.3) and 3-month follow-up (0.8 ± 0.3). Annual savings account for €262.1/person, arising from travel expenses and absenteeism reduction. Participants reported a significant increase in satisfaction levels in all evaluated domains—pharmacist’s availability, opening hours, waiting time, privacy conditions, and overall experience.
Conclusions
Changing the dispense setting to CP may promote better access and satisfaction. Moreover, it ensures the persistence of treatments, promotes savings for citizens, and reduces the burden of healthcare services, representing a crucial public health measure.}

Patient-centred care is an important part of quality healthcare and patient satisfaction has been shown to be associated with improved clinical outcomes. We aim to explore the satisfaction of patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) with their visits to the TCM physician and its association with patients' socio-economic characteristics.
Methods
A questionnaire survey was conducted among patients aged >21 years with DKD. Participants' demographic, socioeconomic characteristics and satisfaction scores measured with the self-administered Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (MISS) were collected after they visited the TCM physician. MISS is a 26-item questionnaire consisting of three domains – cognitive, affective and behavioural which was developed to assess patient satisfaction with medical consultation. Independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyse the data.
Results
137 participants completed the questionnaires and were included in the analysis. The mean satisfaction score was 3.1 out of 5, with the cognitive domain being significantly higher compared to the affective and behavioural domains. The mean satisfaction score of the cognitive domain differed significantly among participants staying in different types of housing and those with previous TCM encounters. The mean satisfaction score of the behavioural domain differed significantly among participants of different ethnicities. The mean satisfaction scores of all the domains were also significantly different among participants with different duration of follow-up with their TCM physicians.
Conclusion
We found that ethnicity, types of housing, previous TCM experience and the duration of follow-up with the TCM physician may affect the satisfaction scores of patients with DKD.}

There is a critical need for genomic medicine research that reflects and benefits socioeconomically and ancestrally diverse populations. However, disparities in research populations persist, highlighting that traditional study designs and materials may be insufficient or inaccessible to all groups. New approaches can be gained through collaborations with patient/community stakeholders. Although some benefits of stakeholder engagement are recognized, routine incorporation into the design and implementation of genomics research has yet to be realized.
Methods
The National Institutes of Health–funded Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium required stakeholder engagement as a dedicated project component. Each CSER project planned and carried out stakeholder engagement activities with differing goals and expected outcomes. Examples were curated from each project to highlight engagement strategies and outcomes throughout the research lifecycle from development through dissemination.
Results
Projects tailored strategies to individual study needs, logistical constraints, and other challenges. Lessons learned include starting early with engagement efforts across project stakeholder groups and planned flexibility to enable adaptations throughout the project lifecycle.
Conclusion
Each CSER project used more than 1 approach to engage with relevant stakeholders, resulting in numerous adaptations and tremendous value added throughout the full research lifecycle. Incorporation of community stakeholder insight improves the outcomes and relevance of genomic medicine research.}

Dementia has been identified as a public health and social- care priority, raising the necessity for multi-domain preventative healthcare strategies for at-risk populations. Western herbal medicine(WHM) has a role to play in strategies supporting healthy brain ageing. The aim of this qualitative, interpretative research study was to explore the experience of Western Herbal Medicine (WHM) practitioners addressing cognitive and vascular brain health in mid-life and older patients, using semi-structured interviews.
Method
Three participants were recruited using purposive sampling and a set of inclusion criteria. In-depth interviews facilitated by a topic guide were used to explore their herbal and therapeutic management approach; and gauge their views on the role of WHM in multi-domain management of brain health in the assay group. Interviews were audio recorded and then transcribed verbatim; thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.
Results
Four themes emerged from the practitioners' narratives of their experience of working with the assay group: the types of conditions their patients presented with; their therapeutic approach to the herbal dietary and lifestyle management of those presentations; the issues of working with the target patient group; and the potential role for WHM in managing brain health in an aging population.
Conclusions
The small exploratory study is the first of its kind attempting to capture the real-life application of WHM in supporting cognitive and vascular brain health in mid-life and older patients. Limitations of the study have been identified.}

In the pain medicine literature there are many examples of imprecision and confusion in this respect, including misnomers and fallacies in reasoning. This article firstly critically examines some of these misnomers. Identified themes include pain being conceptualised as a “thing,” conflation between nociception and pain, and confusion between stimulus and response and between the perspectives of the experiencer and the observer of “pain.” Secondly, fallacies in reasoning are identified that contribute to imprecision and confusion. These include reification of pain, attributing to the brain functions that belong to whole organisms, and the illusory truth effect. Thirdly, these themes are identified also in constructs that are shown to be based more on speculation than on fact. Taken together, these observations reveal a need to review and, where necessary, modify terminology and concepts used in Pain Medicine.
Perspective
This article examines a number of words and constructs commonly found in the pain literature from the perspective of accuracy in terms of their consistency of usage, concordance with fact, degree of speculation and logical argument. A common major theme is the error of considering pain as a “thing” that has agentive properties. A need to clarify much of the language used in Pain Medicine is identified.}

In this paper, we introduce the main principles of sociocognitive terminology theory and examine how the application of these principles in TCM translation projects can produce superior results. To begin our study, we evaluate the salient characteristics of important TCM terms from linguistic, cognitive, diachronic, and communicative perspectives. Next, we present a model for realizing the objectives of linguistic economy, systematic relevance, conceptual retrospection, and knowledge dissemination in sociocognitive translation studies. Finally, to illustrate the practicality of this four-dimensional model, we present a case study on sociocognitive translation of the TCM classic 黄帝内经 (Huangdi Neijing or The Inner Canon of Huangdi), which was compiled during the Warring States period (475–221 BCE). In summary, we find that this model effectively addresses the complexities of TCM terminology and provides solutions to problems involving conceptual connotation, symbolic representation, and communicative context. Following this approach, translators will be better able to convey the profoundly humanistic nature of TCM concepts, significantly improve the quality of TCM translations, and promote TCM and Chinese culture internationally.}

Faculty who identify as women or racial/ethnic groups underrepresented in medicine (URiM) are less likely to occupy senior leadership positions or be promoted. Recent attention has focused on interventions to decrease this gap; thus, we aim to evaluate changes in leadership and academic promotion for these populations over time.
Methods
Successive cross-sectional observational study of six years (2015 to 2020) of data from the Academy of Administrators/Association of Academic Chairs of Emergency Medicine- Benchmark Survey. Primary analyses focused on gender/URiM differences in leadership roles and academic rank. Secondary analysis focused on disparities during the first 10 years of practice. Statistical modeling was conducted to address the primary aim of assessing differences in gender/URiM representation in EM leadership roles/rank over time.
Results
12,967 responses were included (4589 women, 8378 men). Women had less median years as faculty (7 vs 11). Women and URiM were less likely to hold a leadership role and had lower academic rank with no change over the study period. More women were consistently in the early career cohort (within 10 years or less as faculty) : 2015 =–75.0% [95% CI:± 3.8%] v 61.4% [95% CI:± 3.0%]; 2020 =–75.1% [95% CI: ± 2.9%] v 63.3%, [95% CI:: ± 2.5%]. Men were significantly more likely to have any leadership role compared to women in 2015 and 2020 (2015 = 54.3% [95% CI: ± 3.1%] v 44.8%, [95% CI: ± 4.3%]; 2020 = 43.1% [95% CI:± 2.5%] v 34.8 [95% CI:± 3.1%]). Higher academic rank (associate/professor) was significantly more frequent among early career men than women in 2015 (21.1% [95% CI:± 2.58%] v 12.9%; [95% CI:± 3.0%]) and 2020 (23.1% [95% CI:± 2.2%] v 17.4%; [95% CI:± 2.5%]).
Conclusions
Disparities in women and URiM faculty leadership and academic rank persist, with no change over a six-year time span. Men early career faculty are more likely to hold leadership positions and be promoted to higher academic rank, suggesting early career inequities must be a target for future interventions.}

The illegal wildlife trade is one of the key threats to species survival and its regulation and monitoring are dependent on accurate identification. Plants are particularly difficult to identify due to their look-alike properties, which are further aggravated when they are processed eventually in their finished product. Identification of species is critical to monitoring, detecting, and regulating the wildlife trade. In this study, we quantified species misidentification using a match-mismatch experiment adapted from psychology, taking examples of medicinal plant products used in Traditional Asian Medicines. Participants compared 210 pairs of images of plant products, indicating if the paired images were the same (species), different (species), or (they) did not know. We found that the matched pairs (paired images of the same species) had a lower level of error than the unmatched pairs (paired images of different species). Similarly, 1.4% of the image pairs had errors over 75%, three of them as high as 83%. Such errors in species identification can be used by traders to deceive enforcement actions through laundering as less threatened or regulated species. These results suggest that future interventions around identification training should prioritize species with high errors and should consider that product processing may have a significant impact on identification. Further, initiatives related to species identification could benefit from using existing standard methodologies from psychology to inform training needs and measure their impacts which in turn will benefit conservation efforts.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore the potential imaging biomarkers for predicting Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) deficiency and excess syndrome in prostate cancer (PCa) patients by radiomics approach based on MR imaging.
Methods
A total of 121 PCa patients from 2 centers were divided into 1 training cohort with 84 PCa patients and 1 validation cohort with 37 PCa patients. The PCa patients were divided into deficiency and excess syndrome group according to TCM syndrome differentiation. Radiomic features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient images originated from diffusion-weighted imaging. A radiomic signature was constructed after reduction of dimension in training group by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The performance of the model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve.
Results
The radiomic scores of PCa with TCM excess syndrome group were statistically higher than those of PCa with TCM deficiency syndrome group among T2WI, diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient imaging models. The area under ROC curves for T2WI, diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient imaging models were 0.824, 0.824, 0.847 in the training cohort and 0.759, 0.750, 0.809 in the validation cohort, respectively. The apparent diffusion coefficient imaging model had the best discrimination in separating patients with TCM excess syndrome and deficiency syndrome, and its accuracy was 0.788, 0.778 in the training and validation cohort, respectively. The calibration curve demonstrated that there was a high consistency between the prediction of radiomic scores and the actual classification of TCM's deficiency and excess syndrome in PCa.
Conclusion
The radiomic signature based on MR imaging can be performed as a non-invasive, potential approach to discriminate TCM deficiency syndrome from excess syndrome in PCa, in which apparent diffusion coefficient imaging model has the best diagnostic efficiency.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Shuganjianpi Therapy (SGJP), Jianpi Therapy (JP), Shugan Therapy (SG), Jianpiwenshen Therapy (JPWS), and Shuganjianpiwenshen Therapy (SGJPWS), consisting of formulas from Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), have been tremendously applied to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, it remains uncertain when exploring the preferable option among different CHM therapies for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Aim of the study: To compare and rank the efﬁcacy and safety of different CHM therapies for IBS-D. Materials and methods: We searched randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials through mainstream databases from their inception to October 31, 2022. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applied one of the CHM therapies as the experimental group and placebo as the control group. Two authors independently extracted data into a form and evaluated the quality of the retrieved articles by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. At least one of the following outcomes was assessed: Serotonin, Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Incidence of Adverse Events (AE), and Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) with its subscales of Severity of Abdominal Pain (SAP), Frequency of Abdominal Pain (FAP), Severity of Abdominal Distension (SAD), Dissatisfaction with Bowel Habits (DBH), and Interference with Quality of Life (IQOL). A Bayesian network meta-analysis on a random-effect model was conducted using R 4.2.2 software. Results: 1367 records were retrieved from databases in an initial search. Fourteen studies involving six interventions with 2248 participants were identified. Provided pairwise comparisons, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) ranking, and cluster analysis, JPWS was the best option for ameliorating clinical symptoms simultaneously, which included IBS-SSS, SAP, FAP, SAD, DBH, and IQOL. As for AE, JPWS contributed to fewer adverse events than others as well. In respect of serum indicators, we noticed the dominance of SGJP in regulating both serotonin and NPY. Conclusions: JPWS and SGJP were the most prominent CHM therapies for IBS-D in terms of clinical symptoms, including abdominal pain, distension, bowel habits, and improvement of quality of life. The effect of JP and SG for IBS-D required further investigation. As a potential candidate, SGJP may well treat IBS-D by mediating dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity, and the gut-brain axis with an increase of NPY and a reduction of serotonin. For safety, JPWS was ideal for the fewest adverse events in the treatment of IBS-D. On account of a small sample size and possible geographical publication bias, more double-blinded and placebo-controlled trials with larger samples worldwide would be necessary for strengthening current evidence.}

We present 12 cases of PPY-H accompanying pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasias (NEN). PPY-H was analyzed with the help of immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy; preoperative clinical data and imaging studies were evaluated retrospectively. We observed PPY-H emerging from pancreatic ducts, and in some cases, we observed simultaneous NKX6.1 positivity in ducts and PPY-H. Additional clinical-pathological correlations suggests that gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., epigastric pain and cholestasis) could be more related to PPY-H than to NEN hormonal production. In particular cases, SSTR2 expression was strong in PPY-H and correlated with distinguishable accumulation of activity next to NEN on 99 mTc EDDA/Hynic-TOC SPECT/CT. In another case, 18F-FDG-PET/CT showed increased metabolic activity in the area of PPY-H surrounding NEN. Our data suggest that PPY-H originates in the lining of pancreatic ducts. Confirmation of SSTR2 in PPY-H, using immunohistochemistry, suggests the utility of 99 mTc EDDA/Hynic-TOC or 68Ga-DOTA radiotracers in clinical diagnostics; however, studies with larger cohort are needed.}

abstract = {Background & aims
Several types of human stem cells from embryonic (ESCs) and induced pluripotent (iPSCs) to adult tissue-specific stem cells are commonly used to generate 3D liver organoids for modeling tissue physiology and disease. We have recently established a protocol for direct conversion of primary human hepatocytes (hPHs) from healthy donor livers into bipotent progenitor cells (hCdHs). Here we extended this culture system to generate hCdH-derived liver organoids for diverse biomedical applications.
Methods
To obtain hCdHs, hPHs were cultured in reprogramming medium containing A83-01 and CHIR99021 for 7 days. Liver organoids were established from hCdHs (hCdHOs) and human liver cells (hLOs) using the same donor livers for direct comparison, as well as from hiPSCs. Organoid properties were analyzed by standard in vitro assays. Molecular changes were determined by RT-qPCR and RNA-seq. Clinical relevance was evaluated by transplantation into FRG mice, modeling of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), and in vitro drug-toxicity tests.
Results
hCdHs were clonally expanded as organoid cultures with low variability between starting hCdH lines. Similar to the hLOs, hCdHOs stably maintained stem cell phenotype based on accepted criteria. However, hCdHOs had an advantage over hLOs in terms of EpCAM expression, efficiency of organoid generation and capacity for directed hepatic differentiation as judged by molecular profiling, albumin secretion, glycogen accumulation, and CYP450 activities. Accordingly, FRG mice transplanted with hCdHOs survived longer than mice injected with hLOs. When exposed to ethanol, hCdHOs developed stronger ARLD phenotype than hLOs as evidenced by transcriptional profiling, lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In drug-induced injury assays in vitro, hCdHOs showed a similar or higher sensitivity response than hPHs.
Conclusion
hCdHOs provide a novel patient-specific stem cell-based platform for regenerative medicine, toxicology testing and modeling liver diseases.}

Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is not only a widely known vegetable but also a valuable medicinal plant. Cabbage's pharmacological properties were described already in antiquity. Numerous reports, published in recent years, confirm cabbage's healing properties, leading to a deeper analysis of its applications in the traditional healing practices of Polish rural communities.
Aim of the study
The study aimed to analyze the exploiting of cabbage in Polish folk medicine from 16th to 20th century. The elaboration bases mainly on Polish-language bibliography, from which a little number of papers was published online, so the presented review has the particular value to make available this unique knowledge to an international readership. In addition, the analysis created a basis for the future research of pharmacological application of cabbage and its processed products, especially lacto-fermented, commonly used to preserve this vegetable for winter months in the Polish climatic zone.
Materials and methods
The analysis of the therapeutic use of cabbage in Polish folk medicine was carried out on the basis of Polish-language historical sources dating to the period from the first written evidence till the end of the 20th century, covering the areas inhabited by Polish population. With the perspective of a comprehensive analysis of the medicinal use of cabbage, the information is presented against the background of its benefits in the folk medicine of other ethnic communities.
Results
Polish folk communities diffusely exploit all parts of cabbage plants, and its preparations, including leaves, stems, seeds, sauerkraut, and the sauerkraut's juice as a natural medicine. The mentioned raw materials were applied in the treatment of numerous ailments, especially of the digestive tract, skin, burns, frostbites, to relieve pain, fight parasites, and of gynecological disorders related to childbirth and children feeding. Cabbage pharmacological applications covered the therapy of tuberculosis, measles, and jaundice. Cabbage and its by-products were used in the cure of farm animals, especially in the perinatal period, parasite and microbial infections, or to improve the resistance against diseases and the overall fitness.
Conclusions
The healing properties of raw materials and products of lactic acid fermentation of white cabbage are confirmed by historical documents. Ethnographic sources indicate their wide application in Polish folk medicine and show the perception and classification of disease entities by Polish rural communities in the analyzed period. The collected data constitute background for further research on the phytochemical use of this plant in modern medicine.}

The increasing global incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) requires new drug interventions. For more than two thousand years, the combination of Radix Bupleuri and Radix Paeoniae Alba couplet medicine (BPCM) has provided beneficial activities in the treatment of diabetes. The object of this network pharmacology study was explore their combined mechanisms with verification In vitro.
Methods
The chemical compounds and potential targets of BPCM were analyzed through Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Gene information related to T2DM was collected using GeneCards and OMIM database. The core targets were obtained through Venn Diagram, and the protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the STRING database. The networks of compound-target and drug-compound-common target-disease were constructed by Cytoscape. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and biological pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis were performed using R language. SYBYL docking for key compounds with targets were performed to explore their binding modes, which was further verified through cell experiments.
Results
The study identified 17 active ingredients in Radix Bupleuri and 13 active ingredients in Radix Paeoniae Alba. There were 23 targets related to type 2 diabetes, including caspase 3 (CASP3), peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ (PPARG) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1). Further analysis identified 403 GO biological processes and 76 related signal pathways. It was found that CASP3-kaempferol, CASP3-quercetin, and ICAM1-stigmasterol had high binding activities. In the palmitic acid-induced HepG2 cells, BPCM improved lipid aggregation and up-regulated the levels of p-ACC and p-AMPK. Importantly, experimental verification results showed that BPCM increased the expression of PPARG and decreased the levels of CASP3 and ICAM1.
Conclusions
Through network pharmacology, molecular docking and vitro experiments, the study found that BPCM may treat T2DM by promoting AMPK/ACC conduction and inhibiting lipid accumulation.}

Cholestatic liver disease (CLD) is mainly characterized by cholestasis. If not treated, it will deteriorate to cholestatic hepatitis, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and even liver failure. CLD has a high clinical incidence, and limited treatment with single therapy. In the long-term clinical exploration, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been corroborated with unique therapeutic effects on the CLD process.
Aim of this review
This paper summarizes the effective single and compound TCMs for the treatment of CLD. According to 4 important clinical stages of CLD: cholestasis, hepatitis, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, pharmacological effects and mechanisms of 5 typical TCM examples are reviewed, aims to provide basis for clinical drug selection in different processes of CLD.
Materials and methods
Relevant scientific articles regarding therapeutic effects of TCM for the CLD were collected from different databases. We collated three single herbs including Artemisia scoparia Waldst. et Kit. or Artemisia capillaris Thunb. (Artemisiae Scopariae Herba, Yin Chen in Chinese), Paeonia lactiflora Pall. or Paeonia veitchii Lynch. (Paeoniae radix rubra, Chi Shao in Chinese), Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf (Poria, Fu Ling in Chinese), and two compound herbs of Huang Qi Decoction (HQD) and Yin Chen Hao Decoction (YCHD) to studied and analyzed.
Results
We proposed five promising TCMs treatments for the important developmental stages of CLD. Among them, Yin Chen is an essential medicine for protecting liver and gallbladder, and its TCM prescription is also a promising strategy for cholestasis. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose application of Chi Shao is a clinical special treatment of cholestasis hepatitis. Fu Ling can regulate immune cells and increase antibody levels in serum, which is expected to be an emerging therapy to prevent cholestatic liver fibrosis to cirrhosis. HQD can be used as routine clinical medicine for liver fibrosis. In addition, YCHD can exert better comprehensive advantages with multiple components, can treat the whole course of CLD and prevent it from developing to the end-stage.
Conclusion
Yin Chen, Chi Shao, Fu Ling, HQD and YCHD have shown good clinical efficacy in controlling the development of CLD. Clinically, it is easier to curb the development of CLD by adopting graded diagnosis and treatment measures. We suggest that CLD should be risk stratified in clinical treatment to ensure personalized treatment for patients, so as to slow down the development of the disease.}

abstract = {Objective
This study proposes to visually review the current situation and progress of standards sets by the International Organization for Standardization/Technical Committee on Traditional Chinese Medicine (ISO/TC 249). The review aims to explore the development strategies of the standards, which will exhibit the considerable impact on the economy, trade and exchanges, and cooperation in the area of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
Methods
ISO/TC 249 standards were searched on the ISO website, and their title, proposed time, current stage, scope, and classification were obtained for further summarization. Gephi was utilized to portray the co-occurrence network graph of the ISO/TC 249 standards subject.
Results
In ISO/TC 249, there were 116 standards, including 81 published standards and 35 developing standards by April 30, 2022. Two withdrawal standards were published after revision, which were not counted in the total standards. The number of published standards has been increasing since the first standard was published in 2014, whose title was “Sterile acupuncture needles for single use”. Among these standards, 17.24% (20/116) standards were in review, 56.03% (65/116) in publication, 3.45% (4/116) in approval, 5.17% (6/116) in enquiry, 3.45% (4/116) in committee, and 14.66% (17/116) in preparation, respectively. With 116 standards, most of the research focused on the medicament, as its classification of the International Classification for Standards (ICS) showed the proportion reaching 49.54%. The network analysis data revealed that the top five most frequent words were “materials” “root” “requirements” “products” and “system”, after removing the noise data, such as prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns. Additionally, the word “system” co-exists with the terms “computerized” “coding” “image” “tongue” and “analysis”; the word “requirement” co-exists with “manufacturing” “decoction” “process” and “materials”; whereas the word “devices” co-exists with “pulse” “electric” “skin” and “measurement”.
Conclusion
With the increased diversification and complexity of problems, the development of standards is also oriented to multidisciplinary fields to cultivate the interdisciplinary talents, and especially the international standardization talents of compound TCM. Multi-angle analysis, formulation, and demonstration of standards, in line with industry needs in different disciplines, enhance the availability of standards and the ability to serve the industry.}

abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are intimately associated with inflammation and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Temporal and inter-individual variabilities in disease activity and response to therapy pose significant challenges to diagnosis and patient care. Discovery and validation of truly integrative biomarkers would benefit from embracing redox metabolomics approaches with prioritization of central regulatory hubs. We here make a case for applying a personalized redox medicine approach that aims to selectively inhibit pathological overproduction and/or altered expression of specific enzymatic sources of ROS without compromising physiological function. To this end, improved ‘clinical-omics integration’ may help to better understand which particular redox signaling pathways are disrupted in what patient. Pharmacological interventions capable of activating endogenous antioxidant defense systems may represent viable therapeutic options to restore local/systemic redox status, with HIF-1α and NRF2 holding particular promise in this context. Achieving the implementation of clinically meaningful mechanism-based biomarkers requires development of easy-to-use, robust and cost-effective tools for secure diagnosis and monitoring of treatment efficacy. Ultimately, matching redox-directed pharmacological interventions to individual patient phenotypes using predictive biomarkers may offer new opportunities to break the therapeutic ceiling in IBD.}

However, the use of a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) test may provide an opportunity for early detection of cancer recurrence, particularly in patients with high-risk or aggressive forms of the disease. We present two cases of early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in which ctDNA screening facilitated early detection of recurrence prior to detection by imaging. As a result, treatment was initiated sooner than would have been possible in the absence of ctDNA screening. These cases underscore the potential utility of ctDNA screening integration within a radiation oncology practice for the detection of recurrent breast cancer, and how their use in routine clinical practice could benefit patients. We also provide a review of the current literature on ctDNA testing, including its benefits and limitations. While there is currently insufficient data to support the routine use of ctDNA screening in all patients, we speculate on specific patient populations that may derive the greatest benefit from this innovative diagnostic tool.}

BSHXF improved IL-1β and H2O2 stimulation-induced injuries on NPCs by promoting cell viability, increasing ECM deposition, inhibiting cell senescence, and decreasing the levels of inflammatory factors. The active ingredients in BSHXF were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis; three active ingredients from the principal drugs, Aucubin, Tanshinol, and Tanshinone II A promoted NPC viability; and Aucubin and Tanshinol promoted NPC viability more. Aucubin and Tanshinol, respectively, improved H2O2 stimulation-induced injuries on NPCs by promoting cell viability, increasing ECM deposition, inhibiting cell senescence, and decreasing the levels of inflammatory factors. The activator of NF-κB and Wnt signaling pathways attenuated Aucubin and Tanshinol's protective effects by promoting ECM degradation and NPC senescence. Aucubin, Tanshinol, and Tanshinone II A were identified as the most potent compounds in BSHXF protection against degenerative changes in NPCs.

Medical schools are increasingly including evidence-based medicine (EBM) courses in their curricula. However, little is known about the characteristics of these courses in Peru. Therefore, the present study aimed to describe the characteristics and topics addressed by undergraduate courses on EBM in Peruvian medical schools, and to compare the content of these courses with predefined EBM competencies.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study. We obtained the syllabi of undergraduate EBM courses from all medical schools for the latest year available. We extracted their characteristics and categorized the topics they included according to the five steps necessary to apply EBM, divided into 22 competencies.
Results
In 2021, Peru had 47 universities with active undergraduate medical schools, of which 9 (19.1%) had EBM courses. These courses were not mandatory in three of the universities, and were typically offered between the 2nd and 5th year of the degree program. When analysing the topics covered in the syllabi, we found that they addressed 7 to 13 of the 22 core competencies evaluated. The least addressed topics belonged to steps 4 (apply) and 5 (evaluate) of the EBM process.
Conclusion
We found that few Peruvian universities offer EBM courses, and that these courses have heterogeneous characteristics, with syllabi that do not include all essential topics for applying the five steps of EBM.}

Despite documented racial and ethnic disparities in care, there is significant variability in representation, reporting, and analysis of race and ethnic groups in the hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) literature.
Objectives
To evaluate the race and ethnic diversity of study participants and the reporting of race and ethnicity data in HPM research.
Methods
Adult patient and/or caregiver-centered research conducted in the U.S. and published as JPSM Original Articles from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2019, were identified. Descriptive analyses were used to summarize the frequency of variables related to reporting of race and ethnicity.
Results
Of 1253 studies screened, 218 were eligible and reviewed. There were 78 unique race and ethnic group labels. Over 85% of studies included ≥ one non-standard label based on Office of Management and Budget designations. One-quarter of studies lacked an explanation of how race and ethnicity data were collected, and 83% lacked a rationale. Over half did not include race and/or ethnicity in the analysis, and only 14 studies focused on race and/or ethnic health or health disparities. White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander persons were included in 95%, 71%, 43% 37%,10%, and 4% of studies. In 92% of studies the proportion of White individuals exceeded 57.8%, which is their proportion in the U.S. population.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest there are important opportunities to standardize reporting of race and ethnicity, strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion among research participants, and prioritize the study of racial and ethnic disparities in HPM research.}

abstract = {Summary
In the code of public health, misuse is defined as intentional and inappropriate use of a medicine or product, which is not in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation or the registration as well as with good practice recommendations. Very often this involves an individual or the interaction of several individuals including the patient, his/her carers, prescriber(s) and/or dispensers. Misuse is common; it is the source of medicinal adverse effects for which a significant part is avoidable. Medicines initially prescribed or dispensed in the context of their marketing authorization (MA) can also be the subject of primary dependency and misappropriation. Companies which develop medicines nationally make declarations to the ANSM (French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products) and implement measures to limit non-compliant use of their products. Recently, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the influence and societal impact of drug misuse. The finding of the existence of systemic misuse, the impossibility of proposing simple solutions leads us to propose two main areas for improved information and the training of users and health professionals in medicines in the context of multi-faceted interventions: prevention of misuse on the one hand and its identification and treatment on the other hand.}

To evaluate the access to comprehensive diagnostics and novel antituberculosis medicines in European countries.
Methods
We investigated the access to genotypic and phenotypic Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing and the availability of antituberculosis drugs and calculated the cost of drugs and treatment regimens at major tuberculosis treatment centres in countries of the WHO European region where rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis are the highest among all WHO regions. Results were stratified by middle-income and high-income countries.
Results
Overall, 43 treatment centres from 43 countries participated in the study. For WHO group A drugs, the frequency of countries with the availability of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing was as follows: (a) 75% (30/40) for levofloxacin, (b) 82% (33/40) for moxifloxacin, (c) 48% (19/40) for bedaquiline, and (d) 72% (29/40) for linezolid. Overall, of the 43 countries, 36 (84%) and 24 (56%) countries had access to bedaquiline and delamanid, respectively, whereas only 6 (14%) countries had access to rifapentine. The treatment of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis with a regimen including a carbapenem was available only in 17 (40%) of the 43 countries. The median cost of regimens for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (shorter regimen, including bedaquiline for 6 months), and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (including bedaquiline, delamanid, and a carbapenem) were €44 (minimum–maximum, €15–152), €764 (minimum–maximum, €542–15152), and €8709 (minimum–maximum, €7965–11759) in middle-income countries (n = 12) and €280 (minimum–maximum, €78–1084), €29765 (minimum–maximum, €11116–40584), and €217591 (minimum–maximum, €82827–320146) in high-income countries (n = 29), respectively.
Discussion
In countries of the WHO European region, there is a widespread lack of drug susceptibility testing capacity to new and repurposed antituberculosis drugs, lack of access to essential medications in several countries, and a high cost for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis.}

Some herbal medicines show neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammation effects, which may relieve nerve damages after SCI.

Herein, gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) in conjugation with three herbal medicines including berberine (BRB), astragalus polysaccharides (APS), and diosgenin (DIO) were found to promote the general drug efficiencies, which more remarkably inhibited the inflammation factors such as NF-κB by more than 53.1%, 30.5%, and 30.2% and IKKβ by more than 45.0%, 41.8% and 31.9% respectively in vitro. AuNCs conjugated herbal medicines also reduced inflammatory responses in vivo and more effectively recovers nerve functions after SCI by observing the increased Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) exercise score from 12.2 to 13.2, 11.6 to 14.2, and 11.2 to 12.8 compared to BRB, APS, and DIO only. This work suggests AuNCs may generally promote the therapeutic effects of various herbal medicines.}

Key molecular alterations (MA) of neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) of various grade/primaries have been described but the applicability of molecular profiling (MP) for precision medicine in NEN remains to be demonstrated.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with metastatic NEN who had MP on tumour tissue at Gustave Roussy. The primary objective was to assess the clinical applicability of MP by evaluating the growth modulator index (GMI) as the primary end-point.
Results
MPs were obtained in 114 out of 156 eligible patients, including 12% NET-G1, 42% NET-G2, 13% NET-G3 and 35% neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Primary sites were lung/thymus (40%), pancreas (19%), gastro-intestinal (16%), head&neck (10%), unknown (10%) and others (10%) with synchronous metastases in 61% of the patients. Most frequent MA were: MEN1 (25%), PTEN (13%), TP53 (11%) and TSC2 (9%), in neuroendocrine tumour (NET), and TP53 (50%) and RB1 (18%) in NEC. ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) classification of these MA were: I(5%), III(20%), IV(23%), X(27%); a putative actionable MA was identified in 48% patients.

Molecularly matched treatment was administered to 19 patients (4 NEC, 15 NET): immunotherapy (n = 3), tipifarnib (n = 1), NOTCHi (n = 1), EGFRi (n = 2), HER2i (n = 1) and everolimus (n = 11). Overall, 67% of patients had a clinical benefit defined as a GMI over 1.3 with a 78% disease control rate.
Conclusion
We report 48% of NEN with a putative actionable MA of which 35% received molecularly matched treatment, with a clinical benefit in 67% of the cases.}

abstract = {The quality of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) guarantees its clinical efficacy. Although advanced analytical techniques and methods can accurately determine the content of chemical components in TCM, it is difficult to accurately determine its clinical efficacy. In addition, the current analytical methods and technologies are complex and have difficulty meeting the requirements of a rapid, accurate and convenient determination of TCM quality. In this study, we first propose the concept of “indistinct” evaluation of the quality of TCM, that is, combining biological potency with character evaluation, quantifying the character evaluation, and preparing the safflower quality grade evaluation card based on the character analysis, which provides research ideas and methods for the rapid and accurate evaluation of the quality of TCM. We determined the biological potency of different batches of safflower based on the in vitro antiplatelet aggregation model and divided the safflower samples into two grades based on the biological potency. We further collected the color information of different grades of safflower samples, quantified the color information of different grades of safflower, drew a quality grade evaluation card for the rapid judgment of safflower quality grade and verified its accuracy by pharmacodynamic evaluation. To further analyze the differences in the material basis of different grades of safflower, the LC-MS method was used to simultaneously determine the contents of 19 chemical components, such as myricetin, in different grades of safflower samples to analyze the differences in the material basis of different grades of safflower. The result shows that the different grades of safflower exhibited significant differences in color. The pharmacodynamic results show that the quality evaluation card prepared based on color information can accurately evaluate quality, and the effect of first-class safflower is significantly better than that of second-class safflower. The chemical analysis results of different grades of safflower show that there are also significant differences between them, among which hypericin, 6-hydroxyapin-6-O-glucose-7-O-glucuronide, 6-hydroxykaempferol-3,6-O-diglucoside-7-O-glucuronic acid glycoside, 6-hydroxykaempferol-3,6,7-tri-O-glucoside and hydroxysafflower yellow A exhibit significant differences, which may be the main differentiating components of different grades of safflower. This study preliminarily confirmed that the “indistinct” evaluation of the quality of TCM based on character analysis is accurate and scientific, and the quality evaluation card prepared can accurately judge the quality of TCM, providing a reference for the rapid application of TCM character evaluation.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to investigate whether the use of levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUD) in the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can improve the body constitution deviations and quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).
Materials and methods
To understand the TCM body constitution differences between patients, patients with CPP from a gynecology clinic were first compared to a healthy control group from the Academia Sinica Taiwan Biobank (TWB). Patients with CPP were also compared with patients with pelvic diseases from the TWB. Patients with CPP and HMB, some who under LNG-IUD treatment, underwent tests for physical consistency. After 6–8 months, the TCM body constitution and QoL of patients who received LNG-IUD treatment were reanalyzed. The questionnaires used included the Self-Assessment Chart of Menstrual Bleeding, the Taiwanese version of the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart, the TCM Body Constitution Questionnaire, the 6-point Behavior Rating Scale, and the Taiwanese version of the Short Form-36 Health Survey. All data were analyzed using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test in SAS 9.4 software.
Results
In total, 2932 healthy women and 724 women with pelvic diseases were present in the TWB project. Moreover, 376 patients with CPP were admitted to a gynecology clinic, of whom 42 received LNG-IUD treatment. After LNG-IUD treatment, the primary endpoint was regarded as an improvement in Yang-Xu (lack of energy), Yin-Xu (lack of material), and phlegm stasis (accumulation of pathological products). These findings indicated an improvement in menstrual blood loss, pelvic pain, physical functioning, physical problems, body pain, general health, and emotional problems (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
LNG-IUD treatment improves body constitution deviations in TCM and QoL in patients with CPP and HMB. Our results provide a valuable reference for the use of modern medicine and TCM in treating CPP and HMB.}

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to prevent, treat and diagnose diseases for 5,000 years under the guidance of TCM theories. TCM fingerprinting technology, as the model of the quality control of TCM, promotes the application of TCM all over the world. But how to realize the fast matching, retrieval, recognition, and identification function of TCM fingerprint data is an urgent problem in the study of TCM fingerprint. The establishment of TCM fingerprint database provides a powerful platform for the popularization and application of TCM fingerprint. The aim of this paper is therefore to summarize the research process of TCM fingerprint database.
Methods
Relevant studies from the literature have been collected from scientific databases, such as “PubMed”, “CNKI”, “Google Scholar”, “Baidu Xueshu”, “Web of Science”, “SpringerLink”, “Wiley Online Library”, “SciFinder” and “Chemical book” using the keywords “fingerprint”, “traditional Chinese medicines”, “database”, “TCM fingerprint”, and “TCM fingerprint database”.
Results
This paper mainly expounds the research process of TCM fingerprint database, its advantages in TCM modernization research and research achievements. At the same time, the problems of TCM fingerprint database in modern TCM research are summarized and the bright development prospect is forecasted.

Huangqin-Jinyinhua couplet medicines (HQJYH) were often used to treat hand-foot and mouth disease (HFMD), although its mechanism remains unclear. This study investigated the active ingredients in HQJYH and their mechanism when treating HFMD by network pharmacology and molecular docking.
Methods
The TCMSP database obtained the principal active ingredients found in HQJYH. The GeneCards, CTD, PharmGkb and DisGeNet databases were used to obtain the main targets involved in HFMD, and the merged targets were obtained by R software and the Venn package. The DAVID database performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses on the intersection targets. We also used Cytoscape software to construct an “HQJYH-Active Ingredients-Targets” network and used the STRING platform to conduct protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses on the intersection targets. Molecular docking of core active ingredients-core targets interactions were modeled using AutoDock Vina software.
Results
56 active ingredients were found in HQJYH, corresponding to 212 targets, 5323 HFMD targets, and 156 intersection targets. KEGG enrichment analysis found that genes were mainly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and other pathways. Cytoscape showed that the core active ingredients were quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, wogonin, baicalein and acacetin. The PPI network showed that the core targets involved were TP53, CASP3, AKT1, IL6, MAPK14, EGFR, and HIF1A. The molecular docking results indicated key binding activity between Baicalein-AKT1, quercetin-AKT1, wogonin-AKT1, kaempferol-AKT and wogonin-MAPK14.
Conclusion
This study was based on network pharmacology and revealed the potential molecular mechanisms involved in treating HFMD by HQJYH.}

abstract = {Background
In response to emergencies, such as wildfires, donations of pharmaceuticals often occur. These donations can be given directly by governments, to non-governmental organizations as corporate donations, or by private entities that donate to individual health institutions.
Objective
This paper aimed to collect, review and analyze pharmaceutical product donations received during the natural disaster caused by wildfires in the San Luis province, Argentina, in September and October 2020.
Methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional, and retrospective study was performed. An introductory approach to good donation practices was also carried out. Medicines were classified and in the case of products that were not suitable for administration, these were discarded.
Results
A total of 15,593 units were segregated, of which 52.8% were over-the-counter products and 47.2% were prescription drugs. 86.3% (13,467 units) were accepted, while 13.7% (2126 units) had to be destroyed. The value of donations totaled USD 16,544. The analysis of the results showed that an important part of the donations was irrelevant in the emergency context. Donations were also received in incorrect amounts, which generated a large stock of medicines that couldn’t be used. In emergencies, inappropriate donations create additional work during sorting, storage, and distribution, increasing the time professionals need to complete tasks. This extra work can easily overwhelm limited human and logistical resources.
Conclusions
It is important to previously evaluate the real need for donations. In addition, the distribution of donations must be done through pre-established systems and policies. Otherwise, unsolicited and unnecessary drug donations become wasteful and should therefore be avoided.}

From a range of ‘critical uncertainties’ we derived two scenario drivers: global convergence, ranging from very high (trust and solidarity), to very low (fragmented ecosystems); and disease orientation, ranging from public health first to interceptive medicine. This resulted in four contrasting portraits of the future of medicines and social policy: deprioritizing the high-end; sustainable flow; transformative healing; and global divide.

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of the modified contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) to distinguish malignancy in patients without known hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk factors and compare diagnostic accuracy with that of the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) guideline across radiologists with different levels of CEUS experience.
Methods
A total of 848 individuals with no hepatitis infection presenting with 870 lesions in non-cirrhotic livers were included and divided into the Testing and Validation groups. The modified CEUS LI-RADS was proposed, including downgrading of focal nodular hyperplasia with typical features. Diagnostic performance of the modified CEUS LI-RADS was assessed in the Testing group. In the Validation group, two radiologists with more than 9 y of CEUS experience (Experts) and two radiologists with less than 6 mo of CEUS experience (Novices) used both the modified CEUS LI-RADS and the WFUMB guideline to evaluate performance in diagnosis of the lesions.
Results
LR-5 + M (combination of modified LR-5 and modified LR-M) revealed optimal performance with a sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of 99.3%, 81.6% and 0.904, respectively. Novices using the modified CEUS LI-RADS outperformed those using the WFUMB guideline (AUC: 0.858 vs. 0.767, p = 0.005). Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of Novices were comparable to those of Experts using the modified CEUS LI-RADS (94.1%, 77.6% and 0.858 vs. 96.1%, 77.6% and 0.868 for experts, respectively).
Conclusion
The modified CEUS LI-RADS is a valuable method for distinguishing hepatic malignancy in patients without HCC risk factors. This is particularly beneficial for radiologists with limited CEUS expertise.}

abstract = {Background
Studies in separate cohorts suggest possible discrepancies between inhaled medicines supplied (median 50-60%) and medicines used (median 30-40%). We performed the first study that directly compares CF medicine supply against use to identify the cost of excess medicines supply.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included participants from 12 UK adult centres with ≥1 year of continuous adherence data from data-logging nebulisers. Medicine supply was measured as medication possession ratio (MPR) for a 1-year period from the first suitable supply date. Medicine use was measured as electronic data capture (EDC) adherence over the same period. The cost of excess medicines was calculated as whole excess box(es) supplied after accounting for the discrepancy between EDC adherence and MPR with 20% contingency.
Results
Among 275 participants, 133 (48.4%) were females and mean age was 30 years (95% CI 29-31 years). Median EDC adherence was 57% (IQR 23-86%), median MPR was 74% (IQR 46-96%) and the discrepancy between measures was median 14% (IQR 2-29%). Even with 20% contingency, mean potential cost of excess medicines was £1,124 (95% CI £855-1,394), ranging from £183 (95% CI £29-338) for EDC adherence ≥80% to £2,017 (95% CI £1,507-2,526) for EDC adherence <50%.
Conclusions
This study provides a conservative estimate of excess inhaled medicines supply cost among adults with CF in the UK. The excess supply cost was highest among those with lowest EDC adherence, highlighting the importance of adherence support and supplying medicine according to actual use. MPR provides information about medicine supply but over-estimates actual medicine use.}

This research uses a dynamic cell culture condition in a microfluidic concentration gradient device, helping us to assess breast anticancer activities of probiotic strains against MCF-7 cells. It has been shown that MCF-7 cells could grow and proliferate for at least 24 h; however, a specific concentration of probiotic supernatant could induce more cell death signaling population after 48 h. One of our key findings was that our evaluated optimum dose (7.8 mg/L) was less than the conventional static cell culture treatment dose (12 mg/L). To determine the most effective dose over time and the percentage of apoptosis versus necrosis, flowcytometric assessment was performed. Exposing the MCF-7 cells to probiotic supernatant after 6, 24 and 48 h, confirmed that the apoptotic and necrotic cell death signaling were concentration and time dependent. We have shown a case that these types of microfluidics platforms performing dynamic cell culture could be beneficial in personalized medicine and cancer therapy.}

abstract = {To date, hydroxyurea is the only effective and safe drug that significantly reduces morbidity and mortality of individuals with Sickle cell disease. Twenty years of real-life experience has demonstrated that hydroxyurea reduces pain attacks, vaso-occlusive events, including acute chest syndrome, the number and duration of hospitalizations and the need for transfusion. The therapeutic success of hydroxyurea is directly linked to access to the drug, the dose used and adherence to treatment which, in part, is correlated to the availability of hydroxyurea. This consensus aims to reduce the number of mandatory exams needed to access the drug, prioritizing the requesting physician's report, without affecting patient safety.}

abstract = {Award recognition by medical societies contributes to professional development, career networking, and academic rank promotion. Previous research has demonstrated that men are the predominant recipients of medical society awards across multiple medical specialties; as such, we sought to understand whether women are underrepresented as award recipients amongst blood banking and transfusion medicine (BBTM) medical societies. We examined recipients of 10 total awards from the Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies (AABB) and the American Society for Apheresis. Additional evaluation of AABB's National Blood Foundation Hall of Fame inductees was conducted. Gender was determined via online review of pronouns, online photographs, and a web-based gender identification application. Award recipient gender was analyzed and coded independently by two authors, and any discrepancies were adjudicated by author consensus. Of the 330 AABB awards since 1954, significantly more have been conferred to men (81.5%, 269/330; P < .001). Of the 51 American Society for Apheresis awards presented since 1993, 64.7% (33/51; P = .23) have been conferred to men. Compared to the first 10 years of the AABB awards (1954-1964), there has been a significant increase in the proportion of women award recipients in the most recent decade (2010-2021) (18.5%, 5/27 vs 29.4%, 30/102; P < .001). However, additional temporal analysis of the modern era (2000-2021) revealed men have received significantly more AABB awards than women (77.4%, 144/186 vs 22.6%, 42/186; P < .001). Our findings highlight both historic and contemporary inequity for recognition of women within BBTM. Without improvement, gender parity among BBTM award recipients will take approximately 120 years (11% increase in women awardees in 60 years); thus, to ensure the BBTM field continues to progress, we must advocate for equity among all members, including but not limited to gender, race, and ethnicity. Strategies to enhance equity include transparency in the identities of award nominees, award recipients, and individuals on selection committees, the gender ratios of both award nominees and recipients, and implementation of methods for tracking individual demographics over time. These strategies would permit temporal analysis of the ratio of award nominee gender to award recipient gender, and assessment as to whether potential gender inequities improve over time.}

abstract = {American physicians disproportionately suffer from burnout. Despite calls for systemic solutions, however, few studies have actually examined how ‘the system’ works—i.e. how structural factors intersect in real-time as a system to shape wellbeing. I borrow a systems theoretical approach, which explicitly recognizes the dynamic relationships and interdependencies between different actors and factors in healthcare, to examine how structural factors work together to shape physicians' wellbeing. Drawing on an eight-month ethnography in a pediatrics clinic, I show how respondents experienced pressures from multiple structural levels: societal (including broader social inequality and changing doctor-patient relationships); organizational (centralized decision-making, economic pressures, and unresponsive leadership); and professional (specialty cultures and unhealthy norms). I find that individual physicians effectively served as shock absorbers, routinely absorbing countless, interconnected structural demands (“shocks”) and converting them into competent medical care, at significant cost to their mental health. In so doing, I intervene in sociological debates about the broader fate of the medical profession and conclude that if medicine remains resilient against threats to its dominance, it may well be at the expense of individual physicians' mental wellbeing.}
