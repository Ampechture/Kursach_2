abstract = {Objective
To provide high-quality clinical evidence of the efficacy of Tibetan medicine Honghua Ruyi (HHRY) pills for endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea.
Methods
This study constitutes a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial encompassing a three-menstrual cycle intervention followed by a three-menstrual cycle follow-up period. A total of 164 eligible females with endometriosis-associated dysmenorrhea were randomly divided into HHRY pills and placebo groups in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome included dysmenorrhea symptoms assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores and quality of life, whereas the secondary outcome measures included the maximum VAS for non-menstrual pelvic pain, duration of pain episodes (in days), frequency and quantity of the consumption of ibuprofen sustained-release capsules (or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and days off work/study for staff/student due to dysmenorrhea, ovarian cyst, and/or pelvic nodule size. The safety was monitored throughout the treatment period. All the analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. For continuous outcomes, simple or multiple linear regressions were used to estimate the differences between the HHRY pills and placebo groups, with categorical data expressed as the number and percentage of occurrences. Differences were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The predefined analysis was adjusted for concomitant treatment, a variable considered to be associated with outcomes but unaffected by treatment allocation. Estimates of treatment effects were reported with 95% confidence intervals. Two-tailed P values ≤ .05 were considered statistically significant.
Conclusion
Positive results from this trial, upon completion would provide robust evidence for the efficacy and safety of HHRY pills in treating dysmenorrhea in patients with endometriosis.}

These miRNAs maintain stability in the extracellular environment, making them viable tools for disease diagnosis. They can withstand the digestive processes in the gastrointestinal tract, positioning them as potential carriers for specific oral drug delivery. By engineering plants to generate effective, non-toxic miRNA interference sequences, it's possible to broaden their applicability, including the treatment of diseases such as hepatitis C. Consequently, delving into the miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) within herbal medicines holds immense promise for diagnosing and addressing miRNA-related diseases. In our research, we propose the SGAE-MDA model, which harnesses the strengths of a graph autoencoder (GAE) combined with a semi-supervised approach to uncover potential MDAs in herbal medicines more effectively. Leveraging the GAE framework, the SGAE-MDA model exactly integrates the inherent feature vectors of miRNAs and disease nodes with the regulatory data in the miRNA-disease network. Additionally, the proposed semi-supervised learning approach randomly hides the partial structure of the miRNA-disease network, subsequently reconstructing them within the GAE framework. This technique effectively minimizes network noise interference. Through comparison against other leading deep learning models, the results consistently highlighted the superior performance of the proposed SGAE-MDA model.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
There has been a fundamental shift in the recruitment of medical students and trainees into residency and fellowship programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, websites for medical trainees demonstrate a lack of explicit focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Diversity has positive associations with improving healthcare team performance, patient care, and even financial goals. A lack of diversity may negatively affect patient care. Directed recruitment of underrepresented in medicine applicants has proven successful to increase diversity within training programs. Department websites had a more prominent role in virtual recruitment since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Features on these websites may be used to attract underrepresented in medicine applicants and increase diversity in a field.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to analyze maternal-fetal medicine fellowship websites for the presence of diversity elements important to those people who are underrepresented in medicine.
STUDY DESIGN
Fellowship websites were accessed in the summer of 2021. They were analyzed for the presence of 12 website elements that demonstrate commitment to diversity, including (1) nondiscrimination statement, (2) diversity and inclusion message, (3) diversity-specific language, (4) resources for trainees, (5) community demographics, (6) personalized biographies of faculty, (7) personalized biographies of fellows, (8) individual photographs of faculty, (9) individual photographs of fellows, (10) photos or biographies of alumni, (11) diversity publications, and (12) department statistics. Program size, region, and location were collected. Self-reported underrepresented in medicine data on residency programs was extracted from the National Graduate Medical Education Survey from 2019. Programs were dichotomized into ≥6 diversity elements. Nonparametric, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests were used for the analysis.
RESULTS
Fellowship programs were analyzed (excluding military or fetal surgery [n=91/94]). Websites included a mean of 4.1±2.5 diversity elements. Most featured fewer than 6 elements (n=75 [82.4%]). When dichotomized to ≥6 diversity elements, larger faculty size was the only significant factor (P=.01). Most programs had fewer than 12 faculty members (n=54 [59.3%]), and only 9.3% of those programs had >6 diversity elements. In contrast, among programs with more than 12 faculty, 29.7% had ≥6 diversity elements. Faculty photos, fellow photos, and diversity publications were the most commonly featured items (92.4%, 68.1%, and 49.5%, respectively). The mean rate of underrepresented in medicine was 18.8%±11.3%, and no significant association was noted. There was a nonsignificant difference in diversity elements in the West United States with a mean of 5.3±2.2 diversity elements, compared with a mean of 3.7±2.0 diversity elements in the South United States.
CONCLUSION
Fellowship websites convey information for trainees, especially in an era of virtual recruitment. This study highlights opportunities for directed improvements of websites for features that underrepresented in medicine trainees have identified as important.}

Building on the foundations of evidence-based medicine and existing precision medicine frameworks, we propose a novel evidence-based precision medicine framework in the form of the P32 model, which considers individual sex-related (predictive [P1], preventive [P2], and personalized [P3] medicine) and gender-related (participatory [P4], psychosocial [P5], and percipient [P6] medicine) domains and their intersection with ethnicity, geography, and other demographic and social variables, in addition to population, community, and public dimensions (population-informed [P7], partnered with community [P8], and public-engaging [P9] medicine, respectively). Through its ability to contextualize and reflect on societal realities and developments, our model is expected to promote consideration of diversity, equity, and inclusion principles and, thus, enrich science, increase reproducibility of research, and ensure its social impact.}

abstract = {Background
Gongjin-dan (GJD, also known as Gongchen-dan) and Ssanghwa-tang (SHT, also known as Shuanghe-tang or Souwa-to) are herbal medicines that are widely used in Korea for treating fatigue. However, few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of GJD and SHT in the treatment of chronic fatigue.
Methods
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 90 individuals with persistent (≥6 months) chronic fatigue of unknown cause and a Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score of ≥4 were randomly assigned to GJD group, SHT group, and control group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Outcomes were the changes in the self-reported fatigue questionnaire scores, levels of fatigue-related biomarkers and safety assessment.
Results
Out of 103 patients recruited, 90 were included in the analysis. A significant improvement in the Social Functioning (SF) score of Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) at week 4 was observed in the GJD group; similarly, a significant improvement compared with that in the Control group was observed in the Role Emotional (RE) score of SF-36 at weeks 4 and 6 and the Physical Functioning (PF) score of SF-36 at week 6 in the SHT group. Laboratory tests revealed no abnormalities, and serious intervention-related adverse events were not reported.
Conclusions
It is suggested that SHT can effectively treat chronic mental and physical fatigue, whereas GJD can effectively treat chronic mental and social fatigue. Furthermore, this study presents evidence supporting the safety of the long-term use of GJD and SHT (up to 4 weeks).

1. In reviewing trends in pediatric palliative medicine fellowship applicant pools and discussing the landscape of perinatal medicine, participants will understand the rationale for development of a new subspecialty fellowship track in hospice and palliative medicine (HPM). 2. Utilizing a discussion-based approach, participants will be able to apply the steps needed for the approval process and program development necessary to create a new HPM fellowship track.
Key Message
A novel, ACGME approved perinatal palliative medicine fellowship track was designed as a unique training opportunity for clinical care, education, research, and program development within perinatal palliative care to meet the demand for and growing interest in perinatal palliative care training.
Introduction
There has been a noticeable increase in hospice & palliative medicine (HPM) fellowship applicants who express interest in a career integrating Neonatology, Palliative care (PC), and Ethics. Currently no fellowship training programs are designed to meet this goal, despite greater need for clinicians with combined expertise as perinatal medicine sees ever-greater advances in diagnostic capabilities and possible interventions. To meet this need, a novel fellowship track was developed, inspired by combined adult subspecialty medicine and PC training programs.1,2
Objectives
The HPM Fellowship program at Northwestern University sought to create a novel ACGME approved subspecialty fellowship track for training in perinatal PC.
Methods
Institutional support was leveraged between a well-established HPM Fellowship program with a pediatric track and a perinatal PC service that collaborates with a large regional fetal health center. Stakeholders were identified to design learning objectives and clinical experiences in perinatal PC to augment already existing rotations in adult and pediatric HPM. Approval was obtained from institutional GME and the ACGME to adhere to training standards and requirements and ensure eligibility for board certification. With philanthropic and institutional financial support secured, the fellowship track participated in the NRMP Match for the 2023-2024 academic year. Select novel rotations were piloted with a fellow in the existing pediatric HPM program and methods of eliciting feedback and measuring performance were evaluated and fine-tuned prior to start of the fellowship.
Results
Upon successful recruitment, the inaugural trainee to the perinatal HPM fellowship track has started the academic year with expected program completion in June 2024.
Conclusion
Formal education and training will help meet the ongoing need for expert clinicians in the field of perinatal PC. Successful design, approval, and implementation of a perinatal HPM fellowship track could serve as a model for creation of additional subspecialty tracks within pediatric PC.

Gender disparity in authorship broadly persists in medical literature, little is known about female authorship within pulmonary medicine.
Methods
A bibliometric analysis of publications from 2012 to 2021 in 12 journals with the highest impact in pulmonary medicine was conducted. Only original research and review articles were included. Names of the first and last authors were extracted and their genders were identified using the Gender-API web. Female authorship was described by overall distribution and distribution by country/region/continent and journal. We compared the article citations by gender combinations, evaluated the trend in female authorship, and forecasted when parity for first and last authorship would be reached. We also conducted a systematic review of female authorship in clinical medicine.
Results
14,875 articles were included, and the overall percentage of female first authors was higher than last authors (37.0% vs 22.2%, p<0.001). Asia had the lowest percentage of female first (27.6%) and last (15.2%) authors. The percentages of female first and last authors increased slightly over time, except for a rapid increase in the COVID-19 pandemic periods. Parity was predicted in 2046 for the first authors and 2059 for the last authors. Articles with male authors were cited more than articles with female authors. However, male-male collaborations significantly decreased, whereas female-female collaborations significantly increased.
Conclusions
Despite the slow improvement in female authorship over the past decade, there is still a substantial gender disparity in female first and last authorship in high-impact medical journals in pulmonary medicine.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
The homelessness crisis continues to escalate nationwide, yet many healthcare providers are not adequately prepared to provide care for unhoused patients. An interprofessional Street Medicine elective was developed to address identified knowledge gaps in the unhoused population healthcare needs.
Educational activity and setting
The course comprised didactic and clinical elements focused on empathetic communication, resource utilization, and medical management for unhoused patients. Course learning outcomes were evaluated via thematic analysis of students' post-course reflective essays. Additionally, students completed a voluntary survey to evaluate course effectiveness in preparing students for healthcare in the unhoused population and to identify areas for course improvement.
Findings
Thirty students completed the course (17 osteopathic medical, five pharmacy, eight joint physician assistant/public health). All enrolled students submitted mandatory post-course reflections and 57% completed the voluntary survey. Thematic analysis of reflections indicated that the course content challenged biases toward unhoused populations, equipped students with new perspectives on the unique healthcare needs for unhoused patients, and provided interprofessional approaches to address these needs. Voluntary survey results demonstrated students' preparedness to provide effective care for local unhoused patients without bias or stigma. Most students reported they were likely to incorporate the knowledge/skills acquired from the course in their future clinical practice and were satisfied with the course content and organization.
Summary
The Street Medicine elective provided a structured interprofessional curricular opportunity on specialized care for unhoused individuals. This course can be adapted by other healthcare professional programs to empower students to address the growing homelessness crisis.}

abstract = {Background & aims
Traditional Chinese medicine and radiofrequency ablation are becoming increasingly important in the treatment of primary liver cancer. However, the clinical outcome of traditional Chinese medicine plus radiofrequency ablation is contentious. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials to address this gap.
Methods
Short-term efficacy, alpha-fetoprotein level, immune function, liver function, and quality of life outcomes in patients with primary liver cancer treated with Chinese herbal medicine adjuvant radiofrequency ablation were systematically reviewed.
Results
Eighteen randomized controlled clinical trials with 1488 patients with primary liver cancer were included. The combination treatment significantly increased the objective remission rate and quality of patient survival compared to the control group. Combination treatment significantly improved immunity and liver function factors, including CD3, CD4, CD4/CD8, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and albumin levels. However, there were no statistical differences in CD8 levels across treatments. Trial sequential analysis showed that the cumulative Z-curve of the Objective response rate crossed the conventional and test sequence monitoring boundaries; however, it did not cross the required information size line.
Conclusions
Traditional Chinese medicine combined with radiofrequency ablation for primary liver cancer can effectively reduce alpha-fetoprotein and improve clinical efficacy, immune function, liver function, as well as the quality of life.}

abstract = {Background
Chinese herbs have been used in sports and exercises as potent remedies for the treatment of sports injuries and recovery from sports fatigue. Herbs such as Astragalus, Radix Codonopsis, Shiitake and Rhodiola are favoured for their ability to help athletes improve their physical performance and to enable rapid recovery from fatigue. Abundant studies have proved that these traditional Chinese medicines(TCM) have a positive effect on athletic performance. For instance, TCM have been shown to have a significant recovery effect on skeletal muscle, cardiovascular and central nervous system fatigue caused by sports training or intense competition. Admittedly, it is necessary for more in-depth research to ensure the safety of TCM in sports. However, relatively little research has been done in this area and more studies are needed to assess and confirm the effects of TCM on the post-exercise organism, particularly with regard to the dosage of TCM, the duration of supplementation and a larger sample size.
Purpose
The main purpose of the research is to restore athletes' athletic fatigue and improve their athletic performance through traditional Chinese medicine, changing the traditional massage method to restore fatigue. By looking for literature, the achievements of predecessors are summarized and summarized.
Methods
I reviewed the literature of many scholars on Chinese medicine, described the value and potential of Chinese medicine in sports, and put forward a new research direction on Chinese medicine and sports
Results
the results of scholars have shown that the fatigue recovery of athletes can be improved through traditional Chinese medicine, and the performance of athletes can be improved to a certain extent.
Conclusion
The conclusion is that the conditioning through traditional Chinese medicine can promote the athletic performance of athletes, while improving their physiology and restoring fatigue to a certain extent.}

More than a third of cancer patients use traditional and complementary medicines (T&CM) in the Beni Mellal Khenifra region of Morocco. No study has investigated the reasons for this use. Our objective is to explore the main resaons this use.
Methods
Between April and October 2022, 200 cancer patients from the Beni Mellal oncology center participated in a qualitative and descriptive study with semi-structured interviews. We used thematic analysis to identify reasons for use.
Results
156 patients used T&CM (78%). The majority used natural products, including medicinal plants. The first four reasons given by the patients were the hope of recovery (25.64%), the reduction of the undesirable effects of conventional treatments (20.51%), the improvement of the quality of life (physical, psychological, and aesthetic) (17.94%) and following traditions and customs (15.38%).
Conclusion
The four reasons mentioned can explain the use of T&CM. Given the discrepancies found in other studies, this area of research deserves further investigation across Morocco.}

The identification of a genetic etiology paves the way to precision medicine: an individualized treatment approach, based on the disease pathophysiology. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to: (1) determine the diagnostic yield of WES in a heterogeneous cohort of individuals with epilepsy referred for genetic testing in a real-world clinical setting, (2) investigate the influence of epilepsy characteristics on the diagnostic yield, (3) determine the theoretical yield of treatment changes based on genetic diagnosis and (4) explore the barriers to implementation of precision medicine. WES was performed in 247 individuals with epilepsy, aged between 7 months and 68 years. In 34/247 (14 %) a (likely) pathogenic variant was identified. In 7/34 (21 %) of these individuals the variant was found using a HPO-based filtering. Diagnostic yield was highest for individuals with an early onset of epilepsy (39 %) or in those with a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (34 %). Precision medicine was a theoretical possibility in 20/34 (59 %) of the individuals with a (likely) pathogenic variant but implemented in only 11/34 (32 %). The major barrier to implementation of precision treatment was the limited availability or reimbursement of a given drug. These results confirm the potential impact of genetic analysis on treatment choices, but also highlight the hurdles to the implementation of precision medicine. To optimize precision medicine in real-world practice, additional endeavors are needed: unifying definitions of precision medicine, establishment of publicly accessible databases that include data on the functional effect of gene variants, increasing availability and reimbursement of precision therapeutics, and broadening access to innovative clinical trials.}

abstract = {The demand for an effective system that combines cutting-edge technologies with medical research to improve healthcare systems has increased with the development of medical technology. The most fundamental form of disease prevention is taking the right medication when needed. With the right care, many fatal diseases can be cured or prevented. Therefore, it is crucial to follow the doctor's recommended drug plan. Healthcare experts now have serious concerns about patients not being able to take their prescribed medications on time, particularly elderly patients. Due to age-related memory loss, people who have been given multiple prescriptions at once over an extended period of time are more likely to forget to take their medication on time or to take the wrong medication. Sometimes, a patient's inability to take the right medication at the right time might have a major impact on their health. Aside from being forgetful, patients, especially the elderly and illiterate, may not be able to read the name stated on medical containers, leading to the consumption of the wrong medication. These errors contribute to non-adherence to pharmaceuticals, which is detrimental to the patient's health. As a result, there is a significant problem that hinders the success of the treatment. The medication reminder system is intended for people who frequently take medications or vitamin supplements in order to handle this. In order to help an elderly person properly take their medication and help the patient have a healthy life, we have created a ground-breaking portable multifunctional medicine reminder kit with phone calls. Other intelligent characteristics of the smart medicine reminder include the capacity to show the time, date, and day in real time, the detection of smoke, the measurement of air humidity and temperature in the room, the measurement of heartbeats per second, the patient's body temperature, and the oxygen saturation level.}

abstract = {Introduction
Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common gynecological complaint among adolescents and young women. Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have been widely used for PD treatment in China. However, the relative advantages of different CHM regimens remain uncertain. This systematic review aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of different CHMs for the treatment of PD using network meta-analysis.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) from their inception to December 17, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CHM or Chinese patent drugs with Prostaglandin Synthetase Inhibitors (PGSIs) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A frequentist framework network meta-analysis was performed using R (4.2.2).
Results
A total of 54 RCTs with 5,345 PD patients were included. Compared with PGSIs, Danggui Sini decoction (mean difference [MD] = -5.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.64 to -3.20) and Xiangfu Siwu Decoction (MD = -4.63, 95%CI -8.37 to -0.89) reduced pain significantly.; Danggui Sini decoction (risk ratio[RR] = 1.31, 95%CI 1.12 to 1.53), Danggui shaoyao san (RR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.44), Siwu decoction (RR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.17 to 1.47), Taohong Siwu Decoction (RR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.14 to 1.61), and Wenjing decoction (RR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.19 to 1.52) showed significantly higher overall response rates, and Wenjing decoction could significantly reduce TCM syndrome scores (MD = -4.14, 95%CI -6.84 to -1.44), compared with PGSIs. No serious adverse events were observed. Siwu decoction and Wenjing decoction ranked as the top treatment options in terms of all outcomes of interest (P-score ranking).
Conclusions
CHMs were associated with improved overall response rate, pain reduction, and alleviation of symptoms compared to conventional treatments for patients with PD, and no serious adverse events were observed. However, the confidence in the conclusions is limited because of the lack of high-quality trials.}

To describe variation in genomic medicine services across level IV neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the United States and Canada.
Methods
We developed and distributed a novel survey to the 43 level IV NICUs belonging to the Children’s Hospitals Neonatal Consortium, requesting a single response per site from a clinician with knowledge of the provision of genomic medicine services.
Results
Overall response rate was 74% (32/43). Although chromosomal microarray and exome or genome sequencing (ES or GS) were universally available, access was restricted for 22% (7/32) and 81% (26/32) of centers, respectively. The most common restriction on ES or GS was requiring approval by a specialist (41%, 13/32). Rapid ES/GS was available in 69% of NICUs (22/32). Availability of same-day genetics consultative services was limited (41%, 13/32 sites), and pre- and post-test counseling practices varied widely.
Conclusion
We observed large inter-center variation in genomic medicine services across level IV NICUs: most notably, access to rapid, comprehensive genetic testing in time frames relevant to critical care decision making was limited at many level IV Children’s Hospitals Neonatal Consortium NICUs despite a significant burden of genetic disease. Further efforts are needed to improve access to neonatal genomic medicine services.}

Despite these exemplar applications, there remain significant challenges to the sector-wide adoption of AMM technologies. Drawing on Symposium delegate expert responses to open-ended questions, our coding-based thematic analysis suggest three primary enablers drive successful adoption of AMM technologies at scale, namely: the ability to leverage pre-competitive collaborations to challenge-based problem solving; information and knowledge sharing through centres of excellence; and the development of AMM specific regulatory standards. Further analysis of expert responses identified the emergence of a ‘Platform creation’ approach to AMM innovation; characterised by: i) New collaboration modes; ii) Exploration of common product-process platforms for new dosage forms and therapy areas; iii) Development of modular equipment assets that enable scale-out, and offer more decentralized or distributed manufacturing models; iv) Standards based on product-process platform archetypes; v) Implementation strategies where platform-thinking and AMM technologies can significantly reduce timelines between discovery, approval and GMP readiness. We provide a definition of the Platform creation concept for AMM and discuss the requirements for its systematic development.}

The median number of 40-point criteria met by the preventive medicine residency website was 25. The criteria fulfilled by the greatest number of program websites was research opportunity/facilities (94%). The majority of the preventive medicine residency program websites were not up to the mark regarding accessibility and quality. An updated preventive medicine residency program website is essential for the applicants. Programs with relevant and precise information on their websites have higher chances of attracting potential candidates and better chances of finding the match between applicants and programs.}

As the search for effective treatments for COVID-19 continues, the high mortality rate among critically ill patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) presents a profound challenge. This study explores the potential benefits of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a supplementary treatment for severe COVID-19. A total of 110 critically ill COVID-19 patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Vulcan Hill Hospital between Feb., 2020, and April, 2020 (Wuhan, China) participated in this observational study. All patients received standard supportive care protocols, with a subset of 81 also receiving TCM as an adjunct treatment. Clinical characteristics during the treatment period and the clinical outcome of each patient were closely monitored and analysed. Our findings indicated that the TCM group exhibited a significantly lower mortality rate compared with the non-TCM group (16 of 81 vs 24 of 29; 0.3 vs 2.3 person/month). In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, TCM treatment was associated with improved survival odds (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the analysis also revealed that TCM treatment could partially mitigate inflammatory responses, as evidenced by the reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and contribute to the recovery of multiple organic functions, thereby potentially increasing the survival rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients.}

Sleep medicine fellowship training started on (or after) July 1, 2009 must be accredited by the ACGME in order for the examinee to be board-eligible. After the 2011 board exam, potential examinees were no longer able to meet training requirements through a “practice pathway”, but rather now need to successfully complete 12 months of an ACGME-accredited sleep medicine fellowship program.}

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases, particularly myocardial infarction (MI), are a significant cause of mortality globally. Traditional MIs are commonly linked to substantial coronary artery blockage. However, a distinct subset of patients experience MI with non-obstructive coronary arteries, known as MINOCA. Imaging techniques, such as invasive coronary angiograms, are employed to diagnose MI or assess predisposition to one. Coronary angiograms help visualize vessel blockages; however, these blockages are absent in MINOCA cases, posing a diagnostic challenge. Precision medicine aims to introduce new diagnostic tools to assist in early diagnosis and further management of MINOCA. As percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not benefit MINOCA patients, medical management tailored to the specific pathophysiological mechanism of MINOCA is employed. For example, if MINOCA is attributed to plaque disruption with or without plaque thrombus formation, the fundamental treatments may include statins, agents that modulate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and antiplatelet therapies. On the other hand, if coronary artery spasm is identified as the primary cause, essential intervention involves the use of calcium channel blockers. This approach has been previously utilized in patients with vasospastic angina and could be utilized in MINOCA, although research specific to MINOCA is ongoing. Therefore, the handling of MINOCA underscores the necessity for a tailored therapeutic strategy that corresponds to the underlying physiological mechanism responsible for the patient's clinical symptoms. Ongoing research initiatives are directed at expanding the availability of these treatments, uncovering new biomarkers, creating advanced diagnostic instruments, and establishing a more individualized approach for managing MINOCA patients.}

With the development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome knowledge accumulation and artificial intelligence (AI), this study proposes a holistic TCM syndrome differentiation model for the classification prediction of multiple TCM syndromes based on deep learning and accelerates the construction of modern foundational TCM equipment.
Methods
We searched publicly available TCM guidelines and textbooks for expert knowledge and validated these sources using ten-fold cross-validation. Based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models, with the classification constraints from TCM holistic syndrome differentiation, the TCM-BERT-CNN model was constructed, which completes the end-to-end TCM holistic syndrome text classification task through symptom input and syndrome output. We assessed the performance of the model using precision, recall, and F1 scores as evaluation metrics.
Results
The TCM-BERT-CNN model had a higher precision (0.926), recall (0.9238), and F1 score (0.9247) than the BERT, TextCNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and attention mechanism-based LSTM (LSTM-attention) models and achieved superior results in model performance and predictive classification of most TCM syndromes. Symptom feature visualization demonstrated that the TCM-BERT-CNN model can effectively identify the correlation and characteristics of symptoms in different syndromes with a strong correlation, which conforms to the diagnostic characteristics of TCM syndromes.
Conclusions
The TCM-BERT-CNN model proposed in this study is in accordance with the TCM diagnostic characteristics of holistic syndrome differentiation and can effectively complete diagnostic prediction tasks for various TCM syndromes. The results of this study provide new insights into the development of deep learning models for holistic syndrome differentiation in TCM.}

Anti-microbial resistance is a complex and evolving global public health threat. Promoting effective alternative treatments is an important way to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics. This study aimed to identify the use of treatments for acute cough in China, including Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and their association with avoidance of antibiotics and participants’ reported clinical recovery.
Methods
An online retrospective treatment outcome survey was conducted. Retrospective clinical information was collected on participants who either were experiencing acute cough, or had experienced acute cough in the last 3 months. Participants were recruited through WeChat (a QR code or a link to the online survey), using snowball sampling. We analysed the usage of different CHMs, changes in symptoms as measured by Likert scales and subsequent use of antibiotics.
Results
A total of 25,583 participants completed the online questionnaire, covering all 34 province-level administrative units in China. Respondents had a median age of 25 years (73.5%, aged 18–39). Most respondents reported sputum (65.8%). Nearly half of the participants (45.3%) reported using antibiotics, 39.4% using CHMs, 27.1% and 20.9% using non-antibiotic Western medications and home remedies respectively. Fewer participants took antibiotics after taking CHMs (14.4%), compared to those who started with home remedies (17.6%), or non-antibiotic Western medications (24.5%). The recommendation of doctors (62.4%) and pharmacies (32.1%) were the most common reason for choosing CHMs. Participant-reported clinical recovery was similar (same median of 4 on a 1–5 Likert self-rating scale) regardless of type of CHM. The five CHMs associated with the lowest proportions of subsequent antibiotic use were individualised Chinese herbal formulae, Xiao Qing Long granule, Xian Zhu Li liquid, Chuan Bei Pi Pa Gao and Shi Wu Wei Long Dan Hua pill. The most commonly used herbs in the Chinese patent medicines were Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizome, Platycodonis radix, Pinelliae rhizome, Armeniacae semen amarum, Ephedrae herba, and Citri reticulatae pericarpium.
Conclusion
Almost 40% of participants with acute cough used CHMs. The proportion of participants who subsequently used antibiotics after CHMs was lower than other treatments. CHMs have a potential role for symptom relief thus reducing antibiotic use.}

Herbal medicine as complementary ways are needed for patients who refuse to take medicine for life. Early intervention and lifestyle could delay the time of taking drugs.
Objective
To assess the efficacy of XiaokeGranules vs Sitagliptin in patients who diagnosed T2D.
Methods
This is a randomized, double-blind trial. T2D patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Xiaoke Granules and Sitagliptin(50 mg), an anti-diabetic medicine group, for 12 weeks. Before randomization, the consenting participants were subjected to 2 weeks of screening, followed by twelve weeks of intervention. The primary outcome was change from baseline in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) calculation at 12 week.
Results
We recruited 103 patients, 84 patients participated in the clinical trial and finally 79 patients finished., the least square mean change in HbA1c and HOMA-IR from baseline was similar in both groups, in which HbA1c (6.93 ± 0.76, P = 0.007) and 2hPG (10.87 ± 2.20, P = 0.016) for the Control group, and HbA1c (6.76 ± 0.67, P < 0.001) and 2hPG (10.52 ± 2.46, P = 0.019).
Conclusions
This study revealed that the herbal medicine Xiaoke Granules provides effective glycaemic control with similar safety and immunogenicity profile to Sitagliptin among T2D patients treated for 12 weeks. This study strongly suggests further studies and utilization of Xiaoke Granules usage for controlling hyperglycemia among T2D patients.

abstract = {Background
The prevalence of type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) ranges from 20 % to 40 % among individuals with type 2 diabetes. Multiple immune pathways play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of T2DN. This study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of active ingredients derived from 14 traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) on T2DN.
Methods
By removing batch effect on the GSE30528 and GSE96804 datasets, we employed a combination of weighted gene co-expression network analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis, protein–protein interaction network analysis, and the CIBERSORT algorithm to identify the active ingredients of TCMs as well as potential hub biomarkers associated with immune cells. Functional analysis was conducted using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and gene set variation analysis (GSVA). Additionally, molecular docking was employed to evaluate interactions between active ingredients and potential immunotherapy targets.
Results
A total of 638 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in this study, comprising 5 hub genes along with 4 potential biomarkers. Notably, CXCR1, CXCR2, and FOS exhibit significant associations with immune cells while displaying robust or favorable affinities towards the active ingredients kaempferol, quercetin, and luteolin. Furthermore, functional analysis unveiled intricate involvement of DEGs, hub genes and potential biomarkers in pathways closely linked to immunity and diabetes.
Conclusion
The potential hub biomarkers and immunotherapy targets associated with immune cells of T2DN comprise CXCR1, CXCR2, and FOS. Furthermore, kaempferol, quercetin, and luteolin demonstrate potential immunomodulatory effects in modulating T2DN through the regulation of CXCR1, CXCR2, and FOS expression.}

abstract = {Objectives
To measure prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in a diverse gynecologic oncology patient population and evaluate how attitudes and beliefs regarding CAM relate to demographic factors.
Methods
A validated Attitudes and Beliefs about Complementary and Alternative Medicine (ABCAM) survey was distributed to patients with gynecologic malignancy. Results were evaluated using Pearson's Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon ranks sum and Kruskal-Wallace tests for non-normally distributed variables.
Results
One-hundred thirty patients completed the ABCAM survey. Self-reported race and ethnicity included Asian or Pacific Islander (n = 54; 42%), Hispanic/Latino (n = 23; 18%), White (n = 21; 16%), Black or African American (n = 20; 15%), American Indian/Alaska Native (n = 8; 6.2%) and Other (n = 4; 3.1%). Twenty-four respondents (18%) reported use of CAM. There was a significant difference in expected benefits to CAM between respondents of different races/ethnicities (p < 0.001). Black and Asian respondents reported greater expected benefit to CAM. Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and White respondents reported fewer expected benefits. A significant association was found between perceived barriers to CAM and race/ethnicity (p 0.043), with Asian, Hispanic/Latino and White respondents perceiving more barriers while Black and American Indian/Alaskan Natives reported perceiving fewer barriers to CAM. Respondents with incomes greater than $100,000 reported fewer barriers to CAM.
Conclusions
Use of CAM among gynecologic oncology patients is lower than previously thought. Income, race, and ethnicity inform patient engagement with CAM and can be used to better tailor the provision of evidence-based CAM interventions to benefit a greater number of gynecologic cancer patients.}

Consequently, all theories and practices of ancient medicines were reduced to superstitions. Historians relegated pre-Harveian cardiology to roughs notes, preventing a proper historical evaluation of many centuries of conceptions and practices. All the ancient civilizations shared the conviction that the heart was the biological and spiritual center of the body, the seat of emotions, mind, will, a vital energy produced by breathing and healing, and the soul. This cardiocentric view maintained a special role both in religion and in medicine across millennia from east to west, passing over cultural and scientific revolutions. Here, we will try to give a schematic account of medical beliefs on the heart from the most important pre-classic medicines. Some of them today show to have a kernel of truth. This demonstrates, at least, that history is a non-linear process and that intuitions or even truths, potentially useful for the present and scientific development, can re-emerge from the past.}

abstract = {Introduction
Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is marked by reduced estrogen production and irregular ovulation, often resulting in lowered fertility or infertility. The traditional Chinese medicine "Liu Zi Tang" (LZT) has displayed promising outcomes in treating POI. Yet, conventional oral LZT administration poses challenges, including gastrointestinal irritation and the liver's first-pass effect. Thus, a novel drug delivery approach is imperative.
Method
This research incorporated the extracts of traditional Chinese medicine LZT into a novel liposome type, leading to the creation of LZT-glycerol plasmid/chitosan hydrogel (LZT-Gly-Lip/CS Gel) drug-carrier patches for achieving transdermal gradual-release drug delivery. The POI model was established in rats through intraperitoneal injection of vinylcyclohexene dioxide (VCD). A total of twenty-four 4-week-old female SD rats were distributed randomly among four groups: negative control (NC), vinylcyclohexene dioxide model (VCD), LZT/chitosan hydrogel treatment (VCD+LZT/CS Gel), and LZT glycerol liposome/chitosan hydrogel treatment (VCD+LZT-Gly-Lip/CS Gel). The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by observing and analyzing the rats' body weight, diverse organ indices, serum hormone levels, and histopathological sections.
Result

abstract = {Background
Herbal medicines are raw or processed plant-derived ingredients. Their use during pregnancy may contributed to several adverse effects that could be lethal to the mother and their unborn children.
Aims
This study aims to assess the prevalence of herbal medicine use and associated factors among pregnant women at Woldia General Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (WGCSH) in Ethiopia.
Samples
The sample size in this study was 272.
Methods
A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 270 pregnant mothers from March 2 to April 2, 2021, at WGCSH in the antenatal care clinic. A standardized, structured questionnaire-based interviewer was used to collect the socio-demographic variables; obstetrics variables; and other related variables for this study. The prevalence of herbal medicine use and associated factors were determined using descriptive and logistic regression analysis, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
Results
The prevalence of herbal medicine use in this study was 22.6%. Most of the pregnant women used Ocimum lamiifolium and Rutachalepensis. The use of herbal medicines during pregnancy in rural areas was higher than in urban areas (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.35–3.54). The place of residence (AOR 3.66; 95% CI 1.83–4.74), perception of needing to use herbal medicine (AOR 2.20; 95% CI 4.99–9.86), stage of pregnancy (AOR 2.56; 95% CI 1.16–9.36), distance from the health facility (AOR 2.90; 95% CI 1.52–12.65), and previous use of herbal medicine (AOR 3.23; 95% CI 2.74–7.56) were significantly associated with herbal medicine use.
Conclusions
Nearly one-fourth of pregnant mothers at WGCSH used herbal products and preparations.}

abstract = {Purpose
To compare the time to publication of accepted manuscripts and content in orthopaedic sports medicine journals during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
A convenience sample of articles published in January, May, and September during the years 2019−2021 was taken from Arthroscopy, American Journal of Sports Medicine (AJSM), and Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (KSSTA). The duration between the aspects of the article publication process was compared between journals and years.
Results
Overall, 826 journal articles were included. Arthroscopy demonstrated no significant differences in the time from manuscript submission to journal publication from 2019 to 2021, a significant decrease in time from acceptance to e-Pub (140 vs 74 vs 16 days; P < .001), but an increase from e-Pub to journal publication (23 vs 74 vs 130 days; P < .001). In AJSM, there was an overall increase in time from submission to journal publication significant between 2019 and 2021 (P = .05) and 2020 and 2021 (P = .001). KSSTA demonstrated the longest timelines in 2020. There was a trend toward a greater number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Conclusion
Changes in various aspects of the time to publication and journal content occurred in orthopaedic sports medicine journals in the years surrounding the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Although it is not possible to know whether these delays are caused by journal or author-related factors, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the possible delay in time to publication and consider online and e-publication resources for the most current evidence-based medicine, while journals may take this information into account to consider ways of improving the publication process and when determining journal content.
Clinical Relevance
It is important to understand the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the publications which orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons rely on for clinical knowledge and the practice of evidence-based medicine.}

Comparing the effect of serious game and problem-based learning on nursing students' knowledge and clinical decision-making skill regarding the application of transfusion medicine in pediatric nursing.
Design and methods
In this quasi-experimental study, 76 undergraduate nursing students were enrolled through a convenience sampling method, and were allocated to one of the three groups of serious game, problem-based learning, and control through the block randomization method. Data were collected using a valid and reliable 3-part researcher-made tool, completed before and two weeks after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-test, analysis of covariance, and Bonferroni post hoc test. A significance level of <0.05 was considered.
Results
After the intervention, mean scores of both knowledge and clinical decision-making skill increased significantly in both intervention groups (p < 0.05). Mean post-test scores of both knowledge and clinical decision-making skill in the serious game group, and only clinical decision-making skill in the problem-based learning group were significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed regarding mean post-test scores of both knowledge and clinical decision-making skill between the intervention groups (p > 0.05).
Conclusions
Both serious game and problem-based learning are proven to be effective in improving nursing students' knowledge and clinical decision-making skill regarding the application of transfusion medicine in pediatric nursing.
Practice implications
Since learning now occurs beyond classrooms and the new generation of students spend most of their time in virtual places, utilizing technology-based teaching methods like serious games can benefit both educators and students by providing continuous education, saving their time and expenses, etc.}

abstract = {Study objective
Prior work has found first-attempt success improves with emergency medicine (EM) postgraduate year (PGY). However, the association between PGY and laryngoscopic view – a key step in successful intubation – is unknown. We examined the relationship among PGY, laryngoscopic view (ie, Cormack–Lehane view), and first-attempt success.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Emergency Airway Registry, including adult intubations by EM PGY 1 to 4 resident physicians. We used inverse probability weighting with propensity scores to balance confounders. We used weighted regression and model comparison to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between PGY and Cormack–Lehane view, tested the interaction between PGY and Cormack–Lehane view on first-attempt success, and examined the effect modification of Cormack–Lehane view on the association between PGY and first-attempt success.
Results
After exclusions, we included 15,453 first attempts. Compared to PGY 1, the aORs for a higher Cormack–Lehane grade did not differ from PGY 2 (1.01; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.07), PGY 3 (0.92; 0.31 to 2.73), or PGY 4 (0.80; 0.31 to 2.04) groups. The interaction between PGY and Cormack–Lehane view was significant (P-interaction<0.001). In patients with Cormack–Lehane grade 3 or 4, the aORs for first-attempt success were higher for PGY 2 (1.80; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.77), PGY 3 (2.96; 1.66 to 5.27) and PGY 4 (3.10; 1.60 to 6.00) groups relative to PGY 1.
Conclusion
Compared with PGY 1, PGY 2, 3, and 4 resident physicians obtained similar Cormack–Lehane views but had higher first-attempt success when obtaining a grade 3 or 4 view.}

abstract = {Introduction
The most significant obstacle in addressing cancer is the development of multidrug resistance during chemotherapy. Cancer cells have the ability to endure numerous cycles of traditional chemotherapy drugs before ultimately developing resistance to the treatment. Combining drugs is a strategy used to address the problem of multidrug resistance. Persistent challenges with synthetic drugs include catastrophic adverse reactions and other consequences. Natural compounds originating from traditional Chinese medicine are acknowledged for their minimal toxicity and possible benefits in reversing multidrug resistance induced by mainstream chemotherapeutic or targeted treatments. Cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) is an immediate clinical justification for unsatisfactory chemotherapy treatment. Cancer recurrence and metastasis are precipitated by MDR, leading to a high risk of death. The development of a unique nano-delivery method for the therapeutic management of MDR cancers has emerged as a key use of nanotechnology. Because of its significant anticancer prospective, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-combination therapy is an emerging treatment modality and an essential treatment option for cancer. By precisely regulating the release of medicines and delivering pharmaceuticals to cancerous cells, nano targeted drug-delivery devices offer amazing benefits and pave the way for the growth of TCM-combination therapies.
Method
The present review examines the literature on three important topics: the mechanism of MDR in cancer chemotherapy, the role of traditional Chinese herbs and formulation in MDR treatment, and the incorporation of TCM in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems to circumvent the limitations of traditional system. Major sources for the work include PubMed, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Embase, and ScienceDirect. All the aspects pertaining to MDR, TCM, and nanotechnology for more than 50 years were considered, with an emphasis on the use of TCM in nano formulation, various forms of nano formulation, advances in the drug delivery system as a result of nanotechnology, and everything else in between.
Results
As nanotechnology becomes more closely associated with TCM, the realm of practice for TCM is broadening. Furthermore, it enhances the prospects for future research and facilitates the advancement of modern Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). By integrating nanotechnology into a meticulously designed drug delivery system, TCM will enhance its ability to both treat and prevent diseases with even greater efficacy than previously.
Discussion
This article examines nano-TCM and explores its characteristics, compositions, and relevant techniques for preparation and application in reversing MDR. In addition, a comprehensive elucidation of the key benefits of nano-TCM had been given with respect to MDR. The objective of this study was to analyze the existing body of literature on the application of nanotechnology in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that can be used in the treatment of MDR. The review encompasses various aspects like the development of active components for TCM, the utilization of TCM for reversing multidrug resistance (MDR), and the potential future advancements and obstacles associated with TCM-based nano combinations.}

Complementary and alternative medications (CAM) are common among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) for physical and psychological support. However, there is insufficient data regarding the application of CAM in the different cultures and beliefs of each community as well as patient's status.
Objective
To evaluate the prevalence and modalities of the use of CAM among patients with central nervous system idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNS-IIDD) in a tertiary care hospital
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted at Siriraj Hospital from June to December 2021 involving patients with MS, neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorders (NMOSD), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), idiopathic transverse myelitis (iTM), and optic neuritis (ON) to examine the prevalence and mode of CAM use and its correlation with patient characteristics.
Results
There were 107 patients. The diagnoses were MS (38), NMOSD (55), MOGAD (5), iTM (7), and ON (2). Most of the patients were female (89.7%), and 61.7% were diagnosed over 5 years. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale was 2.63 (S.D., 2.38), and the median ambulation index was 0 (range 0–8.5). There were 68 patients (63.6%) with a history of CAM use for at least 3 months, while those with current use decreased to 62 (58.5%). Vitamins and minerals were the most commonly used, particularly vitamin D (97.1%) and calcium (47.7%). Both treatments were primarily prescribed (95.3%) rather than self-administered (24.3%). The main reasons for the use of CAM were to strengthen their health (48.6%) and relieve existing symptoms (28.0%).
Conclusions
The use of CAM is common among patients with Thai CNS-IIDD. Further exploration of patient perspectives and preferences regarding CAM usage may contribute to a more comprehensive management approach for patients with CNS-IIDD.}

TAMs promote the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumour cells by remodelling the extracellular matrix, inhibiting immunity, promoting immune escape and tumour angiogenesis, and affecting cell metabolism. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used clinically in China for millennia. Chinese herbs exhibit potent antitumour effects with minimal to no toxicity, substantially contributing to prolonging the lives of patients with cancer and improving their quality of life. TCM has unique advantages in improving the solid tumour microenvironment, particularly in regulating TAMs to further inhibit tumour angiogenesis, reduce drug resistance, reverse immunosuppression, and enhance antitumour immunity. This review highlights the TAM-associated mechanisms within the solid tumour microenvironment, outlines the recent advancements in TCM targeting TAMs for antitumour effects, emphasises the superiority of combining TCM with standard treatments or new nano-drug delivery systems, and evaluates the safety and efficacy of TCM combined with conventional treatments via clinical trials to provide insights and strategies for future research and clinical treatment.}

Medicinal plant value chains can promote local development and sustainable livelihoods that are critical for forest frontiers in need of inclusive economic alternatives. This sector can become an example of restorative bioeconomy, which not only maintains but enhances nature's contributions to people – notably to historically marginalized actors such as Indigenous peoples. However, a reality check is due. Using the Amazon as an emblematic case study, this article examines Brazil's context and policy framework on herbal medicine promotion. It draws from a literature review as well as 23 key-informant interviews and field visits to 10 local herbal medicine value chain initiatives. Our findings expose a closing window of opportunity, as while deforestation and forest degradation advances, Brazil's herbal medicine promotion has fallen short of its potentials for development and inclusiveness. Insufficient attention to traditional knowledge or to research on Brazil's native biodiversity, regulatory stringency without converse support to integrate marginalized actors, and ambivalent social acceptability of herbal medicine have been key barriers to advancing the sector. We conclude that herbal medicine offers a clear case of restorative bioeconomy with double potential to address historical inequalities both on healthcare access and socioeconomic inclusiveness, but delivering on that requires much more participatory research, attention to local capacity enhancement, and a better understanding of herbal medicine promotion in multicultural social settings.}

To examine the current situation of potentially inappropriate medicines (PIM) for treatment of chronicity in older patients and whether the inappropriate medicines were included in the 22nd World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines (EMLs), China National Model list of Essential Medicines (China EMLs), or supplementary list of essential medicines in Guizhou Province 2018 (Guizhou EMLs) through real world data, so as to promote the development of lists of essential medicines suitable for older patients and provide a reference for the revision of lists of essential medicines to reduce adverse effects, drug-induced diseases and even possible death due to use of inappropriate medicines existing in lists of essential medicines.
Methods
A retrospectively study was conducted. Dispensing records of patients aged ≥ 65 admitted to convenience clinic of a tertiary hospital from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 were extracted through electronic information system. Then, we merged dispensing records of the same patient on the same date as one record and patients with at least one chronic disease were included. The American Geriatrics Society(AGS)/Beers Criteria 2019 (Beers 2019) was used to evaluate the PIM status. Thereafter, the inappropriate medicines were compared with WHO EMLs, China EMLs, and Guizhou EMLs to find out percentages of drugs of PIMs existing in above lists of essential medicines in all drugs of PIMs. The above evaluation was conducted using Excel software (version 2019).
Results
A total of 5314 dispensing reports were included in this study. 5.95% (316/5314), 7.88% (419/5314) of PIMs met Table 2 (medicines that are potentially inappropriate in most older adults), Table 4 (medicines that should be used with caution) of Beers 2019, respectively. Among PIM drugs which met Table 2 of Beers 2019, 47.37%, 78.95%, and 78.95% were respectively included in WHO EMLs, China EMLs, and Guizhou EMLs, and that was 47.06%, 76.47%, and 82.35% for Table 4 of Beers 2019.
Conclusions
PIM in older patients is common in clinical practice. Patients with diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, depression and/or anxiety and Parkinson’ diseases were more frequently prescribed drugs of PIM according to Beers 2019. Take older patients into consideration and formulate List of essential medicines special for older patients may be a key way to reduce PIM.}

We present listings of metrics that are reported by physicians or hospitals, either voluntarily or by mandate, to government agencies, payers, “watchdog” ratings organizations, and other entities. The costs and other burdens of extracting data and reporting metrics are summarized. The potential for unintended adverse consequences of the use of quality metrics is discussed along with approaches to mitigating adverse consequences. Finally, some recent attempts to develop simplified core measure sets are presented, with the promise that the complex and burdensome quality-metric enterprise may improve in the near future.}

abstract = {The spleen fulfills fundamental roles in both Hematological and Immunological processes, serving as the largest lymphoid organ within the body. Despite its significance, the spleen remains relatively understudied compared to other solid organs. Recent years have brought to light the profound implications of complete splenic absence, typically resulting from splenectomy or hypofunction, in various disease states including sickle cell anemia, cancer, and HIV infection. Diminished splenic activity often predisposes individuals to thromboembolic events and immune deficiencies, as exemplified by clinical manifestations observed in cases of COVID-19 where splenic dysfunction has been documented. Experimental models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have revealed clinical lymphopenia and splenic atrophy. This chapter consolidates current insights into the spleen's role in Regenerative Medicine, presenting novel perspectives for interdisciplinary research encompassing in vitro disease modeling, drug screening, and therapeutic interventions, alongside its traditional applications in hematology and immunology. Remarkable advancements have characterized spleen regenerative medicine in the 21st century: (a) pioneering the development of artificial spleen devices; (b) identifying a diverse array of pluripotent adult stem cells within the organ's stroma; (c) elucidating its contribution to the regeneration of insulin-producing cells within pancreatic islets; (d) unraveling mechanisms governing splenic regeneration; (e) showcasing its diagnostic utility in assessing immunotoxicity to biomaterials; (f) exploiting its therapeutic potential in ischemic stroke treatment; (g) demonstrating its capacity to support hematopoiesis and myelopoiesis; (h) devising protocols for generating splenic organoids adaptable for diverse applications; and (i) engineering biological scaffolds from decellularized splenic extracellular matrix, facilitating the development of hepatic, pancreatic, splenic, and thyroid tissue constructs. Consequently, the spleen emerges as a versatile organ harboring manifold applications in Regenerative Medicine. Anticipating further studies, we envision continued exploration not only towards creating compatible and functional bioartificial spleens, but also leveraging the spleen as a tool for study and application across the aforementioned domains.}

Osteoporosis is a chronic and systemic skeletal disease that is defined by low bone mineral density (BMD) along with an increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. This study aimed to overview clinical evidence on the use of herbal medicine for management of osteoporosis.
Methods
Electronic databases including Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane library, and Scopus were searched until November 2022 for any clinical studies on the efficacy and/or safety of plant-derived medicines in the management of osteoporosis.
Results
The search yielded 57 results: 19 on single herbs, 16 on multi-component herbal preparations, and 22 on plant-derived secondary metabolites. Risk of fracture, bone alkaline phosphatase, BMD, and specific bone biomarkers are investigated outcomes in these studies. Medicinal plants including Acanthopanax senticosus, Actaea racemosa, Allium cepa, Asparagus racemosus, Camellia sinensis, Cissus quadrangularis, Cornus mas, Nigella sativa, Olea europaea, Opuntia ficus-indica, Pinus pinaster, Trifolium pretense and phytochemicals including isoflavones, ginsenoside, Epimedium prenyl flavonoids, tocotrienols are among plant-derived medicines clinically investigated on osteoporosis. It seems that multi-component herbal preparations were more effective than single-component ones; because of the synergistic effects of their constituents. The investigated herbal medicines demonstrated their promising results in osteoporosis via targeting different pathways in bone metabolism, including balancing osteoblasts and osteoclasts, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and estrogen-like functions.
Conclusion
It seems that plant-derived medicines have beneficial effects on bone and may manage osteoporosis by affecting different targets and pathways involved in osteoporosis; However, Future studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of these preparations.}

Reducing the lens dose limit from 150 mSv/year to 20 mSv (averaged over defined periods of 5 yrs, or 50 mSv in 1 yr) makes other risk factors less obvious. The presented work is a review of the literature not only in the scope of the most obvious risk factor in this occupational group - ionizing radiation, with special attention given to issues specific to nuclear medicine (e.g. the variety of radionuclides or manual performing of procedures), as well as the difficulties related to the routine monitoring of eye lens exposure. Moreover, the paper presents several other risk factors that may play a key role in modulating damage to the eye lens. These include age, exposure to UV radiation, oxidative stress, genetic factors and dietary nutrient intake. An overview of all known molecular and biophysical mechanisms that imply the modulation of the cataract-related mechanism most often focus on radiation protection, has been given. The prepared review is the basis for the possibility of developing new studies aimed to introduce new protocols based on the intake of specific nutrients that could reduce the effects of the dose absorbed by the lens and, consequently, reduce the onset of cataracts in an employee involved in nuclear medicine practices.}

abstract = {Background
Although postinterview communication (PIC) guidelines exist, adherence is voluntary. There are no studies of PIC practices in critical care medicine (CCM) and pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowship recruitment.
Research Question
What is the frequency, format, goals, and content of PIC between CCM/PCCM applicants and program directors? What is the impact of PIC on applicant and program rank order lists (ROLs)?
Study Design and Methods
CCM/PCCM applicants and program directors were separately surveyed after the 2022-2023 National Resident Matching Program Specialty Match. Surveys included multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and two free text questions. Thematic content analysis of free text responses was performed.
Results
One-third of eligible participants responded (applicants: n = 373 [34%]; program directors: n = 86 [32%]). Applicant respondents applied to CCM (19%), PCCM (69%), or both (12%). Program directors represented CCM (17%), PCCM (57%), or both (26%) programs. Applicant (66%) and program director (49%) respondents reported initiating PIC. PIC did not impact ROL decision for most applicants (73%) or program directors (83%), though 21% of applicants and 17% of program directors moved programs or applicants up on their ROL in response to PIC. One-quarter (23%) of applicants strongly agreed or agreed that PIC was helpful in creating their ROL, 27% strongly disagreed or disagreed, and 29% were neutral. PIC challenges identified by both groups included time; lack of uniformity; peer pressure; misleading language; and uncertainty about motives, rules, and response protocols.
Interpretation
PIC is common among CCM/PCCM applicants and program directors. About 50% of applicants and 20% of program directors share ranking intentions via PIC. Although PIC did not impact ROL for most applicants and program directors, a minority of applicants and program directors moved programs up on their ROL after receiving PIC from the other party. Applicants have mixed perspectives on PIC value. Applicants and program directors alike desire clear guidance on PIC to minimize ambiguous and misleading communication.}

To address this low-value care, a taskforce of pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians was formed to create the first PEM Choosing Wisely recommendations. Using a systematic, iterative process, the taskforce collected suggested items from an interprofessional group of 33 ED clinicians from 6 academic pediatric EDs. An initial review of 219 suggested items yielded 72 unique items. Taskforce members independently scored each item for its extent of overuse, strength of evidence, and potential for harm. The 25 highest-rated items were sent in an electronic survey to all 89 members of the American Academy of Pediatrics PEM Committee on Quality Transformation (AAP COQT) to select their top ten recommendations. The AAP COQT survey had a 63% response rate. The five most selected items were circulated to over 100 stakeholder and specialty groups (within the AAP, CW Canada, and CW USA organizations) for review, iterative feedback, and approval. The final 5 items were simultaneously published by Choosing Wisely United States and Choosing Wisely Canada on December 1, 2022. All recommendations focused on decreasing diagnostic testing related to respiratory conditions, medical clearance for psychiatric conditions, seizures, constipation, and viral respiratory tract infections. A multinational PEM taskforce developed the first Choosing Wisely recommendation list for pediatric patients in the ED setting. Future activities will include dissemination efforts and interventions to improve the quality and value of care specific to recommendations.}

They contain various combinations of “anti-tussive” drugs including opioids, antihistamines, herbal preparations, mucolytics, decongestants and expectorants. Whilst theoretically attractive for symptom relief when children are suffering, as time has passed these popular over the counter medicines have been shown to lack efficacy, delay more serious underlying diagnoses, and can cause complications and sometimes death. This has resulted in clinician concerns, a citizen petition to the American Food and Drug Association in 2007, some self-regulation from manufacturers and escalating restrictions on their use from regulatory agencies across the world over the last twenty years. This article will review the protective role of cough, juxtapose the conflicting treatment goals of suppressing a dry cough and promoting expectoration for a wet cough, consider the evidence basis for prescribing cough medicines in comparison to other more specific treatments such as for asthma [beta agonists] or infection [antibiotics], regulatory interventions, and conclude with the view that over counter cough medicines should not be used in children, especially young children.}

This suggests that protein–protein interactions of TDP-43 with other proteins may in part be responsible for the pathology. To gain better insights, we investigated TDP-43-binding proteins in each domain and correlated these interactions with canonical pathways. These investigations revealed key cellular events that are involved and are important at each domain and suggested previously identified compounds to modulate key aspects of these canonical pathways. Our approach proposes that personalized medicine approaches, which focus on perturbed cellular mechanisms would be feasible in the near future.}

In particular, we explore the stigmatization of abortion as both a word and a process, the role of caregivers as gatekeepers, the implications of viability as a limit for access, and the hierarchy of deservedness and value. Recognizing the role of language in these discussions is critical to building systems that honor the complexities of patient-centered reproductive decision-making, ensure access to comprehensive reproductive health care including abortion, and center patient autonomy. Healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to facilitate institutional, state, and national landscapes in which pregnant patients are supported in their autonomy and provided with just and equitable reproductive health care.}

The Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine enforced in Japan in 2014, regulates the manufacture of cellular processed products. However, with regards to the manufacturing facilities at medical institutions, only the submission of necessary documents is required for a license, and the need for third-party inspection has been highlighted. Remote activities are becoming more prominent with the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 infection; therefore, the current assessment of compliance with structural facility standards was conducted remotely.
Methods
The entire process, including start-up meetings, preparation of the survey schedule, submission and review of preliminary materials, audits, and reporting of results, was conducted via e-mail and web conferencing systems. The survey was conducted remotely, to minimize the risk of contamination of the cell processing facility (CPF) and reduce the burden on surveyors, while contributing to the establishment of suitable structural facilities by identifying and highlighting the areas or items that were considered to be non-compliant with the regulations. The series of audits were completed in ten weeks, with a period of six weeks between the start-up meeting and the audit implementation. The audit was completed in approximately 3 h on the day of the inspection.
Results
The audit results were delivered in the report, with four items requiring improvement and several other recommended items listed as non-conformities.
Conclusions
We believe that this remote method allows the effective inspection of regenerative medicine manufacturing facilities and assessment of more cell culture processing facilities than the current in-person audit method, with limited human resources.}

abstract = {Current classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) into stages using indirect systemic measures (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria) is agnostic to the heterogeneity of underlying molecular processes in the kidney thereby limiting precision medicine approaches. To generate a novel CKD categorization that directly reflects within kidney disease drivers we analyzed publicly available transcriptomic data from kidney biopsy tissue. A Self-Organizing Maps unsupervised artificial neural network machine-learning algorithm was used to stratify a total of 369 patients with CKD and 46 living kidney donors as healthy controls. Unbiased stratification of the discovery cohort resulted in identification of four novel molecular categories of disease termed CKD-Blue, CKD-Gold, CKD-Olive, CKD-Plum that were replicated in independent CKD and diabetic kidney disease datasets and can be further tested on any external data at kidneyclass.org. Each molecular category spanned across CKD stages and histopathological diagnoses and represented transcriptional activation of distinct biological pathways. Disease progression rates were highly significantly different between the molecular categories. CKD-Gold displayed rapid progression, with significant eGFR-adjusted Cox regression hazard ratio of 5.6 [1.01-31.3] for kidney failure and hazard ratio of 4.7 [1.3-16.5] for composite of kidney failure or a 40% or more eGFR decline. Urine proteomics revealed distinct patterns between the molecular categories, and a 25-protein signature was identified to distinguish CKD-Gold from other molecular categories. Thus, patient stratification based on kidney tissue omics offers a gateway to non-invasive biomarker-driven categorization and the potential for future clinical implementation, as a key step towards precision medicine in CKD.}

abstract = {Introduction
During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, health care workers (HCWs) faced a heightened risk of infection. Preventative measures are critical to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and protect HCWs. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended to prevent and treat COVID-19 in China. We conducted this survey to investigate the use of infection control behaviors, preventative and therapeutic interventions, and outcomes among HCWs during the surge of Omicron variant COVID-19 infections to explore the association of preventative measures with outcomes and to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of TCM as a preventative measure.
Methods
The questionnaire consisted of 23 sections with 154 questions for HCWs. The targeted respondents comprised all HCWs from Xiamen Hospital Affiliated of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. The recruitment process was open between March 17 and June 1, 2022. Chi-square test was used to estimate the relationship between prevention and outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors influencing the use of TCM as a preventative measure.
Results
Among the 1122 participants who completed the questionnaire, 79.71% took preventative measures, including TCM (56.21%), physical activities (52.37%) and food supplements (26.99%). Xiamen preventative formula (a government-approved fixed prescription) (45.22%) and Lianhua Qingwen preparations (18.95%) were the most commonly used Chinese medicines. Thirty-six participants reported flu-like symptoms and three were diagnosed with COVID-19. Flu-like symptoms were not associated with prevention, vaccination, or TCM. Frontline working experience (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.46–0.80), good knowledge of post-COVID-19 syndrome (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39–0.84), Western medicine qualifications (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.51–3.86), being a nurse (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.21–2.40), or medical technician (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.25–4.10) were associated with the willingness to use TCM as a preventative measure.
Conclusion
Complementary medicine, especially TCM, could be used for COVID-19 prevention. Knowledge of COVID-19 may prompt people to use TCM to prevent COVID-19. Multicenter studies and prospective cohort follow-up studies are needed to provide further insights into the use of TCM for COVID-19 management.}

The effective treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an unmet medical need. Qushi Huayu (QSHY) is an empirical herbal formula with promising effects in NAFLD rodent models and a connection to gut microbiota regulation.
Hypothesis/Purpose
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of QSHY in patients with NAFLD through a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial.
Study design
A total of 246 eligible patients with NAFLD and liver dysfunction were evenly divided to receive either QSHY and Dangfei Liganning capsule (DFLG) simulant or QSHY simulant and DFLG (an approved proprietary Chinese medicine for NAFLD in China) for 24 weeks. The primary outcomes were changes in liver fat content, assessed using vibration-controlled transient elastography, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels from baseline to Week 24.
Results
Both QSHY and DFLG led to reductions in liver fat content and liver enzyme levels post-intervention (p < 0.05). Compared to DFLG, QSHY treatment improved ALT (β, −0.128 [95 % CI, −0.25, −0.005], p = 0.041), aspartate transaminase (β, −0.134 [95 % CI, −0.256 to −0.012], p = 0.032), and fibrosis-4 score (β, −0.129 [95 % CI, −0.254 to −0.003], p = 0.044) levels. QSHY markedly improved gut dysbiosis compared to DFLG, with changes in Escherichia-Shigella and Bacteroides abundance linked to its therapeutic effect on reducing ALT. Patients with a high ALT response after QSHY treatment showed superior reductions in peripheral levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine, along with an elevation in the related microbial metabolite p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate favorable clinical potential for QSHY in the treatment of NAFLD.}

abstract = {Objective
Psychotropic medicines use alters according to socio-economic factors and perceived stress. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of use of psychotropic medicines and supplements (PMS) without medical advice, including storage at home, and its relationship with socio-demographic characteristics and perceived stress in primary care patients.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional sample of adult attendees in an urban primary care unit in Crete, Greece, were surveyed during regularly scheduled appointments during a three-week period in October 2020. A questionnaire was distributed to investigate PMS use during the last 12 months. The validated Greek version of Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) was adopted to measure perceived stress.
Results
Of 263 respondents (mean age 46.3±14.5 years; 66.5% females), 101 (38.4%; 95%CI 33.1–43.7%) recalled having psychotropic medicines stored at home cabinets and 72 (27.4%; 95%CI 22.4–32.3%) reported using PMS without medical advice in the last 12 months.
Conclusions
This study revealed a high prevalence of PMS use without medical advice, including storage at home. People>59 years of age, experiencing irregular sleep and scoring high in PSS, displayed increased prevalence of storing PMS at home or using them without medical advice. The findings could potentially inform primary care providers to focus on patients most likely to be users of PMS without medical advice.
Resumen
Objetivo
El uso de medicamentos psicotrópicos cambia según los factores socioeconómicos y el estrés percibido. El estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la prevalencia de uso de medicamentos y suplementos psicotrópicos (MSP) sin consejo médico, incluido el almacenamiento en el hogar y su relación con las características sociodemográficas y el estrés inferido en pacientes de atención primaria.
Materiales y métodos
Se encuestó a una muestra transversal de asistentes adultos en una Unidad de Atención Primaria Urbana en Crete, Grecia, durante citas programadas regularmente durante un periodo de tres semanas en Octubre de 2020. Se distribuyó un cuestionario para investigar el uso de MSP durante los últimos 12 meses. Se adoptó la versión griega validada de la Escala de Estrés Percibido (Perceived Stress Scale 14, PSS-14) para medir el estrés percibido.
Resultado
De 263 encuestados (edad media 46,3 ± 14,5 años; 66,5% mujeres), 101 (38,4%; IC 95%; 33,1-43,7%) recordaban tener medicamentos psicotrópicos almacenados en los armarios de sus casas y 72 (27,4%; IC 95%; 22,4-32,3%) informó haber usado MSP sin consejo médico en los últimos 12 meses.
Conclusiones
Este estudio reveló una alta prevalencia de uso de MSP sin consejo médico, incluido el almacenamiento en el hogar. Las personas mayores de 59 años, que experimentaron sueño irregular y puntuaron alto en PSS, mostraron una mayor prevalencia de almacenar MSP en casa o usarlos sin consejo médico. Los hallazgos podrían informar potencialmente a los proveedores de atención primaria para que se centren en los pacientes con mayor probabilidad de usar MSP sin consejo médico.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of a new model, Case Analysis and Translation to Care in Hospital (CATCH), for the review of pediatric inpatient cases when an adverse event or “close call” had occurred.
Study design
The curricular intervention consisted of an introductory podcast/workshop, mentorship of presenters, and monthly CATCH rounds over 16 months. The study was conducted with 22 pediatricians at a single tertiary care center. Intervention assessment occurred using participant surveys at multiple intervals: pre/post the intervention, presenter experience (post), physicians involved and mentors experience (post), and after each CATCH session. Paired t-tests and thematic analysis were used to analyze data. Time required to support the CATCH process was used to assess feasibility.
Results
Our overall experience and data revealed a strong preference for the CATCH model, high levels of engagement and satisfaction with CATCH sessions, and positive presenter as well as physicians-involved and mentor experiences. Participants reported that the CATCH model is feasible, engages physicians, promotes a safe learning environment, facilitates awareness of tools for case analysis, and provides opportunities to create “CATCH of the Day” recommendations to support translation of learning to clinical practice.
Conclusions
The CATCH model has significant potential to strengthen clinical case rounds in pediatric hospital medicine. Future research is needed to assess the effectiveness of the model at additional sites and across medical specialities.}

Key regulatory entities can serve as building blocks for the African Medicines Agency (AMA). The aim of this study is to demonstrate how the regional medicines regulatory harmonisation programmes could contribute to AMA's effectiveness and efficiency.
Methods
A literature search was conducted using key words to identify publications about the AMA, African Medicines Regulatory Harmonisation (AMRH) and East African Community Medicines Regulatory Harmonisation programmes (EAC-MRH) from 2009 to 2023. The EAC-MRH programme experience was used to highlight the benefits and challenges of African regulatory harmonisation.
Results
As the foundation for the AMA, the AMRH has established structures and workstreams to support its operationalisation, including 10 Technical Committees (TCs) and 5 Regional Economic Committees (RECs). Lessons learned from the EAC-MRH 10-year experience are being used to scale up regulatory harmonisation and could be of value to AMA harmonisation experience.
Conclusions
As of June 2023, 35 of 55 countries have either signed and/or ratified the AMA Treaty, whilst 20 have neither signed nor ratified it. An effective AMA will need strong National Medicines Regulatory Authorities as well as Regional programmes and it is imperative for more well-resourced countries to ratify the treaty to ensure access to essential medical products and technologies for the African people.}

abstract = {Objective
This network meta-analysis aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of various external therapies from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in enhancing sleep quality among patients with cancer.
Methods
We systematically searched nine electronic databases, encompassing five English and four Chinese databases, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from their inception up to August 10, 2023. The random effects model was utilized for effect size analysis, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. Network meta-analysis and comparative effects ranking were executed utilizing STATA 14.0.
Results
We included thirty-four RCTs involving seven distinct external TCM therapies. Among these, Chinese medicine pillow (SMD = −3.27; 95% CI: −6.03 to −0.51), auricular acupressure (SMD = −2.33; 95% CI: −3.36 to −1.29), moxibustion (SMD = −2.28; 95% CI: −3.63 to −0.94), acupressure (SMD = −1.67; 95% CI: −2.64 to −0.70), and acupuncture (SMD = −1.43; 95% CI: −2.65 to −0.21) demonstrated significant effects in improving sleep quality when compared to usual care or waitlist. The cumulative ranking curve values revealed that the Chinese medicine pillow exhibited the highest potential for effectively enhancing sleep quality in patients with cancer, followed by auricular acupressure, moxibustion, acupressure, acupuncture, Tuina, and electroacupuncture.
Conclusions
Our study highlights the Chinese medicine pillow as an optimal external TCM therapy for ameliorating sleep quality in cancer patients, but more RCTs are needed to validate this conclusion. These findings serve as valuable support for future clinical trials and research endeavors.

The cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) is identified as the signaling protein relevant importantly in various cancers, inflammations, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via interacting with extracellular cyclophilin A (CypA). The reduction of CD147 levels inhibits the progression of CD147-associated diseases. Thai traditional medicines (TTMs): Keaw-hom (KH), Um-ma-ruek-ka-wa-tee (UM), Chan-ta-lee-la (CT), and Ha-rak (HR) have been used as anti-pyretic and anti-respiratory syndromes caused from various conditions including cancers, inflammations, and infections. Thus, these medicines would play a crucial role in the reduction of CD147 levels.
Aim of the study
This article aimed to investigate the effects of KH, UM, CT, and HR for reducing the CD147 levels through in vitro study. Additionally, in silico study was employed to screen the active compounds reflexing the reduction of CD147 levels.
Materials and methods
The immunofluorescent technique was used to evaluate the reduction of CD147 levels in human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) stimulated with CypA for eight extracts of KH, UM, CT, and HR obtained from water decoction (D) and 70% ethanol maceration (M) including, KHD, UMD, CTD, HRD, KHM, UMM, CTM, and HRM.
Results
UM extracts showed the most efficiency for reduction of CD147 levels in the cytoplasm and perinuclear of BEAS-2B cells stimulated with CypA. Phenolic compounds composing polyphenols, polyphenol sugars, and flavonoids were identified as the major chemical components of UMD and UMM. Further, molecular docking calculations identified polyphenol sugars as CypA inhibitors.
Conclusions
UMD and UMM are potential for reduction of CD147 levels which provide a useful information for further development of UM as potential therapeutic candidates for CD147-associated diseases such as cancers, inflammations, and COVID-19.}

However, with a return to prepandemic elective procedure volumes and sideline sports coverage responsibilities, sports medicine fellowships have regained some of their traditional education opportunities. Moreover, the implementation of novel training resources, including virtual didactics, augmented reality surgical skills labs, and telehealth medicine training are poised to outlast the current public health crisis and further supplement fellowship education.

The use of personal continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) in patients with diabetes has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase as CGMs become more affordable and insurance plans improve coverage. The utilization of CGMs has improved diabetes management and reduced hypoglycemic events. A pharmacist-led personal CGM workflow was created to evaluate the impact on glycemic management in patients with diabetes. This was a prospective, investigator-initiated pilot study conducted at an Atrium Health Internal Medicine clinic over 28 weeks. In this pilot, 42 patients were qualifying candidates with diabetes and personal CGM use. Additionally, 30 patients were followed until study completion and included into final analysis. The average baseline A1c was reduced from 8.3% to 7.1% over a 3 – 6 month period. The pharmacist-led CGM workflow revealed a statistically significant reduction in A1c from baseline by an average of 1.2% (95% CI, -0.6 – -1.8; P = 0.0006). On average, patients were enrolled for 19.9 weeks and had an average of 5 visits during this time. During the study duration, 100 medications changes were implemented under the existing Clinical Pharmacist Practitioner (CPP) agreement between the pharmacists and the provider. The implementation of the CGM workflow led to one less diabetes related hospitalization. Overall, 58 CPT 95251 codes were billed yielding $7,052.00 in billed CGM services for the clinic. This project generated 40.6 provider relative value units (RVUs). The utilization of a pharmacist-led personal CGM workflow can improve diabetes outcomes.}

Chinese herbal medicine is widely used for treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The present study aimed to explore the effects of Bu-Shen-Jian-Pi Formula, a Chinese herbal medicine formula, on the pregnancy outcomes of women with PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) based on a retrospective cohort study.
Methods
One hundred and forty-six females with PCOS undergoing IVF-ET were included in the study from Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University between July 2016 and June 2021, of whom 73 patients received Bu-Shen-Jian-Pi Formula treatment for 12 weeks before IVF-ET, while the other 73 did not. The clinical data were collected from the medical records of the included patients. Bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) and leukemia inhibitory factor levels in the follicular fluids were detected.
Results
After the treatment of Bu-Shen-Jian-Pi Formula, women with PCOS undergoing IVF-ET exhibited significant improvement in the fertilization (P<0.05), good-quality embryo (P<0.01), clinical pregnancy (P<0.01), and live birth (P<0.01) rates, and single birthweight in newborns (P<0.05). The expression levels of BMP15 in the follicular fluids of the women with PCOS were significantly increased after Bu-Shen-Jian-Pi Formula treatment (P<0.05).
Conclusion
This study provided preliminary evidence of a significant association of Bu-Shen-Jian-Pi Formula treatment with improved pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing IVF-ET, partly through increasing BMP15 levels in the follicular fluids.}

Emergency medicine residents are often involved in the management of trauma airways. There are few data on the correlation between prior intubation experience and first-pass trauma intubation success for emergency medicine residents.
Objectives
We attempted to elucidate a relationship between prior resident intubation experience and first-pass success for trauma patient intubation.
Methods
We combined two data sets to assess for correlation between prior intubation experience for postgraduate year 2 and 3 residents and first-pass success for trauma patient intubation. Prior intubation experience was gathered from resident procedure logs and trauma intubation data were collected as part of a quality-monitoring program. A univariable logistic regression analysis for all available variables was performed, with first-pass intubation success as the outcome of interest.
Results
We included 295 consecutive trauma patients intubated at a Level I trauma center where we could link the resident prior intubation experience (total intubations) with intubation attempt quality data. First-pass success for all emergency medicine residents was 82.3% (233/283). Overall successful intubation rate for emergency medicine residents was 90.4% (256/283). The combination of airway management by both the resident and emergency medicine attending provided an overall success rate of 97.3% (287/295). There was no statistically significant association between first-pass success and prior resident intubation experience or any of the other measured variables.
Conclusion
We did not demonstrate any significant correlation between first-pass intubation success and number of prior intubations performed by the emergency medicine resident.}

abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study is to identify available reporting guidelines for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), delineate their fundamental characteristics, assess the scientific rigor of their development process, and evaluate their dissemination.
Study Design and Setting
A search was conducted in Medline (via PubMed), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), SinoMed, WANFANG DATA, and the EQUATOR Network to identify TCM reporting guidelines. A preprepared Excel database was used to extract information on the basic characteristics, development process, and dissemination information. The development process quality of TCM reporting guidelines was assessed by evaluating their compliance with the Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines (GDHRRG). The extent of dissemination of these guidelines was analyzed by examining the number of citations received.
Results
A total of 26 reporting guidelines for TCM were obtained from 20 academic journals, with 61.5% of them published in English journals. Among the guidelines, 14 (53.8%) were registered in the EQUATOR Network. On average, the compliance rate of GDHRRG guidelines was reported to be 63.3% ranging from 22.2% to 94.4%. Three steps showed poor compliance, namely guideline endorsement (23.1%), translated guidelines (19.2%), and developing a publication strategy (19.2%). Furthermore, the compliance rate of GDHRRG guidelines published in English journals was higher than that in Chinese journals. In terms of the dissemination, 15.4% of the guidelines had been cited over 100 times, while 73.1% had been cited less than 50 times.
Conclusion
The development of TCM reporting guidelines still has limitations in terms of regarding scientific rigor and follow-up dissemination. Therefore, it is important to ensure adherence to the scientific process in the development of TCM reporting guidelines and to strengthen their promotion, dissemination, and implementation.}

abstract = {Background
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are known to cause hospitalisation, longer hospital stays, as well as higher healthcare costs and mortality. Unrecognised ADRs are anticipated throughout the medicine lifecycle as, before the medicine reaches the market, clinical trials are conducted for a short period on a limited number of people, who might underrepresent the actual population. After the medicine reaches the market, emergent information that could affect its benefit-to-risk balance is usually shared by regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies through medicine risk communications. Medicines risk communications aim to prevent harm to patients by targeting their behaviour, knowledge, and attitudes, as well as those of health care professionals (HCPs). Despite their important role in translating these communications into their clinical practice, HCPs do not always adhere to the recommendations provided in risk communications. Measurement of medicine risk communications' effectiveness does not necessarily guarantee their implementation, cost-effectiveness, or transferability in real-world situations. To enhance the impact of drug regulatory interventions, implementation science has been encouraged. However, implementation science was not previously used to identify factors affecting HCPs' implementation of medicines risk communications. A recently widely used framework is the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). In this systematic review, the TDF was employed to categorise a range of different factors that could affect HCPs’ implementation of medicine risk communications within their clinical contexts.
Methods
The search strategy involved a set of predefined search terms and fifteen databases, such as EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL PLUS. Searches were conducted from April to May 2018 and updated in June 2021 using PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL PLUS. A second reviewer independently conducted the screening process of the initial search. The total number of records screened was 10,475. A study was included if it reported any factors influencing HCPs' uptake of medicine risk communications. Only studies with English or Arabic abstracts were included. Those studies that did not include pharmacovigilance-related medicine risk communications were excluded. Additionally, studies only assessing HCPs' practice or evaluating the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures were excluded. Likewise, studies related to occupational hazards, case reports, interventional studies, and studies not involving HCPs were excluded. In case the published information was insufficient to decide whether to include or exclude a study, the authors were contacted. Furthermore, the authors of seven eligible abstracts were contacted for full-text articles. The mixed method appraisal tool (MMAT) was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. All included studies were assessed by one reviewer, and a total of 16 studies were assessed by two reviewers independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Using thematic analysis and concept mapping, a narrative synthesis was performed, followed by a critical reflection on the synthesis process. This review presents the results of the concept mapping, which involved matching the identified factors to the TDF.
Results
A total of 28 studies were included. Eleven domains influenced HCPs' implementation of medicine risk communications. A large number of studies included factors related to the “Knowledge” domain (n = 23), followed by “Beliefs about Consequences” (n = 13), “Memory, Attention and Decision Processes” (n = 12) and “Environmental Context and Resources” domains (n = 12). Seven studies reported “social influences” and six studies included factors relating to “Goals”, followed by four studies involving factors related to “Social/Professional Role and Identity”. Underrepresented domains included “Emotion” (n = 2), “Beliefs about Capabilities” (n = 2), “Behavioural Regulation” (n = 1), and “Reinforcement” (n = 1). On the other hand, none of the identified factors were related to the “Skills”, “Optimism”, or “Intentions” domains. Except for “Beliefs about Consequences”, most studies contributing to the other three most commonly reported domains (“Knowledge”; “Environmental Context and Resources”; and “Memory, Attention and Decision Processes”) scored low (1 or 2 out of 5) on the MMAT quality assessment. Moreover, the same number of studies (n = 5) contributing to the “Beliefs about Consequences” domain had low (1 or 2 out of 5), and intermediate (3 out of 5) scores on the MMAT.
Conclusion
Medicines risk communications are important tools for disseminating information that may influence the benefit-to-risk balance of medicines. Even though HCPs are required to implement the recommendations of these communications, they do not always adhere to them. Using the TDF enabled the categorization of the range of factors that affect whether or not HCPs implement the recommendations provided in a medicine risk communication. However, most of these factors relate to four domains only (“Knowledge”; “Beliefs about Consequences”; “Memory, Attention and Decision Processes”; and “Environmental Context and Resources”). Additionally, most of the studies contributing to three of these four domains were of low quality. Future research should focus on using implementation science to identify target behaviours for actionable medicine risk communications. Regulators should use such science to develop cost-effective strategies for improving the implementation of medicines risk communication by HCPs.}

In addition, the research on the isolation methods and mechanisms of EVs has also made significant progress. In this paper, we review the biogenesis, composition, and isolation techniques of EVs, summarize the potential therapeutic mechanisms of natural EVs as well as the engineering strategies for EV modification, and highlight the recent advances in the application of EVs in tissue regeneration. Finally, we discuss EVs' current problems and future perspectives in regenerative medicine.}
