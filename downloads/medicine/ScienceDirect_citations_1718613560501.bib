Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has become popular interventional treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, lack of knowledge about the general characteristics and long-term clinical outcomes hampers the development of herbal drugs for ALS.
Aim of the study
The China Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Registry of Patients with Traditional Chinese Medicine (CARE-TCM) provides an opportunity to better understand which TCM interventions patients with ALS are receiving, what the characteristics of patients with ALS are, and how these interventions impact clinical measures.
Materials and methods
This study includes a voluntary nationwide registry, and data will be collected prospectively using an electronic data system. Detailed data collection will be performed every 3 months for 5 years. Baseline characteristics and 5-year survival will be collected. This registry was initiated in March 2021. The number of participating medical centers will be about 30 hospitals, and the target procedure number will be 2000. We will also compare the results with those of other registries in China and other countries.
Discussion
The CARE-TCM registry will first provide real-world data regarding TCM and ALS in China, focusing on the clinical characteristics of ALS patients with TCM, disease phenotypes that respond best to TCM, and correlating clinical response with other parameters. The CARE-TCM can be very helpful to improve the efficiency and quality of TCM clinical trial design.

Moreover, a cutoff point is a crucial step in ensuring a minimal risk of clinical misclassification. Therefore complying with such statutory requirements is an essential part of obligatory good laboratory and clinical practices. In this concise report, we propose a novel methodology for establishing cutoff points for all samples exhibiting detectable levels of the measured parameter, even those from the disease-free group. Based on target specificity and sensitivity levels of 100 % and 95 %, a value of 1209 A is identified as the "best cutoff". In fact, the ROC decision matrixes play a crucial role in determining optimal cutoff points. The most effective discriminators are those that meet specified accuracy criteria. The selection process is influenced by finding the right clinical sensitivity/specificity trade-off.}

The origin of TCM material impacts the quality of the same TCM materials. However, the existing origin classification methods of the same TCM materials from different places mainly have two disadvantages: slow processing speed and extensive experience. To address these issues, a fast and real-time technology, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), is introduced into our solution. We propose a TCM classification system that combines one-dimensional LIBS spectra with two-dimensional images. This dual-modality fusion approach represents a significant advancement in multi-view data analysis for TCM classification. As a case study, we focus on wolfberry and construct a new dataset comprising 10,800 pairs of LIBS spectrum and image data to fill the gap. To achieve superior multiple feature fusion, a two-stage fusion network (TFNet) in a coarse-to-fine way is proposed. In the first coarse fusion, the Depth Attention Fusion (DAF) module is applied to extract the key features of stacked spectrum and image. In the second fine fusion, the Line to Area (LTA) module entirely focuses on and highlights the critical spectral line features. Experimental accuracy is over 0.99 with less computation and parameters, indicating the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed TFNet. Therefore, the classification system achieves exceptional accuracy and efficiency due to its simple sample preparation, real-time data collection and the high-accuracy lightweight network.}

abstract = {Introduction
Most current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infected cases are now diagnosed as mild to moderate. Symptoms such as sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, cough, etc. lack effective treatment for their relief. The registered Chinese herbal medicine Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJD) has been used to treat different epidemics like influenza A virus subtype H1N, and has been shown to improve symptoms such as fever, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion and cough. It has also been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China. This study aims to verify the efficacy and safety of SFJD in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 infection.
Methods
This study is designed as a randomized, blind, placebo control trial. A total of 220 patients in each group will receive either SFJD or placebo three times a day for five days, in addition to standard medical care. Participants will be assessed at baseline, during the treatment period, during the period of isolation in hospital and after hospital discharge on day 7 and 14. The primary outcome is time to alleviation of all COVID-19 related symptoms, including cough, stuffy nose, sore throat, fever or chills, muscle/joint pain, headache, fatigue, etc. Secondary outcomes are time to alleviation of individual COVID-19 related symptoms, time to SARS-CoV-2 virus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) turning to negativity, changes in inflammatory parameters (leukocyte, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum procalcitonin (PCT), inflammatory factor (Interleukin-6), CD4/CD8 cells), the amount of lung inflammation as ascertained by chest CT and adverse events.
Discussion
The study is expected to provide evidence to explore indications and usage of SFJD for COVID-19. The design and methodology could be relevant to research on Chinese herbal medicine for other infectious diseases. Additionally, the results from the follow-up period will provide information on potential longer term symptom alleviation (14 days post COVID-19).

abstract = {Background
Completing an emergency medicine (EM) away rotation is integral to matching successfully into an EM residency program. The demand for EM away rotations (ARs) drives students to submit numerous applications without evidence-based recommendations to guide stakeholders on the approach or number to submit.
Objectives
We conducted a survey study of EM-bound fourth-year medical students to gain insight into their AR application experiences, outcomes, and perceptions.
Methods
We distributed a 40-item questionnaire to EM applicants in Fall 2018 via e-mail through the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine, Council of Residency Directors in EM, and Emergency Medicine Residents’ Association listservs. Responses were evaluated using quantitative and qualitative analysis. Primary outcomes were the number of AR applications submitted and AR offers received by students. Secondary outcomes were students’ self-assessment of their competitiveness, differences in AR application numbers by degree type, sources of student advising, and student perceptions of the AR application process.
Results
There were 253 respondents, consisting of 192 allopathic (MD) and 61 osteopathic (DO) medical students, who met the inclusion criteria, representing about 10% of the applicant pool. On average, students submitted 13.97 applications (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.59–16.35), received 3.25 offers (95% CI 3.01–3.49), and accepted 2.22 offers (95% CI 2.08–2.36). DO candidates submitted twice as many applications as MD candidates while experiencing a similar rate of offers received. Peer influence (n = 154, 61%), peer online advising networks (n = 83, 33%), and self-assessment (n = 114, 45%) were the most often reported causes of increased applications; cost (n = 104, 41%) and geographic limitations (n = 114, 45%) were the most often reported causes of decreased applications. Open-response analysis revealed frustration with lack of standardization (n = 44, 29.5%), insufficient transparency on available positions (n = 37, 24.8%), limited communication (n = 30, 20.1%), and cost (n = 12, 8.1%).
Conclusions
This study showed that, as a whole, students received one away rotation offer for every four to five applications submitted. It clarified factors contributing to increased EM away rotation application submissions and associated stressors inherent in the application experience. Our findings offer insights to inform advising recommendations. They also suggest that stakeholders consider standardizing the process and improve communication over spot availability and application status.}

abstract = {Objective
To identify the key attitudes and opinions of Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialists (MFMs) who counsel expectant mothers with a prenatal diagnosis of fetal anomaly surrounding prenatal genetic testing, disability and termination.
Methods
We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with MFMs across the United States. Participants were recruited through the snowball method beginning with referrals from the MFM on our study team, AM. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively analyzed for themes using modified grounded theory by three reviewers.
Results
2227 codes from 17 interviews were grouped into 18 themes, which were then characterized into six over-arching, topic-oriented clusters: 1) Physician Methodology; 2) Physician Perception of Disability; 3) Physician Experience; 4) Physician-Patient Relationship; 5) Patient Experience; and 6) Termination. Patients’ misunderstanding of prenatal genetic screening, diagnostic technology, the implications of certain genetic anomalies, and limited time to explain these factors were identified as major barriers to effective counseling. All MFMs described themselves as informants in the prenatal diagnostic process, and all offered their patients termination following a diagnosis of a severe or lethal congenital anomaly; however, MFMs did not identify a consistent definition of severe or lethal congenital anomaly. MFMs reported fears of being perceived as coercive by patients and a high degree of moral and emotional distress during consultations. Finally, MFMs identified legal, financial and structural barriers that prevented patients from accessing prenatal genetic diagnostic services and termination services. It was felt that these limitations ultimately inhibited autonomous decision making by patients.
Conclusions
These findings highlight important barriers faced by MFM providers when trying to provide effective counseling to expectant mothers carrying a prenatal diagnosis of fetal anomaly. Further exploration of these identified barriers may lead to the development of strategies to improve prenatal counseling.}

This article presents an ethnographic study in the Northeastern region of the United States with 20 families with children diagnosed with Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS)/Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS). Two of the 20 families had moved to the U.S. seeking care. The for-profit structure of the U.S. health care system resulted in costly and lengthy therapeutic journeys to access a diagnosis and adequate treatments. In the U.S., PANS/PANDAS coverage depends on legislation, advocacy, clinical characteristics of each child, and how for-profit insurance companies react to an increased demand for a given service. Many medical professionals, both in the U.S. and in other countries, refuse to acknowledge the condition or offer effective treatments that lack “acceptable” evidence. We argue that the financial logic behind coverage exists across modern health care systems and imposes restrictions and exclusions that impede access to care. Thus, untimely care, the time gap from PANS/PANDAS symptoms to diagnosis and treatment is the result of the modern logics that structure medicine and coverage. The results of this study illustrate how modern medicine and coverage fail to protect families with children with PANS/PANDAS against catastrophic expenses and often block care that would prevent developmental disruptions and losses, avoid much suffering, and even save costs to health care systems. New and controversial conditions like PANS/PANDAS highlight the importance of separating the financial logics behind proposals such as “universal health coverage” from the provision of comprehensive forms of care that acknowledge uncertainty and prioritize action and flexibility.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Antibiotic stewardship (AS) is a cornerstone of the fight against antimicrobial resistance; however, evidence on the best practice to improve antibiotic prescription in various hospital settings is still scarce. This study aimed to measure the efficacy of a non-restrictive AS intervention in the internal medicine area of a tertiary-care hospital across a 3-year period.
Methods
The intervention comprised a 3-month ‘intensive phase’ based on education and guidelines provision, followed by 9 months of audits and feedback activities. The primary outcome was the overall antibiotic consumption measured as days of therapy (DOTs) and defined daily doses (DDDs). Secondary outcomes were carbapenem and fluoroquinolone consumption, all-cause in-hospital mortality, length of stay, incidence of Clostridioides difficile and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales bloodstream infections (CRE-BSIs). All outcomes were measured in the intervention wards comparing the pre-phase with the post-phase using an interrupted time-series model.
Results
A total of 145 337 patient days (PDs) and 14 159 admissions were included in the analysis. The intervention was associated with reduced DOTs*1000PDs (–162.2/P = 0.005) and DDDs*1000PDs (–183.6/P ≤ 0.001). A sustained decrease in ward-related antibiotic consumption was also detected during the post-intervention phase and in the carbapenem/fluoroquinolone classes. The intervention was associated with an immediate reduction in length of stay (–1.72 days/P < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (–3.71 deaths*100 admissions/P = 0.002), with a decreasing trend over time. Rates of Clostridioides difficile infections and CRE-BSIs were not significantly impacted by the intervention.
Conclusions
The AS intervention was effective and safe in decreasing antibiotic consumption and length of stay in the internal medicine area. Enabling prescribers to judicious use of antimicrobials through active participation in AS initiatives is key to reach sustained results over time.}

This work is motivated by a real application, where the company Connect Robotics, the first drone delivery provider in Portugal, made a partnership with a pharmacy located at a rural region to start implementing the delivery of medicines by drone. The pharmacy receives orders throughout the day and has to deliver in the same day with tight lead-times. The resulting problem is modelled as a Dynamic Parallel Drone Scheduling Vehicle Routing Problem with Lead-Time. A solution method is devised to solve it, thus helping the pharmacist to plan the car and drone delivery routes during the day. The results obtained on real instances revealed that the solution method is effective when compared to the optimal solutions of the static version of the problem, since the dynamic solution only differs, on average, about 7% from the static one. Moreover, some managerial insights about the impact of adding drones to the distribution operation are discussed, namely the economic and environmental impacts with cost savings up to 41% and reduction of monthly CO2 emissions of 310 kg, the use of spare batteries which increase the benefit from 16% to 41%, and same-day versus next-day delivery.}

PubMed search was filtered by the title including Coronary Artery Disease during 2020–2023. To find the genes with pharmacogenetic impact on the CAD, additional filtrations were considered according to the variant annotations. Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs), Gene-miRNA Interactions (GMIs), Protein-Drug Interactions (PDIs), and variant annotation assessments (VAAs) performed by STRING-MODEL (ver. 12), Cytoscape (ver. 3.10), miRTargetLink.2., NetworkAnalyst (ver 0.3.0), and PharmGKB.
Results
Results revealed 5618 publications, 1290 papers were qualified, and finally, 650 papers were included. 4608 protein-coding genes were extracted, among them, 1432 unique genes were distinguished and 530 evidence-based repeated genes remained. 71 genes showed a pharmacogenetics-related variant annotation in at least (entirely 6331 annotations). Variant annotation assessment (VAA) showed 532 potential variants for the final report, and finally, the concluding PGs list represented 175 variants. Based on the function and MAF, 57 nonsynonymous variants of 29 Pharmacogenomics-related genes were associated with CAD.
Conclusion
Conclusively, evaluating circulating miR33a in individuals’ plasma with CAD, and genotyping of rs2230806, rs2230808, rs2487032, rs12003906, rs2472507, rs2515629, and rs4149297 (ABCA1 variants) lead to precisely prescribing of well-known drugs. Also, the findings of this review can be used in both whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis in the prognosis and diagnosis of CAD.}

However, the pharmacological mechanisms underlying this success remain unclear. Hence, the aim of this review is to combine pharmacological assays based on the theory of TCM in order to elucidate the potential signaling pathways, targets, active compounds, and formulas of herbs that are involved in the TCM treatment of COVID-19, which exhibits combatting viral infections, immune regulation, and amelioration of lung injury and fibrosis. Extensive reports on target screening are elucidated using virtual prediction via docking analysis or network pharmacology based on existing data. The results of these reports indicate that an intricate regulatory mechanism is involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Therefore, more pharmacological research on the natural herbs used in TCM should be conducted in order to determine the association between TCM and COVID-19 and account for the observed therapeutic effects of TCM against COVID-19.}

abstract = {Background
Mortality, morbidity, and organ failure are important and common serious harms after surgery. However, there are many candidate measures to describe these outcome domains. Definitions of these measures are highly variable, and validity is often unclear. As part of the International Standardised Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine (StEP) initiative, this study aimed to derive a set of standardised and valid measures of mortality, morbidity, and organ failure for use in perioperative clinical trials.
Methods
Three domains of endpoints (mortality, morbidity, and organ failure) were explored through systematic literature review and a three-stage Delphi consensus process using methods consistently applied across the StEP initiative. Reliability, feasibility, and patient-centredness were assessed in round 3 of the consensus process.
Results
A high level of consensus was achieved for two mortality time points, 30-day and 1-yr mortality, and these two measures are recommended. No organ failure endpoints achieved threshold criteria for consensus recommendation. The Clavien–Dindo classification of complications achieved threshold criteria for consensus in round 2 of the Delphi process but did not achieve the threshold criteria in round 3 where it scored equivalently to the Post Operative Morbidity Survey. Clavien–Dindo therefore received conditional endorsement as the most widely used measure. No composite measures of organ failure achieved an acceptable level of consensus.
Conclusions
Both 30-day and 1-yr mortality measures are recommended. No measure is recommended for organ failure. One measure (Clavien–Dindo) is conditionally endorsed for postoperative morbidity, but our findings suggest that no single endpoint offers a reliable and valid measure to describe perioperative morbidity that is not dependent on the quality of deli-vered care. Further refinement of current measures, or development of novel measures, of postoperative morbidity might improve consensus in this area.}

abstract = {Background
Empirical evidence for physicians’ knowledge gaps in bleeding disorders is limited to self‐reported surveys, yet often cited as a leading cause of diagnostic and management delays.
Objectives
Our aim was to assess internal medicine (IM) residents’ competence, based on their training level, in evaluating a patient with a bleeding disorder, and knowledge gaps in their clinical approach.
Methods
Content experts developed patient case presenting with abnormal bleeding, bruising, and an isolated prolonged PTT. We administered the hemostasis case as part of an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). We performed a descriptive analysis. One‐way anova was conducted to compare the effect of training level on performance. Item difficulty level for the hemostasis case was also determined.
Results
Sixty‐seven IM residents participated in the OSCE. The hemostasis case had the highest failure rate at 41.8% with a mean score for the station of 57.96% (SD 13.04). Senior residents scored significantly higher than junior residents on this case (F(2,64) = 4.604, p = .014, ηp2 = 0.126). The item difficulty analysis demonstrated challenges in in eliciting a history of bleeding provoked by challenges, examining the bleeding site, interpreting the mixing study, requesting appropriate follow‐up tests, making the diagnosis and providing acute management for a bleeding patient. Only 49.3% of residents requested a hematology consultation.
Conclusions
We demonstrated important knowledge gaps in IM residents’ approach to the bleeding patient. Innovative strategies for hemostasis education should be a priority to address physician‐related factors in the diagnostic and management delays of patients with bleeding disorders.}

However, its mechanism, involving a variety of cardiac glycosides, remains largely unknown. The immune knockout strategy can highly selectively deplete target components by immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC). We aimed to identify the common structural features of cardiac glycosides in P. forrestii and design IAC to specifically recognize these features to achieve the multi-component knockout of potential active substances from the extracts of P. forrestii. A content detection experiment confirmed that the content of a compound with periplogenin structure (CPS) in the extract of P. forrestii was reduced by 45% by IAC of periplogenin. The immunosuppressive ability of the extract on H9 human T lymphocytic cells was weakened after CPS knockout from P. forrestii extract. Molecular biology experiments showed that mRNA expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in H9 cells was up-regulated after CPS knockout, while no significant changes in the expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) were found. CPS knockout from P. forrestii extract did not cause significant changes in the proliferation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells incubated with this extract. These results indicate that CPS exhibited immunosuppressive effects via inhibiting the T helper 1 (Th1) cell immune response and not via the anti-inflammatory components in P. forrestii. This is the first use of IAC to achieve multi-component knockout in TCM extracts for identifying effective compounds. This method is effective and reliable and warrants further exploration.}

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe acute respiratory syndrome prompting worldwide demand for new antiviral treatments and supportive care for organ failure caused by this life-threatening virus. This study aimed to help develop a new Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) -based drug and assess its efficacy and safety in COVID-19 patients with major symptoms.
Methods
In February 2022, a randomized clinical trial was conducted among 160 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Emam Reza (AJA) Hospital in Tehran, Iran. During their hospitalization, the intervention group received a treatment protocol approved by Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), consisting of an Iranian regimen, Ficus carica; Vitis vinifera, Safflower, Cicer arietinum, Descurainiasophia seeds, Ziziphus jujuba, chicken soup, barley soup, rose water, saffron, and cinnamon spices. All patients were compared in terms of demographics, clinical, and laboratory variables.
Results
One hundred and sixty COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: intervention and control. In baseline characteristics, there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups (p>0.05). Using SPSS software version 22, statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in four symptoms: myalgia, weakness, headache, and cough (p<0.05). During the 5-day treatment period, the control group had significantly lower C-reactive protein (p<0.05).
Conclusion
While more research with a larger sample size is needed, the proposed combination appears to be effective in the treatment of symptoms as well as inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein in COVID-19 patients. Iranian registry of clinical trials (IRCT) IRCT20220227054140N1.}

Consequently, the food industry has been searching for safe, natural, and environmentally friendly food additives to meet the nutritional and health needs of consumers. Medicine food homology plants (MFHPs) are defined as substances that have both nutritional and medicinal qualities. Essential oils extracted from MFHPs (MFEOs) often contain multiple beneficial active compounds. MFEOs have been reported to have various health benefits, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and anti-obesity properties. MFEOs provide excellent alternatives to the synthetic additives currently used by the food industry, not only to improve the organoleptic properties of food but also to increase its shelf life by decreasing food pathogens. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the recent development of the sources, chemical constituents, health benefits, and food applications of MFEOs. Moreover, this work provides a good foundation for the further development and utilization of MFEOs. The researcher believes that MFEOs will become important food additives and will be more widely used in food preservation.}

abstract = {Background
Interviews are an integral component of the residency selection process. Many programs use current residents as interviewers in addition to faculty. Although the reliability of interview scores between faculty members has been examined, little is known about the reliability between resident and faculty interviewers.
Objective
This study evaluates the reliability of residents as interviewers compared with faculty.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of interview scores from the 2020–2021 application cycle was performed at an emergency medicine (EM) residency program. Each applicant participated in five separate one-on-one interviews led by four faculty members and one senior resident. Interviewers assigned applicants a score from 0 to 10. Consistency between interviewers was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Generalizability theory was used to measure variance components including applicant, interviewer, and rater type (resident vs. faculty) and their impact on scoring.
Results
There were 250 applicants interviewed by 16 faculty members and 7 senior residents during the application cycle. The mean (SD) interview score given by resident interviewers was 7.10 (1.53) and the mean (SD) score given by faculty was 7.07 (1.69). There was no statistically significant difference between the pooled scores (p = 0.97). Reliability between interviewers was good to excellent (ICC = 0.90; 95% CI 0.88–0.92). The generalizability study showed most score variance was attributable to applicant characteristics and only 0.6% was attributable to interviewer or rater type (resident vs. faculty).
Conclusions
There was strong concordance between faculty and resident interview scores indicating reliability of EM resident scoring compared to faculty.}

We do so by attending to the “organizing” side of precision oncology and to the nexus between these activities and epistemic issues. We situate the work that goes into making results actionable and accessing targeted drugs within the larger process of creating a precision medicine ecosystem that includes purpose-built institutional settings, thus simultaneously experimenting with bioclinical matters and, reflexively, with organizing practices. The constitution and articulation of innovative sociotechnical arrangements at MSK provides a unique case study of the production of a large and complex clinical research ecosystem designed to implement rapidly evolving therapeutic strategies embedded in a renewed and dynamic understanding of cancer biology.}

Today's situation where a few companies in the Global North control COVID-19 vaccine production is having dire consequences on African countries' access. However, the challenges surrounding local production of medical products in Africa are long-standing issues dating back to independence. Using Ghana as a case study, this paper looks primarily at how the dependence on medicine imports can be understood as the result of policies implemented since independence, as well as the changes that the Ghanaian State has undergone in reaction to international events and the evolution of the structure of global pharmaceutical capital. It examines the policies associated with the Ghanaian State's project to promote local pharmaceutical production, from independence to the present, and the role that non-state actors such as pharmaceutical companies have played. Based on an historical political economy approach, it highlights how the roles of the State and its forms of intervention have evolved over time, from planning (right after independence), to implementing (during the global crisis of the 1970s–1980s), and finally to regulating (from the 1990–2000s onward). This paper draws on 14 months of PhD research fieldwork (2014–2018). It consists of interviews (n = 50) with Ghanaian actors in the pharmaceutical sector, observations in a pharmaceutical plant in Accra, and research into archives at the Public Records and Archives Administration Department (PRAAD) of the Ministry of Industry.}

When the renal organ is stimulated by external stimuli, it will trigger the damage and phenotypic changes of some intrinsic cells in the kidney. When the body's autoimmune regulation or external treatment is not prompted enough to restore the organ, the pathological process is gradually aggravating, inducing a large amount of intracellular collagen deposition, which leads to the appearance of fibrosis and scarring. The renal parenchyma (including glomeruli and tubules) begins to harden, making it difficult to repair the kidney lesions. In the process of gradual changes in the kidney tissue, the kidney units are severely damaged and the kidney function shows a progressive decline, eventually resulting in the clinical manifestation of end-stage renal failure, namely uremia. This review provides a brief description of the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic inhibitors of renal fibrosis. Since renal fibrosis has not yet had a clear therapeutic target and related drugs, some potential targets and relevant inhibitors are discussed, especially pharmacological effects and interactions with targets. Some existing natural products have potential efficacy for renal fibrosis, which is also roughly summarized, hoping that this article would have reference significance for the treatment of renal fibrosis.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Aortic dissection confers high mortality and morbidity rates despite advances in treatment, impacts quality of life, and contributes immense burden to the healthcare system globally. Efforts to prevent aortic dissection through screening and management of modifiable risk factors and early detection of aneurysms should incorporate genomic information, as it is integral to stratifying risk. However, effective integration of genomic-guided risk assessment into clinical practice will require addressing implementation barriers that currently permeate our healthcare systems. The Aortic Dissection Collaborative was established to define aortic dissection research priorities through patient engagement. Using a collaborative patient-centered feedback model, our Genomic Medicine Working Group identified related research priorities that could be investigated by pragmatic interventional studies aimed at aortic dissection prevention, utilization of genomic information to improve patient outcomes, and access to genomic medicine services. Further research is also needed to identify the genomic, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors that contribute to aortic dissection so these data can be incorporated into future comparative effectiveness studies to prevent aortic dissection.}

abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) possess a rich historical background, unique theoretical framework, remarkable therapeutic efficacy, and abundant resources. However, the modernization and internationalization of TCMs have faced significant obstacles due to their diverse ingredients and unknown mechanisms. To gain deeper insights into the phytochemicals and ensure the quality control of TCMs, there is an urgent need to enhance analytical techniques. Currently, two-dimensional (2D) chromatography, which incorporates two independent separation mechanisms, demonstrates superior separation capabilities compared to the traditional one-dimensional (1D) separation system when analyzing TCMs samples. Over the past decade, new techniques have been continuously developed to gain actionable insights from complex samples. This review presents the recent advancements in the application of multidimensional chromatography for the quality evaluation of TCMs, encompassing 2D-gas chromatography (GC), 2D-liquid chromatography (LC), as well as emerging three-dimensional (3D)-GC, 3D-LC, and their associated data-processing approaches. These studies highlight the promising potential of multidimensional chromatographic separation for future phytochemical analysis. Nevertheless, the increased separation capability has resulted in higher-order data sets and greater demands for data-processing tools. Considering that multidimensional chromatography is still a relatively nascent research field, further hardware enhancements and the implementation of chemometric methods are necessary to foster its robust development.}

abstract = {Owing to the limited natural distributions and special medicine-industrial values of Viola philippica, it’s urgently needed to explore its population-level differences for promoting the resource utilization efficiencies of this plant. The hypothesis of this study was that different populations of V. philippica plants would have broad-scale differences and interactions of leaf-accumulated metabolites and leaf-colonized bacteria. Hence, two populations (vi-p and vi-j) of this plant were typically collected in China for analyzing multiomics. At first, vi-p and vi-j leaf metabolomes (LMs) were presented with 1,003 metabolites; in contrast of vi-p-LMs, 445 differently accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were identified in vi-j-LMs, with the only up-regulated lipids, vitamin and ketone compounds, the only down-regulated aldehyde compounds, the most up-regulated flavonoids, and the most down-regulated phenylpropanoid compounds. In comparative of vi-p leaf transcriptomes (LTs), 4,645 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in vi-j-LTs, which were typically involved in a series of extracellular defenses and secondary metabolic pathways; the DEGs were frequently co-enriched with DAMs in three biosynthesis pathways of phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and α-linolenic acid. Furthermore, these DAMs were also found to have the significant correlations with some different types or/and abundances of leaf-assembled bacteria (DTAB) between vi-p and vi-j leaf-assembled bacterial communities (LABCs). Taken together, this study reveals the broad-scale patterns of regulating vi-p and vi-j leaf DAMs with DEGs and DTAB, suggesting that it’s essential of keeping plant-population and -habitat diversities for harvesting population-level DAMs in V. philippica.}

Self-healing hydrogels are highly hydrated 3D structures with the ability to self-heal after breaking, this property is attributable to a variety of dynamic non-covalent and covalent bonds that are able to re-linking within the matrix. Self-healing ability specially benefits minimal invasive medical treatments with cell-delivery support. Moreover, those tissue-engineered self-healing hydrogels network have demonstrated effectiveness for myriad purposes; for instance, they could act as delivery-platforms for different cargos (drugs, growth factors, cells, among others) in tissues such as bone, cartilage, nerve or skin. Besides, self-healing hydrogels have currently found their way into new and novel applications; for example, with the development of the self-healing adhesive hydrogels, by merely aiding surgical closing processes and by providing biomaterial-tissue adhesion. Furthermore, conductive hydrogels permit the stimuli and monitoring of natural electrical signals, which facilitated a better fitting of hydrogels in native tissue or the diagnosis of various health diseases. Lastly, self-healing hydrogels could be part of cyborganics – a merge between biology and machinery – which can pave the way to a finer healthcare devices for diagnostics and precision therapies.}

Previous studies have revealed that a high-fat diet (HFD) promotes the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) in close association with disturbances in the intestinal flora and metabolic disorders. Xianglian pill (XLP) is a well-established traditional prescription with unique advantages in controlling intestinal flora imbalance and inflammation. However, its therapeutic effects on HFD-related CRC remain largely unknown.
Aim of the study
The primary objective of this research was to investigate the anticancer mechanism of XLP in countering HFD-related CRC.
Materials and methods
The protective effect of XLP was evaluated using azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC model of mice exposed to a HFD. The degree of colorectal carcinogenesis, including body weight, colon length, and histopathology, was measured in mice treated with XLP and untreated mice. The effect of XLP on gut microbiota and its metabolites was detected using 16S rDNA and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, a “pseudo-sterile” mouse model was constructed using antibiotics (Abx) to verify whether the gut microbiota and metabolites play a role in the pathogenesis of CRC.
Results
XLP inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in a dose-dependent fashion. Our findings also highlighted that XLP protected the integrity of the intestinal barrier by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, XLP inhibited the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Notably, the XLP treatment increased the proportion of probiotics (particularly Akkermansia) and significantly reduced fecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a microbiota-derived metabolite of bile acids (BA) closely related to Muribaculaceae. Furthermore, after Abx treatment, XLP showed no clear antitumor effects on CRC. Simultaneously, DCA-supplemented feedings promoted colorectal tumorigenesis and provoked obvious colonic inflammation, M1 macrophage infiltration, and colonic injury. In vitro, the results of RAW-264.7 macrophages and normal intestinal epithelial cells treated with DCA corroborated our in vivo findings, demonstrating consistent patterns in inflammatory responses and intestinal barrier protein expression.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that XLP inhibits colorectal cancer associated with HFD via inactivating TLR4/MyD88 by remodeling gut microbiota composition and BA metabolism.}

Glaucoma is the second most common blindness in the world, which seriously affects the life quality of patients. Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM), are important plant materials, widely used for ocular disease all over the world. With the help of modern ophthalmic detection technology, TCM has gradually become an important content in the field of ophthalmology, characterized by more targets and lower toxicity.
Aim of this review
This review presents an overview of the pathogenesis of glaucoma in both modern and traditional medicines, and summarizes the therapeutic effect of TCM on glaucoma including their formula, crude drugs and active components, and also the application of acupuncture.
Methods
A collection and collation of relevant scientific articles from different scientific databases was performed regarding TCM and its application on glaucoma. The therapeutic effects of TCM were summarized and analyzed according to the existing experimental and clinical researches, while the GSE26299 database were employed to screen bioinformatics analysis of glaucoma based on the GEO database chip.
Results
There were many positive signs showing that TCM could increase the survival rate of retinal ganglion cells, which may be related to its regulation of microcirculation, oxidative stress, and the immune system. Hence, TCM plays an active role in treating glaucoma. In addition, the bioinformatics analysis predicted that the pathogenesis of glaucoma might be related to p53, MAPK, NF-κB signal, as well as other pathways by KEGG analysis, and the results from bioinformatics analysis predicted that PIK3R6, FGF1, and TYRP1 etc.
Conclusion
TCM exerts definite effects on preventing and treating ocular disease. It could alleviate and treat glaucoma in various ways. The differentiation syndrome should thus be taken as the basis to propose appropriate treatment options of TCM making their application on glaucoma more popular.}

Cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), as the terminal stage of many cardiovascular diseases, has brought a heavy burden to the global medical system. Microvascular rarefaction (decreased myocardial capillary density) with reduced coronary flow reserve is a hallmark of HF and therapeutic myocardial angiogenesis is now emerging as a promising approach for the prevention and treatment in HF. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has made remarkable achievements in the treatment of many cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence have shown that their protective effect in HF is closely related to therapeutic angiogenesis.
Aim of the study
This review is to enlighten the therapeutic effect and pro-angiogenic mechanism of TCM in HF, and provide valuable hints for the development of pro-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of HF.
Materials and methods
The relevant information about cardioprotective TCM was collected from electronic scientific databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI).
Results
The studies showed that TCM formulas, extracts, and compounds from herbal medicines can provide therapeutic effect in HF with their pro-angiogenic activity. Their actions are achieved mainly by regulating the key angiogenesis factors particularly VEGF, as well as related regulators including signal molecules and pathways, non-coding miRNAs and stem cells.
Conclusion
TCM and their active components might be promising in therapeutic angiogenesis for the treatment of HF.}

To investigate the association between comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia and major adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, and stroke, in adults with suspected sleep disorders who underwent sleep apnea testing.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic medical records data from patients with clinical encounters at sleep medicine centers to identify patients with comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea only, insomnia only, and patients without a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia (i.e., controls). Obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, comorbidities, and new-onset major adverse cardiovascular events were ascertained by ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional regression models evaluated the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events over a 10-year follow-up period.
Results
A total of 3951 patients, 226 controls, 2107 with obstructive sleep apnea only, 276 with insomnia only, and 1342 with comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia, were included in the analysis. Compared to controls, comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 3.60, 95 CI%: 2.33-5.91) in unadjusted analyses. The relationship between comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia and major adverse cardiovascular events remained after adjustment for demographic and behavioral factors, but not after further adjustment for comorbidities. The greatest risk of major adverse cardiovascular events was found among younger adults with comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Obstructive sleep apnea only was associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in unadjusted analyses only (hazard ratio 2.77, 95% CI: 1.80-4.54). Insomnia only was not significantly associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.
Conclusions
Comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia may be a high-risk group for major adverse cardiovascular events, particularly younger adults. Further research is needed to better understand the association between comorbid obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia and major adverse cardiovascular events risk.}

In this study, we used Ginseng-Fuzi (Aconitum carmichaelii) proprietary Chinese medicines (GFPCMs), with different dosage forms, as examples to develop a new unified quality control strategy. Thus, using a high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, coupled with unified quality evaluation strategies to comprehensively characterize the contents of 12 aconitines and 25 ginsenosides containing eight groups of isomers in 10 GFPCMs. Quality control was carried out for the first time for aconitines and ginsenosides in Jianbuqiangshen Pill, Nanbao Capsule, Nvbao Capsule, Pingfengshengmai Capsule, Wumei Pill, and Xinbao Pill. Furthermore, 4 aconitines and 16 ginsenosides were firstly quantified in all 10 GFPCMs. Subsequently, there was a comprehensive comparison of the universality and accuracy of the quality control strategies based on absolute, normalized, and unit content. It was indicated the strategy-based unit content was more practical and effective. As for Fuzi, the total unit content of diester alkaloids should be less than 0.020%, while monoester alkaloids should be more than 0.010%. As for ginseng, the total unit content of Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rg5, and Re should be higher than 2.0%, and the unit content of Rg5 was a good indicator for the classification of the dosage forms and processing methods. In summary, this strategy showed great potential for supervising the quality of Chinese medicine.}

Although effective treatments for common mental health problems are available, individual responses to treatments are difficult to predict. Treatment efficacy could be optimized by targeting interventions using individual predictions of treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction algorithm using data from one of the largest randomized controlled trials on psychological interventions for common mental health problems.
Methods
This is a secondary analysis of the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease study investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and care as usual (CAU) for depression and low perceived social support following acute myocardial infarction. 2481 participants were randomly assigned to CBT and CAU. Baseline social-demographics, depression characteristics, comorbid symptoms, and stress and adversity measures were used to build an algorithm predicting post-treatment depression severity using elastic net regularization. Performance and generalizability of this algorithm were determined in a hold-out sample (n = 1203).
Results
Treatment matching based on predictions in the hold-out sample resulted in inconsistent and small effects (d = 0.15), that were more pronounced for individuals matched to CBT (d = 0.22). We identified a small subgroup of individuals for which CBT did not appear more efficacious than CAU.
Limitations
Limitations are a poorly defined CAU condition, a low-severity sample, specific exclusion criteria and unavailability of certain baseline variables.
Conclusions
Small matching effects are likely a realistic representation of the performance and generalizability of multivariable prediction algorithms based on clinical measures. Results indicate that future work and new approaches are needed.}

First, discoveries of triptans provided a breakthrough in acute migraine treatment utilizing bench-to-bedside research results on the role of serotonin in migraine. Next, the discovery of the role of neuropeptides, more specifically calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in migraine attack led to the development of anti-CGRP therapies that are effective both in acute and preventive treatment, and are also able to reduce migraine-related burden. Here, we reviewed the most recent clinical studies and real-world data on available migraine-specific medications, including triptans, ditants, gepants and anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Novel drug targets, such as PACAP and amylins were also discussed. To address the main challenges of migraine therapy, the high heterogeneity of people with migraine, the prevalent presence of various comorbid disorders, and the insufficient medical care of migraine patients were covered. Promising novel approaches from the fields of omics, blood and saliva biomarker, imaging and provocation studies might bring solutions for these challenges with the potential to identify further drug targets, distinguish more homogeneous patient subgroups, contribute to more optimal drug selection strategies, and detect biomarkers in association with headache features or predicting treatment efficacy. In the future, the combined analysis of data of different biomarker modalities with machine learning algorithms may serve precision medicine in migraine treatment.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Marsdenia tenacissima (Roxb.) Moon, (M. tenacissima) a traditional herbal medicine, has been used for thousands of years. It is noted in Dian Nan Ben Cao that M. tenacissima is bitter in flavor and cold in property, and extracts possess diverse pharmacological effects, including immunomodulation and anti-tumor activities.
Aim of the study
The anti-tumor effects of M. tenacissima extracts (MTE) have been repeatedly confirmed, and this medicine has also been extensively applied in cancer treatment or prognostic adjuvant therapy, with significant curative effect. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the anti-tumor mechanism of M. tenacissima starting from the key features of traditional Chinese medicine and by studying the main active components individually to identify anti-tumor targets in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Materials and methods
Molecular network profiling and multi-omic joint analyses were conducted using an H22 mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma to determine the main active ingredients in MTE and the underlying anti-tumor mechanisms.
Results
Tenacissosides I, H, and G (TI,TH and TG) were found to be the likely active ingredients of MTE in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. These compounds were shown to promote apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis and improve immune function through targeting P53, JAK-1 and HIF1α, respectively.
Conclusions
For the first time, based on the theory that multiple components and multiple targets synergistically exert the beneficial effects of a traditional Chinese medicine, this paper comprehensively analyzes the mechanisms of action of M. tenacissima and provides a novel strategy for the subsequent development of anti-tumor therapies.}

Plant materials are used as complementary and alternative therapies all over the world for the treatment of various diseases. Ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease listed as one of the modern refractory diseases by the World Health Organization, has a long course, is challenging to cure, and is prone to cause cancer. Recent years have witnessed a growing trend of applying traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to UC.
Aim of this review
This review presents an overview of the pathogenesis of UC and reports the therapeutic effect of TCM on UC (including TCM prescriptions, single TCM, and treatments using TCM ingredients) to provide a theoretical basis for the use of TCM in treating UC.
Methods
We performed a collection and collation of relevant scientific articles from different scientific databases regarding TCM and its usefulness in treating UC. In this paper, the therapeutic effect of TCM is summarized and analyzed according to the existing experimental and clinical research.
Results
There are positive signs that TCM primarily regulates inflammatory cytokines, intestinal flora, and the immune system, and also protects the intestinal mucosa. Hence, it can play a role in treating UC.
Conclusion
TCM has a definite curative effect in the treatment of UC. It can alleviate and treat UC in a variety of ways. We should take syndrome differentiation and treatment differentiation as the basis. With the help of modern medicine, TCM's clinical curative effects can be enhanced for the treatment of UC.}

However, despite the fervent efforts invested in recent clinical trials, a considerable number of these studies have produced outcomes that are deemed unsatisfactory. It is noteworthy that the trials that have yielded the most satisfactory outcomes have exhibited a shared characteristic, namely, the existence of a mechanism for the regulated administration of growth factors. Despite the extensive exploration of drug delivery vehicles and their efficacy in delivering certain growth factors, the development of a reliable predictive approach for the delivery of delicate growth factors like Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) remains elusive. VEGF plays a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis; however, the administration of VEGF demands a meticulous approach as it necessitates precise localization and transportation to a specific target tissue. This process requires prolonged and sustained exposure to a low concentration of VEGF. Inaccurate administration of drugs, either through off-target effects or inadequate delivery, may heighten the risk of adverse reactions and potentially result in tumorigenesis. At present, there is a scarcity of technologies available for the accurate encapsulation of VEGF and its subsequent sustained and controlled release. The objective of this review is to present and assess diverse categories of VEGF administration mechanisms. This paper examines various systems, including polymeric, liposomal, hydrogel, inorganic, polyplexes, and microfluidic, and evaluates the appropriate dosage of VEGF for multiple applications.}

Alcohol and illicit drugs abuse, which is a predisposing factor, was also assessed. In the analysed cohort, 70.1% were males and 29.9% females. The most frequently used weapon was a blunt instrument (accounting for 47.7% of homicides), while the least common was a firearm (accounting for 4.7% of homicides). There were significant differences in homicide mechanisms related to victims’ gender. In males, blunt or sharp instruments predominated, while in females violent suffocation and chop injuries were more frequent. Fatal head injuries and their consequences predominated in the pathomechanisms of death (32.7% of cases). It was shown that the highest blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was found in homicides due to violent strangulation and sharp instrument use, while the lowest BAC was found in gunshot victims. Toxicological tests were performed in 18 cases and in 7 cases showed positive results for illicit drugs. The analysis of various elements involved in homicide may contribute to a conceptual framework for preventive measures aiming at the reduction of homicides number.}

abstract = {Aims
To assess the prevalence of depression and its associated factors among patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus attending family medicine clinics in Qatar
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to April 2021 where 683 adult patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were selected by cluster sampling technique using probability-proportionate to size sampling. Diabetes mellitus was defined as having HA1c of greater than or equal to 6.5%, and patients were assessed for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The relationship between depression, glycemic control, and background characteristics was analyzed using Chi-square, and binary logistic regression analyses. Adjusted logistic regression models estimated the significant factors that were independently associated with depression.
Results
20.1% of the study participants had depression with the vast majority of them having mild depression (70.8%). More than three-quarters had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (81.5%). Male patients were at higher risk for developing depression (AOR =1.98, 1.25-3.14) when compared to female patients. On the other hand, being Qatari was associated with a lower risk for depression compared to non-Qatari patients (AOR =0.56, 0.34—0.90), and treatment with insulin-containing regimens was associated with a lower risk for depression as compared to treatment with non-insulin- containing regimens (AOR =0.49, 0.30-0.78).
Conclusions
Prevalence of depression among patients with Type 2 diabetes attending family medicine clinics in Qatar is high. Therefore, utilizing a multidisciplinary health care plan for screening and management of depression in patients with diabetes in a primary health care setting is highly recommended.

A secondary objective was to examine the gender composition of middle authors in relation to the genders of their respective first and last authors.
Methods
In this observational study, we selected 4 journals in emergency medicine using the Journal of Citation Reports and prior literature to analyze genders of all authors from research articles and editorials published from January 2013 to September 2019. Reviewers identified author genders through web searches with matching academic qualifications or used a gender identification application programming interface to identify likelihood of male or female identity. The primary outcome was the proportion of female authors in each position.
Results
Selected publications included 2,980 original research articles with 18,224 authors (median 6, interquartile range [IQR] 4 to 8) and 433 editorials with 986 authors (median 2, IQR 1 to 2). Women occupied 34.9%, 24.3%, and 36.5% of first, last, and middle author positions on original research articles and 23.8%, 20.5%, and 34.2% of first, last, and middle author positions among editorials, respectively. Publications with female first and last authors (n=340 articles) had a larger proportion of female middle authors (49%, 634/1,290) compared to publications with male first and last authors (n=1667 articles, female middle authors 33% [2,215/6,771]).
Conclusion
Over the 7 years examined, female authorship in these emergency medicine journals increased. A more pronounced gender gap exists in editorial authorship compared to research articles. On publications where the first and last author were women, a higher proportion of middle authors were women.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be described as the use of computers to perform tasks that formerly required human cognition. The American Medical Association prefers the term ‘augmented intelligence’ over ‘artificial intelligence’ to emphasize the assistive role of computers in enhancing physician skills as opposed to replacing them. The integration of AI into emergency medicine, and clinical practice at large, has increased in recent years, and that trend is likely to continue.
Discussion
AI has demonstrated substantial potential benefit for physicians and patients. These benefits are transforming the therapeutic relationship from the traditional physician–patient dyad into a triadic doctor–patient–machine relationship. New AI technologies, however, require careful vetting, legal standards, patient safeguards, and provider education. Emergency physicians (EPs) should recognize the limits and risks of AI as well as its potential benefits.
Conclusions
EPs must learn to partner with, not capitulate to, AI. AI has proven to be superior to, or on a par with, certain physician skills, such as interpreting radiographs and making diagnoses based on visual cues, such as skin cancer. AI can provide cognitive assistance, but EPs must interpret AI results within the clinical context of individual patients. They must also advocate for patient confidentiality, professional liability coverage, and the essential role of specialty-trained EPs.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Ruda-6 (RD-6), a typical traditional Mongolian medicine formulae consisting of 6 herbs, has been traditionally used in treating gastric disorders. Even though it has been shown to protect against gastric ulcers (GU) in animal models, the gut microbiome and serum metabololite-related mechanisms that prevent GU are not well understood.
Aim of the study
This study was conducted to evaluate the gastroprotective mechanism of RD-6 associated with the alteration of the gut microbiome and serum metabolic profiles in GU rats.
Materials and methods
RD-6 (0.27, 1.35 and 2.7 g/kg) or ranitidine (40 mg/kg) were orally administered in rats for three weeks before the induction of gastric ulcer using indomethacin (30 mg/kg, single oral dose). The gastric ulcer index, ulcer area, H&E staining, and the levels of TNF-α, iNOS, MPO and MDA were quantified to evaluate the ulcer inhibitory effects of RD-6. Then, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with LC-MS metabolic profiling was performed to investigate the effect of RD-6 on the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in rats. Moreover, a spearman analysis was used to calculate the correlation coefficient between the different microbiota and the metabolites.
Results
RD-6 inhibited the gastric lesion damage caused by indomethacin in rats, decreased the ulcer index by 50.29% (p < 0.05), reduced the levels of TNF-α, iNOS, MDA and MPO in gastric tissue. Additionally, RD-6 reshaped the diversity and microbial composition, and reversed the reduced bacteria including [Eubacterium]_xylanophilum group, Sellimonas, Desulfovibrio, and UCG-009, and the increased bacteria Aquamicrobium caused by indomethacin induction. Furthermore, RD-6 regulated the levels of metabolites including amino acids and organic acids, and these affected metabolites were involved in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and tryptophan metabolism. Spearman analysis revealed that the perturbed gut microbiota were closely related to the changes in differential serum metabolites.
Conclusion
In view of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and LC-MS metabolic results, the present study suggests the mechanism of RD-6 ameliorating GU via modulating intestinal microbiota and their metabolites.}

A 32-year-old male missing for 4 months, was found in a car in a forest far from his home and had died from blood loss, having been stabbed with a kitchen knife in the left side of his chest. Whitish or white greenish colonies ranging 5 cm to 8 cm in size were observed over his whole body. Penicillium commune and Cladosporium cladosporioides were isolated from the colonies. A 49-year-old male missing for one month, and was found dead at 500 m elevation in the mountains. An autopsy was conducted, but the cause of death could not be determined. Dark greenish or whitish colonies were found on his face and neck, and Epicoccum nigrum, Mucor sp.. Cladosporium sp., and Pestalotiopsis sp. were isolated. Penicillium sp. and Cladosporium sp. are major indoor fungi, and Epicoccum sp. and Pestalotiopsis sp. are plant pathogens found in outdoor environments. There was no discrepancy between the police statement and findings of the corpse such as place discovered, types of isolated fungi, and estimated time since death. Identifying fungi on cadavers may aid in forensic casework, and further studies are needed to develop for the use of fungi as a forensic tool.}

Kuntze). In case significant alterations were detected, single components with potential exposure during pregnancy were identified in the literature and further tested. TM had no neurodevelopmental toxic potential in zebrafish embryos, while LGT and its main compounds triptolide and celastrol induced significant alterations in behavior. Developmental exposure to EGCG, the main catechin of green tea, also produced significant alterations in zebrafish embryos behavior after developmental exposure. A combination of ZEDTA with L/D Transition assay is proposed as a useful combination of alternative methods for DNT assessment of CHM products together with other New Approach Methodologies (NAMs).}

abstract = {Background
Migraine is a highly prevalent neurovascular disorder with complicated treatment due to multifactorial pathophysiology. During the recent years, the prevalence of migraine in Mongolia is increasing and has reached 26.5% by 2019 which indicates an increase of 5.2% over the past 10 years. The industry of traditional medicine in Mongolia has a long history of development, hence, it is evident that various herbal medicines such as but not limited to Khurtsiin deed-6 (KhD-6) can be considered as generally safe and effective against several diseases including migraine. KhD-6’s single component has shown excellent analgesic, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect, while the whole compound effectiveness and molecular mechanism had not been assessed for the treatment of migraine.
Objectives
To study the effects of Khurtsiin deed-6 compound on inflammation and neuronal cell damage in migraine model in rats.
Methods
A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into the following six groups including control group, Nitroglycerin-induced (NTG-induced) migraine model group, KhD-6 groups of 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg doses, and Ibuprofen (IBU) 85 mg/kg treated group. Corresponding treatments were administered intragastrically for 10 days to animals of experimental groups. Then NTG-induced migraine model group, three KhD-6 groups and IBU group were subcutaneously injected with Nitroglycerin (10mg/kg) 1 h after the last treatment. Experimental animals were observed for two hours after Nitroglycerin injection to confirm the model establishment. After four hours, all rats were anesthetized and blood was collected from three rats from each group in order to detect levels of Nitric oxide (NO), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and endothelin (ET) by ELISA method. The remaining three animals of each experimental group were perfused under anesthesia for the removal of their brains and isolation of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to analyze OX42, COX2, RAGE, GFAP, BDNF, BAX, and Bcl expressions.
Results
NTG-induced rat migraine model presents increased NO and CGRP levels in serum as well as c-Fos expression in the brain trigeminal nucleus area, which indicates that the migraine model was successfully generated. NO and CGRP levels in serum were suppressed in KhD-6 and IBU treated groups. The c-Fos expression decreased significantly in the TNC not only in Khurtsiin-6 compound, but also in IBU treated groups. Furthermore, KhD-6 compound inhibits neuro-inflammatory pathways by reducing COX2 expression, OX42 and GFAP activation. It inhibits neuronal cell death through suppressing RAGE, BAX, Bcl expression and increasing BDNF expression.
Conclusion
KhD-6 offers analgesic and neuroprotective effects in the NTG-induced migraine rat model by inhibiting the activation of glial cells and the secretion of neuroinflammatory factors in the TNC region.}

Recently, it has been recognized that like common diseases, patients with rare diseases can greatly vary in the manifestation and severity of symptoms. Here, we review omics-driven approaches that enable an integrated, holistic view of metabolic phenotypes in IEM patients. We focus on applications of Constraint-based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA), a widely used mechanistic systems biology approach, to model the effects of inherited diseases. Moreover, we review evidence that the gut microbiome is also altered in rare diseases. Finally, we outline an approach using personalized metabolic models of IEM patients for the prediction of biomarkers and tailored therapeutic or dietary interventions. Such applications could pave the way towards personalized medicine not just for common, but also for rare diseases.}

Human sex trafficking is widespread and a nationally recognized public health crisis. Trafficked individuals and survivors often utilize the healthcare system, yet healthcare professionals cite a lack of formal training to identify and provide appropriate care. This study aims to increase obstetrics/gynecology, emergency medicine, and family medicine residents’ knowledge and confidence when caring for individuals involved in sex trafficking.
Methods
Obstetrics/gynecology, emergency medicine, and family medicine residents voluntarily attended an evidence-based education session and received an electronic pre-, immediate post-, and 5-month post-session survey measuring knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and confidence. Validated survey items were adapted from previous studies. Paired t-tests (p<0.05) and descriptive analyses were used to determine differences. A concluding focus group was facilitated to further understand trainee experiences and awareness when caring for suspected sex-trafficked individuals and survivors. Thematic analysis determined reoccurring themes.
Results
Between 2019 and 2021, 48 pre-session, 28 immediate post-session, and 13 5-month post-session surveys were collected. Resident knowledge and confidence increased from the pre-session to the immediate post-session period. Session pre- and post-surveys were linked (n=14) and showed a statistically significant increase in knowledge (p<0.05) and an increase in confidence. The mean number of correct knowledge questions remained higher 5 months after the session than in the pre-session period. Focus group themes included increased resident knowledge and confidence.
Conclusions
Improvement and retention in resident knowledge and confidence in caring for sex-trafficked individuals illustrate the utility of this education intervention and expand on current literature. This study provides an example of an education session that can be adapted for other medical trainees.}

abstract = {Objective
To report sex specific overall attendance rate, prevalence of screen detected cardiovascular conditions, proportion of unknown conditions before screening, and proportion initiating prophylactic medicine among 67 year olds in Denmark.
Design
Cross sectional cohort study.
Methods
Since 2014, all 67 year olds in Viborg, Denmark, have been invited to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), carotid plaque (CP), hypertension, cardiac disease, and type 2 diabetes. Individuals with AAA, PAD, and or CP are recommended cardiovascular prophylaxis. Combining data with registries has facilitated estimation of unknown screen detected conditions. Up to August 2019, 5 505 had been invited; registry data were available for the first 4 826 who were invited.
Results
The attendance rate was 83.7%, without sex difference. Screen detected prevalence was significantly lower among women than men: AAA, 5 (0.3%) vs. 38 (1.9%) (p < .001); PAD, 90 (4.5%) vs. 134 (6.6%) (p = .011); CP, 641 (31.8%) vs. 907 (44.8%) (p < .001); arrhythmia, 26 (1.4%) vs. 77 (4.2%) (p < .001); blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mmHg, 277 (13.8%) vs. 346 (17.1%) (p = .004); and HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol, 155 (7.7%) vs. 198 (9.8%) (p = .019), respectively. Pre-screening proportions of unknown conditions were particularly high for AAA (95.4%) and PAD (87.5%). AAA, PAD, and or CP were found in 1 623 (40.2%), of whom 470 (29.0%) received pre-screening antiplatelets and 743 (45.8%) lipid lowering therapy. Furthermore, 413 (25.5%) started antiplatelet therapy and 347 (21.4%) started lipid lowering therapy. Only smoking was significantly associated with all vascular conditions in multivariable analysis: odds ratios (ORs) for current smoking were AAA 8.11 (95% CI 2.27 – 28.97), PAD 5.60 (95% CI 3.61 – 8.67) and CP 3.64 (95% CI 2.95 – 4.47).
Conclusion
The attendance rate signals public acceptability for attending cardiovascular screening. Men had more screen detected conditions than women, but prophylactic medicine was started equally frequently in both sexes. Sex specific cost effectiveness follow up is warranted.}

Qijiao Shengbai Capsule (QSC) is a reputable Miao Nationality medicine used for treating leukopenia, but its chemical composition has not yet been elucidated. We herein present a strategy, by integrating multiple data acquisition, computational data annotation and processing methods to visualize and identify the complicated constituents in QSC based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with traveling wave ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TWIMS-QTOF-MS). The multiple data acquisition modes, including data-independent mass spectrometryEnergy (MSE), data-independent high-definition mass spectrometryEnergy (HDMSE), and fast data-dependent acquisition (fast-DDA), in both positive and negative ion modes, were conducted on a Waters-SYNAPT G2-Si mass spectrometer with an ESI source. An in-house library built by the UNIFI platform could efficiently process the peak annotation of known compounds, whilst different structural types were clustered in the molecular networks for the analogous classification and structural annotation of the unknown ones. Neutral loss, diagnostic ions, feature fragmentation behaviors, and community curation of mass spectrometry data of known compounds helped exploit those similar neighboring nodes of unknown compounds. Moreover, by combination of the predicted CCS values from CCS platform with the experimental CCS values from HDMSE, as well as diagnostic fragment ions, isomer compounds were annotated. By integrating reference compound comparison, a total of 202 constituents, including 94 flavonoids, 12 saponins, 30 phthalides, 38 organic acids, 3 amino acids, 7 alkaloids and 18 others, were unambiguously characterized or tentatively identified in QSC. Among them, 5 potential new compounds were detected and 12 pairs of isomers were comprehensively distinguished. Conclusively, the established multiple acquisition modes, computational data processing and analysis strategy proved to be useful for the in-depth structural identification of QSC.}

abstract = {Background
There is an increasing demand to improve personal health and reduce the social burden in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A comprehensive review of ASD interventions from the point of view of efficacy, safety, and compliance is needed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of East Asian Herbal Medicine (EAHM) in the treatment of ASD.
Materials and methods
Eleven databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, KISS, RISS, OASIS, KCI, CNKI, Wanfang data, and CiNii) were searched from their respective inception to July 2021. A search was conducted by combining the keywords Autism Spectrum Disorder and Herbal medicine. We included a randomized controlled trial in which oral administration of EAHM was combined with conventional treatment for pediatric ASD patients. The primary outcomes were the clinical efficacy rate and the improvement in Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score.
Results
A total of 7 studies involving 462 children with ASD were included. The results suggest that EAHM as part of a combined therapy enhances the CARS score (MD[95% confidential interval]=4.47[5.89,3.05], p<0.01) and the clinical efficacy rate (RR=1.31[1.14,1.51], p<0.01) in comparison to the control group using only conventional therapy. Safety information was reported in 4 of the 7 included studies, and there were no adverse events or the difference in the incidence of side effects between the two groups was not significant.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis shows that EAHM may improves the clinical efficacy rate and CARS score in children with ASD. However, in that the quality of the included studies is not generally high and the numbers are difficult to be considered sufficient, larger scale and rigorously designed randomized controlled trials need to be conducted to strengthen the evidence.}

abstract = {Objective
A review of new oncology indications approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for 2012-2016 showed that 33% of new drugs had labeling based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We reviewed labeling text based on PRO endpoints for new oncology indications approved during 2017-2021.
Methods
New oncology drugs approved by EMA to treat indications of cancers during 2017-2021 were identified from the EMA website. PRO-related language reported in EMA summaries of product characteristics (SmPCs) were summarized and compared with similar findings reported for oncology indications approved during 2012-2016.
Results
Review documents by the EMA during 2017-2021 were available for 49 new oncology drugs for 70 cancer indications. Submissions for 52 (74.3%) of the 70 indications included PRO data for EMA review. Of all submissions, 14 (20.0%) approvals contained PRO-related language in the SmPC. Broad concepts such as health-related quality of life were most common and found in 8 of 14 (57.1%) PRO-related labels.
Conclusion
PRO-related language appeared in SmPCs for 20% of all indications of new oncology drugs approved by EMA during 2017-2021 compared with approximately 33% of EMA approvals during 2012-2016. PRO-related labeling during the same periods showed a greater decline (from 47% to 27%) for indications of new oncology drugs that also included PRO data. One possible reason for this decline may be the increase in open-label studies from 62% between 2012 and 2016 to approximately 79% between 2017 and 2021.}

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive accumulation of hepatic lipids and metabolic stress-induced liver injury. There are currently no approved effective pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for centuries to treat patients with chronic liver diseases without clear disease types and mechanisms. More recently, TCM has been shown to have unique advantages in the treatment of NAFLD. We performed a systematic review of the medical literature published over the last two decades and found that many TCM formulas have been reported to be beneficial for the treatment of metabolic dysfunctions, including Potentilla discolor Bunge (PDB). PDB has a variety of active compounds, including flavonoids, terpenoids, organic acids, steroids and tannins. Many compounds have been shown to exhibit a series of beneficial effects for the treatment of NAFLD, including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory functions, improvement of lipid metabolism and reversal of insulin resistance. In this review, we summarize potential therapeutic effects of TCM formulas for the treatment of NAFLD, focusing on the medicinal properties of natural active compounds from PDB and their underlying mechanisms. We point out that PDB can be classified as a novel candidate for the treatment and prevention of NAFLD.}

abstract = {Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide life-threatening pandemic. Lianhua Qingwen is believed to possess the ability to treat or significantly improve the symptoms of COVID-19. These claims make it important to systematically evaluate the effects of using Lianhua Qingwen with Western medicine to treat COVID-19.
Objective
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy, employing Lianhua Qingwen with Western medicine, to treat COVID-19, using a meta-analysis approach.
Search strategy
China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies evaluating the effect of Lianhua Qingwen-Western medicine combination therapy in the treatment of COVID-19.
Inclusion criteria
(1) Research object: hospitalized patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 were included. (2) Intervention measures: patients in the treatment group received Lianhua Qingwen treatment combined with Western medicine, while the control group received either Western medicine or Chinese medicine treatment. (3) Research type: randomized controlled trials and retrospective study were included.
Data extraction and analysis
Two researchers extracted the first author, the proportion of males and females, age, body temperature, course of treatment, rate of disappearance of main symptoms, duration of fever, adverse reactions, and total effectiveness from the literature. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as the effect value for count data, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI were used as the effect value for measurement data.
Results
Six articles met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 856 COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis showed that Lianhua Qingwen combination therapy achieved higher rates of fever reduction (OR = 3.43, 95% CI [1.78, 6.59], P = 0.0002), cough reduction (OR = 3.39, 95% CI [1.85, 6.23], P < 0.0001), recovery from shortness of breath (OR = 10.62, 95% CI [3.71, 30.40], P < 0.0001) and recovery from fatigue (OR = 2.82, 95% CI [1.44, 5.53], P = 0.003), higher total effectiveness rate (OR = 2.51, 95% CI [1.73, 3.64], P < 0.00001), and shorter time to recovery from fever (MD = −1.00, 95% CI [−1.04, 0.96], P < 0.00001), and did not increase the adverse reaction rate (OR = 0.65, 95% CI [0.42, 1.01], P = 0.06), compared to the single medication control.
Conclusion
The Lianhua Qingwen and Western medicine combination therapy is highly effective for COVID-19 patients and has good clinical safety. As only a small number of studies and patients were included in this review, more high-quality, multicenter, large-sample-size, randomized, double-blind, controlled trials are still needed for verification.}

abstract = {Objectives
To describe first author gender differences and characteristics in 1) Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Annual Meeting abstracts and 2) resulting manuscript publications.
Methods
We performed cross-sectional evaluation of SAEM abstracts from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, compiling and reviewing a random sample of 100 abstracts for each year (total n = 700 abstracts). We documented abstract characteristics, including first author gender, and used the 2020 SAEM scoring rubric. We then searched PubMed to identify manuscript publications resulting from abstracts from 1990 to 2015 (n = 600). Finally, among abstracts that resulted in manuscript publication, we identified first and last author gender on both the abstracts and the resulting publication.
Results
Overall, 29% (202/695; n = 5 missing gender) of abstracts had female first authors. Female first authors increased over time (e.g., 17% in 1990 to 35% in 2020). Abstract quality scores were similar (both median [interquartile range] of 11 ([9–12]). Overall, 42% (n = 254/600) of abstracts resulted in a manuscript publication, 39% (n = 65/202) with female and 44% (n = 189/493) with male first authors (p = 0.26). The median time (IQR) from abstract to manuscript publication was longer for abstracts with female first authors vs. those with male first authors (2 [1–3] years and 1 [1, 2] years, p < 0.02); 77% and 78% of publications resulting from abstracts with female and male first authors, respectively, had the same first author. Female first author abstracts more often converted to a male first author manuscript publication (18%, n = 12/65) compared to male first author abstracts converting to female first author publications (7%, n = 14/189).
Conclusions
A minority of SAEM abstracts, and manuscript publications resulting from them, had female first authors. Abstracts with female first authors took longer to achieve manuscript publication, and almost a fifth of female first author abstracts resulted in male first author manuscript publication.}

Radiopharmaceuticals products target specific cellular elements which allow to explore several biological pathways. Nuclear medicine may also be used for therapeutic purposes and recent developments of approach based on Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) for treatment of aggressive PA and pituitary carcinoma will be reviewed.
