Si-Wei-Qiang-Wei Powder (SWQ) is a formulated traditional Tibetan medicine preparation that has been used clinically to treat liver and gallbladder diseases for centuries. Previous work has confirmed its clinical effectiveness, however, the specific mechanism of SWQ is still unknown. Aim of the study: This study aims to explore the anti-inflammatory effect of SWQ on cholecystitis and its possible mechanism.
Materials and methods
The main chemical components of SWQ were analyzed by HPLC. The network pharmacology database was used to screen and construct the network of the main components and molecular targets of SWQ, and to predict the molecular pathways of its core targets. Cholecystitis guinea pig model and LPS stimulated cultured human gallbladder epithelial cells (HGBEC) were used, as in vivo and in vitro methods respectively, to study the anti-cholecystitis activity of SWQ. Specifically, gallbladder wall thickness, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and liver function indexes were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activities of SWQ in cholecystitis; qRT-PCR and ELISA were used to detect the changes of the production of inflammatory cytokines; Western blot analysis was used to analyze the effects of SWQ on phosphorylation of P38, ERK1/2, JNK and AKT.
Results
SWQ decreased the indexes of ALT, AST, TBA, CHOL, DBIL in serum and TBIL, TC and Ca2+ in bile, and alleviated the wall thickness of gallbladder and hepatobiliary fibrosis in LCA-induced guinea pigs. In addition, SWQ attenuated the expression and production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2 both in liver and gallbladder. Moreover, SWQ reversed the up-regulation of p-P38, p-ERK1/2, and p-JNK in animals with cholecystitis and LPS-induced HGBEC. Furthermore, mechanistic studies indicated that SWQ inhibited the activation of ERK1/2, thereby decreasing the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and phosphorylation P38 and JNK.
Conclusion
In summary, our research showed that SWQ relieves gallbladder inflammation by inhibiting the MAPK pathway.}

The single ascending dose of Naoqingzhiming tablet (180–2160 mg) were well tolerated in all enrolled subjects, without serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study. The most common drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were elevated blood bilirubin and serum uric acid. No clinically significant findings were found in the physical examinations, vital signs or electrocardiograms. After single-dose administration of Naoqingzhiming tablet, echinacoside was absorbed with a Tmax at 1.25–1.75 h and declined with a t1/2 of 2.42–3.33 h. However, the proportionality coefficients for Cmax, AUC0−t and AUC0-∞ of echinacoside were not fully contained in the pre-defined 90 % CI criterion (0.91–1.09). As a result, the dose proportionality could not be concluded statistically within the dosage range of this study. Overall, the safety profile and PK properties support further development and use of Naoqingzhiming in vascular dementia.}

abstract = {Objectives
Telehealth has provided increased specialty access to patients and health care providers; however, it is currently being underutilized to deliver oral medicine. In this study, we aim to assess the telehealth-related perspectives of licensed oral health providers in the state of Washington and their likelihood to utilize telehealth for oral medicine services.
Study Design
A cross-sectional, confidential, online survey study was performed with data collected via REDCap. Emails were distributed to 8427 licensed dentists and dental hygienists provided by the Washington State Department of Health public records. Analyses included descriptive statistics, means and standard deviations, as well as a hierarchical multiple regression modeled by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) system of the theoretical domains framework.
Results
Among the 927 participants who initiated the survey (11% response rate), 563 (57%) were included in the analysis based on level of completeness. Dental providers indicated a significant lack of adequate access to oral medicine services (mean [M]= 2.16, standard deviation [SD] = 1.70 on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating strong agreement) and a significant likelihood to use telehealth to deliver oral medicine (adjusted: M = 71.30, SD = 25.38 on a 100-mm VAS scale, with 100 being very likely). Within the capabilities, opportunity and motivation domains, motivation was the domain most strongly associated with higher likelihood to use telehealth to deliver oral medicine
Conclusions
We identified oral health providers’ lack of access to oral medicine in Washington State and their willingness to use a telehealth program to deliver oral medicine. Benefits and barriers indicated by providers in this survey may inform the development of a telehealth program where a multidisciplinary team can support other dental providers in the integrated delivery of oral medicine to their patients across Washington State.}

Herein, we constructed an in vitro BBB-glioma microfluidic chip model lined by primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and glioma cells, which could recapitulate the high level of barrier function of the in vivo human BBB and glioma microenvironment. The BBB unit in BBB-glioma microfluidic chip (BBB–U251 chip) displayed selective permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer-dextran (FITC-dextran) with different molecular weights and three model drugs with different permeability behavior across BBB, which indicated that this glioma model included a functional barrier. Six potential anti-glioma components in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were delivered into the blood channel and the permeated amount was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with ultraviolet (HPLC-UV). The permeated drugs then directly acted on 3D cultured glioma cells (U251) to evaluate the drug efficacy. The results of permeability coefficients of drugs showed that the data were closer to the in vivo data of traditional Transwell model. The effect of the drugs on U251 cells in the BBB-U251 chip was significantly lower due to the existence of BBB. Drug responses on glioma demonstrated the necessity to take BBB into account during the development of anti-glioma new drugs. Therefore, this 3D glioma microfluidic models integrating the BBB functionality can be a useful platform for screening the anticancer drug for brain tumors.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Blood proteins are frequently measured in serum or plasma, because they provide a wealth of information. Differences in the ex vivo processing of serum and plasma raise concerns that proteomic health and disease signatures derived from serum or plasma differ in content and quality. However, little is known about their respective power to predict feto-maternal health outcomes. Predictive power is a sentinel characteristic to determine the clinical use of biosignatures.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to compare the power of serum and plasma proteomic signatures to predict a physiological pregnancy outcome.
STUDY DESIGN
Paired serum and plasma samples from 73 women were obtained from biorepositories of a multinational prospective cohort study on pregnancy outcomes. Gestational age at the time of sampling was the predicted outcome, because the proteomic signatures have been validated for such a prediction. Multivariate and cross-validated models were independently derived for serum and plasma proteins.
RESULTS
A total of 1116 proteins were measured in 88 paired samples from 73 women with a highly multiplexed platform using proximity extension technology (Olink Proteomics Inc, Watertown, MA). The plasma proteomic signature showed a higher predictive power (R=0.64; confidence interval, 0.42–0.79; P=3.5×10-6) than the serum signature (R=0.45; confidence interval, 0.18–0.66; P=2.2×10-3). The serum signature was validated in plasma with a similar predictive power (R=0.58; confidence interval, 0.34–0.75; P=4.8×10-5), whereas the plasma signature was validated in serum with reduced predictive power (R=0.53; confidence interval, 0.27–0.72; P=2.6×10-4). Signature proteins largely overlapped in the serum and plasma, but the strength of association with gestational age was weaker for serum proteins.
CONCLUSION
Findings suggest that serum proteomics are less informative than plasma proteomics. They are compatible with the view that the partial ex-vivo degradation and modification of serum proteins during sample processing are an underlying reason. The rationale for collecting and analyzing serum and plasma samples should be carefully considered when deriving proteomic biosignatures to ascertain that specimens of the highest scientific and clinical yield are processed. Findings suggest that plasma is the preferred matrix.}

abstract = {Summary
Meningiomas represent the most common group of central nervous system primary tumors, and are often incidental findings on neuroimaging exams. The World Health Organization classifies meningiomas into three grades (grades I-III), varying in risk of recurrence and mortality. Approximately 100% of meningiomas present expression of the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), which, in recent years, has been highlighted by the literature as a possible theranostic tool, confirming the relevance of PET/CT with SSTR ligands in this context. Based on a narrative literature review, the objective was to analyze the main characteristics of meningiomas found in DOTATOC-68Ga PET/CT, FDG-18F PET/CT and PSMA-68Ga PET/CT exams performed in a private nuclear medicine service. Subsequently, the data obtained was compared with evidence from the studies consulted. A search tool connected to the RIS database was used, utilizing the search word meningioma in PET/CT exam reports, from February 2019 to January 2024. As a result, exams from 68 patients were found, including 19 PET/CT DOTATOC-68Ga, 45 PET/CT FDG-18F and 4 PET/CT PSMA-68Ga. The absolute number per age group was 8 (40-49 years), 12 (50-59 years), 15 (60-69 years), 19 (70-79 years) and 14 (80 years or more), among which 47 were women and 21 men. Among all studies, 12 (17.6%) were indicated for meningioma specific evaluation, varying between initial diagnosis, radiosurgery programming, post-resection evaluation and uncleared focal neurological signs, which represented 57.9% (11) of the DOTATOC-68Ga PET/CT sample and 2.2% (1) of FDG-18F PET/CT. All PSMA-68Ga PET/CT studies had another indication. Within all lesions evaluated, 61 were unifocal and 7 were multifocal. The largest diameter of the lesions analyzed ranged from 5 to 66 mm (average 23 mm). Based on the 68 patients analyzed in the sample, highlighting the existence of multifocal lesions, the topographies observed were: parasagittal 23, hemispherical convexity 30, sphenoid and middle cranial fossa 12, cerebellar convexity 1, frontobasal 4, posterior fossa 2 and foramen magnum 1. All lesions evaluated by DOTATOC-68Ga PET/CT showed tracer uptake (SUV between 2.5 and 17.8, mean SUV 8.9), compared to 3 lesions evaluated by FDG PET/CT-18F (SUV between 4.9 and 7.2, mean SUV 6.1). No lesion showed significant uptake of PSMA-68Ga.
Conclusão
In the context of increasing advances in molecular imaging with SSTR ligands for meningiomas, PET/CT studies have showed relevance, above all, in the initial evaluation (pre-surgical/pre-radiotherapeutic), in the scenario of suspected tumor recurrence, as well as for candidates to radionuclide therapy. The present work sought to analyze information that could corroborate the characteristics of such tumors in hybrid images, comparing the data found with current literature. In addition, highlight the potential use of FDG-18F uptake in the non-invasive assessment of the aggressiveness of meningiomas.}

It is the only nonpoisonous member of the genus Aconitum, and has been used as a medicinal herb since ancient times. A. heterophyllum is an important ingredient in many traditional systems of medicine. Mostly, it is harvested for its roots, and its medicinal properties are due to the presence of diverse bioactive secondary metabolites, commonly known as aconites. Our understanding of the pharmacological properties of this intriguing genus is continuously growing due to its broad chemical diversity. The therapeutic uses identified by traditional medicinal practice are receiving extensive study. Multiple in vitro experimental investigations of A. heterophyllum have reported the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic, antiparasitic and anticancer properties, as well as its effects on the central nervous system. In this review, we highlight the classification, distribution, commerce, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and conservation measures relevant to this species. Additionally, this review includes the biosynthetic pathways of A. heterophyllum’s key constituents, which could be targeted to enhance the expression levels of desired metabolites via genetic interventions. Studying the genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomic aspects of this species would be helpful in developing highly designed genotypes and chemotypes of this species to be used in commercial production.}

Due to their complex and dynamic nature, modeling tumors accurately is a challenging task. Current models suffer from inadequate translation between in vitro and in vivo results, primarily due to the isotropic nature of tumors and their microenvironment's relationship. To address these limitations, hydrogel-based 3D bioprinting is emerging as a promising approach to mimic cancer development and behavior. It provides precise control over individual elements' size and distribution within the cancer microenvironment and enables the use of patient-derived tumor cells, rather than commercial lines. Consequently, hydrogel bioprinting is expected to become a state-of-the-art technique for cancer research. This manuscript presents an overview of cancer statistics, current modeling methods, and their limitations. Additionally, we highlight the significance of bioprinting, its applications in cancer modeling, and the importance of hydrogel selection. We further explore the current state of creating models for the five deadliest cancers using 3D bioprinting. Finally, we discuss current trends and future perspectives on the clinical use of cancer modeling using hydrogel bioprinting.}

abstract = {Introduction
People with opioid use disorder (OUD) have high rates of discharge against medical advice from the hospital. Interventions for addressing these patient-directed discharges (PDDs) are lacking. We sought to explore the impact of methadone treatment for OUD on PDD.
Methods
Using electronic record and billing data from an urban safety-net hospital, we retrospectively examined the first hospitalization on a general medicine service for adults with OUD from January 2016 through June 2018. Associations with PDD compared to planned discharge were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Administration patterns of maintenance therapy versus new in-hospital initiation of methadone were examined using bivariate tests.
Results
During the study time period, 1,195 patients with OUD were hospitalized. 60.6% of patients received medication for OUD, of which 92.8% was methadone. Patients who received no treatment for OUD had a 19.1% PDD rate while patients initiated on methadone in-hospital had a 20.5% PDD rate and patients on maintenance methadone during the hospitalization had a 8.6% PDD rate. In multivariable logistic regression, methadone maintenance was associated with lower odds of PDD compared to no treatment (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34–0.81), while methadone initiation was not (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56–1.39). About 60% of patients initiated on methadone received 30 mg or less per day.
Conclusions
In this study sample, maintenance methadone was associated with nearly a 50% reduction in the odds of PDD. More research is needed to assess the impact of higher hospital methadone initiation dosing on PDD and if there is an optimal protective dose.}

abstract = {Objectives
To explore pediatric residents’ perspectives on humanism and how residency impacts humanism formation.
Methods
We conducted a qualitative study with pediatric resident focus groups at Stanford. Transcripts were analyzed by two investigators using grounded theory. Subsequent literature review led us to adapt Cruess et al. 2015′s professional identity formation framework to describe development of a humanism identity in residency. Member check was done to verify themes and the adapted framework.
Results
Thirty two pediatric residents participated. Five themes emerged: 1) Empathy, compassion, and respect are foundational elements of humanism. 2) Each resident had a unique view of humanism derived from personal values. 3) Residents felt that the terms excellence and resilience (Gold Foundation IECARES model) did not fit with their own definitions. 4) Residents felt that humanism is a central part of their practice and training. 5) The demands, structure, and culture of residency were often in conflict with promoting humanism in residents. Based on residents' perspectives, we modified the professional identity formation and socialization conceptual framework proposed by Cruess et al. 2015 to reflect humanism identity formation during pediatrics residency. The new framework emphasizes the increased power of the healthcare system and unconscious acquisition on humanism formation in residency as compared to medical school.
Conclusions
Residents believe that humanism is a core part of practicing medicine and should be reinforced during residency training. Cruess' professional identity and socialization framework is a tool for a better understanding of the complexity of humanism development in residency.}

However, it still constitutes more than 1% of all pediatric malignancies, with a rising incidence during the last years. In most areas of treatment, little evidence exists because of the rarity of the disease and the long survival of pediatric patients with DTC. However, there is a high level of agreement that radioiodine therapy, besides surgery, is a crucial treatment modality in this entity. Of special importance in this context is, that pediatric DTC are more likely to present a higher tumor stage than in the adult setting. As pediatric tumors usually show a strong avidity for RAI, the response to this treatment is very good in most cases. However, especially in this population of patients with a long life expectancy positive and negative effects need to be carefully weighed against each other.}

Kuan-Sin-Yin (KSY) is a traditional Chinese medical decoction, designed based on the classic Si-Jun-Zi-Tang decoction and used clinically to improve the synergic effects of energy promotion, liver function and cancer related symptom and quality of life. However, the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) function of KSY is unclear.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to investigate the anti-mobility activity of KSY on HCC cells and elucidate its molecular mechanism.
Materials and methods
Two malignancy hepatocellular carcinoma cells, Mahlavu and SK-Hep-1, were used for the test of cell proliferation via alarm blue assay. The wound healing and Transwell assays were used to determine the anti-mobility activity of KSY in HCC cells. Cell morphology was analyzed via confocal microscopy. The genomic profile of KSY-treated HCC cells was analyzed by microarray. The potential signaling pathways and bio-functions of KSY-mediated genes were analyzed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of indicated gene.
Results
KSY did not affect cell viability of HCC cells but significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in those HCC Mahlavu and SK-Hep-1 cells. In parallel, KSY induced changes in morphology of HCC cells via re-modulating actin cytoskeleton. KSY upregulated 1270 genes but reduced 1534 genes in Mahlavu cells. KSY regulated various gene networks which controlled cell migration, invasion and movement. Specifically, KSY reduced expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which is correlated to cell mobility, and concomitantly downregulated mRNA levels of phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3 (PIK3R3) and CEA cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1).
Conclusion
These findings indicated that regulation of CCL2-mediated PIK3R3 and CEACAM1 may be involved in KSY inhibited cell mobility. Moreover, KSY may be a potential a Chinese decoction for reducing cell mobility.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aimed to understand broad data sharing decisions among predominantly underserved families participating in genomic research.
Methods
Drawing on clinic observations, semistructured interviews, and survey data from prenatal and pediatric families enrolled in a genomic medicine study focused on historically underserved and underrepresented populations, this paper expands empirical evidence regarding genomic data sharing communication and decision-making.
Results
One-third of parents declined to share family data, and pediatric participants were significantly more likely to decline than prenatal participants. The pediatric population was significantly more socioeconomically disadvantaged and more likely to require interpreters. Opt-in was tied to altruism and participants’ perception that data sharing was inherent to research participation. Opt-out was associated with privacy concerns and influenced by clinical staff’s presentation of data handling procedures. The ability of participants to make informed choices during enrollment about data sharing was weakened by suboptimal circumstances, which was revealed by poor understanding of data sharing in follow-up interviews as well as discrepancies between expressed participant desires and official recorded choices.
Conclusion
These empirical data suggest that the context within which informed consent process is conducted in clinical genomics may be inadequate for respecting participants’ values and preferences and does not support informed decision-making processes.}

The results showed higher HS production was achieved, with 109.73 and 111.44 g·kg−1, and HA/FA was raised by 12.70–16.02 % in compost products by LDB addition stimulation. Significant upregulation of β-glucanase and xylanase activities catalyzed higher decomposition of lignocellulose toward more HS potential precursors supply. Furthermore, exogenous LDB intervention induced microbial community restructure and microbial network establishment via enriching synergism functional bacteria, i.e., Thermobifida, Paenibacillus, Nonomuraea, etc. Mantel test results showed that it was variation of cellulose, hemicellulose and HS that affected microbial community succession (p < 0.01, r > 0.6), which represented the positive action of LDB addition stimulation on HS synthesis upregulation. Further exploration suggested LDB had an indirect effect on HS formation by enhanced lignin and hemicellulose conversion based on the Random Forest model and Partial least-squares path modeling results. This research provides new insights into the trigger effects of LDB introduction on upregulating HS synthesis and is expected to propose new perspectives for HS efficient production in CMHRs composting.}

abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer and constitutes approximately 25 % of cancer diagnoses among children under the age of 15 (Howlader et al., 2013) [1]. Overall, about half of ALL cases occur in children and adolescents and it is the most common acute leukemia until the early 20s, after which acute myeloid leukemia predominates. ALL is the most successful treatment paradigm in pediatric cancer medicine as illustrated by the significant survival rate improvement from ∼10 % in the 1960s to >90 % today (Hunger et al., 2015) [2]. This remarkable success stems from the progressive improvement in the efficacy of risk-adapted multiagent chemotherapy regimens with effective central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis via well-designed randomized clinical trials conducted by international collaborative consortia, enhanced supportive care measures to decrease treatment-related mortality, in-depth understanding of the genetic basis of ALL, and refinement in treatment response assessment through serial minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring (Pui et al., 2015) [3]. These advances collectively contribute to a decline in mortality rate of 23.5% for children diagnosed with ALL in the US from 2000 to 2010 (Smith et al., 2014) [4]. Nevertheless, outcomes of older adolescents and young adults with ALL still lag behind those of their younger counterparts despite pediatric-inspired chemotherapy regimens (Stock et al., 2019) [5], relapsed/refractory childhood ALL is associated with poor outcomes (Rheingold et al., 2019) [6], and ALL still represents the leading causes of cancer-related deaths (Smith et al., 2010) [7]. The last two decades have witnessed important genomic discoveries in ALL, enabled by advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the landscape of germline and somatic alterations in ALL, some of which have important diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications. Comprehensive genomic analysis of large cohorts of children and adults with ALL has revised the taxonomy of ALL in the molecular era by identifying novel clonal, subtype-defined chromosomal alterations associated with distinct gene expression signatures, thus reducing the proportion of patients previously labelled as “Others” from 25 % to approximately 5 % (Mullighan et al., 2019) [8]. Insights into the genomics of ALL further provide compelling biologic rationale to expand the scope of precision medicine therapies for childhood ALL. Herein, we summarize a decade of genomic discoveries to highlight three different facets of precision medicine in pediatric ALL: 1) inherited predispositions of ALL; 2) relevant molecularly targeted therapies in genomically-defined ALL subtypes; and 3) treatment response monitoring via pharmacogenomics and novel MRD biomarkers.}

Weierning tablet (WEN) is a traditional Chinese patent medicine widely used in clinical for chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) therapy for years. However, the underlying mechanisms of WEN on anti-CAG are still unveiled.
Aim of the study
The present study aimed to elucidate the characteristic function of WEN on anti-CAG and to illuminate its potential mechanism.
Methods
The CAG model was established by gavage rats with a modeling solution (consisting of 2% sodium salicylate and 30% alcohol) with irregular diets and free access to 0.1% ammonia solution for two months on end. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the serum levels of gastrin, pepsinogen, and inflammatory cytokines. qRT-PCR was applied to measure mRNA expressions of IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, TNF-α, and γ-IFN in gastric tissue. Pathological changes and the ultrastructure of gastric mucosa were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. AB-PAS staining was applied to observe the intestinal metaplasia of gastric mucosa. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to measure the expression levels of mitochondria apoptosis-related proteins and Hedgehog pathway-related proteins in gastric tissues. Expressions of Cdx2 and Muc2 protein were determined by immunofluorescent staining.
Results
WEN could dose-dependently lower the serum level of IL-1β and the mRNA expressions of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and γ-IFN in gastric tissue. Also, WEN significantly alleviated the collagen deposition in gastric submucosa, regulated the expressions of Bax, Cleaved-caspase9, Bcl2, and Cytochrome c to reduce the apoptosis of gastric mucosa epithelial cells, and maintained the integrity of the gastric mucosal barrier. Moreover, WEN could reduce protein expressions of Cdx2, Muc2, Shh, Gli1, and Smo, and reverse intestinal metaplasia of gastric mucosa to block the progress of CAG.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated a positive effect of WEN on improving CAG and reverse intestinal metaplasia. These functions were related to the suppression of gastric mucosal cells' apoptosis and the inhibition of Hedgehog pathways’ activation.}

abstract = {The term “proteoforms” describes the range of different structures of a protein product of a single gene, including variations in amino acid sequence and post-translational modifications. This diversity in protein structure contributes to the biological complexity observed in living organisms. As the concentration of a particular proteoform may increase or decrease in abnormal physiological states, proteoforms have long been used in medicine as biomarkers of health and disease. Notably, the analytical approaches used to analyze proteoforms have evolved considerably over the years. While ligand binding methods continue to play a large role in proteoform measurement in the clinical laboratory, unanticipated or unknown post-translational modifications and sequence variants can upend even extensively tested and vetted assays that have successfully made it through the medical regulatory process. As an alternate approach, mass spectrometry—with its high molecular selectivity—has become an essential tool in detection, characterization, and quantification of proteoforms in biological fluids and tissues. This review explores the analytical techniques used for proteoform detection and quantification, with an emphasis on mass spectrometry and its various applications in clinical research and patient care including, revealing new biomarker targets, helping improve the design of contemporary ligand binding in vitro diagnostics, and as mass spectrometric laboratory developed tests used in routine patient care.}

abstract = {Research Objectives
To examine associations between Interpersonal Trauma (IT) and satisfaction with overall healthcare and physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) services received from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Satisfaction with healthcare services is associated with favorable outcomes. Understanding factors related to satisfaction can assist providers tailor outreach and optimize rehabilitation outcomes. IT is intentional in nature and impairs one's ability to trust others, which may influence the patient-provider relationship.
Design
A retrospective cohort study. IT and non-interpersonal trauma (NIT) data were collected from the Life Events Checklist (LEC-5).
Setting
VHA, as a national healthcare system.
Participants
1,109 Veterans who were screened for mental health disorders and traumatic brain injury between 2006-18, completed a follow-up survey in 2020-21, and received care from VHA in the six months before contact.
Interventions
N/A.
Main Outcome Measures
Self-reported satisfaction with overall VHA and PM&R services rated on a 1 (extremely unsatisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied) scale.
Results
Preliminary analyses using Spearman's rank test revealed correlations between overall healthcare satisfaction and the presence of IT (p = 0.0044), but not the presence of NIT (p = 0.4483). Neither IT (p = 0.3101) nor NIT (p = 0.3523) were found to be correlated with satisfaction with PM&R services. Demographic and health characteristics were assessed to generate a parsimonious model. Adjusted Odds ratios revealed small and insignificant effects due to the presence of NIT (Adjusted OR: 1.172 [0.653, 2.104]) and IT (Adjusted OR: 0.831 [0.585, 1.182]). Odds ratios for satisfaction with PM&R services revealed similar small and statistically insignificant results.
Conclusions
Findings support other studies that found no correlation between IT and overall healthcare satisfaction or satisfaction with PM&R services. These results may indicate that VHA efforts to support veterans who have experienced interpersonal trauma exposure have reduced barriers to patient-clinician relationships, and the resulting impact on satisfaction with care. Further investigation into the IT characteristics, such as type of trauma, is required.

abstract = {Background
Trials of hospital deprescribing interventions have demonstrated limited changes in practitioner behaviour. Our previous research characterised four barriers and one enabler to geriatricians and pharmacists deprescribing in hospital that require addressing by a behaviour change intervention. Six behaviour change techniques (BCTs) have also been selected by the target audience using the hospital Deprescribing Implementation Framework (hDIF). This research aimed to co-design and operationalise the content, mode of delivery and duration/intensity of the six selected BCTs to develop the CompreHensive geriAtRician-led MEdication Review (CHARMER) deprescribing intervention.
Methods
We established co-design panels at three hospitals representing contextual factors likely to influence CHARMER implementation. Panels comprised geriatricians, pharmacists and other hospital staff likely to be involved in implementation. We convened two rounds of co-design workshops with each hospital to design a prototype for each BCT, which went for feedback at a final workshop attended by all three hospital panels.
Results
The six BCTs were co-designed into an intervention comprising:(1&2) Pharmacists' workshop with pros and cons of deprescribing activities, and videos of salient patient cases3 Regular geriatrician and pharmacist deprescribing briefings4 Videos of geriatricians navigating challenging deprescribing consultations5 Hospital deprescribing action plan6 Dashboard to benchmark deprescribing activitiesAutomated prompts to flag high-risk patients for deprescribing and a primary and secondary care deprescribing forum were proposed as additional BCTs by stakeholders. These were later excluded as they were not fidelitous to the theoretical determinants of geriatricians' and pharmacists’ deprescribing behaviours.
Conclusions
This study illustrates the integration of theory and co-design methodology with the target audience and staff likely to be involved in implementation of a hospital deprescribing behaviour change intervention. The development of an intervention that remains faithful to the underpinning mechanisms of action of behaviour change is a strength of this approach.}

abstract = {Objective
We employed a multidisciplinary approach incorporating theoretical ideas, clinical experience, psychology, physiology, traditional Chinese medicine (CM), modern practice of CM, and oncology to explore the effect of patients’ repression of negative emotions and traumatic events on breast cancer (BC) pathogenesis.
Methods
BC female patients, older than 18 years of age, with available pathology reports who were treated at Rabin Medical Center were recruited. All participants completed questionnaires regarding medical history, behavioral tendencies, negative emotions, trauma, symptoms, and pathology (from a CM perspective). Data on tumor characteristics were collected from the pathology reports. The associations were examined using hierarchical binary logistic regressions.
Results
A total of 155 BC patients were enrolled. The median age was 52 years, with a range of 26–79; 95% were mothers; 28% had estrogen receptor (ER)-negative BC, 52% had progesterone receptor (PR)-negative BC, 48% had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative BC, and antigen Ki-67 ≥ 20% was reported for 52% of tumors. Statistically significant associations were found between the emotional markers (sense of motherhood failure, and lack of self-fulfillment), avoidance behavior, and physical symptoms that are related to emotional repression based on CM. Significant associations were also found between variables associated with physical symptoms of emotional repression, which involves the production and accumulation of non-substantial phlegm (i.e., “high-lipid Qi-like microscopic phlegm”), avoidance behavior which unconsciously uses “high-lipid Qi-like microscopic phlegm” in order to achieve emotional repression, and tumor parameters including tumor grade, PR status, and Ki-67. Patients with higher levels of “high-lipid Qi-like microscopic phlegm” were more likely to have tumors with worse prognosis (PR-negative, higher grade, and higher Ki-67).
Conclusion
We demonstrated a relationship between emotional parameters, behavioral tendencies, CM parameters, and oncologic parameters in BC. Additional research is warranted to explore these associations and their relevance to clinical practice.}

abstract = {Objective
A systematic review was conducted to investigate the efficacy of Guilu Erxian Jiao (GEJ) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA).
Methods
We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese Electronic Periodical Services, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify relevant randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, from the inception of each source to April 20, 2021. Primary outcome included overall efficacy, pain score, and Lequesne index score; secondary outcome included adverse events. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1.0). The meta-analysis was performed based on a random-effects model due to anticipated clinical heterogeneity. The grading of overall evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021233573).
Results
Eight studies were included. Compared to controls, GEJ exhibited superior overall efficacy for treating OA (risk ratio (RR) = 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06–1.35). Regarding pain score, there was no statistical difference between GEJ and controls (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.27; 95% CI = −0.91 – 1.46). No significant difference was found in Lequesne score between GEJ and controls (MD = −0.25; 95% CI = −0.52 – 0.01). No statistical difference in adverse reactions was observed between GEJ and controls (risk difference (RD) = −0.01; 95% CI = −0.05–0.03).
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that GEJ may have positive effects on overall efficacy in treating OA. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding pain score, Lequesne score, and knee joint function score.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Involvement of pharmacists and trainees in care transitions reduces medication-related problems. Participation in the transitions-of-care (TOC) process may impact self-perceived growth of autonomy within selected entrustable professional activities (EPAs).
Educational activity and setting
A student-driven TOC documentation process was implemented within an inpatient family medicine advanced pharmacy practice experience. During the month-long rotation, students rounded with an interdisciplinary care team. Responsibilities included ensuring accurate medication reconciliation at care transitions throughout hospitalization and prior to discharge as well as medication optimization during hospitalization. Another responsibility was completing a medication-specific TOC note in the clinic-based electronic health record at discharge for patients receiving primary care from the associated clinic. The note was available to the outpatient interdisciplinary care team during the hospital follow-up appointment. Student-perceived growth in autonomy within selected EPAs was determined through an online anonymous survey.
Findings
Ninety percent (n = 18) of eligible students completed the survey. For specific EPA statements (collecting information, establishing patient-centered goals and establishing a care plan, implementing a care plan, collaborating as an interdisciplinary team member, and ensuring immunization), student-perceived autonomy increased after involvement in this student-driven TOC process. During the study period, 215 notes were generated by student pharmacists and included interventions/recommendations within the following themes: evidence-based changes in therapy, patient counseling, and medication access.
Summary
The importance of pharmacist and pharmacy trainee involvement in the TOC process has been well-documented. Involving students in student-driven TOC documentation processes serves to facilitate student-perceived growth in autonomy within selected EPAs.}

abstract = {Summary
Matching the treatment to an individual patient’s tumor state can increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce tumor recurrence. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from solid tumors are promising subjects for theragnostic analysis. To analyze how CTCs represent tumor states, we established cell lines from CTCs, primary and metastatic tumors from a mouse model and provided phenotypic and multiomic analyses of these cells. CTCs and metastatic cells, but not primary tumor cells, shared stochastic mutations and similar hypomethylation levels at transcription start sites. CTCs and metastatic tumor cells shared a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal transcriptome state with reduced adhesive and enhanced mobilization characteristics. We tested anti-cancer drugs on tumor cells from a metastatic breast cancer patient. CTC responses mirrored the impact of drugs on metastatic rather than primary tumors. Our multiomic and clinical anti-cancer drug response results reveal that CTCs resemble metastatic tumors and establish CTCs as an ex vivo tool for personalized medicine.}

abstract = {Introduction: Health advocacy is an important skill for healthcare professionals to develop, but is challenging to teach. Here, we describe the development & evaluation of a curriculum to support healthcare professionals & trainees to develop as health advocates through advancing health equity across donation products for marginalized groups. Methods: We developed a transfusion medicine health equity & advocacy curriculum “Advancing a more inclusive blood and transplant system for marginalized groups”. This curriculum included two workshops focusing on advancing inclusion across donation products for 1) LGBTQIA+ & 2) racialized peoples. The first workshop, “Building a more inclusive blood and transplant system for LGBTQIA+ peoples” outlined blood, stem cell, & organ & tissue donation in Canada for gay, bisexual, & other men who have sex with men, starting from the historical policies & the context in which they were first put in place, to today's policies & where future policies may lie. The second workshop, “Addressing racial disparities in blood, stem cell, and organ & tissue donor pools”, outlined disparities in donor pools across donation products, barriers to donation impacting racialized/ ethnic populations, & structural racism in donation policies (i.e. policies which disproportionately impact racialized/ ethnic peoples). The workshops also presented content from national campaigns to engage LGBTQIA+ peoples (stemcellclub.ca/SavingLivesWithPride) & Black peoples (stemcellclub.ca/BlackDonorsSaveLives) to donation (Figure 1). Both workshops concluded with facilitated discussion groups supporting participants to reflect on donation policies for marginalized groups & their consequences, & how to help overcome barriers to donation. The curriculum was published to stemcellclub.ca/training & piloted with a national cohort of Canadian medical students. Quantitative & qualitative analyses (using a thematic analysis approach) were conducted to evaluate participants' perspectives on the impact of the workshop on their development as health advocates. Results: We hosted these workshops at 9 medical schools across Canada 10/2020-3/2023. 142 medical students participated, of whom 103/142 completed pre- & post- workshop surveys (73% response rate). 64/103 (62%) of survey respondents were female, 47/103 (46%) identified as racialized or LGBTQIA+, & 86/103 (83%) were pre-clerkship with 17/103 (17%) in clerkship. Results from quantitative & qualitative analyses of participants' perspectives on the role of these workshops in their development as health advocates are shown in Table 1A-B. Nearly all participants strongly agreed/ agreed the workshops supported their development as health advocates (101/103, 98%), including the abilities to: advocate for patients beyond the clinical environment; work with patients/ communities to address & identify determinants of health that affect them; respond to the needs of communities/ populations by advocating with them for system-level change; apply a process of continuous quality improvement to health promotion activities; & contribute to a process to improve the health of a community/ population they will serve. Nearly all felt that the workshop should be incorporated into medical curricula (99/103, 96%). Following each workshop, a subset of medical students (n = 38 for each) participated in focus groups to share their perspectives on what they learned. Qualitative analysis identified rich examples of participants' development as health advocates through their participation in the workshops, across the following themes: prioritize inclusion; recognize discrimination; understand barriers to change; collaborate with advocates from diverse communities to address disparities; & build a culture which supports inclusion. Conclusion: We present the first-ever curriculum in health equity in transfusion medicine to our knowledge, focusing on advancing inclusion across donation products & addressing disparities impacting patients & donors from marginalized groups. We also share the perspective of a national cohort of medical students in Canada that their participation in this curriculum contributed to their development as health advocates. This workshop is a model for teaching health advocacy to healthcare professionals & trainees, and is relevant to a wide audience across medicine.}

To characterize the racial/ethnic representation in the studies used in the American Urological Association/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine & Urogenital Reconstruction stress urinary incontinence guideline.
Methods
Cited studies were reviewed using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria focused on United States literature to allow for demographic comparison with census data. To compare the racial representation in a study to the diversity in the surrounding city, we calculated the differences between county census data and the study race reported data and performed regression analyses.
Results
Eighty-seven cited studies were reviewed, of which 33 were excluded and 52 studies were further evaluated. Seventeen studies were US studies, nine of which reported race. Eighty percent of the women included in the 9 studies were non-Hispanic white women. A diverse geographic region did not correlate with increased study enrollment of non-White patients.
Conclusion
The majority of cited studies used to develop the stress urinary incontinence management guidelines did not report the race/ethnicity of participants. Among those studies that did, Asian, Black, and Hispanic women were included at lower rates than non-Hispanic white women, identifying an area of opportunity to improve research recruitment and promote health equity. Non-Hispanic women were consistently overrepresented while other women were either under-represented or completely excluded.}

abstract = {Background
Based on the complex pathology of AD, a single chemical approach may not be sufficient to deal simultaneously with multiple pathways of amyloid-tau neuroinflammation. A polydrug approach which contains multiple bioactive components targeting multiple pathways in AD would be more appropriate. Here we focused on a Chinese medicine (HLXL), which contains 56 bioactive natural products identified in 11 medicinal plants and displays potent anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory activity.
Hypothesis/Purpose
We investigated the neuroimmune and neuroinflammation mechanisms by which HLXL may attenuate AD neuropathology. Specifically, we investigated the effects of HLXL on the neuropathology of AD using both transgenic mouse models as well as microglial cell-based models.
Study design
The 5XFAD transgenic animals and microglial cell models were respectively treated with HLXL and Aβ42, and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and then analyzed focusing on microglia mediated Aβ uptake and clearance, as well as pathway changes.
Methods
We showed that HLXL significantly reduced amyloid neuropathology by upregulation of microglia-mediated phagocytosis of Aβ both in vivo and in vitro. HLXL displayed multi-modal mechanisms regulating pathways of phagocytosis and energy metabolism.
Results
Our results may not only open a new avenue to support pharmacologic modulation of neuroinflammation and the neuroimmune system for AD intervention, but also identify HLXL as a promising natural medicine for AD.
Conclusion
It is conceivable that the traditional wisdom of natural medicine in combination with modern science and technology would be the best strategy in developing effective therapeutics for AD.}

Herein, a type of biocompatible metal free carbon dots is prepared via a hydrothermal method which can exhibit peroxidase (POD)-like, catalase (CAT)-like and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activities. It has been found that the carbon dots have the capability to efficiently deplete the excessive ROS such as peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O2−) and hydroxyl radical (OH) for their abundant functional groups. After the tail injection in mice with liver inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide, the carbon dots efficiently reduced the excessive production of ROS and proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. Both in vitro and in vivo results endowed the biocompatible carbon dots with great potential in nanocatalytic medicine for the treatment of disease.}

Within this domain, Terpinen-4-ol (T-4-ol), a bioactive monoterpene alcohol and the major constituent of tea tree oil (TTO), has made its way into translational research. Recent literature on T-4-ol strongly indicates its diverse pharmacological properties, including but not limited to antimicrobial, antivirulent, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and anti-cancer effects. Hence, this review is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of the sources, bioavailability, safety, pharmaceutical delivery systems, and multifaceted biological properties of T-4-ol, emphasizing its medicinal potential for widescale application. The antibacterial and antifungal effectiveness of T-4-ol has been discussed, encompassing its role in combating a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens. The review delves into the antivirulent prospects of T-4-ol, shedding light on its ability to attenuate virulence and mitigate bacterial pathogenesis. Scientific literature on the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of T-4-ol highlighting its role in neutralizing reactive oxygen species and modulating inflammatory pathways has also been collated. Furthermore, the review elaborates on the cardioprotective and anti-hypertensive properties of T-4-ol and augments literature on its anti-cancer mechanism against various cancer cell lines. The review also provides in-depth knowledge of the pharmaceutical formulations of T-4-ol and recent knowledge about its application in clinical/field trials. The exploration of these diverse attributes positions T-4-ol as a promising candidate for further research and therapeutic repurposing in various biomedical applications.}

abstract = {Introduction
There is widespread use of Aloe species in traditional healing practices in East Africa for a variety of diseases. Unfortunately, there is a tendency of mistakenly referring to all species of the genus Aloe as Aloe vera, despite the diversity of aloes in the region. The names for the different Aloe species in local languages are usually the same for the different species.
Aim
The aim of this review was to assess the medicinal uses of the indigenous little-known and other popular Aloe species in East Africa.
Methods
Relevant articles, books, theses, dissertations, patents, and other English-only reports on the ethnobotany, traditional medicinal uses, pharmacological or biological activity, toxicity, phytochemistry, trade, conservation, etymology, and distribution of aloe species in East Africa (Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, and Burundi) were reviewed. Databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and search engines such as Google Scholar, were searched between May and September 2020. Scientific names and synonyms of the aloe species were verified and resolved using Plants of the World Online (POWO, http://powo.science.kew.org/).
Results
Forty-nine of the over 180 Aloe species known in East Africa, are traditionally used for treating various ailments. Most of the Aloe species (85.7%) had direct references to their use in traditional medicine. Thirty-six species (73.5%) had some form of phytochemical analysis performed on them. Most of the Aloe species (67.3%) have never been investigated for any biological activity. The distinctive constituents in aloe leaves are phenolic compounds including chromone, anthraquinone or anthrone derivatives. Aloe aageodonta, A. ballyi, and A. christianii are known to be poisonous to humans when used in high doses, despite being used in traditional medicine. Aloe elgonica, A. ferox, and A. lateritia are all highly toxic to brine shrimp, whereas A. macrosiphon, A. vera, and A. volkensii cause a wide range of toxic side effects, such as bloody diarrhoea, dehydration, kidney damage, miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, and acute renal failure, when used for long periods and in high doses.
Conclusion
Several Aloe species are used in East Africa for treating various ailments. However, most of the local Aloe species have not been scientifically investigated for their biological activity, as well as their toxicity.}

abstract = {Clonal diversity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) plays a key role in poor therapeutic outcomes. AML cells usually accumulate spontaneous DNA damage including highly toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by metabolic products and replication stress. To repair numerous DSBs and survive, AML cells activate the DNA damage response (DDR) involving the pathways that sense (ATM and ATR kinases) and repair (RAD51-mediated homologous recombination = HR, RAD52-mediated transcription associated homologous recombination = TA-HR and single strand annealing = SSA, DNA-PK -mediated non-homologous end-joining = NHEJ, PARP1/Polq-dependent microhomology-mediated end-joining = MMEJ) DSBs. Thus, DDR is a legitimate therapeutic target. Numerous AML-driving mutations [ FLT3(ITD), TETmut, DNMT3Amut, AML1-ETO, PML-RARa , IDH1mut, cKITmut] regulate DDR and affect the sensitivity of leukemia cells to DDR inhibitors (DDRi). The genetic landscape of malignant clones in a patient may be complicated since individual clones can carry multiple mutations. Thus, individual AML clones may respond differently to DDRi depending on their mutational profile. In our experimental protocol AML cells from individual patients were treated with various DDRi followed by single-cell targeted DNA sequencing (sctDNA-seq) to integrate patient's leukemia clonal composition with response to the inhibitors. We developed a sctDNA-seq myeloid platform interrogating up to 1394 genetic variants of 54 known leukemia driver genes, which unraveled the clonal landscape of AML at a single-cell resolution before and after the treatment. Based on these results we designed a “clonal attack”, a patient-tailored combination of DDRi targeting all AML clones in a patient sample. Here we show that DDRi simultaneously attacking different clones caused clonal attrition and eradicated the disease in vitro and in vivo. For example, in AML-MD2 sample 2 clones carrying EZH2(V679M) + TET2(L1721W) and EZH2(V679M) + TET2(L1721W) + FLT3(D835Y) were resistant/less responsive to ATRi but sensitive to PARPi, ATMi and RAD52i. Conversely, three other clones carrying EZH2(V679M) + TET2(L1721W) + RUNX1(D160Y), EZH2(V679M) + TET2(L1721W) + RUNX1(D160Y) + EZH2(E54*) and EZH2(V679M) + TET2(L1721W) + RUNX1(D160Y)EZH2(E54*) + BCOR1(R1334Tfs*32) + NRAS(G13R) were sensitive to ATRi while less responsive to PARPi, ATMi and RAD52i. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that simultaneous treatment with ATRi + PARPi or ATRi + ATMi should result in elimination of all AML-MD2 clones. In agreement with this hypothesis, in vitro treatment with these combinations was 20 - 30x more effective in eliminating clonogenic growth of Lin-CD34+ AML-MD2 cells when compared to individual inhibitors. This effect was associated with abundant accumulation of DSBs. Combinations of these inhibitors were only modestly toxic to normal hematopoietic cells. Moreover, combination of DDRi displaying similar clonal targeting specificity was only 2x better than individual inhibitors. Next, humanized NRGS immunodeficient mice bearing primary AML-MD2 xenograft were treated with vehicle, PARPi, ATRi and the combination of these drugs. We found that individual treatments reduced the number of hCD45+ AML-MD2 cells in bone marrow and spleen by approximately 2x and 3x, respectively. Remarkably, the combination of PARPi + ATRi eliminated more than 99% of leukemia cells in bone marrows of 7/10 mice and in spleens of 10/10 mice while no obvious toxicity was observed. Clonal targeting by DDR inhibitors, however, may not be applicable to all AML samples. For example, we identified AML patient samples, where clones displayed similar sensitivity pattern or were resistant to DDRi treatment. In conclusion, we postulate that sctDNA-seq combined with in vitro DDRi sensitivity testing (sctDNA-seq/DDRi) is a powerful tool to interrogate clonal sensitivity of AML to these agents. This clonal medicine approach may become a novel therapeutic regimen to overcome clonal complexity of AML in a cohort of patients. The “clonal attack” by DDR inhibitors shifts the paradigm of genotoxic therapies from those using non-discriminative cytotoxic drugs to those selectively attacking DDR vulnerabilities in AML clones with minimal harm to normal cells. Since clonal heterogeneity and DNA damage are hallmarks of cancer, the “clonal attack” may be broadly applicable to the quest for cancer cure.}

Consequently, there has been a call for reform and an urgency for change in legal, political, economic, and healthcare spheres. Change only occurs through change, with a pivotal point to target the beginning stages in life which will have a greater likelihood to subsist throughout the lifecourse. The crossroads of healthy living medicine (HLM) and education are an appropriate context for necessary change. If healthy living medicine is to embody the ideals of social justice, then people need equal access to resources of well-being – physical, social, and emotional – in their school systems. This paper examines the current intersection of health and social justice within the school systems in the United States. It is both a critique of how school systems have not yet provided such an intersection and highlight those efforts that have proven valuable and successful in providing HLM resources to populations that are historically under-resourced and under-served. Ultimately, this paper looks to provide a path forward, providing ideas for sustainable, feasible, actionable change in school systems K-12 and in higher education.}

Despite the noteworthy interests of scientists to manufacture oral therapeutic medicines, poor solubility/bioavailability of orally-administered drugs remains a big challenge in recent years. Therefore, various scientists are trying to develop novel techniques to enhance the solubility of orally-administered therapeutic agents. One of the promising ways, which has recently attracted the global attentions is the use of supercritical fluids (SCFs). This technique could overcome the unfavorable/detrimental influences of organic solvents on the environment due to its environmentally-benign characteristics, non-inflammability and low toxicity. In this research, the solubility of Exemestane (EXE) drug is modeled based on two parameters of temperature and pressure. In order to handle the modeling process, the AdaBoost method with three core models of linear regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Gaussian Process (GPR) are considered, which are tuned by AEO method in terms of their hyper-parameters. Based on the evaluations carried out in this research, ADA GPR, ADA KNN, and ADA LR models showed 0.996, 0.991, and 0.925 values in terms of R-square score. Also, in terms of the error rate, the three models ADA GPR, ADA KNN, and ADA LR have an RMSE error equal to 1.3459, 1.8967, and 5.8875, respectively. Based on these facts and some other analyses, the Gaussian process model optimized and boosted with AdaBoost can be accepted as the most accurate model of this research.}

Tinea (ringworm) is a highly infectious and commonly presenting pediatric condition. Standard care in rural Kenya is costly, associated with side effects, becoming less effective, and not always available. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of testing and using the homeopathic medicine Bacillinum for tinea.
Methods
Children were recruited from two rural schools in Kenya. Inclusion criteria were: a clinical diagnosis of tinea and a positive Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) smear test. Children were alternately allocated to receive 28-day courses of standard treatment, or Bacillinum 12C. Outcomes measured were KOH smear test status, and tinea status according to Clinician Assessment Questionnaire (CAQ) completed by the child and the clinician. Tests were performed at baseline, 1, 2, and 6 months.
Results
110 children received clinical diagnoses of tinea, of whom 50 had negative KOH tests, one no show, and 10 were outside the age range. 49 were allocated alternately to standard treatment or Bacillinum. At 56 days, 64% receiving standard treatment and 56% receiving Bacillinum had negative KOH tests. At 6 months, 36% receiving standard treatment and 63% receiving Bacillinum had negative KOH tests. Flexibility was required to accommodate school timetable changes and carers living far away. The KOH smear test and clinical diagnosis frequently disagreed.
Conclusion
Bacillinum is a low cost, easily administered intervention which may potentially improve long-term tinea status and reduce relapse incidence. Given tinea prevalence and problems with standard treatment, a randomised controlled trial is warranted. Long-term effects and tinea re-occurrence should be measured.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a serious public health challenge in the world. According to the treatment instructions by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2020, bronchiectasis combine with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting anti-muscarinic agents were recommended as the main prescription. However, this symptomatic treatment still has ineluctable limits because it ignored the most pathogenesis mechanism of COPD. As an alternative traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for COPD, Bufei Jianpi granules (BJG) can reduce the frequency and duration of acute exacerbation in COPD patients and improve their quality of life. The evidence demonstrated BJG acts as therapeutics that retarding the airway remodeling process, eliminating phlegm, thrombolysis and improving mitochondrial function. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is still urgently revealed.
Purpuse
In this study, we aim to find out the active pharmacodynamic ingredients and reveal the treatment mechanism of active pharmacodynamic ingredients.
Methods
Based on the pharmacodynamic evaluation and chemomic profiling of BJG in COPD rats, an integrated multi-omics analysis was performed, including molecular networking, metabonomics, proteomics and bioinformatics. Moreover, focus on the active compounds, we verified the molecular core mechanism by molecular biology methods.
Results
Pachymic acid, shionone, peiminine and astragaloside A was verified as therapeutic agents for improving the condition of COPD by acting on the EGFR, ERK1, PAI-1 and p53 target, respectively.
Conclusion
In this study, our findings indicated that some compounds in BJG alleviates the pathological process of COPD, which is related to regulating lung function, mucus production, pulmonary embolism and energy metabolism and this will be a benefit complementary to GOLD guidelines.}

abstract = {Introduction
Mitochondria are maternally inherited cell organelles with their own genome, and perform various functions in eukaryotic cells such as energy production and cellular homeostasis. Due to their inheritance and manifold biological roles in health and disease, mitochondrial genetics serves a dual purpose of tracing the history as well as disease susceptibility of human populations across the globe. This work requires a comprehensive catalogue of commonly observed genetic variations in the mitochondrial DNAs for all regions throughout the world. So far, however, certain regions, such as North and East Africa have been understudied.
Objectives
To address this shortcoming, we have created the most comprehensive quality-controlled North and East African mitochondrial data set to date and use it for characterizing mitochondrial genetic variation in this region.
Methods
We compiled 11 published cohorts with novel data for mitochondrial genomes from 159 Sudanese individuals. We combined these 641 mitochondrial sequences with sequences from the 1000 Genomes (n = 2504) and the Human Genome Diversity Project (n = 828) and used the tool haplocheck for extensive quality control and detection of in-sample contamination, as well as Nanopore long read sequencing for haplogroup validation of 18 samples.
Results
Using a subset of high-coverage mitochondrial sequences, we predict 15 potentially novel haplogroups in North and East African subjects and observe likely phylogenetic deviations from the established PhyloTree reference for haplogroups L0a1 and L2a1.
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate common hitherto unexplored variants in mitochondrial genomes of North and East Africa that lead to novel phylogenetic relationships between haplogroups present in these regions. These observations call for further in-depth population genetic studies in that region to enable the prospective use of mitochondrial genetic variation for precision medicine.}

The macroscopic parameters, histological analysis and measurement of inflammatory markers and mediators were evaluated. HdLP did not exhibit cytotoxicity and did not induce skin irritation. HdLP stimulated the release of IL-1β at the beginning of the inflammatory phase. This effect probably favored the earlier release of IL-10 by macrophages, during the proliferative phase. The shortening and completeness of healing were characterized by fibroblast proliferation and the presence of newly synthesized collagen fibers.

abstract = {External interventions are required to restore the body’s function when it is challenged beyond its natural healing ability by critical size defects. As a result, regenerative medicine techniques are being developed to regenerate or repair tissues and organs to circumvent the limitations of conventional grafts being used for tissue/organ repair. This article focuses on tissue engineering techniques for bone regeneration. Specifically, we discuss some of the designs and techniques employed by researchers to engineer scaffolds with improved mechanical properties capable of maintaining the mechanical and structural integrity of bone defects. We also review some of the optimization strategies for improving in situ mechanical integrity of bone defects as the tissue-engineered bone evolves.}

This definition excludes the conduct of the operation/procedure itself but encompasses the medical care of patients before, during, and after the procedure. Taking advantage of the whole pathway from first contemplation of surgery until full recovery offers numerous opportunities to improve clinical outcomes and experience of care both directly, in relation to the surgery, and in relation to the patient's health generally.}

1. Identify experiences that affect professional identity formation of hospice and palliative medicine physicians. 2. Construct a preliminary model for professional identity formation in hospice and palliative medicine.
Original Research Background
The transformative evolution of becoming a hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) physician requires learners to integrate knowledge from prior training while learning to “think, act, and feel” like a palliative care physician. The drivers of professional identity formation (PIF) among HPM physicians are not well understood, and their impact on training is unknown. This study aims to identify factors that affect the PIF of HPM physicians.
Research Objectives
Identify experiences that affect PIF for HPM physicians. Construct a preliminary model for PIF in HPM.
Methods
In this qualitative study, we conducted semistructured interviews with fellowship-trained HPM physicians practicing in the Southwest. We performed thematic analysis using NVivo software (QSR International) in an iterative, team-based process.
Results
We interviewed 10 HPM fellowship-trained physicians who were non-Hispanic White (100%), 70% female and 30% male, and coming from 5 primary disciplines (internal, family, and emergency medicine, surgery, and pediatrics). Our preliminary analysis identified 3 key themes that affect PIF for HPM physicians: formal curriculum, interactions with interdisciplinary team members (particularly chaplains and social workers), and role models and mentors. Participants spoke extensively about role models including attendings, other clinicians, department leadership, faculty, and co-fellows who were supportive and patient-centered, modeled good communication, were compassionate, and encouraged learning.
Conclusion
Interviewees were universally influenced in their PIF by supportive and patient-centered role models from various backgrounds and disciplines throughout training. Formal didactics and communication curriculum were also key ingredients in becoming a palliateur across participants.
Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice
HPM is a relatively new specialty,and information gained from this study can provide a model for PIF in palliative medicine, can serve as groundwork for HPM fellowship training curriculum and educator development, and can aid HPM educators in nurturing PIF among learners.}
