abstract = {Diseases cause perturbation of the host’s immune system in which genes, proteins, and metabolites are involved. While genes are regulated by epigenetic or other host factors, proteins undergo posttranslational modifications to exhibit its functionality. As a result, it becomes difficult to correlate the disease phenotype based on genetic and proteomic information only. Metabolites provide direct information on the biochemical activity during diseased state. Therefore metabolites can be considered as phenotypic signature of a diseased state. Measuring metabolites in large scale falls under the omics technology known as metabolomics. Metabolic profiling in biological fluids can be used as biomarkers of disease or drug response. In addition, metabolomics together with genomics can be used to differentiate patients with differential treatment response. Thus metabolomics can be used as biomarker for patient stratification and personalized drug formulation. However, these are complicated steps and identification of a robust biomarker requires involvement of multidisciplinary fields ranging from technological development, involvement of researchers from computer science, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and validation of data among different demographic regions. In this chapter we discuss different technologies that are used for detection of different metabolites and challenges associated with implementation of the technique for personalized medicine.}

abstract = {Isolation of oogonial stem cells and their application In 2004, Johnson et al. reported findings suggesting oocyte regeneration in the adult mouse ovary, and several research groups from around the world have reported the possibility that oogonial stem cells (OSCs) exist in the ovary after birth. In 2012, White et al. isolated OSCs from human frozen ovarian tissue. When GFP-labeled human OSCs were injected into human ovarian tissue fragments and these tissue fragments were xenotransplanted into mice, primordial follicles with flat cells surrounding GFP-positive cells were observed. For ethical and legal reasons, oocytes derived from human OSCs could not be fertilized with human sperm, but when GFP-labeled mouse OSCs were injected into the ovaries of infertile mice, pups expressing GFP were obtained. In the future, it may be possible to safely obtain many mature oocytes by isolating OSCs from frozen ovarian tissue, growing them in an in vitro culture system that does not contain cancer cells, inducing differentiation in an artificial ovary in vitro, and reimplanting them in the remaining gonadal tissue. On the other hand, germline stem cells and granulosa cells derived from ES and iPS cells, as well as OSCs derived from ovarian tissue, are expected to be applied to reproductive medicine. Isolation of endometrial stem cells and their application To date, four kinds of endometrial stem cells (eSC) are identified in the endometrium; epithelial stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (eMSC), side population stem cells, and very small embryonic-like stem cells. Although the specific role of eSCs has not been investigated so far, intrauterine transplantation of eMSCs derived from menstrual blood flow has been reported to increase endometrial thickness in humans. Future studies on the functional mechanisms of eMSCs in the development of endometrial disorders would be beneficial for the treatment of damaged endometrium.}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) placed additional strain on an already struggling health care system. In response, novel solutions such as telehealth have been explored, however, there is significant room for innovation in health care delivery.
Objectives
The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a drive-through medical treatment system for evaluating patients with COVID-like symptoms.
Methods
We designed a prototype drive-through medical treatment facility (DMF) to triage large volumes of patients quickly and efficiently, while fully evaluating, treating, and discharging low-risk patients. A retrospective chart review was performed to extract clinical and logistical metrics.
Results
A total of 2164 patients were evaluated between May 1 and July 1, 2020. Overall accuracy for patient classification was 92.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.2–93.5%). Screening criteria resulted in a return with need for workup or admission rate of 0.25%, yielding a sensitivity of 83.3% (95% CI 65.3–94.4%). Of those presenting to the DMF, 179 patients (8.3%) were diverted to the main emergency department (ED) for further evaluation, of which 14% received diagnostic workups and 5% subsequent admission to an inpatient service, yielding a specificity of 92.8% (95% CI 91.7– 93.9%). Length of stays for those seen in the DMF vs. the main ED (M = 38 min vs 149 min) yielded a mean difference of 111 min per encounter and a total time savings of 3762 h.
Conclusion
Drive-through medical systems can accurately triage patients presenting with potential COVID-19 and effectively treat lower-risk patients, thereby reducing ED utilization.}

abstract = {Objective
The intestinal absorption characteristics of active ingredients are very important for oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. However, a deeper understanding about active ingredients absorption characteristics is still lack. The aim of this study was to investigate the absorption properties and mechanism of rhubarb active ingredients in TCM preparation and pure form.
Methods
The intestinal absorption behavior of active ingredients in Shenkang extract (SKE) and rhubarb anthraquinone ingredients (RAI) were investigated by in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model. And the bidirectional transport characteristics of these active ingredients were assessed by in vitro Caco-2 cell monolayer model.
Results
In situ experiment on Sprague-Dawley rats, the effective permeability coefficient values of aloe-emodin, emodin and chrysophanol in RAI were higher than those in SKE, and the value of rhein in RAI was lower than that in SKE. But the easily absorbed segments of intestine were consistent for all ingredients, whether in SKE or in RAI. In vitro experiment, the apparent permeability coefficient values of rhein, emodin and chrysophanol in RAI were higher than those in SKE, and this value of aloe-emodin in RAI was lower than that in SKE. But their efflux ratio (ER) values in SKE and RAI were all similar.
Conclusion
Four rhubarb anthraquinone ingredients in SKE and RAI have similar absorption mechanism and different absorption behavior, and the microenvironment of the study models influenced their absorption behavior. The results may provide an aid for understanding of the absorption characteristics of the TCM active ingredients in complex environments and the complementarities of different research models.}

This chapter discusses how two ancient medical systems, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda (from India) bring a unique perspective on care of the mother during this unique and pivotal time. Both traditions emphasize a period of preparing the body for pregnancy prior to a planned pregnancy as a way to prevent complications, to maximize health of the mother, and even enhance the future health of the child. TCM refers to this as “tilling the soil before planting the seed.” During pregnancy, both traditions emphasize the mother taking care of her food, drink, daily activities and routine, and emotions to restore and maintain balance in her system, according to the criteria of TCM or Ayurveda. Uses, risks, and research on acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, and Ayurvedic herbs are discussed for various conditions including threatened or recurrent miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, diabetes, obesity, low back pain, neck pain, headache, pelvic pain, breech presentation, anxiety and depression, hypertension and preeclampsia, preparing for labor, and postpartum recovery.}

abstract = {Objectives
Older surgical patients frequently develop postoperative complications due to their frailty and multiple comorbidities. Geriatric medicine consultation helps to optimize risk factors and improve outcomes in patients with hip fracture. This study aimed to evaluate patient outcomes before and after comanagement model implementation between geriatric medicine (Geriatric Surgical Service) and vascular surgery services.
Design
This was a case-control study involving emergency vascular surgical patients who were comanaged by vascular surgery, geriatric medicine, and geriatric nursing services.
Settings and Participants
This study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Singapore from 2015 to 2018 with acute vascular surgical patients aged older than 65 years.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of 135 patients from 2013 to 2014 (control group) who fulfilled the criteria for the comanagement model was compared with a prospective cohort of 348 patients who were comanaged by a geriatric surgical service from 2015 to 2018, and a further subgroup analysis of patients between 2015 and 2016 (n = 150) (early intervention group) and between 2017 and 2018 (n = 198) (late intervention group) was performed.
Results
Comanaged patients had a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (11.6 vs 20.8 days, P = .001), reduced nosocomial infections (3% vs 12% for urinary tract infection, P = .003) and decreased 30-day readmission rates (22% vs 34%, P = .011). A trend of a decreased incidence of fluid overload was noted in patients comanaged with the geriatric surgical service (3% vs 7%, P = .073). Subgroup analysis showed progressive reductions in the length of stay (15.4 vs 11.6 days, P = .001), 30-day readmission rate (35% vs 22%, P = .01), and nosocomial urinary tract infection (8% vs 3%, P = .003) between the early intervention group and the late intervention group. Although they were not statistically significant, reductions were also observed in the delirium rate (13% vs 11%) and other postoperative medical complications in the early intervention group and the late intervention group.
Conclusion and Implications
Despite having increasing comorbidities, older vascular surgical inpatients had a significantly shorter length of stay, reduced nosocomial infections, and decreased 30-day readmission rates through a comanagement model with vascular surgery and geriatric medicine services. Improvements in outcomes were observed over time as the model of care evolved. Geriatric medicine intervention in the perioperative period improves the outcomes of older acute vascular surgical patients.}

abstract = {Pharmacy service is to provide individualized pharmaceutical care for patients, which should follow the current evidence-based pharmacy, and constantly verify the evidence and then produce new evidence. In pharmaceutical care, differences are often found in the efficacy and adverse reactions of drugs among individuals, even within individuals, which are closely related to patient's genetics, liver and kidney functions, disease states, and drug interactions. Back in the 1980s, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been applied to routinely monitor the blood drug concentration of patients taking antiepileptic drugs or immunosuppressants after transplantation to provide individualized dosage recommendations and accumulate a large amount of pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) data. As individualized pharmaceutical care proceeds, the concept of precision medicine was introduced into pharmacy services in combination with evidence-based pharmacy, PK/PD theories and big data to further promote the TDM technology and drugs, and carry out pharmacogenomics analysis. The TDM and pharmacogenomics have been applied gradually to the fields of antimicrobial, antitumor and antipsychotic drugs and immunosuppressants. Based on the concept of precision pharmacy, we adpoted approaches including PK/PD, quantitative pharmacology, population pharmacokinetics, and big data machine learning to provide more personalized pharmacy services, which is mainly for special patients, such as critical patients, patients with interaction risk of multiple drugs, patients with liver and renal insufficiency, pregnant women, children and elderly patients. As the service pattern of precision pharmacy has been constructed and constantly improved, better evidence in clinical practice will be produced to provide patients with better precision pharmacy service.
Resumen
El servicio de farmacia se encarga de prestar atención farmacéutica personalizada a los pacientes. Los servicios de farmacia deben utilizar aquellas prácticas con mayor nivel de evidencia, y realizar una continua validación de dicha evidencia antes de elaborar nuevas prácticas. En la terapia farmacológica, se observan diferencias inter e intra individuales respecto a los efectos terapéuticos y a las reacciones adversas de los medicamentos, lo que está estrechamente relacionado con las variaciones genéticas, la función hepática y renal, el estado de la enfermedad y la interacción entre medicamentos. Desde la década de los 80 del siglo pasado, se utiliza la monitorización terapéutica de fármacos (MTF) de forma rutinaria para controlar las concentraciones sanguíneas de fármacos antiepilépticos o de inmunosupresores postrasplante y elaborar recomendaciones de dosis personalizadas y recoger una gran cantidad de datos farmacocinéticos (PC)/farmacodinámicos (PD). Con el desarrollo de la atención farmacéutica personalizada, el concepto de medicina de precisión se introduce en la atención farmacéutica, combinando la farmacia basada en evidencias, los enfoques PC/PD y los macrodatos (big data), promover técnicas de MTF en medicamentos, y la realización de análisis farmacogenómicos. La MTF y la farmacogenómica se están aplicando de forma gradual en el tratamiento con antimicrobianos, antitumorales, antipsicóticos e inmunosupresores. Sobre la base del concepto de farmacia de precisión, utilizamos métodos de PC/PD, farmacología cuantitativa, farmacocinética poblacional y aprendizaje automático con big data para ofrecer una atención farmacéutica más personalizada, principalmente a pacientes con necesidades especiales, como los pacientes en estado crítico, con riesgo de interacciones farmacológicas múltiples, pacientes con insuficiencia hepática y renal, mujeres embarazadas, niños y ancianos. Con la construcción y mejora continua del modelo de servicio de farmacia de precisión, la generación de evidencia científica sobre la práctica clínica mejorará y eso redundará en un mejor servicio de farmacia de precisión para los pacientes.}

Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) examination indicated most of pannus in the skin tissue of chilblain rats had disappeared, and the local inflammatory cells were also greatly reduced when given nifedipine at 15.0 mg/kg/d. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that nifedipine inhibited release of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and VEGF in serum. The RT-PCR analysis showed that nifedipine down regulated mRNA levels of TRPC-6 and VEGF in skin tissue. Furthermore, immunohistochemical examination showed nifedipine inhibited expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α inflammatory protein and further inhibited expression of TRP (transient receptor potential) family proteins TRPM-7, TRPC-1, TRPC-3 and TRPC-6 and reduced expression of VEGF in skin and relieved erythema and oedema.

Currently, laser-activated silk sealant agent without suture and gauze has been demonstrated promising for fast skin repair taking advantage of its structural transformation after heating. Nevertheless, more efficient healing effects and less side effects of laser-activated silk sealant agent remains challenging due to absence of suitable photo-thermal materials and robust/biomimetic protein materials. In this work, the marriage between silk protein and Rehmanniae radix preparata (a kind of the traditional Chinese herb) has been demonstrated as a novel and effective way to achieve an excellent healing effect for skin repair.

This new methodology might shed a new light for combining dark traditional Chinese medicine and silk fibroin for advanced wound healing technology.}

abstract = {Introduction
Formal communication skills training programs for practicing healthcare providers have increasingly been implemented. However, transfer and sustainment of these communication skills into daily clinical practice can be challenging. The uptake of novel communication skills may vary depending on clinician specialty and clinical context. Post-workshop coaching has been identified as one approach which helps support providers integrate workshop communication skills into their workplace interactions with patients. The current study examines post-workshop coaching feedback to identify differences in the uptake of communication skills across medical specialties.
Methods
Trained communication coaches observed healthcare providers (including physicians, advanced nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) 30 and 60 days after they participated in a communication skills workshop. Coaches provided written and verbal feedback to each provider on their use of workshop skills. Content analysis was applied to written feedback reports to compare which skills clinicians had effectively incorporated into their patient interactions and how this varied by provider’s medical specialty, discipline, and gender.
Results
All participating providers (N=85) demonstrated improvement in use of skills following the workshop and coaching sessions, with more improvement at 60 days post workshop. Primary care specialties (family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics) were more successfully able to integrate skills such as agenda setting and teachback into their clinical practice than surgical and medical subspecialties. Utilization and sustainment of skills was comparable across gender and across disciplines (physician vs. non-physician).
Discussion
Preliminary study Findings: demonstrate that a program combining a communication skills workshop and coaching can be effective in improving and refining practicing healthcare providers’ communication skills. Potential challenges in specific clinical contexts and disciplines on effective uptake of skills, such as agenda setting and teachback, deserve further study. This research can inform the development of specialty-focused interventions that better support translation of these skills into diverse clinical practice settings.}

abstract = {Regenerative medicine has gained significant interest over the past decades due to its remarkable efficiency to repair and regenerate damaged tissues using engineered biomaterials. Appropriate cellular responses can be triggered by rationally tuning the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. Attractive surface features, porosity, and tensile strength are prerequisites for the regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In this regard, 3D bioprinting has come up as a promising technology that enables the fabrication of complex and precise tissue structures by stacking materials layer by layer. This chapter gives a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the area of 3D bioprinting-driven solutions to produce customizable and defect-fillable scaffolds for tissue regeneration. This technology attractively allows for the simultaneous or separate printing of biocompatible materials and bioactive molecules for enhancing scaffold functionality that can save patients suffering from the current shortage of transplantable organs. Applications of the 3D printing have been extended to diverse organs like the bone, cartilage, heart valves, liver, and skin. Biophysical qualities of 3D-printed biomaterials help to mimic the tissue microenvironment to promote cell adhesion, infiltration, proliferation, and differentiation. Several nanocomposite-based bioinks have been developed to modulate the topography, charge, size, electrostatic interactions, and stiffness that play a vital role in their biological response. In view of this background, nano-based 3D-printed biomaterials may serve as a promising alternative to the conventional therapy, thereby, revolutionizing regenerative and translational medicine.}

Disparities in access to ASCT have been reported but studies analyzing the reasons are sparse. We found only one such study done by Hyun D et al at Grady Memorial hospital where established clinical criteria and poor functional status were the leading causes of non-referral for ASCT. Objectives: To analyze reasons limiting access to ASCT in CNSL. Design: Retrospective cohort including patients from 06/15/1999-04/05/2022. Setting: Tertiary oncologic center. Patients: 71 CNSL patients, median age at diagnosis 63 years, Asians 5.7%, Blacks 32.8%, Hispanic 37%, White 12.8%, American Indians 0.1% and Others 10%. 17.1% of the patients were HIV positive. Methods: Electronic chart review. Results: 32.8% (23/70) of CNSL patients received ASCT. HIV-positive status was associated with poor ECOG performance status at diagnosis (p=0.03). 47/70 patients were not offered ASCT because 14 (29.7%) had poor baseline functional status at diagnosis, functional status of 5 (10.6%) patients deteriorated after induction therapy, 6 (12.7%) refused ASCT, 3 (6.3%) were non-compliant with treatment, and for 2 (4.2%) patients provider chose different consolidation treatment, 1 died before ASCT could be done and 4 (8.5%) lost to follow-up and unknown reason for 12 (25.5%) patients. HIV-positive status was significantly associated with decreased access to ASCT in the logistic regression model (p=0.01). Majority of HIV-positive patients did not receive ASCT due to poor performance status (41.7%). 62.5% of HIV-positive patients with uncontrolled disease didn't receive ASCT due to poor performance status. Those with controlled HIV refused ASCT (50%) or were not offered ASCT (50%) due to non-compliance. Access to ASCT was not affected by socioeconomic status or race/ethnicity. Conclusions: In our population, ASCT was not offered to patients for medical reasons like poor functional status rather than socioeconomic reasons. However socioeconomic factors could be responsible for poor functional status. HIV status was also a significant factor for limited access to ASCT. Further evaluations are needed to identify modifiable factors that can improve referral and assess the impact of ASCT in CNSL.}

They reproduce to make better offspring, enabled to fight against the odds in nature to become the fittest survivor. Infertility, unable to give birth to a live child, is one of the burning problems in the present era worldwide; around 12% of women in the United States have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a full-term pregnancy at their fertile age. The infertility issues with men are less in percentage among heterosexual couples, however, it is significant. Modern biomedical research and technology have improved significantly to diagnose the majority of infertility issues with fruitful remedies. Among them, the in vitro fertilization technique has been moderately successful in time (∼30% of individual attempts), but the success rate is still improving. Nevertheless, usage of ‘herbal medicines sometimes is ignorantly beneficial to improve the outcome of assisted reproduction, either by supplementing the conventional medical treatment and/or by mitigating the mental health of the futile patients under distress. Various herbal medicines have been utilized over the years as adjuvant therapies, depending on ethnicity and cultural diversity. Overall, the quality of evidence for herbal medicines in assisted reproduction is poor due to the lack of randomized controlled trials and scientific analyses; moreover, population-based qualitative studies are often misleading. This chapter is dedicated to discussing the pre-clinical and clinical evidence, underlying the potentiality of herbal medicines/phytochemicals to treat male and female infertility.}

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) was used for profiling and identification of the main phytochemical constituents from leaf extracts (MeOH 90%, DCM, EtOAc, n-BuOH, n-hexane and residue) of C. africana. Twenty-two constituents, comprising flavonoids, phenolic acids, hydroxycinnamic acid amides and lignanamides were identified. Most of the identified compounds are known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which could at least in part explain the traditional use of C. africana against skin disorders.}

Constriction was attributed to cell-attractive forces and involved better osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells than that of spheroids. This approach was scalable, and ∼2000 bone beads were prepared semi-automatically using a liquid dispenser and spinner flask. The mechanical stimuli in the spinner flask further improved the osteogenic differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells in the bone beads compared with that in static culture. Vascular endothelial cells readily attach to and cover the surface of bone beads. The in vitro assembly of the endothelial cell-enveloped bone beads resulted in microchannel formation in the interspaces between the bone beads. Significant effects of endothelialization on in vivo bone regeneration were shown in rats with cranial bone defects. The use of endothelialized bone beads may be a scalable and robust approach for treating large bone defects.
Statement of significance
A unique aspect of this study is that the hMSC-encapsulated collagen microgels were prepared through spontaneous constriction, leading to the enrichment of collagen and cell density. This constriction resulted in favorable microenvironments for the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, which is superior to conventional spheroid culture. The microgel beads were then enveloped with vascular endothelial cells and assembled to fabricate a tissue graft with vasculature in the interspaces among the beads. The significant effects of endothelialization on in vivo bone regeneration were clearly demonstrated in rats with cranial bone defects. We believe that microgel beads covered with vascular endothelial cells provide a promising approach for engineering better tissue grafts for bone-regenerative medicine.}

abstract = {Background
Communication with parents during pregnancy about complex congenital heart disease (CHD) can significantly influence parental understanding of, and psychological responses to, the diagnosis. Fetal cardiac consultations provide an important opportunity to optimize this communication. Prior research suggests words clinicians use to describe CHD, such as “heart difference” rather than “heart defect”, may be important to parents. However, little is known about the language used in fetal cardiac consultations.
Methods
Initial fetal cardiology consultations with parents for potentially complex CHD were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded by two independent coders. A codebook was inductively developed and applied to all transcripts. Coding differences were adjudicated to full agreement. The final coding framework was used to identify communication patterns and themes.
Findings
In the 19 audio-recorded consultations across five fetal cardiology clinicians at one academic institution, 14 different cardiac diagnoses were discussed (seven with low and seven with high risk of mortality). We identified three themes for language used to describe CHD: medical, plain, and patient-centered language. Each consultation utilized all three types of language with plain language used most frequently. Plain language often was used to define and emphasize the meaning behind medical language. While less frequently used, patient-centered language emphasized the child as a whole person with value and worth beyond their heart condition.
Discussion
Fetal cardiology clinicians in our study used plain language to define and describe medical language for parents. They employed patient-centered language to center counseling on the child rather than the pathology. Similar clinician language may help familiarize and empower parents with the tools to understand their child’s condition and communicate with their medical team. Future research should focus on clinicians’ communication intentions and the consequences of their language use on parents’ decision-making, psychological adjustment, mental health, and quality of life outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
The collimators in which the various geometrical configurations have been suggested to optimize the sensitivity and resolution have a key role in acquiring the qualified images in nuclear medicine towards a better recognition of some diseases.
Methods
In this study, a new configuration as a geometrical combination of the conical, cylindrical and spherical (CCS) volumes for parallel-hole collimators (PCs) which is investigated by using the volumetric-parametric method has been introduced to enhance point spread function (PSF). The obtained PSF is evaluated via collimators response, which is derived from a radioactive point source. The configuration was simulated by MCNPX code at different amounts of energy from the point source together with the traditional collimator which contained only the cylindrical volume.
Results
The PSF will transmogrify from a delta function to a distribution that can correlate to a Gaussian distribution while increasing the scattered gamma rays. The simulation results shown that the PSF in CCS configuration is narrower than that of the cylindrical one at all the energies, which led to an enhancement in the resolution. Also, the theoretical results were agreement with the simulated ones. The higher the energy amount of the source, the wider the PSF becomes due to the higher penetration and scattering potency. Also, the percentage of scattering and penetration (S+P)% of the CCS collimator was less than the conventional PC one because of more undesirable photons elimination in the annexed conical-spherical denticles. The better the qualified image had a narrower PSF.
Conclusion
The suggested geometry and method may also be used to determine the exact attenuation coefficient of absorbers.}

Clays have been used as early as 2500 BC in human civilization for medicinal purposes. The ease of availability, biocompatibility, and versatility of these unique charged 2D structures abundantly available in nature have enabled the extensive applications of clays in human history. Recent advances in the use of clays in nanostructures and as components of polymer clay nanocomposites have exponentially expanded the use of clays in medicine. This review covers the details of structures and biomedical applications of several common clays, including montmorillonite, LAPONITE®, kaolinite, and halloysite. Here we describe the applications of these clays in wound dressings as hemostatic agents in drug delivery of drugs for cancer and other diseases and tissue engineering. Also reviewed are recent experimental and modeling studies that elucidate the impact of clay structures on cellular processes and cell adhesion processes. Various mechanisms of clay-mediated bioactivity, including protein localization, modulation of cell adhesion, biomineralization, and the potential of clay nanoparticles to impact cell differentiation, are presented. We also review the current developments in understanding the impact of clays on cellular responses. This review also elucidates new emerging areas of use of nanoclays in osteogenesis and the development of in vitro models of bone metastasis of cancer.}

abstract = {Background
Alginate hydrogels have been widely used as wound healing materials because of their high water content, biocompatibility, and easy fabrication. However, it is still challenging to improve their bioactivities due to the inherently bioinert properties of alginate. Herein, we report a simple and effective method to fabricate a multifunctional alginate hydrogel (Alg@Rt) with anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities, by combining the advantages of alginate and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa leaves extract (Rt).
Methods
The hydrogel is prepared by simply mixing the solutions of alginate and Rt, using CaO2 as the crosslinker. The porous structure of hydrogel is evidenced by the scanning electron microscope. The swelling of the hydrogel was determined by comparing the difference in mass of samples immersed in physiological pH. The polyphenol release was determined by using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The in vitro anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities of the Alg@Rt hydrogel were evaluated and compared with the pure Alg hydrogel. The biocompatibility of hydrogels was evaluated towards fibroblasts.
Significant finding
A new injectable Alg@Rt hydrogel was developed to facilitate the wound healing process. Compared to the pure Alg hydrogel, Alg@Rt hydrogel significantly enhanced the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and cell proliferative activities, which is beneficial in wound treatment and tissue regenerative applications.}

Holistic fingerprinting at polysaccharide and the hydrolyzed oligosaccharide and monosaccharide levels utilized various chromatography methods, while OGD and OGD/R models on H9c2 cells were introduced to evaluate the protective effects on cell viability and mitochondrial function. Polysaccharides from six ginseng species exhibited remarkable content difference (RG > PG/ZZS/ZJS/PQ > PN), but weak differentiations in molecular weight distribution and oligosaccharide profiles, while Glc and GalA were richer for monosaccharide compositions of PG and RG polysaccharides, respectively. RG polysaccharides (25/50/100 μg/mL) showed significant cardiomyocyte protection by regulating mitochondrial functions. These new evidences may provide support for the supplementary role of polysaccharides in quality control of ginseng.}

Scarcity of lipids that are suitable for cell therapy, vaccination, and gene therapies continue to be a problem in advancing many potential diagnostic/therapeutic/vaccine candidates to the clinic. Herein, we describe the development of novel ionizable lipids to be used as functional excipients for designing vehicles for nucleic acid therapeutics/vaccines in vivo or ex vivo use in cell therapy applications. We first studied the transfection efficiency (TE) of LNP-based mRNA formulations of these ionizable lipid candidates in primary human T cells and established a workflow for engineering of primary immune T cells. We then adapted this workflow towards bioengineering of CAR constructs to T cells towards non-viral CAR T therapy. Lipids were also tested in rodents for vaccine applications using self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) encoding various antigens. We have then evaluated various ionizable lipid candidates and their biodistribution along with the mRNA/DNA translation exploration using various LNP compositions. Further, using ionizable lipids from the library, we have shown gene editing of various targets in rodents. We believe that these studies will pave the path to the advancement in nucleic acid based therapeutics and vaccines, or cell & gene therapy agents for early diagnosis and detection of cancer, and for targeted genomic medicines towards cancer treatment and diagnosis.}

Here we summarize recent approaches in genetic testing and current personalized treatments that are already applicable in genetic epilepsy syndromes. We also discuss current precision therapy utilized in personalized pharmacogenomics, as well as tailored treatment with neuromodulation for epilepsy patients.

abstract = {Background
Unused prescription opioids from family and friends continue to be the primary access point to prescription opioids for nonmedical use among youth. Implementation of medicine disposal boxes at pharmacies is one approach to facilitate removal of unused prescription opioids from the home to prevent diversion.
Objectives
We sought to examine the implementation rates of disposal boxes at pharmacies in North Carolina from 2016 to 2021 and place-based health disparities in availability.
Methods
We identified pharmacies with a disposal box in 2016, 2018, and 2021 among licensed pharmacies in North Carolina in 2018 (N = 2587). We computed descriptive statistics to describe disposal box implementation rates over time and used geographic information systems to identify spatial trends. We used separate logistic regression models in 2018 and 2021 to assess the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the likelihood of a pharmacy implementing a disposal box.
Results
We found an increase in disposal boxes over time with 43 pharmacies (1.7%) in 2016, 144 (5.6%) in 2018, and 350 (13.5%) in 2021 implementing a disposal box. In 2018, independent pharmacies were more likely than chains to have a disposal box. In 2021, medical-affiliated and pharmacies defined as “other” were less likely than chains to have a disposal box. In both 2018 and 2021, pharmacies in census tracts with a higher percentage of the population below the federal poverty line were more likely to have a disposal box. In 2021, pharmacies in tracts with a higher percentage of the population unemployed were less likely to have a disposal box. In 2018, pharmacies located in counties with a greater number of opioid overdose deaths were more likely to have a disposal box.
Conclusion
Our findings highlight the growth of disposal boxes in North Carolina over time and the potential for continued expansion to provide opportunities to prevent prescription opioid diversion.}

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that occurs due to insulin resistance in target tissues in response to β-cell dysfunction. Deficiency of insulin secretion from β-cells and insulin resistance in target tissues are the two major causes of type 2 diabetes. Around the world, the prevalence of diabetes is increasing with a high magnitude, both in developed and developing countries. As per the WHO report, the number of patients to be affected is estimated to reach 366 million by the year 2030. From the total number of diabetic patients, 95% are afflicted with type 2 diabetes. The treatment of diabetes can be broadly divided into two: conventional and alternative medicine. Patients receiving conventional medicines significantly improve in conditions like hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and secretion of insulin. However, these conventional medicines cause many side effects. To overcome these side- effects, a vast population around the world are using herbal products for effective treatment of several disorders. Entire systems of naturopathic medicine including the Chinese, Ayurvedic, Unani etc. exist for providing herbal remedies. In this chapter, we try to summarize the different alternative medicines and their effect on diabetes.}

Machine learning has traditionally operated in a space where data and labels are assumed to be anchored in objective truths. Unfortunately, much evidence suggests that the “embodied” data acquired from and about human bodies does not create systems that function as desired. The complexity of health care data can be linked to a long history of discrimination, and research in this space forbids naive applications. To improve health care, machine learning models must strive to recognize, reduce, or remove such biases from the start. We aim to enumerate many examples to demonstrate the depth and breadth of biases that exist and that have been present throughout the history of medicine. We hope that outrage over algorithms automating biases will lead to changes in the underlying practices that generated such data, leading to reduced health disparities.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis related to high morbidity and mortality. The incidence of psoriasis is increasing in recent decades. Some patients with psoriasis are anxious about the underlying side effects of synthetic drugs they are on. Therefore, they are eager to seek alternative and efficient therapy, such as Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Researchers have found some CHM provides best source for the development of anti-psoriatic drugs because of their structural diversity and fewer adverse reactions. Some of CHM formulas or active constituents extracted from CHM have been rapidly developed into clinical drugs with good efficacy. At present, along with the CHM formulas, single CHM and its active components have been extensively accepted and utilized in the treatment of psoriasis, whose therapeutic mechanisms hitherto have not been thoroughly illustrated. Aim of the study: This review aimed to comprehensively summarize about the existing therapeutic mechanisms of CHM in the treatment of psoriasis and to provide a reference to develop future related studies in this field.
Materials and methods
Relevant literatures about how CHM treated psoriasis were acquired from published scientific studies (including PubMed, CNKI, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, The Plant List, Elsevier and SciFinder). All plants appearing in the review have been included in The Plant List or Medicinal Plant Names Services (MPNS).
Results
In this review, we collect numerous literatures about how CHM treats psoriasis via immune cells, signaling pathways and disease-related mediators and systematically elucidates potential mechanisms from the point of the suppression of oxidative stress, the inhibition of abnormal abnormal proliferation and differentiation, the inhibition of immune responses, and the suppression of angiogenesis.
Conclusions
Psoriasis is considered as a complicated disease caused by interaction among various mechanisms. The CHM formulas, single CHM and its active components have considerable positive reports about the treatment of psoriasis, which brings hope for a promising future of CHM in the clinical therapy of psoriasis. In the paper, we have concluded that the existing therapeutic mechanisms of CHM in the treatment of psoriasis.}

abstract = {Background
Personalized medicine (PM) and patient-orchestrated care (POC) are frequently used terms in healthcare communication, policy, and research. Clarity of these constructs is important, as ambiguity in interpretation may lead to miscommunication and false assumptions both within and across disciplines. We aimed to explore the understanding of PM and POC among interdisciplinary professionals in the field of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 senior-level professionals from healthcare, society, industry and academia. Audio-recordings were transcribed and coded inductively and deductively by two researchers independently, using the ‘framework approach’.
Preliminary Results
Some professionals understood PM from a (bio-)medical perspective (e.g., medication, precision medicine), whereas others additionally employed a social perspective (e.g., personal needs, patient-centeredness). Most professionals distinguished PM from POC, and they mainly understood POC from a social perspective, entailing either full control for the person affected or shared responsibility and decision-making. Professionals agreed that care partners should also be involved in PM and POC.
Preliminary Discussion
Professionals appear to understand the construct of PM differently, which could lead to miscommunication. In line with their historically different backgrounds and values, the concepts of PM and POC are perceived distinctively. We plead for a more uniform understanding of PM, which may reduce miscommunication and false assumptions among interdisciplinary professionals, and therewith improve the validity of healthcare policy and research. These results are a first step towards discussions among interdisciplinary professionals in the AD field, allowing for reflection on current standards of good practice and optimization of communication. Moreover, the exact associations and interrelations between the terms PM, POC, person-centeredness, and personalization are currently unclear and this study may pave the way for a preliminary figure.
Questions
•How do PM, POC, person-centeredness and personalization interrelate?•How to improve communication among interdisciplinary professionals and translate Findings: into practice?}

The findings demonstrated poor interactions between BC3 and MAF, which led to low MAF sensitivity in flawless nanosheets. This study examined the effects of single and double vacancy (SV and DV) defects in the nanosheets in order to better understand how the drug and nanosheet interact. It was discovered that the adsorption energies of MAF onto SV-BC3 and DV-BC3 were roughly −25.61 and −16.86 kcal/mol, respectively. These findings show the extent of the drug-nanosheet interaction. The bandgap and work function of the defective nanosheets were dramatically altered by this adsorption. And yet, during drug adsorption, the perfect BC3 changed mostly in its bandgap, with just a minor change in the work function. Therefore, imperfect nanosheets may act as both Φ-type and electronic sensors for MAF, while an ideal nanosheet may only act as an electronic detector for MAF. Noticeably, the adsorption energy shifted with increasing dielectric constant. In addition, the drug adsorption of DV-BC3 resulted in notable modifications to its magnetic properties.}

Though autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has shown survival benefits, data regarding access to and outcomes of ASCT in racial minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups is limited. Objectives: To identify variables, such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and HIV status, associated with access to ASCT and outcomes in patients with PCNSL. Design: Retrospective cohort including patients from 06/01/2000 to 04/05/2022. Setting: Tertiary oncologic center. Patients: Fifty-three PCNSL patients with a median age at diagnosis of 63 years were included. The cohort was 7% Asian, 29% Black, 27% Hispanic, 17% White, and 20% other. Eighteen percent of the patients were HIV positive, thrice the global prevalence of HIV in PCNSL patients. Methods: Electronic health records were reviewed. SES was measured using the area deprivation index (ADI), composed of 17 categories and validated for a range of health outcomes and disease domains (Kind et al. NEJM 2018). Main Outcome Measures: Correlation of different demographic variables with access to ASCT and overall survival (OS). Results: The most common induction chemotherapy and conditioning regimens were remdesivir and TBC (thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide), respectively. Our population had a higher poverty index than the national average (median NY state ADI: 5th percentile). Thirty-two percent of the patients in our cohort received ASCT (17/53), better than the national average of 12.9% in PCNSL patients in 2020. In a logistic regression model, HIV-positive status was significantly associated with decreased access to ASCT (P=0.01). ADI and race/ethnicity did not affect access to ASCT. One-year OS was 80%, and no significant difference was found between those treated with ASCT and those who were not. Median OS was not reached in ASCT recipients. When adjusted for the other variables, Karnofsky scores >90 at diagnosis were associated with increased access to ASCT (P=0.04). Conclusions: In our population, HIV positivity limited access to ASCT, but race/ethnicity did not. Neighborhood disadvantage (ADI) also did not affect access to ASCT as patients were within a narrow range of extremely low socioeconomic status. Analyzing larger datasets of HIV-positive individuals with PCNSL can provide further insights into factors affecting ASCT access and outcomes.}

Despite multimodal therapeutic approaches that include surgical resection, radiation therapy or concurrent chemoradiation, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, SCCHN is still associated with a poor prognosis for patients with locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic (R/M) diseases. Although next-generation sequencing data from thousands of SCCHN patients have provided a comprehensive landscape of the somatic genomic alterations in this disease, genomic-based precision medicine is not implemented yet in routine clinical use since no satisfactory genetic biomarker has been identified for diagnosis, patient outcome prediction and selection of tailored therapeutic options. The lack of significant improvement in SCCHN patient survival over the last decades stresses the need for reliable predictive biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for personalized clinical management of SCCHN patients. Targeting the SCCHN-associated microenvironment or the interaction of the latter with cancer cells may represent such paradigm shift in the development of new strategies to treat SCCHN patients, as exemplified by the recent implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors to improve clinical outcomes by increasing anti-tumor immune responses in SCCHN patients. Several clinical trials are in progress in SCCHN patients to evaluate the activity of monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) at different treatment settings, including combinations with adjuvant surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. This review describes the current knowledge about the influence of the TME on intratumoral heterogeneity and clinical relapse in human SCCHN patients. More precisely, the role of hypoxia as well as the presence of non-cancer cells (e.g. cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells) on therapy response of SCCHN cells is highlighted. We also discuss relevant (pre)clinical models that may help integrate the microenvironment-tumor cell interplay in translational research studies for SCCHN. Finally, this review explores potential therapeutic strategies that may exploit the crosstalk between TME and SCCHN cells in order to implement fundamental changes in the tumor treatment paradigm of patients with locally advanced or R/M SCCHN.}

Introduction
Strategies of harm reduction (HR) include policies and community-based measures aimed to reduce the risk of self-harm while continuing potentially hazardous behaviors, such as illegal drug, alcohol, and tobacco use.
Objectives
To assess whether and to which extent strategies of HR could have beneficial, or harmful, effects on sexual and reproductive health, for general and at-risk populations.
Methods
A literature research was performed between July 2020 and January 2021, investigating the association between harm reduction strategies and sexual and reproductive health.
Results
HR strategies are mostly aimed at providing support to at-risk population, such as injection drug users or sex workers. Alcohol and drug use, smoking and high-risk sexual behaviors are among the main targets for HR strategies. Barriers to access, such as stigma, marginalization or lacking awareness, are often present as negative risk factors and require attention from professionals. Preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs), early/unwanted pregnancies and violence are the most important results HR programs could provide for sexual and reproductive health. However, evidence is limited and often qualitative, rather than quantitative.
Conclusion
HR strategies are important measures to improve sexual and reproductive health in at-risk populations. Increasing personal and social awareness is a key factor for the success of HR programs. A Sansone, E. Limoncin, E Colonnello, et al. Harm Reduction in Sexual Medicine. Sex Med Rev 2022;10:3–22.}

The surgical experience is frequently the first touchpoint to reengage the patient in their own health care. Some of the key interventions that are being effectively instituted by the anesthesiologists include proactive engagement in preoperative optimization of patient's health; personalization and standardization of care delivery by segmenting patients based on their complexity and risk; and implementation of best practices that are data-driven and evidence-based and provide structure that allow patients to return to their optimal state of functional, cognitive, and psychological health.

abstract = {Objectives
The recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has caused a significant drop in visits to dental and medical practices. Following the shelter‐in‐place orders across the United States, we have implemented tele (oral) medicine for the diagnosis and management of oral medicine conditions. We aimed to (1) characterize a cohort of oral medicine patients seen via telemedicine and (2) assess the effectiveness of telemedicine visits in terms of pain control in patients affected by oral diseases.
Study Design
A retrospective chart review for patients seen via telemedicine was conducted between March 2020 and December 2020. Sociodemographic information, home ZIP code, referring doctor and type of insurance, and clinical diagnosis were collected and entered into an electronic database. The pain score was recorded at each visit using a 0 to 10 scale. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate median and range. Differences in oral pain were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
A total of 137 new patients were included (57% female), with a median age of 56 years (range, 3-89). If seen in person, patients would have traveled a median distance of 65 miles (range, 0.9-100). More than half of the patients (n = 82; 59.8%) were referred by physicians, with the greatest proportion coming from primary care physicians (n = 47; 34.3%) and otolaryngologists (n = 17; 12%). The most common oral conditions seen were reactive/inflammatory lesions (n = 70; 51%), orofacial pain disorders (n = 18; 13.1%), and immune-mediated conditions (n = 17; 12.4%). One third of patients (n = 51; 37%) required an oral biopsy. Imaging and laboratory studies were ordered in 9.4% and 2.1% patients, respectively. Most patients (n = 92; 67.1%) had their visit covered by private medical insurance, 9 by dental insurance (6.5%), and 31 by Medicare (22.6%%), and 5 were self-pay (3.6%). When pain was considered, there was a 3-point median pain reduction from the first video visit to the first follow-up (P < .05) and a self-reported 65% (range, 0%-100%) median improvement of oral symptoms.
Conclusions
Tele (oral) medicine was an effective method for the diagnosis and treatment of oral medicine conditions. Tele (oral) medicine may be used in the future for an initial screening of oral mucosal conditions and to improve access to care.}

abstract = {Nuclear medicine staff is primarily exposed to their fingers during radionuclide manipulation. About 20% of these workers have risk to exceed the hand dose limit. Therefore, monitoring with ring dosimeters in terms of Hp(0.07) is advised. Most ring dosimeters make use of lithium fluoride (LiF) thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs). Different types of LiF TLDs exist, each with their advantages and disadvantages. The goal of this work was to evaluate the performance of three different LiF TLD types (MCP-N, MTS-N and MCP-Ns) for ring dosimetry during manipulation of the more novel radionuclides Lu-177, Ga-68 and I-131 within radionuclide imaging and therapy, and to provide recommendations for the most accurate dosimetric follow-up of the dose to the hands. This was done by combining measurements with TLDs and theoretical modelling of the TLD responses using Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations and microdosimetric modelling of the TLD relative luminescence efficiency. It was concluded that MTS-N TLDs are best suited for measuring doses from Lu-177 and I-131 if more than 1 mm polycarbonate equivalent shielding is provided. However, MCP-N TLDs have less than 20% under-response and are thus also acceptable in case high sensitivity is important. MCP-Ns TLDs were found to be best suited for measuring doses from Ga-68, and from Lu-177 and I-131 if less than 1 mm polycarbonate equivalent shielding is provided. The recommended TLD type strongly depends on both the manipulated radionuclide and the amount of shielding between the radionuclides and the fingers (syringe thickness and potential additional shielding around the syringe). But the approach presented here for the theoretical modelling of the Hp(0.07) response can easily be applied to select the most appropriate TLD type for other radionuclides or other amounts of shielding.}

Gynecological medicine involves the diagnoses and treatment of illnesses and issues involving female reproductive organs. This review is focused on female cancers of their reproductive organs including ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and uterine/endometrial cancer, as well as endometriosis, and infections within the reproductive tract. For each of the illnesses the current state of screening and diagnosis is investigated. These typically involve screening of symptoms for the illnesses, followed by imaging with ultrasound or MRI in the case of cancers and endometriosis, or swab cultures in the case of infection. These techniques are time consuming and require trained professionals to perform, and thus are expensive and difficult to apply to general population screening. Faster, lower cost, and simple screening methods need to be developed as screening is essential to catching these illnesses in an early stage, allowing their more effective treatment and improving outcomes for patients. The realm of sensors and biosensors offers a way to screen for blood, tissue, and urine based biomarkers for these illnesses. This review looks at a selection of biomarkers for each of the gynecological illnesses, and investigates some of the sensors that have been developed for them including various electrochemical, colorimetric, plasmon based sensors, and more. Future work in this field should not only focus on the accuracy of developed sensors for these illnesses, but also focus on their ease of use, ability to be mass produced, and keeping their cost low, all of which would allow the sensors to be used in general population screening.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional pharmacopoeias are constantly evolving and adapting, hence the assimilation of alien plants and weeds into traditional systems of healing. Invasive plants are detrimental to the ecosystem, however they are also potential sources of secondary metabolites with useful biological activities.
Aim of the review
The aim of this review was to investigate published reports of traditional use and biological activity of declared invasive alien plants and other weeds in South Africa.
Materials and methods
Information was retrieved from scientific databases including Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, PubMed, Chemical Abstracts Services and books, theses, dissertations and technical reports. Keywords used for the search engines were “South Africa” or “southern Africa” in conjunction with “(native weeds OR alien invasive)” AND “medicinal”. Separate searches were conducted on the individual invasive plant species recorded as having been used in ethnobotanical surveys to determine their known biological activities and chemical components.
Results
A total of 89 plant species regarded as invasive species or weeds in South Africa were identified as being used in traditional medicine. The most commonly mentioned plant family was the Asteraceae with a total of 15 species followed by the Fabaceae and Solanaceae with 6 species each. Of the 89 species recorded, 68% were reported to have traditional usage with both phytochemical and biological data available. A history of traditional usage coupled with biological data was available for 12% of species. Records of traditional usage alone were linked to 11% of species. Invasive alien species comprised 61% of recorded species, while native and non-invasive alien weeds formed the remaining 39%.
Conclusions
The exploration of alternative uses for weeds and particularly invasive plants, whether native or alien, as medicines for possible commercialisation may lead to innovative mechanisms for putting such species to good use.}

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) is the presence of air in the pleural space, occurring in the absence of trauma and known lung disease. Standardized expert guidelines on PSP are needed due to the variety of diagnostic methods, therapeutic strategies and medical and surgical disciplines involved in its management.
Methods
Literature review, analysis of literature according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology; proposals for guidelines rated by experts, patients, and organizers to reach a consensus. Only expert opinions with strong agreement were selected.
Results
A large PSP is defined as presence of a visible rim along the entire axillary line between the lung margin and the chest wall and ≥2 cm at the hilum level on frontal chest x-ray. The therapeutic strategy depends on the clinical presentation: emergency needle aspiration for tension PSP; in the absence of signs of severity: conservative management (small PSP), needle aspiration or chest tube drainage (large PSP). Outpatient treatment is possible if a dedicated outpatient care system is previously organized. Indications, surgical procedures and perioperative analgesia are detailed. Associated measures, including smoking cessation, are described.
Conclusion
These guidelines are a step towards PSP treatment and follow-up strategy optimization in France.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are often prepared in oral dosage forms, making TCMs interact with gut microbiota after oral administration, which could affect the therapeutic effect of TCM. Xiaoyao Pills (XYPs) are a commonly used TCM in China to treat depression. The biological underpinnings, however, are still in its infancy due to its complex chemical composition.
Aim of the study
The study aims to explore XYPs’ underlying antidepressant mechanism from both in vivo and in vitro.
Materials and methods
XYPs were composed of 8 herbs, including the root of Bupleurum chinense DC., the root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, the root of Paeonia lactiflora Pall., the sclerotia of Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, the rhizome of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., the leaves of Mentha haplocalyx Briq., the rhizome of Atractylis lancea var. chinensis (Bunge) Kitam., and the rhizome of Zingiber officinale Roscoe, in a ratio of 5:5:5:5:4:1:5:5. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat models were established. After that, the sucrose preference test (SPT) was carried out to evaluate if the rats were depressed. After 28 days of treatment, the forced swimming test and SPT were carried out to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of XYPs. The feces, brain and plasma were taken out for 16SrRNA gene sequencing analysis, untargeted metabolomics and gut microbiota transformation analysis.
Results
The results revealed multiple pathways affected by XYPs. Among them, the hydrolysis of fatty acids amide in brain decreased most significant via XYPs treatment. Moreover, the XYPs' metabolites which mainly derived from gut microbiota (benzoic acid, liquiritigenin, glycyrrhetinic acid and saikogenin D) were found in plasma and brain of CUMS rats and could inhibit the levels of FAAH in brain, which contributed to XYPs’ antidepressant effect.
Conclusions
The potential antidepressant mechanism of XYPs by untargeted metabolomics combined with gut microbiota-transformation analysis was revealed, which further support the theory of gut-brain axis and provide valuable evidence of the drug discovery.}

abstract = {Background
Regenerative medicine has emerged as a multidisciplinary field with the promising potential of renewing tissues and organs. The main types of adult stem cells used in clinical trials are hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Stem cells are defined as self-renewing clonogenic progenitor cells that can generate one or more types of specialized cells.
Highlight
MSCs form adipose, cartilage, and bone tissue. Their protective and regenerative effects, such as mitogenic, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and angiogenic effects, are mediated through paracrine and endocrine mechanisms. Dental pulp is a valuable source of stem cells because the collection of dental pulp for stem cell isolation is non-invasive, in contrast to conventional sources, such as bone marrow and adipose tissue. Teeth are an excellent source of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) for therapeutic procedures and they can be easily obtained after tooth extraction or the shedding of deciduous teeth. Thus, there is increased interest in optimizing and establishing standard procedures for obtaining DPSCs; preserving well-defined DPSC cultures for specific applications; and increasing the efficiency, reproducibility, and safety of the clinical use of DPSCs.
Conclusion
This review comprehensively describes the biological characteristics and origins of DPSCs, their identification and harvesting, key aspects related to their characterization, their multilineage differentiation potential, current clinical applications, and their potential use in regenerative medicine for future dental and medical applications.}

abstract = {Introduction
Although the role of epigenetic alterations in oncogenesis has been well studied, their prevalence in metastatic solid tumours is still poorly described. We therefore aimed at: (i) describing the presence of epigenetic gene alterations (EGA) - defined by an alteration in a gene encoding an epigenetic regulator; and (ii) evaluating their relationship with clinical characteristics and outcome in patients (pts) included in prospective molecular profiling trials.
Materials and methods
On-purpose tumour biopsies from pts with metastatic solid tumours enrolled in the Gustave Roussy-sponsored MOSCATO (NCT01566019) and MATCHR (NCT02517892) trials were molecularly profiled using whole exome sequencing (WES). Alterations in 176 epigenetic genes were assessed and classified as pathogenic variants (PV) or non-pathogenic variants by a molecular tumour board. Clinical characteristics and outcome were collected.
Results
Between Dec 2011 and Oct 2016, WES was successfully performed in 292 pts presenting various solid tumours. We found 496 epigenetic gene alterations in 134 patients (49%), including 237 pathogenic variants in 86 patients; 63 tumour samples (47%) presented ≥3 EGAs. The median number of previous treatment lines was 3 (1–10). The most frequently altered genes were KMT2D and KMT2C (16% each), ARID1A and SETD2 (10% each) and KMT2A (8%).; 31% of EGA co-occurred with a driver gene alteration (p < 0.001). Outcome was not correlated with the presence of EGA.
Conclusions
Epigenetic alterations occur frequently in metastatic solid tumours. With the current development of epigenetic modifiers, they increasingly represent actionable targets. Such genes should now be systematically analysed in molecular profiling studies.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Aidi injection is one of the China Food and Drug Administration approved Chinese herbal injections and the most competitive product in cancer care in China. It is composed of the extracts from Mylabris Phalerata, Astragalus Membranaceus, Panax Ginseng, and Acanthopanax Senticosus.
Aim of the study
This overview aims to map systematic reviews (SRs) of Aidi injection for cancer and provide a summarized evidence for clinical practice and decision making.
Materials and methods
Seven databases were searched for SRs and/or meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on Aidi injection for cancer care until December 2020. Six authors worked in pairs independently identified studies, collected data, and assessed the quality of included studies according to the revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A narrative synthesis was used for the evidence mapping.
Results
Fifty-two SRs on Aidi injection as adjuvant therapy were included, involving lung cancer (20 SRs), liver cancer (10), colorectal cancer (7), gastric cancer (6), lymphoma (2), breast cancer (2), esophageal cancer (1), ovary cancer (1), and a mix of different cancers (4). Except for one SR focusing on Aidi injection used alone, other SRs evaluated Aidi injection in combination with chemotherapy (43), radiotherapy (4), or chemo/radiology/targeting therapy (4). Aidi injection showed additional beneficial effects on survival (9), objective response rate (44), quality of life (42), and the reduction of side-effects from chemo/radiotherapy (48). Using AMSTAR 2 tool, two reviews were assessed as low and the rest as critically low methodological quality mainly due to the lack of prospective registration. The reporting quality was insufficient assessed with PRISMA in the reporting of search strategy (26, 50.0%), additional analysis (19, 36.5%), and the summary of evidence (2, 3.8%).
Conclusion
Aidi injection has been evaluated for its adjuvant beneficial effects on cancer survival, tumor responses, quality of life, and reducing the side effects of chemo/radiotherapy, mainly focusing on lung, liver and colorectal cancer. The methodological and reporting quality are weak and need to be improved in the future.}

abstract = {Background
A traditionally prepared aqueous extract (= decoction) of Houttuynia cordata Thunb (Yu xing cao) (HC) is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to treat inflammatory disease. Previous chemical and biological studies on HC have mainly focused on organic extracts rather than the aqueous decoction, which is the traditional formulation.
Purpose
The study aimed to investigate whether the chemical composition of HC aqueous decoction (HCD) varies with geographical sourcing, to investigate the mechanism of action of HCD, and to determine if chemical variation impacts on HCDs anti-inflammatory activity.
Method
Sixteen samples of HC were purchased from Sichuan, Hubei and Anhui provinces in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and were prepared by the traditional decoction method to yield their corresponding HCDs. A Quality Control (QC) sample was prepared by combining individual HCD extracts. HCDs were analysed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The anti-inflammatory activities associated with intestinal barrier function of HCD were studied by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) activated Caco-2 monolayers in vitro and in vivo using Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. Proteins involved in inflammation, mRNA levels, disease severity scores, and histology involved in intestinal inflammation were analysed.
Results
HCD samples exhibited different chemical fingerprints and three regional outliers were identified by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Fifteen phytochemical metabolites were identified and quantified. HCD showed in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, enhancing zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, interleukin (IL)-10 and decreasing IL-1β, IL-6 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via an EGFR-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) signaling pathway. This beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation was also seen in the in vivo colitis model at a molecular level in colonic tissues.
Conclusion
This study shows that the test HCDs were chemically different, resulting in different levels of activity on intestinal barrier function and inflammation. Moreover, a “Daodi” product showed the greatest biological activity in this study, thus validating the importance of the “Daodi” quality material in TCM and supporting the traditional used of HCD for the treatment of inflammation.}

abstract = {The Russo-Ukraine war has been the first large-scale combat operation between two near-peer adversaries after World War II. It has seen the no holds barred and lethal use of all the new weapon systems developed in the last eight decades. The result has been an increase in casualties to the tune of nearly 10 to 15 times of those seen in the global war on terror in the US operations in the Gulf wars and in Afghanistan. The casualties have been much more severe with multi-system involvement and more lethal, owing to the munitions used. Lack of air superiority has necessitating Prolonged Field Care as far forward as possible with casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) only when available. Other aspects such as training of medical personnel in mass casualty scenarios where triaging would have to be done in a way to benefit the maximum numbers. The provisioning of blood and products as far forwards with the use of “walking blood banks” would have to be synergied, and capacities to deal with cognitive casualties and rehabilitation in the post-war period would have to be vastly enhanced. Novel ideas such as the use of logistic drones for medical and blood-supply delivery and even for CASEVAC may also be viable, depending on the combat situation.}

Helichrysum italicum (HI) is a Mediterranean plant with well-reported use in traditional medicine for a wide range of applications, including digestive and liver disorders, intestinal parasitic infections, wound healing, stomach ache and asthma. However, little is known about the global mechanism behind its pleiotropic activity.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study was to explain the mechanism behind the previously demonstrated effects of HI and to justify its use in traditional medicine.
Materials and methods
A microarray-based transcriptome analysis was used to discover the global transcriptional alterations in primary colon fibroblasts after exposure to HI infusion for 6 h and 24 h. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR was used to verify the microarray results.
Results
Altogether we identified 217 differentially expressed genes compared to non-treated cells, and only 8 were common to both treatments. Gene ontology analysis revealed that 24 h treatment with HI infusion altered the expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell growth, whereas pathway analysis further showed the importance of interleukin signaling and transcriptional regulation by TP53. For the 6 h treatment only the process of hemostasis appeared in the results of both enrichment analyses. In functional assays, HI infusion increased cell migration and decreased blood clotting and prothrombin time.
Conclusions
With the careful evaluation of the role of individual genes, especially SERPING1, ARHGAP1, IL33 and CDKN1A, represented in the enriched pathways and processes, we propose the main mode of HI action, which is wound healing. In addition to its indirect prevention of diseases resulting from the impaired barrier integrity, HI also effects inflammation and metabolic processes directly, as it regulates genes such as LRPPRC, LIPA, ABCA12, PRKAR1A and ANXA6.}

abstract = {Objective
To describe the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients diagnosed with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) by an oral medicine reference center in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil.
Methodology
This is an observational, longitudinal, and retrospective study that analyzed records of patients diagnosed with OPMDs (leukoplakia, actinic cheilitis, leukoerythroplakia, proliferative verrucous leukoplakia) from 2004 to 2019. The study variables were organized in an Excel spreadsheet.
Results
82 cases of OPMDs were diagnosed, of which 49 were women. The mean age was 60.7 years; 49 patients were Caucasian. The most common lesion was leukoplakia (n = 39), followed by actinic cheilitis (n = 37), leukoerythroplakia (n = 5) and proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (n = 1). Most patients reported no tobacco (n = 49/72) or no alcohol consumption (n = 42/72). The main anatomical location of OPMDs, except for actinic cheilitis, was the gingiva (n = 13/39). The treatment of choice was surgery (n = 34/65).
Conclusion
OPMDs were more common among women. The mean age of 60.7 years is in accordance with the literature. The main lesion was leukoplakia, followed by actinic cheilitis. Most patients had no tobacco and/or alcohol consumption. The treatment of choice was surgery excision.
