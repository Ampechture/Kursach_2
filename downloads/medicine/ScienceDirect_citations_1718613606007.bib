abstract = {Summary
Background
Race-based practices in medical education and clinical care may exacerbate health inequities. Misguided use of race in popular point-of-care clinical decision-making tools like UpToDate® may promote harmful practices of race-based medicine. This article investigates the nature of mentions of Black/African American race in UpToDate®.
Methods
We conducted a systematic content analysis of UpToDate® articles mentioning Black or African American race to assess for biological interpretations of racial categories. Following a simple text search for the terms “Black” and “African American” in UpToDate® on January 24 and March 19, 2020, respectively, removal of duplicates yielded an analytical sample of 208 documents. We adopted a deductive coding approach and systematically applied 16 a priori codes to all documents, refining the codebook to achieve a final inter-rater reliability of 0.91. We then developed these codes into two themes: (1) biologization of race and (2) racialized research and practice.
Findings
Biologization of race occurred nearly universally across all documents (93.3%), with discussions of inherent physiological differences between racial groups and presentation of epidemiologic disparities without context emerging most frequently. Sixty-eight documents (32.7%) included codes related to racialized biomedical research and clinical practice, including references to racialized patterns of behavior and cultural practices, insufficient data on Black populations, research limiting study to a specific racial group, and race-based clinical practices guidelines.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that UpToDate® articles often inappropriately link Black race to genetics or clinical phenotype—without considering socio-structural variables or the health effects of structural racism—thus perpetuating a false narrative that race is inherently biological. UpToDate® articles may also promote unequal treatment by recommending race-based clinical practices. Such racial essentialism risks exacerbating racialized health inequities.

The gastrointestinal tract contains the most diverse and dense microbiome in the human body, and its composition can be affected by intestinal microenvironmental parameters such as pH, oxygen levels, nutrient availability, water activity, and temperature. The intestinal microbiome is crucial for the development, maturation, and modulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems and for neurological development. The human intestine acts as a “bioreactor” into which the microbial community is inserted. In this environment, substrates are transformed into products, and the different biological agents act in a complex communication network.

The utilization of multimodal therapies such as acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and photobiomodulation has become increasingly common as a part of routine treatment plans for zoological animals. Acupuncture is a medical procedure that involves the use of needles or injections at specific “points” or locations on the body to provide symptomatic treatments, including therapies such as pain relief and gastrointestinal conditions. Acupuncture can be enhanced through the use of electroacupuncture, which is the method of providing a low voltage electrical current through acupuncture needles. Photobiomodulation is primarily used to enhance wound healing, decrease swelling, or to assist with pain relief that produce a change at the cellular level through a specialized light emitting device at a specialized wavelength via a laser or light-emitting diode (LED) device. All of these therapies can work together with or without traditional medications to provide an integrative approach to medicine and aid in improving the health and welfare of the animal.}

An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry with precursor ions list-including data-dependent acquisition approach was developed for metabolite profiling. Holistic, continuous, and pattern recognition chemometrics could make it feasible to unveil forty-one markers, with “multi-duplicated and traceability samples comparison” cross validation to narrow down to twelve robust markers, some of which were further validated by absolute quantification. A support vector machine model was eventually developed to distinguish these two species and predict origins of commercially available varieties. This was the first report on systematic comparison and discrimination of two original species of RA. This integral strategy, in contrast to conventional approaches, renders more convincing data supporting for the discovery of multi-source chemical makers of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).}

abstract = {The field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) possesses the possibility for the treatment of degenerative retinal disease such as age-related macular degeneration. Previously, the damaged or diseased retina was treated by delivering cells, genes, drugs, and biological substances in the anterior segment or the posterior ocular. However, these methods fail to fully regenerate the degenerative retinal tissue to mature functional retinal tissue. To overcome these limitations, the application of hydrogel for retinal TERM was studied for over 10 years and showed the potential for successful retinal regeneration. Hydrogels have shown attractive properties as retinal tissue engineering (RTE) scaffolds. Their ability to maintain a fully hydrated three-dimensional structure provides a similar environment to the native extracellular matrix (ECM). The viscoelastic property of the hydrogel allows the noninvasive injection to the target tissue. Also, the mechanical support allows the encapsulation of cells and drugs. Taking these advantages, efforts are continuously being performed to discover the most suitable biomaterial for RTE. This review outlines a brief description of retina structure, retinal disease, and the application of hydrogels for RTE. Furthermore, challenges and outlooks of hydrogel-based RTE are discussed.}

abstract = {Albumin is the most abundant circulating protein and provides about 70% of the plasma oncotic power. The molecule also carries many other biological functions (binding, transport and detoxification of endogenous and exogenous compounds, antioxidation, and modulation of inflammatory and immune responses). Hypoalbuminemia is a frequent finding in many diseases, representing usually only a biomarker of poor prognosis rather than a primary pathophysiological event. Despite that, albumin is prescribed in many conditions based on the assumption that correction of hypoalbuminemia would lead to clinical benefits for the patients. Unfortunately, many of these indications are not supported by scientific evidence (or have been even disproved), so that a large part of albumin use is nowadays still inappropriate. Decompensated cirrhosis is the clinical area where albumin administration has been extensively studied and solid recommendations can be made. Besides prevention and treatment of acute complications, long-term albumin administration in patients with ascites has emerged in the last decade has a potential new disease-modifying treatment. In non-hepatological settings, albumin is widely used for fluid resuscitation in sepsis and critical illnesses, with no clear superiority over crystalloids. In many other conditions, scientific evidence supporting albumin prescription is weak or even absent. Thus, given its high cost and limited availability, action is needed to avoid the use of albumin for inappropriate and futile indications to ensure its availability in those conditions for which albumin has been demonstrated to have a real effectiveness and an advantage for the patient.}

Common antibiotics, although useful, have adverse effects or are ineffective against many infections. Also, many emerging or reemerging infections lack proper therapeutics. To face this global threat, alternative or new drugs are urgently required. The secondary metabolites of plants are the vital components of nature that help in human defense by interfering with specific molecules of microbial or human cells, modulating the cell signaling pathways, and protecting against UV damage and oxidative stress. Hence, “plant-derived antimicrobials” or “phyto-antimicrobials” can predispose inhibitory activity against diverse viruses, bacteria, and fungi to parasites. It not only causes leakage of the microbial cell wall, damage to the cell membrane, or cell lysis, but also inactivate/disrupt proteins or enzymes and interfere transcription to translation leading to the death of the microbes. Hence, natural antimicrobials may be the most ideal for health care, as it can help in healing process and kill/inhibit the pathogens efficiently and may prevent the development of drug resistance. Billions of living species on the earth from bacteria to animals produce a plethora of healing chemicals, many of which are still unknown. Thus, the present review portrays the antimicrobial role of selected traditional medicine(s) including their active compounds with the possible mechanism of action for managing difficult-to-treat infections.}

Shenling Baizhu San (SBS) is commonly employed to improve gastrointestinal dysfunction in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in China. SBS combined with mesalamine has been demonstrated to result in improve its curative effects without increasing any adverse reactions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclarified.
Aim of the study
Our study aimed to illuminate the potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of SBS, which is a medicine complementary to mesalamine, in the treatment of UC.
Materials and methods
A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of SBS as a complementary medicine to mesalamine for patients with UC (n = 48). The patients in the control group (n = 24) were given mesalamine alone, whereas those in the experimental group were administered mesalamine combined with SBS. The therapeutic outcome was assessed at 8 weeks. The structures of the gut microbiota (GMB) were characterized by 16S rRNA sequencing, and the microbial tryptophan metabolites were analyzed by UPLC–MS/MS to investigate the mechanism through which SBS achieves its effects.
Results
Our results showed that the combination of SBS and mesalamine could significantly improve the clinical signs of UC by achieving mucosal healing and relieving colon damage. Interestingly, the combination of SBS and mesalamine could alter the GMB structures and increase the microbial levels of tryptophan metabolites, including indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-acetic acid.
Conclusion
SBS combined with mesalamine is effective in improving the clinical and endoscopic outcomes of patients with UC. SBS, as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment, alleviates UC via the GMB-tryptophan metabolite axis.}

Oxidation of As(iii) to As(v) is an effective way to improve the performance of most arsenic removal technologies. In this study, a new alternative biosorbent, TiO2-loaded biochar prepared by waste Chinese traditional medicine dregs (TBC) was applied in remediation for As(iii) from aqueous solution. Compared with unmodified biochar, the specific surface areas and total pore volumes of TBC increased while the average aperture decreased due to the loading of nano-TiO2. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of TBC confirmed that the precipitated titanium oxide was primarily anatase. pH did not have a significant effect on the adsorption capacity at 10 mg L−1 As(iii) in suspension with a pH ranging from 2 to 10. Adsorption kinetics data were best fitted by the pseudo-second-order model (R2 > 0.999). The Sips maximum adsorption capacity was 58.456 mg g−1 at 25 °C, which is comparable with other adsorbents reported in previous literature. The Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of As(iii) adsorption was negative, indicating the spontaneous nature of adsorption. The results of free radical scavenging and N2 purging experiments indicated that O2 acted as an electron accepter and O2˙− dominated the oxidation of As(iii). The oxidation of As(iii) obviously affected the adsorption capacity for As(iii) by TBC. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies showed that As(iii) and As(v) existed on the surface of TBC, suggesting that the oxidation of As(iii) occurred. TBC played multiple roles for As(iii), including direct adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation adsorption. Regeneration and stability experiments showed that TBC was an environment-friendly and efficient adsorbent for As(iii) removal.}

The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprints and Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) quantized fingerprints were successfully developed to comprehensively evaluate overall quality of Citri Reticulata Pericarpium (CRP) by applying comprehensive quantified fingerprint method (CQFM). All samples were well distinguished and divided into 5 grades. In addition, through principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), the identification ability of HPLC fingerprints and FT-MIR fingerprints on CRP with different storage years was discussed. The results showed that HPLC fingerprints combined with PCA had good discrimination ability, and the PLS-DA model established by the preprocessed FT-MIR fingerprint data could accurately distinguish and predict the storage period of CRP. Finally, based on 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•) scavenging assay, combined with bivariate correlation analysis, the fingerprint-activity relationship of offline antioxidant activity of CRP samples with the fingerprints peak were studied. In general, the comprehensive strategies provide a reliable and scientific reference scheme for the quality control of MFHM in the future.}

Re-create the development process, structure, workflow, documentation/billing strategies, and curricular components of the hybrid ICU/palliative rotation described in this session 2. Apply the strategies outlined in the session to expand access to palliative care clinical experiences in a manner that will meet new ACGME requirements In July 2019, the Palliative Care team at UT Southwestern Medical Center created a 2-week-long clinical rotation for internal medicine residents. Although the rotation was well-received, residents universally commented that the experience was too short to allow for adequate practice of communication skills. Additionally, although they received ample exposure to conversations regarding late goals of care, they noted a dearth of opportunities to be observed and receive coaching on upstream communication and other primary palliative skills. Unfortunately, due to competing service requirements, our residency program was unable to increase the length of the palliative care rotation. In this session, we describe the innovative strategy employed to increase primary palliative skills training and bedside communication coaching at our institution—the development and implementation of a hybridized medical ICU/palliative care rotation in which residents rotating through the medical ICU are jointly supervised by a critical care attending and a palliative care attending. Palliative faculty augment bedside and didactic teaching in the ICU, and pulmonary and palliative faculty model collegial collaboration between specialties. We will describe typical daily workflow, present novel strategies employed for documentation and billing, and outline the didactic and bedside curricula that were developed for this unique educational experience. Residents are coached in assessing communication preferences, navigating cultural differences, collecting spiritual histories and responding to the language of faith, collaborating with interpreters to overcome language barriers, conducting virtual family meetings, managing symptoms and emotions in the context of discontinuation of artificial means of support, and much more. As the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education recently instituted a mandate that every internal medicine resident receive clinical training in hospice and palliative medicine, our hope is that this session will give attendees a blueprint by which they can rapidly upscale exposure to palliative skills training at their home institutions.}

Clinical tools commonly used to assess patients, including the modified Rodnan skin score, difference between limited or diffuse forms of skin involvement, presence of lung, heart or kidney involvement, or of various autoantibodies, are important prognostic factors, but still fail to reflect the large heterogeneity of the disease. SSc treatment options are diverse, ranging from conventional drugs to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and predicting response is challenging. Genome-wide technologies, such as high throughput microarray analyses and RNA sequencing, allow accurate, unbiased, and broad assessment of alterations in expression levels of multiple genes. In recent years, many studies have shown robust changes in the gene expression profiles of SSc patients compared to healthy controls, mainly in skin tissues and peripheral blood cells. The objective analysis of molecular patterns in SSc is a powerful tool that can further classify SSc patients with similar clinical phenotypes and help predict response to therapy. In this review, we describe the journey from the first discovery of differentially expressed genes to the identification of enriched pathways and intrinsic subsets identified in SSc, using machine learning algorithms. Finally, we discuss the use of these new tools to predict the efficacy of various treatments, including stem cell transplantation. We suggest that the use of RNA gene expression-based classifications according to molecular subsets may bring us one step closer to precision medicine in Systemic Sclerosis.}

Exploratory analysis of the MFHs samples was executed by the principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The mass spectrometry relative intensities of 46 mineral elements in combination with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to classify-three MFHs, which were Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR), Lilii Bulbus (LB), and adlay (AD). Overall, the supervised PLS-DA achieved satisfactory classification results. In addition, variable importance in projection (VIP) was employed to select the main classification indicators. In brief, the proposed method was simple, rapid, environmental, and reliable because it does not require standard solutions of mineral elements and complicated pretreatment, is less time-consuming, and acquires satisfactory results.}

However, in patients with metastatic disease, many tumours become refractory to RAI, and these patients require alternative treatments, such as locoregional therapies and/or systemic treatment with multikinase inhibitors. Improvements in our understanding of the genetic alterations that occur in thyroid cancer have led to the discovery of several targeted therapies with clinical efficacy. These alterations include NTRK (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase) gene fusions, with the tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibitors larotrectinib and entrectinib both approved by the European Medicines Agency and in other markets worldwide. Inhibitors of aberrant proteins resulting from alterations in RET (rearranged during transfection) and BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene) have also shown promising efficacy, and so far have received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. Selpercatinib, a RET kinase inhibitor, was approved for use in Europe in early 2021. With the discovery of multiple actionable targets, it is imperative that effective testing strategies for these genetic alterations are integrated into the diagnostic armamentarium to ensure that patients who could potentially benefit from targeted treatments are identified. In this review, we offer our recommendations on the optimal testing strategies for detecting genetic alterations in thyroid cancer that have the potential to be targeted by molecular therapy. We also discuss the future of treatments for thyroid cancers, including the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and new generations of targeted treatments that are being developed to counter acquired tumour resistance.}

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
Black men with prostate cancer in the United States experience disproportionately worse clinical outcomes compared to other racial groups. Identifying more reliable prognosticators to address these inequities has thus been the subject of considerable research scrutiny. However, prognostic genomic tools and genomic biorepositories suffer from an even greater lack of racial diversity. Strategies to mitigate these amplifying developments in inequities are desperately needed. We hypothesized that the presence of a precision medicine navigator (PMN) may mitigate inequities with standard of care (SOC) genomic test utilization among Black men with prostate cancer.
Materials/Methods
We retrospectively reviewed prostate cancer consults within one healthcare system from 11/2/2021 to 1/2/2022. We compared the frequency of patients who received SOC Decipher or Tempus genomic testing in the 7 months prior to the PMN start (pre-PMN) to the 7 months afterward (post-PMN). Chi square analysis was used to compare subgroups. Binary logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of receiving genomic testing.
Results
The sample included 693 patients, 44.9% (311/693) pre-PMN and 55.1% (382/693) post-PMN, with a median age of 68 in both groups. Pre- and post-PMN racial distributions were similar with 60.1% and 60.2% White, 35.1% and 34% Black, 3.2% and 3.7% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1.3% and 2.1% Latino, respectively. Pre- and post-PMN NCCN risk category distribution was 15.2% and 10.4% low risk, 46.8% and 49.9% intermediate risk, and 38.1% and 39.7% high risk, respectively. Pre- and post-PMN groups had 14.5% and 17% distant metastases, 77.2% and 76.9% localized disease, 10.3% and 10% prior prostatectomy, 47% and 51% income below sample median, 51% and 52% with Medicare/Medicaid, and 47% and 48% seen at community hospitals, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences for these variables pre- and post-PMN. However, from pre- to post-PMN, the proportion of Black patients receiving genomic testing increased from 19% to 58%. Black patients seen post-PMN were six times more likely to receive testing (p<0.001). Significant increases in SOC genomic testing post-PMN also occurred among lower median income patients, patients with Medicare/Medicaid, and community hospital patients.
Conclusion
The presence of a PMN may improve disparate rates of Black patients receiving SOC genomic tests for prostate cancer compared to other racial groups and may alleviate genomic testing inequities among other demographics.}

abstract = {Therapeutic Area
Heart Failure - Quality Improvement
Background
Sodium glucose transport inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizations and Cardiovascular (CV) death in patients with heart failure (HF). However, residents may be under prescribing SGLT2i for patients with HF in the outpatient setting possibly due to being unaware of newest guidelines or lack of comfort with prescribing SGLT2i for HF. The aim of this resident-led quality improvement project is to increase the rate of SGLT2i prescribed in patients with HF in the UT Tyler Internal Medicine (IM) Resident Clinic by 10% from a baseline of 16% within one month.
Methods
Using a fish-bone diagram, root-cause analysis was performed for different reasons SGLT2i are under prescribed by residents. A Pick Chart was used for intervention planning which involved reminders on conference tables aimed at the preceptor and resident during report out. The intervention was implemented for one month and data was pulled using built EMR data analysis tool after this initial run to evaluate the percentage of SGLT2i prescriptions.
Results
Pre-intervention data was pulled and revealed 16% of patients at the IM clinic with ICD codes indicating HF diagnosis were on SGLT2i (Figure 1). Post-intervention data analysis that used the same ICD codes showed a 10.7% increase to 26.7% of HF patients on SGLT2i (Figure 2).
Conclusions
At the IM clinic, our goal was to improve SGLT2i prescription by 10% among the IM residents by educating and reminding residents on their indications. SGLT-2i have emerged as a staple in improving mortality and hospital readmission of patients with HF with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) as seen in Emperor Reduced and Emperor Preserved Trials. Despite the proven benefits of SGLT-2i in HF, their use in clinical practice remains suboptimal due to lack of awareness, concerns about side effects, and high cost. We intend to continue to assess rates of SGLT2i prescription by analyzing SGLT2i prescription rates every six months and improving current interventions further by implementing more robust signs that are updated periodically with changing guidelines. This project can be further expanded and replicated at other associated clinics and in the inpatient setting in the future.}

Since ancient times, numerous natural remedies and herbal medicines have been used continuously to treat aches and medical ailments. In modern times, plants, oil extracts, and their mixtures have been nanofabricated into many more medical drugs, and traditional medicine is still often used rather than modern medicine. The necessity and importance of traditional medicines for societies with different cultures and climates can be seen within the market. This chapter illustrates nanodrug-delivery approaches that address the shortcomings of conventional drug-delivery systems. The unique advantages of nano-herbal medicine, such as curing different diseases with far fewer adverse effects like toxicity, greater compatibility, and better therapeutic effects, are highlighted. Applying nanotechnology to solve the limitations of herbal-based drugs (phytoconstituents) is also discussed in detail. The chapter focuses on herbal nanoformulations, nanoparticle/herbal drug-loading techniques, and applications for treating within the varied fields of wound healing, cancer treatment, tissue engineering, antioxidants, and toxicity issues.}

Window I; based on manipulation of the data of zero order absorption spectrum of the mixture using novel Extended absorbance difference (EAD) and Absorbance difference (AD) methods coupled with corresponding spectrum subtraction method (SS). Window III; based on manipulation of the data of ratio spectra via Constant value coupled with constant subtraction (CV-CS) and novel Induced dual amplitude difference (IDAD) method coupled with corresponding spectrum subtraction method (SS). Finally, window IV; based on manipulation of the data of derivative of the ratio spectrum of the mixture via novel Factorized derivative ratio null contribution (FDD-NC) and Factorized unlimited derivative ratio (FUDD) methods coupled with corresponding spectrum subtraction method (SS). Synthetic mixtures and commercial medicine were constructively analyzed using the proposed methods while maintaining calibration graphs to be linear over ranges; 4.0–40.0 µg/mL for ACE, 2.0–14.0 µg/mL for PAR and 4.0–30.0 µg/mL for RAB. Moreover, methods' validation was confirmed via performing exhaustive statistical treatment of the experimental findings. The proposed methodologies can be used for the routine analysis of the cited drugs in quality control laboratories. Additionally, Spectral Similarity Index (SSI) was calculated to detect counterfeit products and methods’ greenness profile was finally guaranteed through analytical greenness (AGREE) metric assessment tool.}

abstract = {Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a very common and debilitating condition, characterised by a significant drop in blood pressure (BP) on standing upright. Multiple neuro-cardiovascular mechanisms should stabilise BP when moving to an upright position but in OH, BP decline results from dysfunction of neuro-cardiovascular mechanisms. With the advent of non-invasive, beat-to-beat BP measurement, the detailed postural BP profile presents an opportunity to explore the underlying pathological deficits seen in OH. To date, several distinct clusters of postural BP drop have been identified, typically defined by the rate and duration of BP decline and the degree of recovery. The morphology of the BP drop may reflect the underlying cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. There are three principal treatment strategies for OH; conservative management, fludrocortisone or midodrine. As each of these therapies have different therapeutic mechanisms, in this review we hypothesise how they could be used in a more targeted manner to treat the underlying physiological deficit - conservative management for ‘initial drop, quick recovery’, fludrocortisone for ‘medium drop, slow recovery/venular-deficit’ and midodrine for ‘large drop, non-recovery/arteriolar-deficit’.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have made great contributions to the prevention and treatment of human diseases in China, and especially in cases of COVID-19. However, due to quality problems, the lack of standards, and the diversity of dosage forms, adverse reactions to TCMs often occur. Moreover, the composition of TCMs makes them extremely challenging to extract and isolate, complicating studies of toxicity mechanisms. Aim of the review: The aim of this paper is therefore to summarize the advanced applications of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) technology in the quality control, safety evaluations, and determination of toxicity mechanisms of TCMs.
Materials and methods
Relevant studies from the literature have been collected from scientific databases, such as “PubMed”, “Scifinder”, “Elsevier”, “Google Scholar” using the keywords “MSI”, “traditional Chinese medicines”, “quality control”, “metabolomics”, and “mechanism”.
Results
MSI is a new analytical imaging technology that can detect and image the metabolic changes of multiple components of TCMs in plants and animals in a high throughput manner. Compared to other chemical analysis methods, such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), this method does not require the complex extraction and separation of TCMs, and is fast, has high sensitivity, is label-free, and can be performed in high-throughput. Combined with chemometrics methods, MSI can be quickly and easily used for quality screening of TCMs. In addition, this technology can be used to further focus on potential biomarkers and explore the therapeutic/toxic mechanisms of TCMs.
Conclusions
As a new type of analysis method, MSI has unique advantages to metabolic analysis, quality control, and mechanisms of action explorations of TCMs, and contributes to the establishment of quality standards to explore the safety and toxicology of TCMs.}

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) over the last few years, and data being generated at extremely high rates and being analyzed and interpreted with the help of AI, have led to new approaches in medicine that include also optimization and real-time control algorithms. In particular, digital twins (i.e., digital replicas of biological systems: cells, tissues, organs, systems) have seen a fulminant rise over the last few years. We start this review by discussing briefly the use of digital control applied to various medical problems: from diabetes to anesthesia. Then, we focus on the extension of the digital control concept to the digital twins concept to improve not only the process control, but also to improve biomedical design, virtual testing of personalized therapies, and optimization of therapies (including drug delivery). We discuss the applications of such digital twins to preclinical research as well as clinical research. We conclude this review by outlining some benefits as well as ethical concerns surrounding the digital twins.}

Gaps in insurance coverage and cost sharing are 2 such structural barriers that can perpetuate inequities in screening, diagnostic workup, guideline-concordant treatment, symptom management, survivorship, and access to clinical trials. Mitigating these barriers will be key to achieving equity in prostate cancer care, and will require a multi-pronged approach from policymakers, health systems, and individual providers.

abstract = {Objectives
Conventional cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) for the value-based pricing of new medicines largely ignores the implications of limited market exclusivity (ie, patent-protection periods plus any exclusivity granted by regulators). This paper explores the implications of this methodological shortcoming, which produces several pricing anomalies with potentially unintended effects on research and development (R&D) incentives.
Methods
We illustrate these implications by comparing 4 stylized examples of increasing complexity, from short-term cures for acute conditions to long-term cures for rare, health-catastrophic conditions.
Results
(1) Conventional-CEA will project a different result than an adjusted CEA that considers generic or biosimilar entry; (2) free and flexible pricing of long-term treatments (eg, statins for hypercholesterolemia) or repeated-dose cures (eg, insulin for type 1 diabetes) for chronic conditions will likely result in predictable price increases at the end of the exclusivity period that may be perceived as unjustified or unsupported; and (3) one-time administration “cures” (eg, gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy) have the potential to allocate a large share of the social surplus to the manufacturer over the product lifetime, which may or may not be dynamically efficient per se, but may also inadvertently disadvantage the development of valuable long-term treatments or repeated-dose cures for chronic conditions.
Conclusions
We highlight the need for additional research on long-term solutions to these issues that would aim to promote dynamically efficient global R&D. More work is needed on the following: (1) relationships between social surplus allocation and the amount and composition of global R&D, as we may be as likely to be encouraging excessive R&D in some areas as to be undersupplying it in others; and (2) relating the size of the surplus reward to R&D cost and, thus, the return on investment.}

abstract = {Introduction
The use of certain Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) in children has been documented in Spain. The main aim of this study is to estimate the knowledge, recommendations, and use of CAM by Spanish paediatricians.
Material and methods
A national study was conducted from June to July 2020 using an online questionnaire. Two e-mails were sent to paediatricians who were members of the Spanish Association of Paediatrics (AEP).
Results
Out of 1414 responses received, acupuncture was considered as a science by 31.8%. Homeopathy was recommended to parents by 28.1%. CAM was used by 21.3% of physicians, at least once, to improve their own health. Only 3.8% had ever replaced a conventional treatment with CAM. The following variables were associated with a greater disposition to prescribe homeopathy: female, age over 45 years old, paediatricians working in Primary Care, and paediatricians working in private healthcare.
Conclusions
This AEP Committee on Medicines questionnaire provides new data that should be considered alarming and should ask for a serious thinking on the use of CAM in Spain. Some paediatricians are recommending parents to give treatments not supported by scientific evidence to their children. This practice could be potentially harmful, especially when conventional treatment is being replaced.
Resumen
Introducción
El uso de determinadas pseudociencias en niños está documentado en España. El objetivo principal del estudio es estimar el grado de conocimiento, la recomendación y el uso de algunas pseudoterapias por parte de los pediatras españoles.
Material y métodos
Estudio transversal, descriptivo y de ámbito nacional, mediante encuesta en línea, enviada por correo electrónico a pediatras socios de la Asociación Española de Pediatría (AEP), entre junio y julio de 2020.
Resultados
Se recibieron 1.414 respuestas. El 31,8% considera que la acupuntura es una ciencia. El 28,1% ha recomendado alguna vez homeopatía a sus pacientes. Un 21,3% reconoce haber utilizado alguna medicina alternativa para mejorar su propia salud. El 3,8% reconoce haber sustituido un tratamiento convencional por una terapia alternativa. Las variables que se asociaron a una mayor predisposición para recomendar homeopatía fueron: sexo femenino, edad > 45 años, trabajo en atención primaria y en un sistema de salud privado.
Conclusiones
El Comité de Medicamentos de la AEP aporta con esta encuesta nuevos datos que se consideran preocupantes y que merecen una seria reflexión sobre el uso de las pseudociencias en nuestro país. Un significativo porcentaje de pediatras están recomendando a los padres que administren a sus hijos tratamientos no avalados por la evidencia científica, con todas las consecuencias negativas y perjuicios que esto puede conllevar, sobre todo si se sustituye el tratamiento convencional.}

Objective
This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of DRESS for emergency clinicians.
Discussion
DRESS is a severe hypersensitivity reaction which can involve multiple organ systems, including the skin, lymphatic system, lungs, kidneys, and heart. Treatment is primarily supportive care combined with removal of the offending agent and initiation of corticosteroids. Additional options include cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin, and N-acetylcysteine.
Conclusion
It is important for the emergency clinician to be aware of the diagnosis and management of DRESS in order to best optimize care for these patients.}

Bio-organometallics, metallo-therapy, metallo-diagnostics, medicine and environmental chemistry” is now established in Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry IV. However, it is unlikely to have existed for the first volumes of COMC. The application of organometallic drugs and the discovery of natural systems utilizing organometallic moieties is, nevertheless, nowadays a flourishing area of research. This volume assists bioinorganic chemists, coordination and medicinal chemists, and those interested in new-to-nature reactions. It also includes opportunities for green and sustainable organometallic catalysis. Nature's methods of employing organometallic chemistry for catalysis and human attempts to mimic nature's techniques by both building and optimizing synthetic analogs are examined in this volume, as well as the utilization of organometallic complexes to diagnose and treat diseases.}

In this paper, a memetic algorithm, specifically a Multi-Objective Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm (MOSFLA) has been developed, implemented, and applied to solve the query-oriented extractive multi-document text summarization problem. Experiments have been conducted with datasets from Text Analysis Conference (TAC), and the obtained results have been evaluated with Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics. The results have shown that the proposed approach has achieved important improvements with respect to the works of scientific literature. Specifically, 25.41%, 7.13%, and 30.22% of percentage improvements in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4 scores have been respectively reached. In addition, MOSFLA has been applied to medicine texts from the Topically Diverse Query Focus Summarization (TD-QFS) dataset as a case study.}

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
To understand the current state of radiology residents' exposure to nuclear medicine and molecular imaging (NM/MI), determine key factors that may attract more trainees into the field, and identify differentiating aspects between those specializing in NM/MI and those who are not.
Materials and Methods
An anonymous web-based survey was sent to contacts at all diagnostic radiology residency programs in the United States for dissemination to their residents, collecting information about trainees' NM/MI exposure during residency and factors that may attract them to NM/MI.
Results
A total of 198 trainees responded to the survey, 34 of whom plan on pursuing a career in NM/MI. Most trainees reported early exposure to NM/MI during residency; most (97.4%) reported ample exposure to general NM/MI and oncologic studies. Less than 3% of trainees reported adequate exposure to therapies, neurological applications, molecular imaging/research advances, and physics. Respondents reported a need for better quality education (38.9%) and exposure to mentors (28.8%) as ways to attract trainees to NM/MI. Routinely encountered clinical pathology was the most interesting for those specializing in NM/MI (29.4%), whereas lifestyle was the most attractive aspect of NM/MI for those not pursuing a career in the field (27.4%). NM/MI-associated research was the least attractive for those specializing in NM/MI (35.3%), while job market concerns was the least attractive aspect for those not specializing in NM/MI (37.2%). Trainees planning to specialize in NM/MI reported higher satisfaction with their orientation to NM/MI during their first clinical rotation compared to those who do not plan to specialize in the field (3.03/5.00 and 2.67/5.00, respectively, p = 0.04).
Conclusion
This survey highlights several factors that training programs and national societies can target to improve interest in NM/MI among radiology residents. We found that optimized education initiatives, including improved orientation to the field, increased mentoring, and career opportunities are essential levers for recruiting radiology trainees into the NM/MI workforce.}

Neuroprotective Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced in alternative medicine from early days. TCM-derived neuroprotective compounds, such as Chrysin, Cannabidiol, Toonasinoids, and β-asaron, exert significant effectiveness's towards Parkinson's disease (PD). Further, these neuroprotective TCM showed antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-septic, analgesic properties. Recent research showed that the reduction in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased the α-synuclein (α-syn) toxicity and enhanced the dopaminergic neuron regenerations, the main hallmarks of PD. Therefore, the neuroprotective effects of novel TCM due to its antiradical activities needed deep investigations.
Aims of the study
This review aims to enlighten the neuroprotective TCM and its components with their antioxidative properties to the scientific community for future research.
Method
The relevant information on the neuroprotective TCM was gathered from scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Wiley Online Library, ACS Publications, and CNKI). Information was also gained from MS and Ph.D. thesis, books, and online databases. The literature cited in this review dates from 2001 to June 2, 0201.
Results
Novel therapies for PD are accessible, mostly rely on Rivastigmine and Donepezil, offers to slow down the progression of disease at an early stage but embraces lots of disadvantages. Researchers are trying to find a potential drug against PD, which is proficient at preventing or curing the disease progress, but still needed to be further identified. Oxidative insult and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be the main culprit of neurodegenerations. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the only causative agent in all interactions, leading to PD, from mitochondrial dysfunctions, α-syn aggregative toxicity, and DA neurons degenerations. It is evident from the redox balance, which seems an imperative therapeutic approach against PD and was necessary for the significant neuronal activities.
Conclusion
Our study is explaining the newly discovered TCM and their neuroprotective and antioxidative properties. But also bring up the possible treatment approaches against PD for future researchers.}

abstract = {Summary
Objectives
The Japanese herbal medicine kyoseihatekigan (KHG) has been used to alleviate the symptoms of croaky voice and globus hystericus, and each of its components has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial actions of KHG on the vocal folds remain largely unknown. We examined the effects of KHG on rat vocal fold wound healing and assessed its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
Study Design
Animal model.
Methods
The vocal folds of Sprague-Dawley rats were unilaterally injured under endoscopy. Rats were divided into three groups based on KHG dosing from pre injury day 4 to post injury day 3: 0 mg/kg/day (sham group), 500 mg/kg/day (1% KHG group) and 1000 mg/kg/day (2% KHG group). Histologic changes were examined to assess the degree of inflammation and oxidative stress at day 3, and fibrosis at day 56. In addition, gene expression related to pro-inflammatory cytokines and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) signaling was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
Results
Histologic analysis showed that the 1% and 2% KHG treatments significantly decreased cell infiltration and the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenalx-immunopositive area, and increased hyaluronic acid at day 3. Both KHG treatments significantly decreased fibrosis at day 56. qPCR revealed that mRNA of interleukin-1β and cyclooxygenase-2 were significantly suppressed at day 1 and TGF-β1 mRNA was significantly downregulated at day 5 in both KHG groups.
Conclusions
The current findings suggest that KHG has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in the early phase of vocal fold wound healing, which can lead to better wound healing with less scar formation.}

Interestingly, 4d exhibited over 40-fold more potent activity against cisplatin-resistant HepG2/DPP cells while showing lower cytotoxicity in normal LX-2 cells. The mechanism studies revealed 4d greatly stabilized G-quadruplex DNA leading to intracellular c-MYC expression downregulation, blocked G2/M-phase cell cycle by affecting related p-cdc25c, cdc2 and cyclin B1 expressions, and induced apoptosis by a ROS-promoted PI3K/Akt-mitochondrial pathway. Furthermore, 4d possessed good pharmacokinetic properties and significantly inhibited the tumor growth in the H22 liver cancer xenograft mouse model without obvious toxicity. Altogether, the remarkably biological profiles of 4d both in vitro and in vivo would make it a promising candidate for HCC therapy.}

Finally, this meta-analysis showed that comparing with antidepressants, DXS exhibited similar effect to antidepressants in the clinical comprehensive effect [RR = 1.04, 95% CI (0.77, 1.40); P = 0.81] and decrease in Self-Rating Depression Scale scores [WMD = 0.89, 95% CI (−6.33, 8.11); P = 0.81], while lower effect in Hamilton Depression Scale scores [SMD = −0.29, 95% CI (−0.55, −0.03); P = 0.03]; Furthermore, DXS plus antidepressants can significantly improve the clinical comprehensive effect [RR = 1.23, 95% CI (1.17, 1.29); P < 0.00001] and decrease the Hamilton Depression Scale scores [SMD = 1.04, 95% CI (0.51, 1.58); P = 0.0001] than pure antidepressants.
Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis approved an efficient role of DXS in improving depression in clinical randomized controlled trials. However, further evidence from large samples and high-quality randomized controlled trials is needed to be investigated for a reliable conclusion about DXS in the treatment of depression.}

abstract = {Outcomes
1. Increase awareness about the benefits of palliative medicine (PM) referrals among patients with advanced or recurrent gynecologic malignancies, especially among ethnic groups with healthcare disparities (non-White patients) 2. Identify disparities in referrals and utilization of palliative medicine, medication usage, and aggressive interventions at the end of life (EoL) in minority groups affected with advanced or recurrent gynecologic malignancies
Background
Early referral to palliative medicine of patients with advanced gynecological malignancies may reduce hospitalizations and procedures performed at EoL. Historically, non-White populations have been disproportionally affected by healthcare disparities and access to effective symptom management in cancer.
Aim Statement
Evaluate the current referral practice in gynecologic oncology to palliative medicine and EoL interventions among patients with advanced or recurrent gynecologic malignancies in a university-based cancer center.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study including patients (186) with stage II-IV or recurrent ovarian, endometrial, cervical, and vulvar cancer. Demographics, palliative medicine-related statistics, and EoL-related descriptive statistics are shown. Variables were analyzed via with chi-square, T, and Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression models. All the statistical tests were two-sided, with significance set at p < .05.
Results
Mean age 58.35 years. The majority were English speakers (69%), with significant representation of minorities: Black (24.7%) and Hispanic (22.6%). Ovarian cancer was the most common malignancy (37.6%). PM referral was placed on 44.2%; 37% were actually seen, mostly for symptom management (73.1%). PM patients had higher use of symptom management medications (p < .004). Over one third of the patients were referred at EoL. Black patients used more appetite stimulants (OR 0.456, CI, 0.226-0.920, p = .028), higher ED visits (26.1% 7 or more compared to 10.7%, p = 0.035), and higher use of chemotherapy in EoL (OR 0.249, CI 0.079-0.786, p = 0.049) compared to Whites. Language spoken was not a significant factor associated with medication use or interventions at the EoL.
Conclusions and Implications
Even though we demonstrated a higher-than-usual PM referral pattern, there are opportunities for improving patients’ holistic management. Racial disparities were noticed in resource utilization but not in referral patterns. Further studies are needed on cachexia, race, and appetite stimulants’ role in gynecologic malignancies and on reasons for more aggressive EoL care for minorities. Given our institution's racial and ethnic diversity, this study serves as a cornerstone for those prospective studies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Urbanization has been associated with increased prevalence of inflammatory skin diseases due to increasing environmental irritants and air pollution. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are disproportionately impacted by this trend due to exposure to irritants, allergens, and limited access to appropriate hygiene resources. While recent studies have reported higher rates of cutaneous infections in PEH compared to the general population, there is limited data on the prevalence of inflammatory skin disease. To identify allergen and irritant exposure on skin disease in PEH, we performed a chart review of 193 patients seen through the university's weekly street-based medical teams.
Methods
A chart review was conducted of patients reporting dermatological complaints seen by Miami Street Medicine team. Information regarding dermatological diagnoses were documented by members of the study team on a HIPAA compliant database.Patients were given information regarding the review and provided oral consent to participate in the study. MSM brings healthcare directly to the unsheltered population. Patients receive health screening, medication management, wound care, chronic disease management, education/counseling, and longitudinal care coordination with routine follow-up visits.
Results
Over a 12-month period, 193 individuals reported cutaneous symptoms. Most common dermatological diagnoses include infectious conditions (n=51, 26.4%) , inflammatory diseases (n=44, 22.8%), miscellaneous/unspecified (n=32, 16.6%), ulcerations/erosions/wounds (n=26, 13.5%), cutaneous neoplasm/UV damage (n=19, 9.8%), pruritus (n=13, 6.7%), and nail disorders (n=8, 4.2%).
Conclusion
Our research describes preliminary findings regarding prevalence of cutaneous disease in PEH. Many diagnoses in this cohort were inflammatory, including contact dermatitis. Interventions and management strategies for PEH are needed to combat possible health disparities.}

abstract = {Licorice, a medicinal herb and food flavor ingredient, has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the past 4000 years. In this study, we propose a new quality evaluation approach for licorice quality control based on the key quality attributes commonly used in TCM. The high quality of TCM formulations is ensured by verifying the genuine origin and implementing good agricultural and collection practices for each medicinal herb. In our study, the genuine production area, the harvest season, and the number of growth years were considered the key quality attributes of TCM. To ensure the representativeness of our analysis, we obtained a total of 158 licorice sample batches that differed in the number of growth years, the location of the production areas, and the season for harvesting. Initially, the 158 sample batches were subjected to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-ﬂight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). A preliminary screen identified 11 licorice compounds related to the three key quality attributes of TCM . An analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS) verified the presence of 34 compounds in all licorice samples. These 34 compounds included the 11 compounds related to the three key quality attributes of the samples, along with other bioactive components identified in previous studies. After using UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS to assess the signal peak intensities of the 34 compounds, we selected 17 licorice compounds to establish sample content evaluation indices, which were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography at four different wavelengths in all 158 licorice sample batches. Finally, the screen identified nine compounds that were closely associated with the quality attributes of licorice based on principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Our results suggested that liquiritin and eight other compounds could be used as quality control indicators of licorice, which provided a foundation to establish the TCM quality composite evaluation index (TCM QCEI). In summary, this research concept can serve as a reference for research on quality markers and the evaluation of TCM.}

This study aims to evaluate the attitudes, practices, and effects of education in oral pathology and medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.
Study Design
Dental students and faculty members were invited to participate through an online questionnaire with 31 questions on agreement and frequency regarding the teaching and learning process before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results
A total of 318 individuals involved in oral pathology and medicine education participated. Before the pandemic, discussion of clinical cases was the main teaching method (73%), and written exam (91%) was the main testing method. During the pandemic, remote synchronous lectures (77%) and individual assignments (69%) were applied. For the learning process, 53% totally disagree and 24% disagree that remote lectures are better than conventional ones. Undergraduate students have more difficulties in online access than lecturers (P < .0001), and students have a greater lack of self-reported interest when compared to lecturers (P < .0001).
Conclusions
There was a significant change in the attitudes and practices in teaching oral pathology and medicine. Thus, the effects on the professional training need to be considered as a factor that may reflect on clinical practice. In addition, there is a need for digital inclusion policies.}

The BrainDrugs-Epilepsy Study is part of the established Lundbeck Foundation funded BrainDrugs research alliance (braindrugs.nru.dk). The study aims to identify biomarkers of treatment outcome as well as cognitive and psychiatric comorbidity in patients with a first epileptic seizure and epilepsy. Our goal is to provide a patient-level prediction of treatment response.
Methods
In a prospective cohort study design, we will consecutively include a total of 200 patients who have experienced their first epileptic seizure and 150 newly diagnosed patients with epilepsy (≥ 16 years old). We will systematically collect data at baseline and one, three, and five years after inclusion. Neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessments will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging tools such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain scans using the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A-binding radioligand [11C]-UCB-J. After completing the baseline investigations, patients diagnosed with epilepsy start anti-seizure medication (ASM) treatment with either lamotrigine or levetiracetam. Patients will be monitored every three months. For daily monitoring, we will use a mobile app. Our clinical endpoints are 1) ASM treatment response, 2) development of a second seizure/epilepsy diagnosis, 3) psychiatric symptoms, 4) cognitive disturbances, and 5) quality of life.
Discussion
We hypothesize that seizures, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms share common neurobiological mechanisms that can be identified using MRI, PET, and EEG. We will assess how these biomarkers change over time and in response to treatment, providing novel insights into disease trajectories in the first years of epilepsy.

Three CPs (CP50, CP70, and CP80) were obtained and comprised rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose, and galactose in different proportions. The CPs contained different amounts of total sugar, uronic acid, and proteins. These also exhibited different physical properties, including particle size, molecular weight, microstructure, and apparent viscosity. Scavenging abilities of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), 1,1′-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals of CP80 were more potent compared to those of the other two CPs. Furthermore, CP80 significantly increased serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and hepatic lipase (HL) activity in the liver, while decreasing the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), along with LPS activity. Therefore, CP80 may serve as a natural novel lipid regulator in the field of medicinal and functional food.}

It is the second most predominant disease causing highest number of deaths globally. Majority of cancer cases are due to the changes in environmental factors such as dietary, exposure to chemicals and pollution, while the remaining cases are due to the alterations in the genetic makeup. The current treatment strategies available against cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The major drawback of these approaches is the severe side effects resulting from its nonspecific nature. In addition, the cells also acquire resistance against chemotherapy and radiotherapy, making it necessary to improve the existing cancer therapies. A major breakthrough in cancer treatment is the application of targeted therapy (precision therapy/personalized therapy), which deals with small molecules that can directly act on specific drug targets based on the genomic and metabolic profile of individuals. Despite the advantages of targeted therapy, there are constraints in terms of time, economy and accuracy. The huge pool of genomic, transcriptomic, and expression data along with the relevant clinical profiles requires ardent modes for efficient consolidation. Integrated computational pipelines and bioinformatics approaches can address these aspects to escalate clinical translation of precision medicine. This chapter summarizes the current scenario and future perspectives of precision medicine under the lens of computational biology thereby addressing the drawbacks and solutions.}

Blood samples were prepared using the protein precipitation method and atazanavir was selected as the internal standard (IS). Separation was performed on an Agilent ZORBAX eclipse plus C18 (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) column using acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase for gradient elution. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min and the injection volume was 2 μL. Agilent Jet Stream electrospray ionization was used for mass spectrometry detection under positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode at a transition of m/z 629.3→447.3 for lopinavir, m/z 721.3→296.1 for ritonavir, and m/z 705.4→168.1 for the IS. The method showed good linearity in the concentration range of 25–2500 ng/mL (r=0.9981) for lopinavir and 5–500 ng/mL (r=0.9984) for ritonavir. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were both within ±15%. Items, such as dilution reliability and residual effect, were also within the acceptable limits. The method was used to determine the effects of five types of traditional Chinese medicines on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir in rats. The pharmacokinetic results showed that the half-life of ritonavir in the groups administered Lianhua Qingwen granules and Huoxiang Zhengqi capsules combined with lopinavir/ritonavir was prolonged by approximately 1.5- to 2-fold relative to that in the control group. Similarly, the pharmacokinetic parameters of lopinavir were altered. Overall, the results of this study offer important theoretical parameters for the effective clinical use of five types of traditional Chinese medicines combined with lopinavir/ritonavir to reduce the occurrence of clinical adverse reactions.}

The characteristics and determinants of health and disease are often organized in space, reflecting our spatially extended nature. Understanding the influence of such factors requires models capable of capturing spatial relations. Drawing on statistical parametric mapping, a framework for topological inference well established in the realm of neuroimaging, we propose and validate an approach to the spatial analysis of diverse clinical data—GeoSPM—based on differential geometry and random field theory. We evaluate GeoSPM across an extensive array of synthetic simulations encompassing diverse spatial relationships, sampling, and corruption by noise, and demonstrate its application on large-scale data from UK Biobank. GeoSPM is readily interpretable, can be implemented with ease by non-specialists, enables flexible modeling of complex spatial relations, exhibits robustness to noise and under-sampling, offers principled criteria of statistical significance, and is through computational efficiency readily scalable to large datasets. We provide a complete, open-source software implementation.}
