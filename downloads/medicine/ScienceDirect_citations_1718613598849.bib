Objective
To promote the recognition and care of patients with female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), we aimed to evaluate the awareness, clinical experience and knowledge of FGM/C among female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) specialists. FGM/C is a cultural practice whereby there is removal of external female genitalia for non-therapeutic reasons. Despite the high prevalence of urogynecologic complications, there is a paucity of literature discussing FGM/C from the lens of urologists and urogynecologists.
Methods
By cross-sectional design, we distributed a 27-item survey via email to members of the Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. We collected variables pertaining to previous FGM/C education, clinical confidence, cultural and medical knowledge, and desire for future education.
Results
A total of 54 US-based, mostly urologists and FPMRS specialists, completed the survey. All providers had heard of FGM/C; however only 13% received formal education during medical training. Over 50% had encountered a patient with FGM/C in clinical practice. Only 19% and 13% felt completely confident recognizing and discussing FGM/C, respectively. Seventy percent believed religious doctrine informed FGM/C practice and 24% correctly identified FGM/C type on clinical representation. Finally, only 17% of respondents were aware of FGM/C guidelines, and providers expressed a desire for increased availability of multimodal resources.
Conclusion
Education regarding FGM/C remains sparse and variable for US FPMRS specialists. Cultural and clinical knowledge is also lacking, which is a detriment to patient care. In order to strengthen awareness and knowledge, we must develop high-quality FGM/C educational resources for urologists and gynecologists.}

keywords = {Myocardial ischemia, Caffeine},
abstract = {Background
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a well-established, non-invasive imaging procedure for the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. With the increasing use of pharmacologic stress agents in myocardial perfusion imaging, strict preparation, including caffeine abstinence, is required. The aim of this review was to determine the effect of caffeine consumed prior to nuclear cardiac stress testing on the diagnostic accuracy.
Methods
Medline, Embase and CINAHL were searched from the earliest available time until August 2022. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2. Data pertaining to diagnostic accuracy were analysed using meta-analysis where appropriate and overall certainty of evidence evaluated using the Grades of Research, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.
Results
Six studies (307 participants) from a yield of 735 articles were identified. Meta-analysis of two studies found no difference in the left ventricular ejection fraction of patients pre and post caffeine consumption (MD -0.31 %, 95% CI -4.32% to 3.7%). Meta-analysis of three studies found there was uncertainty as to whether caffeine consumption affected reversibility (MD -2.16 segments 95% CI -4.61 to 0.28) and descriptive summary of three studies found mixed results for size of stress defects.
Conclusion
The low quality evidence synthesized in this systematic review suggests caffeine may affect the diagnostic accuracy in myocardial perfusion imaging for ischemia detection in patients with chest pain and intermediate-to-high risk of coronary artery disease.
Résumé
Contexte
L'imagerie de perfusion myocardique (IPM) est une procédure d'imagerie non invasive bien établie pour le diagnostic et l'évaluation des patients souffrant d'une maladie coronarienne connue ou suspectée. L'utilisation croissante d'agents de stress pharmacologiques dans l'imagerie de perfusion myocardique exige une préparation stricte, y compris l'abstinence de caféine. L'objectif de cette étude était de déterminer l'effet de la caféine consommée avant une épreuve d'effort cardiaque nucléaire sur la précision du diagnostic.
Méthodologie
Des recherches ont été effectuées dans Medline, Embase et CINAHL depuis la première date disponible jusqu'en août 2022. La qualité méthodologique a été évaluée à l'aide du Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2. Les données relatives à la précision diagnostique ont été analysées par méta-analyse, le cas échéant, et la certitude globale des preuves a été évaluée à l'aide de l'approche Grades of Research, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (niveaux de recherche, d'appréciation, de développement et d'évaluation).
Résultats
Six études (307 participants) ont été identifiées sur un total de 735 articles. La méta-analyse de deux études n'a révélé aucune différence dans la fraction d'éjection du ventricule gauche des patients avant et après la consommation de caféine (MD -0,31%, 95% CI -4,32% à 3,7%). La méta-analyse de trois études a révélé une incertitude quant à l'influence de la consommation de caféine sur la réversibilité (ET -2,16 segments, IC à 95 % -4,61 à 0,28) et le résumé descriptif de trois études a donné des résultats mitigés quant à la taille des anomalies d'effort.
Conclusion
Les données de faible qualité synthétisées dans cette revue systématique suggèrent que la caféine peut affecter la précision diagnostique de l'imagerie de perfusion myocardique pour la détection de l'ischémie chez les patients souffrant de douleurs thoraciques et présentant un risque moyen à élevé de maladie coronarienne.}

abstract = {Introduction
Over the last decade, tranexamic acid (TXA) has been incorporated into treatment algorithms for a multitude of emergent conditions and the evidence surrounding its role in emergency medicine continues to evolve.
Objective
The objective of this literature review is to provide an evidence-based approach to the utilization of TXA in the emergency department.
Discussion
The most robust trials suggest TXA may offer a modest improvement in mortality in patients at risk of significant bleeding from trauma, but is not beneficial in spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding. The role of TXA in other clinical scenarios is less clear and requires clinical judgment.
Conclusion
Tranexamic acid appears to be a reasonable adjunct for the emergency medicine clinician to consider in the management of many hemorrhagic conditions and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema. Additional high-quality research in these areas is needed to further identity patients who may benefit most from TXA.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Ninjin'yoeito (NYT), a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine consisting of 12 herbs, has been reported to improve cognitive dysfunction, depression, and neurological recovery in patients with neurovascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Several studies have reported that the NYT components exert neurotrophic, neurogenic, and neuroprotective effects. In addition, exercise enhances neuroprotection and functional recovery after stroke. Rehabilitative exercises and pharmacological agents induce neurophysiological plasticity, leading to functional recovery in stroke patients. These reports indicate that NYT treatment and exercise may promote functional recovery following stroke through their beneficial effects. However, no study has determined the effects of NYT and the possible mechanisms of neurorepair and functional recovery after stroke.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of NYT and exercise on neuroprotection and functional recovery and the underlying mechanisms in a rat ischemic stroke model.
Materials and methods
Stroke was induced with 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. After stroke, the rats were assigned to four groups: ischemia reperfusion (IR), NYT, exercise (Ex), and NYT + Ex. NYT-treated rats were fed a diet containing 1% NYT one day after stroke. Exercise was performed using a motorized treadmill for 5 days a week (8–15 m/min, 20 min/day), starting 3 days after stroke. The NYT treatment and exercise were continued for 4 weeks after the stroke. Infarct volume, neurological deficits, sensorimotor functions, expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) and B (TrkB), caspase-3 activity, and the p-Akt/Akt ratio were examined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.
Results
Compared to the IR group, all treated groups indicated reduced infarct volumes. The NYT + Ex group showed significantly improved waking time and beam walking score compared with the IR group. The expression of NGF/TrkA/p-TrkA and BDNF/TrkB was significantly increased in the NYT + Ex group compared with those in the IR group, whereas the number of caspase-3 positive cells around the lesion was significantly lower in the NYT + Ex group than in the IR group. In addition, the ratio of p-Akt/Akt was significantly higher in the NYT + Ex group than in the IR group.
Conclusions
This study suggests that NYT in combination with exercise provides neuroprotective effects and improves sensorimotor function by stimulating NGF/TrkA and BDNF/TrkB, and by activating the Akt pathway in ischemic stroke of rats. NYT may be an effective adjunctive agent in post-stroke rehabilitation.}

Whilst often successful in acute pain, pharmacological treatment is rarely successful on its own in the management of chronic pain due to the high number of patients needed to treat to achieve a clinically meaningful improvement in function, quality of life and pain scores. There are also significant side effects in the short and long term. Recent re-analysis of clinic trial data focused on individual responder rates, showed that there is a cohort of patients who achieve 50% pain relief with subsequent improvement in physical function. To avoid intolerable side effects from medication used for chronic pain, titration needs to be slow and aimed towards the agreed risk–benefit between patients and treating physician with a clear plan for weaning and cessation if these goals are not achieved. Pain-orientated physiotherapy, either on its own or as part of a pain management programme, should be offered and medication reduced or weaned after restoration of function has been achieved.}

Our aim is to develop a popPK model of both aripiprazole and its metabolite dehydro-aripiprazole in patients treated with LAI aripiprazole, and to personalize the dosing regimen of aripiprazole across different sub-groups of patients. This is a prospective study investigating the pharmacokinetics of LAI aripiprazole. A total of 93 patients were included, 21 for model development and 71 for external model evaluation. A one-compartment model with linear absorption and elimination adequately described both aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole concentrations. The weight of the patients has been shown to be the factor that most influences the absorption. However, the metabolizing phenotype for CYP2D6 and the concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of this cytochrome have been shown to be the covariates that most influence total drug exposure. This is the first popPK model developed for LAI aripiprazole that includes aripiprazole and its main active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole. It provides a personalized dosage recommendation that maximizes the probability of achieving optimal therapeutic concentrations and minimizes the difficulties associated with trial-and-error therapeutic strategies carried out in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Purpose
To examine the trends between various categories of institutions with their respective published orthopaedic sports medicine content and to determine the publication output and citation rate from the 25 highest-ranked medical schools compared with lower-ranked institutions.
Methods
Publications between 2015 and 2019 from the American Journal of Sports Medicine, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, and Arthroscopy were categorized into university/university affiliated hospitals, non-university affiliated teaching hospitals, public/semi-government research institutes, nonprofit research institutes, private sector institutions, government institutions, and other institutions. Citation rates were collected from PubMed for the first and corresponding author. Similarly, corresponding authors were stratified by U.S. News and World Report 2021 medical school research rankings.
Results
Of the 12,152 publications identified, 5,044 publications met the inclusion criteria. Nonprofit research institutions garnered the greatest number of citations on average (6.44 based on first author, SD 8.83, n = 214; 6.62 based on corresponding author, SD 9.65, n = 208; P < .001), while university/university-affiliated hospitals produced the majority of published articles (77.0% based on first author, 76.8% based on corresponding author), but had lower average citation rates (4.48 based on first author, SD 6.67, n = 3,886; 4.44 based on corresponding author, SD 6.55, n = 3,873; P < .001). Furthermore, of 1953 medical school publications, the top 25 accounted for 53.1% of publications; however, there was no statistical difference between their citation rates and those of lower rankings (P = 0.47).
Conclusions
Publications are cited at different rates, depending on their institution of origin. In addition, high-ranking medical schools produce a disproportionately greater output of publications than lower-ranking schools, but there is no statistically significant difference in citation rates on an individual publication basis.
Clinical Relevance
Knowing how an institution’s ranking influences publication and citation rates can help us understand bias in the scientific literature.}

abstract = {Background/aim
Human dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hDP-MSCs) are a promising source of progenitor cells for bone tissue engineering. Nanocomposites made of calcium phosphate especially hydroxyapatite (HA) offer an impressive solution for orthopedic and dental implants. The combination of hDP-MSCs and ceramic nanocomposites has a promising therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Despite the calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite (HA)-based nanocomposites offer a good solution for orthopedic and dental implants, the heavy load-bearing clinical applications require higher mechanical strength, which is not of the HA’ properties that have low mechanical strength. Herein, the outcomes of using fabricated ceramic nanocomposites of hydroxyapatite/titania/calcium silicate mixed at different ratios (C1, C2, and C3) and impregnated with hDP-MSCs both in in vitro cultures and rabbit model of induced tibial bone defect were investigated. Our aim is to find out a new approach that would largely enhance the osteogenic differentiation of hDP-MSCs and has a therapeutic potential in bone regeneration.
Subjects and methods
Human DP-MSCs were isolated from the dental pulp of the third molar and cultured in vitro. Alizarin Red staining was performed at different time points to assess the osteogenic differentiation. Flow cytometer was used to quantify the expression of hDP-MSCs unique surface markers. Rabbits were used as animal models to evaluate the therapeutic potential of osteogenically differentiated hDP-MSCs impregnated with ceramic nanocomposites of hydroxyapatite/tatiana/calcium silicate (C1, C2, and C3). Histopathological examination and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to evaluate bone healing potential in the rabbit induced tibial defects three weeks post-transplantation.
Results
The hDP-MSCs showed high proliferative and osteogenic potential in vitro culture. Their osteogenic differentiation was accelerated by the ceramic nanocomposites’ scaffold and revealed bone defect’s healing in transplanted rabbit groups compared to control groups. Histopathological and SEM analysis of the transplanted hDP-MSCs/ceramic nanocomposites showed the formation of new bone filling in the defect area 3 weeks post-implantation. Accelerate osseointegration and enhancement of the bone-bonding ability of the prepared nanocomposites were also confirmed by SEM.
Conclusions
The results strongly suggested that ceramic nanocomposites of hydroxyapatite/ titania /calcium silicate (C1, C2, and C3) associated with hDP-MSCs have a therapeutic potential in bone healing in a rabbit model. Hence, the combined osteogenic system presented here is recommended for application in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.}

1. Participants will be able to identify the aspects of educational content that are tailored specifically to PM&R residents. 2. Participants will be able to explain the curriculum's educational techniques and the acceptability and usefulness of those techniques to PM&R residents.
Key Message
A novel two-hour curriculum on communication skills tailored to scenarios faced by PM&R clinicians is relevant, useful, and effective for PM&R residents, and could be used in PM&R programs that are unable to offer such education due to time and faculty constraints.
Abstract
Background: Physiatrists require communication skills for complex medical decision-making, yet a third of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) residency programs offer no palliative care education, primarily due to shortage of faculty expertise and teaching time (1).
Objective
To design, implement and assess a novel communication curriculum tailored to PM&R that incorporates active learning within a 2-hour didactic.
Methods
The curriculum taught two skills, giving headlines and making recommendations, using the format of didactic, demonstration, and drill. Each drills utilized evidence-based teaching techniques of “everybody writes” followed by “turn and talk (2).” The curriculum emphasized giving headlines with a functional prognosis using patient-centered outcomes. To drill recommendations, residents were presented with the patient's values, and asked to synthesize the overarching values and formulate a comprehensive recommendation. Residents were surveyed on the relevancy of the curriculum to PM&R, usefulness of the educational format, and preparedness to perform communication skills before and after the curriculum on a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
Of 20 residents, 100% found the curriculum relevant and appropriate for level of training (≥3 on Likert scale). The didactic, demonstration and drills were useful to 100%, 100% and 95% of residents, respectively (≥3 on Likert scale). Compared to pre-curriculum, average self-reported preparedness (≥3 on Likert scale) increased by 1.4 for giving headlines (p < 0.01) and by 1.5 for making a recommendation (p < 0.01).
Conclusions
The educational format of didactic, demonstration and drill was useful and highly accepted. PM&R residents found the curriculum to be relevant and increased their preparedness to perform both communication skills all while fitting into a busy residency didactic schedule.

abstract = {Background
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing is a promising approach for tailoring therapy in patients with cancer. We report hereby the results from a prospective study where we investigated the impact of comprehensive molecular profiling of ctDNA in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Patients and Methods
Genomic analysis was performed using the FoundationOne Liquid CDx Assay [324 genes, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability status]. Each individual genomic report was reviewed and discussed weekly by a multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB). Actionable targets were classified by ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) tier leading to molecular-based treatment suggestions wherever it was possible.
Results
Between December 2020 and November 2021, 1772 patients with metastatic solid tumors underwent molecular profiling. Median time to assay results was 12 days. Results were contributive for 1658 patients (94%). At least one actionable target was detected in 1059 patients (64%) with a total of 1825 actionable alterations including alteration of the DNA damage repair response pathway (n = 336, 18%), high TMB (>16 mutations/Mb; n = 243, 13%), PIK3CA mutations (n = 150, 8%), ERBB family pathway alterations (n = 127, 7%), PTEN alterations (n = 95, 5%), FGFR alterations (n = 67, 4%) and MET activations (n = 13, 0.7%). The MTB recommended a matched therapy for 597 patients (56%) with a total of 819 therapeutic orientations: clinical trials (n = 639, 78%), off-label/compassionate use (n = 81, 10%), approved drug (n = 51, 6%), and early access program (n = 48, 6%). In total, 122 patients (21%) were treated. Among the assessable patients (n = 107), 4 (4%) had complete response, 35 (33%) had partial response, 27 (25%) had stable disease, and 41 (38%) a progressive disease as best response. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 4.7 months (95% confidence interval 2.7-6.7 months) and 8.3 months (95% confidence interval 4.7-11.9 months) respectively.
Conclusions
ctDNA sequencing with a large panel is an efficient approach to match patients with advanced cancer with targeted therapies.}

Fish were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups of 3 replicates per treatment (20 fish/replicate) and reared for 8 weeks. The results of the test showed that: 1) Feeding 1 % FCHM significantly increased the weight gain rate (P < 0.01) and specific growth rate (P < 0.05) of juvenile largemouth bass compared with the control group. 2) Compared with the control group, FCHM had no significant effect on the body composition of juvenile largemouth bass (P > 0.05) but could result in an overall decreasing trend in muscle drip loss, steaming loss, and freezing loss. 3) FCHM significantly increased the activity of SOD, GSH-PX and CAT in the liver of juvenile largemouth bass and decreased the MDA compared to that of the control group (P < 0.01). (4) Compared with the control group, FCHM significantly increased the relative mRNA expression of the intestinal anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β and IL-10 (P < 0.01) and decreased the pro-inflammatory factors IL-8, IL-15 (P < 0.01) and TNF-α (P < 0.05) of juvenile Largemouth bass.

Following FDA's PAT initiative, it is imperative that critical process parameters (CPP) that significantly impact critical quality attributes (CQA's) of a process are monitored and controlled strictly. It is also well known that viable biomass is one such CPP, or a Key Performance Indicator, which can impact CQA's in a bioprocess. Dielectric spectroscopy, referred to as capacitance measurement, has been used for monitoring biomass in bioprocesses in real time routinely over the past two decades. This technology has been used in the industry for applications ranging from batch fingerprinting, troubleshooting, optimization of nutrient feed, viral infection, cell density control, scale up, among others. Owing to its success in bioprocess applications, dielectric spectroscopy has also been used in regenerative medicine applications and monitoring cell density in 3D tissues. Moreover, this technology has resulted in significant improvement in productivity and reduction in COGS in these applications.
Methods, Results & Conclusion
This presentation will cover the use of capacitance technology to measure CAR-T cells in real time, while identifying real time growth trend, activation, expansion, media exchange and dilutions. Another study will be presented that utilizes this technology for monitoring PBMC's in a flow through cell. Measurement settings and flow rates were optimized for this work, which can be used for similar studies in the future. Capacitance was also used to measure T cells from different donors. The work presented wil indicate that capacitance probes may not need to be calibrated differently for cells derived from different donors. Finally, studies will be presented to demonstrate the use of this technology to reduce media costs up to 40% (in a perfusion application) and improve productivity 40 fold (in vaccine production).}

Screening the Malaria Box against the in vivo growth of the B. microti parasite helped with the discovery of new, effective anti-bovine Babesia drugs, including MMV667488, MMV007285, and MMV019881. Of note, MMV019881 exhibited the highest anti-B. microti efficacy in vivo among the screened MMV compounds. The APfp results revealed that the maximum structural similarity (MSS) was observed between MMV007285, diminazene aceturate, and imidocarb dipropionate (ID). In the same way, clofazimine (CF) and MMV667488 showed the MSS with either each other based on the analysis. The distance matrix and molecular weight correlation findings highlight the possible potential antibabesial efficacy of MMV667488, ID, and CF when administrated as a combination therapy. In conclusion, in the current study new potent antibabesial drug, MMV019881 was identified. CF and MMV667488 showed the MSS with either each other based on the hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and such relation is confirmed by the distance matrix and molecular weight correlation findings. Such combination therapy might have a potential as a novel regime for treating animal or human babesiosis.}

We reviewed the ACGME program finder database and medical school websites to identify thoracic surgery training programs that: (1) offer visiting student clerkships (VSCs), (2) are affiliated with an institution offering a UIM-VMSCP, (3) are at an institution where the existing UIM-VMSCP specifically offers rotations in CT surgery. The PDs in the second group were surveyed via e-mail, assessing their level of awareness of UIM-VMSCPs at their institution, participation in UIM-VMSCPs over the past 3 years, and desire to participate in a UIM-VMSCP in the future. All (n = 76) ACGME CT surgery training programs were affiliated with institutions that offered VSCs in multiple disciplines. Over half, 55.3%, of the programs offered access to visiting students and 61.8% were at institutions with existing UIM-VMSCPs. Our response rate for the 47 PDs from institutions with UIM-VMSCPs was 38.2%. Of the respondents, 61.1% were aware of the UIM-VMSCP at their institution and 44.4% participated in the past 3 years. Most, 88.9% were interested in participating in their institution's UIM-VMSCP in the future. Only half of CT surgery training programs offer VSCs and even fewer are at institutions with an existing UIM-VMSCP that offers a CT surgery clerkship. This is a lost opportunity to broaden exposure to the specialty and increase diversity within the CT surgery workforce.}

COVID-19 highly caused contagious infections and massive deaths worldwide as well as unprecedentedly disrupting global economies and societies, and the urgent development of new antiviral medications are required. Medicinal herbs are promising resources for the discovery of prophylactic candidate against COVID-19. Considerable amounts of experimental efforts have been made on vaccines and direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), but neither of them was fast and fully developed.
Purpose
This study examined the computational approaches that have played a significant role in drug discovery and development against COVID-19, and these computational methods and tools will be helpful for the discovery of lead compounds from phytochemicals and understanding the molecular mechanism of action of TCM in the prevention and control of the other diseases.
Methods
A search conducting in scientific databases (PubMed, Science Direct, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and Web of Science) found a total of 2172 articles, which were retrieved via web interface of the following websites. After applying some inclusion and exclusion criteria and full-text screening, only 292 articles were collected as eligible articles.
Results
In this review, we highlight three main categories of computational approaches including structure-based, knowledge-mining (artificial intelligence) and network-based approaches. The most commonly used database, molecular docking tool, and MD simulation software include TCMSP, AutoDock Vina, and GROMACS, respectively. Network-based approaches were mainly provided to help readers understanding the complex mechanisms of multiple TCM ingredients, targets, diseases, and networks.
Conclusion
Computational approaches have been broadly applied to the research of phytochemicals and TCM against COVID-19, and played a significant role in drug discovery and development in terms of the financial and time saving.}

However, the challenges of immunogenicity and biocompatibility existed since the application of biomaterials. As a method to solve this problem, the decellularization process removes most living cells from biomaterials to minimize their immunogenicity; and preserves the native structures and compositions that favour cell growth and the subsequent construction of functional tissue. On the other hand, genetic modification of biomaterials aims to achieve specific functions (low immunogenicity, osteogenesis, etc.) or analyse the genetic mechanisms underlying some diseases (cardiac dysfunction, liver fibrosis, etc.). The combination of decellularization and gene modification is highly superior to biomaterials; thus, we must obtain a deeper understanding of these novel biomaterials. In this review, we summarize the fabrication approaches and current applications of genetically modified decellularized biomaterials and then discuss their disadvantages and corresponding future perspectives.}

abstract = {Behavioral aspects of organized sports activity for pediatric athletes are considered in a world consumed with winning at all costs. In the first part of this treatise, we deal with a number of themes faced by our children in their sports play. These concepts include the lure of sports, sports attrition, the mental health of pediatric athletes (i.e., effects of stress, anxiety, depression, suicide in athletes, ADHD and stimulants, coping with injuries, drug use, and eating disorders), violence in sports (i.e., concepts of the abused athlete including sexual abuse), dealing with supervisors (i.e., coaches, parents), peers, the talented athlete, early sports specialization and sports clubs. In the second part of this discussion, we cover ergolytic agents consumed by young athletes in attempts to win at all costs. Sports doping agents covered include anabolic steroids (anabolic-androgenic steroids or AAS), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA), human growth hormone (hGH; also its human recombinant homologue: rhGH), clenbuterol, creatine, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), amphetamines, caffeine and ephedrine. Also considered are blood doping that includes erythropoietin (EPO) and concepts of gene doping. In the last section of this discussion, we look at disabled pediatric athletes that include such concepts as athletes with spinal cord injuries (SCIs), myelomeningocele, cerebral palsy, wheelchair athletes, and amputee athletes; also covered are pediatric athletes with visual impairment, deafness, and those with intellectual disability including Down syndrome. In addition, concepts of autonomic dysreflexia, boosting and atlantoaxial instability are emphasized. We conclude that clinicians and society should protect our precious pediatric athletes who face many challenges in their involvement with organized sports in a world obsessed with winning. There is much we can do to help our young athletes find benefit from sports play while avoiding or blunting negative consequences of organized sport activities.}

Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi capsule (FTZ) is a patented preparation of Chinese herbal medicine that has been used to treat hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and other glucolipid metabolic diseases (GLMDs) in the clinic for almost 10 years. However, how FTZ reduces albuminuria and attenuates diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression is unknown.
Aim of the study
To clarify the effects of FTZ on DKD mice model and to explore the underlying mechanisms.
Materials and methods
We used streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg/d, i.p. for 5 days, consecutively) combined with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce a DKD mouse model, followed by FTZ (1, 2 g/kg/d, i.g.) treatment for 12 weeks. Losartan (30 mg/kg/d, i.g.) was used as a positive control. Measurements of 24 h proteinuria, serum creatinine (SCr), fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and expression levels of fibronectin (FN), collagen IV, inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cells, interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and the nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway in the kidney were examined.
Results
FTZ effectively decreased 24 h proteinuria, Scr, FBG, TC, TG, and LDL-C levels, inhibited mesangial cell expansion, reduced FN and collagen IV accumulation, and F4/80+ macrophage cell infiltration and Ly-6G+ neutrophil infiltration in glomerulus and tubulointerstitium. Furthermore, IL-17A production and the NF-κB signaling pathway were also downregulated after the administration of FTZ.
Conclusion
FTZ might attenuate DKD progression, and inhibited kidney inflammation and fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of RORγT and IL-17A in vivo, offering novel insights for the clinical application of FTZ.}

Kanglaite injection (KLTi), a Chinese herbal medicine, is used as an adjuvant treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Aims of the study
To provide an evidence-based endorsement for the clinical application and selection of KLTi by evaluating the reporting quality, methodological quality, risk of bias, and evidence quality of systemic reviews (SRs).
Materials and methods
SRs of KLTi adjuvant therapy of NSCLC were searched by using 12 databases, consulting experts, and retrieving relevant conference papers until 2022.03.24. The treatment group received KLTi in combination with other therapies, regardless of dosage, duration, or the therapy combined. Network meta-analyses and SRs using repeated data were excluded. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines 2009, A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, Risk of Bias in Systematic Review, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation were used to assess the quality of reports, methodological quality, risk of bias, and level of evidence; R was used for visual analysis of the relevant contents.
Results
Twenty SRs (13 Chinese and 7 English articles), all authored by Chinese authors as the first author, were included. The reporting information of most included studies was relatively complete (21–27 points), accounting for three-fourths of the total literature. The quality of the methods used in all studies was critically low. The risk of bias was mostly high. Results of the evidence summary showed that among the “moderate” evidence, KLTi combined with chemotherapy had benefits of 9.7–16.4% for objective response rate (ORR) (11 SRs), 8.1–14% for disease control rate (four SRs), and 20.1–28.6% for quality of life (12 SRs) compared with those of chemotherapy alone. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms (five SRs) was reduced by 11.5%–23.2%, while that of leukopenia (four SRs) improved by 19.5–29.2%. Combined radiotherapy and targeted therapy had benefits of 25.9% and 16.8%, respectively, in ORR and 31.3% and 22.8%, respectively, in quality of life (the quality of evidence was “low”). The results depicted that treatment with two courses of KLTi produce the best results.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that KLTi, whether combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy, has an effect on ORR and quality of life and induces adverse reactions, such as leukopenia, nausea, and vomiting. It may improve patient survival; however, the impact of its low-grade quality on the immune function remains undetermined. Owing to the low reporting quality and methodological quality and high risk of bias of the SRs and the included studies, clinical application of KLTi remains unelucidated; higher-quality SRs and randomized controlled trials are necessary in the future.}

Cancer screening aims to detect treatable precancerous lesions or early-stage disease to enable actions aimed at decreasing morbidity and mortality. Continuous assessment of the available evidence for or against screening interventions by various organizations often results in conflicting recommendations and create challenges for providers and policymakers. Here we have summarized the current cancer screening recommendations by five leading organizations in North America and Europe: the National Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query (PDQ), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and the UK National Screening Committee for the National Health Service (UK NSC). All organizations assess evidence based on strength, quality, and quantity, and recommendations are similar although with differences with respect to screening start and stop ages. Recommendations are consistent for colorectal cancer screening with fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, cervical cancer screening with Pap-test, HPV-test, or co-testing, and breast cancer screening with mammography. However, guidelines vary with respect to age to start and end screening and testing frequency. Tests that have proven to be inefficient or whose use is capable of causing harm are routinely recommended against. Continuous review of screening guidelines is necessary to evaluate the many promising screening tests currently under investigation.}

To facilitate chemical identification and potential components discovery, the present study proposed an integrated identification strategy guided by a self-built component database constructed from literatures to carry out the global profiling of complex matrixes. Lanqin Oral Liquid was applied as example to validate the feasibility of this strategy. Based on LQL Component Database containing 710 compounds, modified MDF windows was established to extract the interested analogues, isoquinoline alkaloids, flavonoids and iridoid glycosides, according to their regular integral masses and mass defect. For compounds with characteristic substructures, such as quinic acids, crocins and some glycoside derivatives, the associated neutral losses and diagnostic fragment ions were collected to assist in profiling. Directly matching the m/z or formulas in database was proposed to components with limited regularity of accurate masses and substructures, like indole alkaloids, sesquiterpenes and some nucleosides. Eventually, 170 ions of 1038 precursor ions were identified or temporarily deduced, including 59 alkaloids, 36 flavonoids, 48 terpenoids, 24 organic acids and their derivatives, 2 oligosaccharides, and 1 lignans. Among them, 52 putative compounds were confirmed by chemical standards. The results indicated that the database-oriented identification strategy could locate potential components quickly and eliminate interfering ions, which have the potential for in-depth analysis of compounds.}

Monkeypox is an emerging viral disease that has been declared a global health emergency. While this disease has been present for over 50 years, the recent surge in cases and expanding knowledge of this has prompted a need for a focused review for practicing clinicians.
Objective
This narrative review provides a focused overview of the epidemiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of monkeypox for emergency clinicians.
Discussion
Monkeypox is an orthopoxvirus endemic to central and western Africa. An outbreak in May and June 2022 across Asia, Europe, North America, and South America was declared a global health emergency in July 2022. The disease can be transmitted via contact with an infected animal or human, as well as contact with a contaminated material. The disease presents with a prodromal flu-like illness and lymphadenopathy. A rash spreading in a centrifugal manner involving the oral mucosa, face, palms, and soles is typical. Lesions progress along various stages. Complications such as bacterial skin infection, pneumonitis, ocular conditions, and encephalitis are uncommon. Confirmation typically includes polymerase chain reaction testing. The majority of patients improve with symptomatic therapy, and as of July 2022, there are no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments specifically for monkeypox. However, antiviral treatment should be considered for several patient populations at risk for severe outcomes.
Conclusion
An understanding of the presentation, evaluation, and management of monkeypox is essential for emergency clinicians to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment of this emerging disease.}

Honghua Qinggan 13 Flavor Pills (HHQG), whose Mongolian name is Guri Gumu-13, is a traditional Mongolian medicine, that was stated in the “Diagnosis and Treatment of Ming Medical Code”. The HHQG has been included in the Mongolian Medicine Division of the Ministry of Health Drug Standards (1998 edition). Based on our clinical expertise, HHQG demonstrated satisfactory therapeutic effects in hepatitis and liver failure. However, the pharmacological effects and potential mechanisms of HHQG have not been investigated.
Aim of the study
In this study, we combined network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and molecular biology to detect the underlying mechanism for the effect of HHQG on acute liver injury in mice.
Materials and methods
Network pharmacology was used to explore the pathways involved in the protective effect HHQG in acute liver injury. This effect was further verified by injecting carbon tetrachloride (CCl4; 10 mL/kg, i.p.) to induce acute liver injury in mice. Serum markers of liver injury, morphology, histology, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the liver tissue were investigated. Transcriptomics further defined the HHQG targets. Transwell analysis was performed to confirm that HHQG inhibited monocyte/macrophage RAW.264.7 infiltration. qPCR and Western blot were performed to explore the mechanism of action of HHQG.
Results
Network pharmacology showed that HHQG exerted anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and promoted metabolic effects against acute liver injury. Pretreatment of mice with HHQG significantly maintained their body weight and decreased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels induced by CCl4 treatment in vivo. Histopathological examination further confirmed that HHQG protected the liver cells from CCl4-induced damage. Importantly, HHQG significantly inhibited CCl4-induced monocyte/macrophage infiltration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that HHQG significantly reduced the expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules. We determined that HHQG significantly downregulated the expression of the key chemokine (monocyte chemokine protein-1, CCL2) at the gene and protein levels. Further research showed that HHQG inhibited chemokine production in hepatocytes by inhibiting the p-P38 and p-JNK pathways, thereby reducing monocyte/macrophage infiltration.
Conclusions
These combined data showed that HHQG alleviated acute liver injury in mice, and further verified that HHQG exerted protective effects by inhibiting the production of CCL2 and reducing the infiltration of monocyte/macrophage by inhibiting the p-P38 and p-JNK pathways.}

abstract = {Hydroxyanthraquinones that can be present in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and herbal extracts have claimed beneficial intestinal effects. We examined the ability of a panel hydroxyanthraquinones, and methanolic extracts from selected TCM and herbal granules to activate Nrf2-EpRE mediated gene expression using a reporter-gene assay. The results indicate that purpurin, aloe-emodin, 2-hydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone and rhein induced Nrf2 mediated gene expressions with a high induction factor (IFs>10), with BMCL10 values (the lower confidence limit of the concentration giving 10% added response above background) of 16 μM, 1.1 μM, 23 μM and 2.3 μM, respectively, while aurantio-obtusin, obtusifolin, rubiadin 1-methyl ether and emodin were less potent (IFs<5), with BMCL10 values for added response above background level of 4.6 μM, 15 μM, 9.8 μM and 3.8 μM, respectively. All TCM extracts and the herbal extracts of Aloe Vera, Polygonum multiflorum, Rubia (cordifolia) and Rheum officinale activated the Nrf2-EpRE pathway. Of the TCM extracts, Chuan-Xin-Lian-Kang-Yan-Pian was the most potent Nrf2-inducer. LC-MS/MS analysis indicated the presence of selected hydroxyanthraquinones in the extracts and herbs, in part explaining their Nrf2-EpRE mediated activity. In conclusion, different hydroxyanthraquinones have different potencies of Nrf2 activation. The Nrf2 activation by extracts from TCM and herbs can be partially explained by the presence of selected hydroxyanthraquinones.}

With easier access to notes and results, ED patients may have an enhanced understanding of their visit, findings, and clinician’s medical decisionmaking, which may improve adherence to recommendations. Patients may also seek clarifications and request edits to their notes. EDs can develop workflows to address patient concerns without placing new undue burden on clinicians, helping to realize the benefits of sharing notes and test results digitally.}

Oral administration is one of the main administration methods for TCMs. Only the ingredients that could be absorbed have the opportunity to play a role. Thus, these were defined as potential active ingredients. Studying of intestinal absorption can provide a theoretical basis for the mechanism of TCMs. The Caco-2 cell model, the everted rat gut sac model, and the Ussing chamber model were established for TCMs. The degree of anastomosis between the in vitro intestinal model and the actual intestinal absorption of TCMs were evaluated by the gavage method in rats. The Ussing chamber model was best fit for oral experiments in rats and was selected as the research means to preliminarily screen potential active ingredients from eight TCMs, including Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Astragalus propinquus Schischkin, Plantago asiatica L, Fallopia multiflora (Thunb.) Harald, Epimedium brevicornu Maxim, Moutan Cortex, Citrus reticulata Blanco, and Panax notoginseng (Burkill) F. H. Chen ex C. H. Chow.

abstract = {Background
Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMNs) or Rohingya refugees are one of the vulnerable groups suffering from different kinds of health problems but have been less reported yet. Therefore, the study was designed to delineate the health problems among FDMNs admitted to Cox's Bazar Medical College Hospital.
Methods
This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the Medicine ward, Cox's Bazar Medical College Hospital, for a six-month period following approval. Rohingya refugees who were admitted during the study period were approached for inclusion. Informed written consent was ensured prior to participation. A structured questionnaire was used during data collection. Collected information was recorded in case record form. A total of 290 subjects were interviewed. Analysis was performed using the statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 20.
Results
The mean age of the participants was 48.76 ± 18.67 years (range: 16–91), with a clear male predominance (60.7%). Family size ranged 6–8. All of the participants reported at least one of the illnesses. Of all, 29.66% patients had disease of the respiratory system, and 26.9% had disease of the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary system. Accidental injury or injury due to electrocution or thin falls or snake bites was present in 10.4% of the cases. Among the single most common diseases, COPD (20%) was the most frequently observed, and the rest of them were chronic liver disease (13.1%), pulmonary TB (5.5%), ischemic stroke (5.5%), CAP (4.1%), acute coronary syndrome (3.4%), thalassaemia (3.4%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (3.4%). Among the top 6 diagnosed diseases, PTB was more common in elderly individuals (p = 0.29). The disease pattern was similar across the sexes among the refugees except community acquisition pneumonia (CAP), which was commonly observed among males (p = .004). Considering different age groups, genitourinary problems were more common in males aged >60 years, and rheumatology and musculoskeletal problems were equally affected in females aged between 40 and 60 years.
Conclusion
COPD, CLD and CAP were the most prevalent diseases in FDMN patients who attended the Medicine ward of Cox's Bazar Medical College Hospital. Further exploration is warranted before any policy making and comprehensive plan.}

keywords = {Geriatrics, Geriatric Assessment, Quality Improvement, Cost Savings},
abstract = {Background
Patients over the age of 65 who present to the Emergency Department (ED) are more likely to be admitted to the hospital and, if admitted, often have a longer length of stay (LOS) in the hospital than younger patients.
Objectives
To determine if assessment and intervention by a Geriatric Emergency Medicine Assessment (GEMA) team would decrease the admission rate and reduce the hospital LOS for admitted geriatric patients.
Methods
We conducted a case-control study of the impact of a GEMA team in a large ED. The team screened patients ≥65 years of age for functional decline to determine the need for targeted interventions. Potential interventions included: occupational therapy consultation in the ED, rehabilitation placement, geriatric clinic referral, and delirium management. Our control population was unassessed geriatric ED patients seen in the six months before and after GEMA team implementation.
Results
A total of 815 patients were assessed between June and November 2019. Assessed patients were more likely to be discharged from the ED (54% vs 29%, OR 2.06). Mean ED LOS was nineteen minutes longer in assessed patients (4.94 vs 4.62 h, p < 0.01). The mean hospital LOS was 25 h less in assessed patients (4.50 vs 5.54 days, p < 0.01). Assessed and unassessed patients who were admitted to the hospital had the same baseline health status as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (median score 2, p = 0.087). The reduction in hospital LOS resulted in an estimated savings of $1.7 million per year using the national average cost for 24 h of inpatient care.
Conclusion
Patients who were assessed by the GEMA team were more likely to be discharged directly from the ED, and if admitted, hospital LOS was reduced by over 24 h. This indicates that a targeted intervention in the ED can help reduce hospital LOS in geriatric patients and therefore provide cost savings.}

abstract = {The classical two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is designed to test the efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention, which may consist of one or more components. However, this approach does not enable the investigator to obtain information that is important in intervention development, such as which individual components of the intervention are efficacious, which are not and possibly should be removed, and whether any components interact. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) is a new framework for development, optimization, and evaluation of interventions. MOST includes the RCT for purposes of evaluation, but inserts a phase of research before the RCT aimed at intervention optimization. The optimization phase requires one or more separate trials similar in scope to an RCT, but employing a different experimental design. The design of the optimization trial is selected strategically so as to maximize the amount of scientific information gained using the available resources. One consideration in selecting this experimental design is the type of intervention to be optimized. If a fixed intervention, i.e. one in which the same intervention content and intensity is provided to all participants, is to be optimized, a factorial experiment is often appropriate. If an adaptive intervention, i.e. one in which intervention content or intensity is varied in a principled manner, is to be optimized, a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) is often a good choice. The objective of this article is to describe MOST and the scientific rationale for its use; describe two current applications of MOST in emergency medicine research, one using a factorial experiment and the other using a SMART; and discuss funding strategies and potential future applications in studying the care of individuals with acute illness, injury, or behavioral disorders.}

abstract = {Background
The General Medicine (GM) department has the highest patient volume and heterogeneity among other hospital specialties. Closely examining hospitalization data is crucial because patients come with various conditions or traits. Length of stay (LoS) in hospitals is often used as an efficiency indicator. It is influenced by various factors, including the patient's medical background, demographics, and type of diseases/signs/symptoms at the triage. LoS is a variable that can vary widely, making it difficult to estimate it promptly and accurately, but doing so is highly beneficial. Moreover, efficiently grouping and managing patients based on their expected LoS remains a significant challenge for healthcare organizations.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the predictive ability of nine Machine Learning (ML) regression models in estimating the actual number of LoS days using demographics and clinical information recorded at admission as independent variables.
Methods
We analyzed data collected on patients hospitalized at the GM department of the Sant'Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital in Bologna, Italy, who were admitted through the Emergency Department. The data were collected from January 1, 2022, to October 26, 2022. Nine ML regression models were used to predict LoS by analyzing historical data and patient information. The models' performance was assessed through root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) and mean absolute prediction error (MAPE). Moreover, we used K-means clustering to group patients' medical and organizational criticalities (such as diseases, signs, symptoms, and administrative problems) into four clusters. Feature Importance plots and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were employed to identify the more essential features and enhance the interpretability of the results.
Results
We analyzed the LoS of 3757 eligible patients, which showed an average of 13 days and a standard deviation of 11.8 days. We randomly divided patients into a training cohort of 2630 (70 %) and a test cohort of 1127 (30 %). The predictive performance of the different models was between 11.00 and 16.16 days for RMSPE and between 7.52 and 10.78 days for MAPE. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR) model had the lowest prediction error, both in terms of RMSPE (11.00 days) and MAE (7.52 days). Sex, arrival via own vehicle/walk-in, ambulance arrival, light blue risk category, age 70 or older, and orange risk category are some of the top features.
Conclusion
The ML models evaluated in this study reported good predictive performance, with the XGBR model exhibiting the lowest prediction error. This model holds the potential to aid physicians in administering appropriate clinical interventions for patients in the GM department. This model can also help healthcare services predict the resources necessary to better manage hospitalization.}

abstract = {Purpose
Time is a critical metric in the emergency department (ED) for acute ischemic stroke and thrombolytic therapy. National guidelines have emphasized tracking time from stroke onset to treatment and decreasing door to needle (DTN) time [1, 2]. Multidisciplinary teamwork is encouraged but, there is limited evidence demonstrating the value of the pharmacist on the stroke response team. The goal of this study is to compare DTN times in the ED with or without a pharmacist at bedside and examine the impact on subsequent patient outcomes.
Methods
This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Investigators identified patients who presented to the ED between August 2016 – May 2020 with signs of ischemic stroke and subsequently received intravenous alteplase. Patients were excluded if they refused alteplase or received alteplase off-campus before being transferred. Pharmacist documentation of clinical interventions was used to identify participation on the stroke response team. The primary outcome was median DTN time. Secondary outcomes included severity of deficits measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), hospital length of stay (LOS), 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and inpatient all-cause mortality.
Results
Of the 164 patients included, 31 had an emergency medicine pharmacist at bedside (EMP group) and 133 did not (No EMP group). The median DTN time was significantly shorter at 35 min EMP [interquartile range (IQR) 29–44] vs 42 min No EMP [IQR 34–55]; p = 0.003. The number of cases achieving a DTN time of 30 min or less was significantly higher when a pharmacist was involved (35.5% vs.16.5%; p = 0.018) as well as the number of patients receiving alteplase within 45 min (80.7% vs. 57.1%; p = 0.015). NIHSS scores at discharge were lower in the EMP group (2 [IQR 0–5] vs. 4 [IQR 0–8.25]; p = 0.049). In patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed stroke, a difference was not observed in the secondary outcomes.
Conclusion
Patients with an emergency medicine pharmacist as part of their stroke response team had significantly lower DTN times. A higher proportion of these cases met benchmark DTN times less than 45 min and 30 min. An emergency medicine pharmacist on a stroke response team has the potential to improve patient care.}

The research group proposed that the mechanism of “Feature Identification based Quality Assessment” (FIQA) of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can be explained according to the relationship between the “Feature” of TCM and the Pharmacodynamic Components representing the holistic effect of TCM. Gastrodiae Rhizoma (GR) was selected as the research object to reveal the close relationship between “Feature” and the quality of TCM.
Materials and methods
In this study, the “Feature” such as “Shape”, “Color”, “Odour” and “Taste” of GR are quantified by the electronic nose, electronic tongue, and other instruments. Then, the Pharmacodynamic Components Group (PCG) of GR was determined which could reflect the holistic effect of GR by spectrum effect relationship analysis. By analyzing the correlation between the “Feature” and the content of PCG, the mechanism of FIQA of GR was determined.
Results
The quantitative results of “Shape”, “Color”, “Odour” and “Taste” of GR from different sources were significantly different. Six components were selected as the PCG, which can represent the holistic effect of GR in the aspect of the neuroprotective effect. There was a good correlation between the components in the PCG and “Feature”.
Conclusions
The quality of GR can be determined quantitatively according to its “Shape”, “Color”, “Odour” and “Taste”. The mechanism of FIQA of TCM can be explained according to the relationship between the Shape of TCM and the Pharmacodynamic Components representing the quality of TCM. The revelation of this mechanism reflects the holistic characteristics of the multi-component synergistic effect of TCM. This study provides a reference research method for revealing the mechanism of FIQA of TCM.}

This study aimed to explore the understanding of healthcare providers working in the internal medicine department in Shanghai regarding a good death.
Methods
The data of the study was collected using face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Through purposive sampling, 16 physicians and 13 nurses who had experiences of caring for adult patients with life-threatening illnesses at the end-of-life stage in Shanghai were interviewed. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
Results
Six characteristics of a good death emerged: no suffering, companionship and care, no worries or concerns, dying with dignity, involvement and acceptance, and less impact on the family. Eighteen categories were identified: dying without experiencing suffering; being relieved of symptoms and suffering; being relieved of psychological suffering; avoiding the use of futile treatment and resuscitation; being cared for and accompanied by family; receiving good health care; having a meaningful life without regrets; making good arrangements for family issues; having a chance to say goodbye; having a quality life before death; dying in a decent environment; the personal will to be respected; maintaining the integrity of the body; death of the patient being accepted by the family and healthcare providers; the death occurred despite the best efforts to care for the patient; limited financial and care burden; shortly affected quality of life of the patient; and improved family cohesion.
Conclusion
Family members’ early involvement in caring for patients at the end-of-life stage helps achieve a good death. For patients with a terminal illness, avoiding unnecessary medical treatment and resuscitation could be the first step in achieving better patient death and promoting the development of advanced care planning in the mainland of China.}

Dental stem cell research has become an important field in regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, the depth of knowledge and awareness of dental stem cells remain vague among the professional groups in Malaysia. The objective of this study is to assess the level of knowledge and awareness of professional groups in Malaysia on dental stem cells and their applications in regenerative medicine.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional survey was implemented using online and hard-copy questionnaires that was distributed among medical doctors, scientists, and dentists to assess the level of knowledge and awareness (n=157). The questionnaire consists of 3 sections consisting of demographics, knowledge assessment and perception among the professional groups. The data were analysed using SPSS analysis.
Results
Results showed that professional groups in Malaysia were knowledgeable and aware of dental stem cells and their application. Majority of the respondents were dentists (41.91%), followed by medical doctors (35.29%) and scientists (22.79%). 50.74% of respondents were unsure about the similar characteristics between dental stem cells (DSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs). Most respondents were aware of the derivation of DSCs from pulp and periodontal ligament (PDL) tissues (77.21%) and that DSCs are considered an adult stem cell source (51.11%). Most respondents were familiar with the characteristics of DSCs. They were aware that DSCs have the unique ability to self-renew and differentiate into trilineage differentiation (69.12%). They agreed that DSCs are an excellent cell resource for therapeutic approaches to neural repair and regeneration (63.24%). 63.24% of the respondents demonstrated a positive outcome for dental stem cell research. 59.56% of them would be willing to donate their extracted teeth for research. About 56.62% of respondents would conserve their teeth in stem cell banks and 52.94% are interested in investing in the stem cell industry.
Conclusion
A high level of perception and awareness about dental stem cells and its application was noted among professional groups in Malaysia. They are supportive and willing to invest for dental stem cell research.}

abstract = {Objectives
In 2000, the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mifepristone for medication abortion. In this article, we explore how the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) criteria for mifepristone specifically impede family physicians’ ability to provide medication abortion in primary care settings.
Study design
We conducted 56 qualitative interviews with a national sample of family physicians across the US who were not opposed to abortion. We examined how the REMS criteria for mifepristone impact family physicians’ ability to provide medication abortion.
Results
Of the 56 interviews conducted, 23 participants (41%) raised the REMS criteria as a barrier to providing medication abortion in primary care. These participants reported the REMS added a layer of bureaucratic complexity that made it difficult for family physicians to navigate, even when trained, to provide abortion care. These family physicians described 2 predominant ways the REMS impede their ability to provide medication abortion: (1) The REMS require substantial involvement of clinic administration, who can be unsupportive; (2) The complexity of navigating the REMS results in physicians and clinic administration in primary care viewing medication abortion as not worth the effort, since it is only a small component of services offered in primary care.
Conclusion
Removing the REMS could simplify integration of medication abortion into primary care, which could meet patient preferences, improve access, and reduce abortion stigma. The FDA's revised REMS criteria may ease administrative burden but will likely maintain key barriers to integrating medication abortion into family physicians’ practice.
Implications
Our study highlights that the REMS criteria are barriers to family physicians’ ability to integrate medication abortion into their primary care practices. The FDA's removal of in person dispensing criteria may provide some impetus for trained family physicians to integrate medication abortion into their scope of practice but the revised REMS criteria maintain key barriers to broader adoption.}

Therefore, the rapid and accurate determination of the concentration of L-Cys has a certain significance for the quality evaluation of TCMs. In this work, a simple method was developed for label-free and indirect detection of L-Cys by chemical vapor generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVG-AFS) based on the phenomenon that L-Cys can inhibit the CVG of arsenic ion (As(III)). Therefore, the AFS signal is inversely proportional to the concentration of L-Cys. The effects of the concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium borohydride (KBH4) in the CVG process and the reaction time between L-Cys and As(III) have been investigated. Under the optimal experimental conditions, it shows a good linearity in the concentration range of 2–18 mM. The limit of detection (LOD) of the presented method is 2.8 μM, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.5%. The method has been successfully applied in the analysis of L-Cys in several animal TCMs with good recoveries.}

abstract = {Background
Carbonized traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a kind of distinctive traditional medicine, which has been widely used to cure various bleeding syndromes in clinic for over 2000 years. However, there are no effective quality control methods developed on carbonized TCM so far.
Purpose
This study aimed at developing a processing-associated quality marker (Q-marker) discovery strategy, which would enable to promote the quality control study of carbonized TCM.
Methods
Carbonized Typhae Pollen (CTP), a typical carbonized TCM with fantastic efficacy of stanching bleeding and removing blood stasis, was used as an example. First, a ultraperformance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) method was established to characterize four types of CTP in different processing degrees. Second, chemometric method was applied to screen candidate Q-markers. Third, peak area changes and Aratio changes of each candidate markers in 57 batches samples were described (Traceability and Transitivity). Fourth, systems pharmacology and two high-throughput zebrafish models: cerebral hemorrhage model and thrombus model were used to furtherly screen Q-markers (Effectiveness). Finally, a ultraperformance liquid chromatographic coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ-MS) method was established and applied to quantify Q-markers in additional 10 batches of CTP samples (Measurability).
Results
The chemical profiles of Typhae Pollen during the carbonized process were investigated. Then, 12 candidate compounds were screened in chemometric part. Six Q-markers (isorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-O-neohesperidoside, naringenin, quercetin and isorhamnetin) were subsequently screened out using three principles of Q-markers combined with content changes and two in vivo zebrafish models. Their average contents in additional 10 batches of CTP were 316.8 μg/g, 13.7 μg/g, 6.1 μg/g, 197.8 μg/g, 12.9 μg/g and 199.3 μg/g, respectively. Their content proportion was about 25: 1: 0.5: 15: 1: 15.
Conclusion
A processing-associated Q-marker discovery strategy was developed for carbonized TCM. It might provide a novel insight to solve the problem of ‘Chao Tan Cun Xing’ in carbonized process.}

The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of pain (I2 = 96.03%, P < 0.001), anxiety (I2 = 98.85%, P < 0.002), and improved relaxation (I2 = 87.19%, P < 0.001) favoring music interventions compared to control groups.
Conclusions
This review provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of music interventions for adult burn patients. However, more high-quality RCTs are needed to safely establish guidelines for music therapists and other health care professionals in using music for health purposes with this population.}

abstract = {Objective
It is essential that reports written by forensic medicine practitioners undergo appropriate quality control. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a tool for assessing the quality of medico-legal reports in adult and adolescent sexual assault cases.
Methods
The authors developed an audit tool and accompanying guideline aimed at detecting errors, omissions, and inadequacies in medico-legal reports following reported adult or adolescent sexual assault. The authors conducted a benchmarking exercise to reach an agreed audit standard. Subsequently two forensic examiners audited 5 legal reports, first without the tool, and then with the tool following standardised instruction. A further ten forensic examiners audited 20 reports after receiving instruction in use of the tool. Their results were compared to the agreed audit standard. Participants were interviewed about their experiences.
Results
Use of the tool to audit reports significantly increased the sensitivity of error detection compared to usual practice (sensitivity with usual practice 55% vs sensitivity with tool 80%). Study participants using the tool to audit 20 reports detected 73% of items designated as errors by the study authors. The overall accuracy in coding items as errors/not errors was 74%. Interrater reliability was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87). Sensitivity, overall accuracy, and interrater reliability results varied by category in the audit: reviewers had lower levels of error detection and lower levels of agreement when auditing opinions in the report as compared to items describing the clinical forensic evaluation. Participants had fundamental disagreements about what constitutes good quality in some aspects of a report, including: the acceptability of including ‘non-relevant’ history; whether to include references and, if so, what constitutes appropriate citations; and how to determine whether the opinions could be understood by a layperson. Study participants reported that using the audit tool and guideline to review medico-legal reports has merit and suggested improvements to increase usability.
Conclusion
Use of an audit tool supported by a guideline and training is useful for improving error detection and standardising the review process for clinical forensic medicine legal reports. Further research aimed at improving the consensus about opinion standards in adult and adolescent sexual assault cases would be valuable.}
