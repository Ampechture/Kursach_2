Tribal migratory shepherds (Gaddi) living in the Northwestern Himalayan region are well known for their nomadic lifestyle in which tribal migratory shepherds along with their livestock which mainly include sheep and goat migrate seasonally in the Northwestern Himalayan region from high hills to low hills for the survival of their livestock from cold winters and hot summer. Due to harsh environmental conditions, heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, wild animal attacks, no medical facilities, no transportation, and no electricity facilities tribal migratory shepherds mostly rely on plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use to treat livestock disease.
Aim of study
The aim of our study is to conduct ethnoveterinary survey for the first time to document the contemporary oral ethnoveterinary knowledge of Gaddi shepherds living in Northwestern Himalayan region.
Methodology
The documentation of plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use was executed through extensive field surveys from 2017 to 2019. Data were collected through direct interviews by administrating questionnaire among tribal migratory shepherds.
Results
A total of 181 plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use belonging to the same or different families were documented during the seasonal migration of shepherds from Northwestern Himalayan region. Most frequently occurring family of plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary was Poaceae, leaves and roots were reported to be the most frequently used plant parts. Most frequently documented plant species for ethnoveterinary use were Cynodon dactylon, Chenopodium album, Zanthoxylum armatum, Aloe vera, Azadirachta indica and Cannabis sativa. Chrysopogon serrulatus, Cynodon dactylon, and Vitex negundo were reported with high use reports. Some of the endemic species of Northwestern Himalayan region such as Elymus himalayanus and Euphorbia pilosa and one endangered species Picrorhiza kurrooa were reported in current study.
Conclusion
It is observed that there is a need to raise awareness among the tribal migratory shepherds about the sustainable use and conservation of some of the plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use. This study provided an inventory of plant species mentioned for ethnoveterinary use having significant ethnoveterinary potential, however there is need of scientific evaluations by in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies.}

Such quality improvement is dependent on evaluation and research. Large-scale studies provide very useful information that can assist in bench-marking, prognostication, and identification of effective interventions. Observational studies have many strengths but also have important limitations. Random assignment to treatment groups minimizes bias, and if the trial is large (e.g., >500 participants), it will balance both known and unknown confounding factors. Large randomized trials are therefore more reliable and because they are typically multicentered (i.e., involving different healthcare settings and clinicians), their results are more generalizable. This chapter explores these aspects and includes some excellent examples of practice-improving clinical trials evaluating perioperative beta-blockade, prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the safety of dexamethasone in noncardiac surgery, and the risks of tight glucose control in critical care. Large pragmatic trials reflect “real-world” patients and clinical settings. They can also measure outcomes that matter to patients, including the potential adverse effects of the intervention. If clinical research in perioperative medicine is to provide more reliable and valid evidence to inform therapeutic decision making in the future, it is clear that a greater proportion of such research needs to be large, high-quality, multicenter randomized trials.}

abstract = {Introduction Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring is fundamental for risk stratification and treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Sensitive molecular assay requires presentation samples to be screened for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (IG/TCR) gene rearrangements. Previously samples were screened by PCR, heteroduplex analysis and Sanger sequencing to identify clone defining IG/TCR gene rearrangements. Subsequently these sequences were used to develop qPCR assays for MRD follow-up monitoring. More recently, targeted IG/TCR high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has been used with similar panels to identify gene rearrangements. Both these methods have limitations, in that only rearrangements covered by the panels are detected, and the techniques are labour intensive and expensive. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has potential to discover all IG/TCR rearrangements in a single assay giving greater potential to detect markers for follow up MRD monitoring. In England all patients with ALL are eligible for WGS at diagnosis via the National Health Service, Genomic Medicine Service (NHS GMS). Methods Sixty-two patients, presenting with ALL at either Great Ormond Street Hospital or Bristol Children's Hospital, had short-read WGS via the NHS GMS performed concurrently with standard of care (SOC) targeted HTS to identify IG/TCR rearrangements. A bespoke bioinformatic pipeline was developed to identify IG/TCR rearrangements in the WGS samples. SOC targeted HTS analysis was performed using the open source Vidjil bioinformatic software. A cut-off of 5% (clone proportion of total clonotypes) was used to define an acceptable disease-specific clone for monitoring. Results All 62 samples had a greater number of rearrangements detected by WGS than targeted HTS. The mean number of clones >5% detected was 2.7 by targeted HTS and 3.1 by WGS. For rearrangements identified by targeted HTS at a 5% cut-off, 97% (185 out of 190) were identified by WGS. All targets were identified by WGS using a 10% cut-off (Table 1).Despite the lower depth of coverage of the WGS assay, it retrieved 89% of sequences seen in SOC down to a level of 1%, as well as additional re-arrangements not seen by the SOC assay (Figure 1). As well as additional rearrangements being discovered by WGS, we observed novel rearrangements (dd3/ja rearrangements) not previously identified using a targeted approach. To establish if the additional sequences identified by WGS were clinically applicable as MRD targets, we designed allele specific oligonucleotides for a representative 32 rearrangements for testing by qPCR. Over half (n=16) were able to be used to track MRD in follow-up samples. New primer/probe sets were designed for the novel dd3/ja rearrangements identified by WGS, these were also tested by qPCR and performed well enough to be clinically applicable for MRD monitoring. Conclusions WGS approach outperformed targeted HTS, identifying more IG/TCR rearrangements suitable for molecular MRD monitoring in all patients. This is of particularly benefit in cases where targeted HTS only identifies 1 or 2 potential MRD targets. WGS also has the advantage of identifying other key gene rearrangements (BCR-ABL, KMT2A, SIL-TAL, IKZF1) that make excellent targets for MRD monitoring. Beyond this, WGS delivers all diagnostic information, germline and additional somatic findings that aid diagnosis. For ALL, in one test WGS can now replace all molecular diagnostics. In England all patients with leukemia are eligible for centralised WGS. With continued improvements in turnaround times, and reducing costs, we propose that WGS should be the new diagnostic standard for pediatric ALL}

abstract = {Background
Trust occurs when a person feels they can be vulnerable to others because of the sincerity, benevolence, truthfulness and sometimes the competence they perceive within a specific context. This project examines the various types of trust captured in written reflections of family medicine residents. Our goal is to understand the roles trust plays in residents’ self-examination and to develop a framework for developing further understanding of trust in healthcare.
Methods
We analyzed 767 reflective writings of 33 residents submitted anonymously, to identify explicit uses of the word “trust” but also explicit or implicit indicators attention to trust or relationship development. Two authors independently inductively coded the entries. Three authors developed a final coding structure that was checked against the entries. These codes were sorted into categories from which themes were developed.
Findings
We identified 102 written reflections contained one or more indicators of trust. These codes were compiled into five code categories: Trust of self/trust as the basis for confidence in their decision making; Trust of others in the medical community; Trust of the patient and its effect on themselves; Assessment of the trust of them exhibited by the patient; and, Assessment of the effect of the patient’s trust on the patient’s behavior.
Discussion
Trust is both relationship-centered and institutionally situated. Trust is a process, built on reciprocity. There is tacit acknowledgement of the interplay among what the residents do is good for the patient, good for themselves, and good for the medical institution. A focus on moments in which trust is experienced or missed, as well as on types of trust, misses this complexity. A greater awareness of how trust is present or absent could lead to a greater understanding of what has beneficial effects on physicians’ performance, personal and professional satisfaction, and improved quality in patients’ interactions.}

abstract = {Problem
The immune regulation at the fetal-maternal interface is crucial for establishing a healthy pregnancy as the mother must tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus, while simultaneously being alert to protect both the mother and the fetus from pathogens. An imbalance in the immune regulation might have an important role in unexplained early pregnancy disorders. The decidual natural killer (dNK) cells comprise about 50-90 % of the decidual lymphocytes in the first trimester. Decidual NK cells secrete cytokines, angiogenic factors and growth factors, and they may play a key role for the development of the placenta. The majority of the circulating peripheral NK cells are cytotoxic with a CD56dimCD16+ phenotype. In contrast, the majority of the dNK cells are CD56brightCD16-, and are less cytotoxic and upon balanced activation seem to secrete factors important for placentation. The cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) is also present in the decidualized endometrium of the uterus. In the present study, we investigated a possible shift from a peripheral CD56dimCD16+ NK cell phenotype towards the CD56brightCD16- decidual NK cell phenotype induced by trophoblast cells with the choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 as a model, or by IL-15, or by both.
Method of Study
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats from 15 healthy, non-pregnant women n (<40 years). The PBMCs were incubated in co-cultures together with a monolayer of the human trophoblast-derived choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 with or without IL-15 for six days. Natural killer cell subpopulations in the PBMCs were analyzed by flow cytometry for the markers CD3, CD14, CD20, CD56, CD16 at day 0 and day 6. Natural killer cells were sub-grouped according to the expression of CD56 and CD16,and analyzed for surface expression of various receptors at day 0 and day 6. JEG-3 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) (HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F and HLA-G).
Results
PBMCs co-cultured with IL-15 with or without JEG-3 for six days resulted in an increase in the CD56brightCD16- NK cell subpopulation and a reduction in the CD56dimCD16+ NK cell subpopulation. Interleukin-15 and the JEG-3 cells seemed to some degree to have an additive effect. Additionally, we observed an increase in the KIR2DL4 and ILT2 receptors on the CD56brightCD16- NK cell subpopulation after co-culture with IL-15 and JEG-3 cells.
Conclusion
Our main findings were an increase in the CD56brightCD16- NK cell subpopulation after co-cultures with PBMCs and the trophoblast-derived choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 and addition of IL-15. The effect was primarily driven by IL-15. The results may indicate that the cytokine IL-15 and trophoblast cells at the fetalmaternal interface induce an increase in the CD56brightCD16- NK cell subpopulation of importance for fetalmaternal immune interactions and placentation}

The current study sought to explore facilitators and barriers to HPM fellowship training from the perspective of surgeons with training in HPM and a surgical specialty. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study utilizing semi-structured interviews with HPM fellowship-trained surgeons. Data were recorded, transcribed, and coded. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic data, and thematic analysis was used to identify themes in participant responses. Results: There were 17 participants, including general surgeons (n=5), surgical specialists (n=5), general obstetrician/gynecologists (n=3), and obstetrics/gynecology specialists (n=4). All participants described having pivotal experiences that highlighted deficits in patient care, their clinical skillset, and/or their personal or professional development. Participants or their mentors recognized that practicing through a palliative care lens aligned with the participant’s personal and professional identity and could fill self-identified deficits in their skillsets. These pivotal experiences and the participants’ internal alignment with the HPM practice ultimately drove their decision to pursue an HPM fellowship. Many participants experienced bias when considering HPM, which was either internal bias and doubt or external bias or discouragement that they experienced during conversations with their mentors, faculty, and peers. Additionally, many participants had to overcome logistical barriers to pursue an HPM fellowship, including financial concerns, moving with spouses/families, coordinating an additional surgical fellowship, and navigating an uncertain job market post-fellowship. Ultimately, all participants found solutions to these barriers (JB1) and felt satisfied with their decision to pursue HPM training. Conclusions: Our participants emphasized the importance of mentorship and exposure to HPM as key facilitators to pursuing HPM training. While many participants had to navigate bias and logistical barriers, they felt HPM fellowship was feasible for surgeons and ultimately led to more satisfying careers in their current practice. Highlighting the experiences of HPM-trained surgeons who have navigated this underrepresented career path may empower other surgeons to consider HPM fellowship training and expand surgeon representation in the HPM workforce. HPM and surgical specialty organizations should work to mitigate the cultural and structural barriers to HPM surgical training identified by our participants to facilitate the growth of this critical healthcare resource, the HPM trained surgeon. This will add value to surgical and HPM care for patients, improve primary and specialty palliative care education in surgery and HPM, and foster HPM-oriented research within the surgical specialties while simultaneously addressing a critical HPM workforce shortage.}

abstract = {As a neurological disorder in the brain, epilepsy is not only associated with abnormal synchronized discharging of neurons, but also inseparable from non-neuronal elements in the altered microenvironment. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) merely focusing on neuronal circuits frequently turn out deficient, which is necessitating comprehensive strategies of medications to cover over-exciting neurons, activated glial cells, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation synchronously. Therefore, we would report the design of a polymeric micelle drug delivery system that was functioned with brain targeting and cerebral microenvironment modulation. In brief, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive phenylboronic ester was conjugated with poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) to form amphiphilic copolymers. Additionally, dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), an analogue of glucose, was applied to target glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and facilitate micelle penetration across the blood‒brain barrier (BBB). A classic hydrophobic AED, lamotrigine (LTG), was encapsulated in the micelles via self-assembly. When administrated and transferred across the BBB, ROS-scavenging polymers were expected to integrate anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and neuro-electric modulation into one strategy. Moreover, micelles would alter LTG distribution in vivo with improved efficacy. Overall, the combined anti-epileptic therapy might provide effective opinions on how to maximize neuroprotection during early epileptogenesis.}

It achieves this by explaining how benzodiazepines work in terms of neuroendocrinology, immunomodulation, sleep, anxiety, cognition, and addiction, ultimately improving their clinical effectiveness. Benzodiazepines play a regulatory role in the HPA axis and impact various systems, including neuropeptide Y and cholecystokinin. Benzodiazepines can facilitate sleep-dependent memory consolidation by promoting spindle wave activity, but they can also lead to memory deficits in older individuals due to reduced slow-wave sleep. The cognitive effects of chronic benzodiazepines use remain uncertain; however, no adverse findings have been reported in clinical imaging studies. This article aims to comprehensively review the evidence on benzodiazepines therapy, emphasizing the need for more clinical studies, especially regarding long-term benzodiazepines use.}

Characterization of the prepared quantum dots revealed multi-doping with nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine. The prepared multi-doped CDs were applied for dual functions as an efficient photocatalyst and a sensitive fluorescence nanosensor that are not restricted by toxicity, cost, or stability. The efficient light absorption, electron transfer, and separation of photogenerated charge carriers within the multi-doped CDs enabled their use as an effective photocatalyst for remediation of organic dye-polluted water. Efficacious degradation of eriochrome black T dye (≈88 %) was accomplished within 80 min under visible light irradiation. Radical scavenging experiments demonstrated that the active species are hole, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the multi-doped CDs were applied as a nanosensor for sensitive determination of the muscle relaxant drug thiocolchicoside (TCC) via fluorescence switch-off mechanism mediated by inner filter effect and dynamic quenching. The nanosensor was applied for the determination of TCC in its tablets with mean recovery % of 99.95 ± 1.55 and excellent selectivity. The present approach is a further step for circular economy applications hence it converts valueless chemical waste into valued products with useful applications.}

This is particularly interesting for dosing and release modelling. In this study, a geometry model was developed that can represent variable dosages while keeping the surface area to volume (SA/V) ratio alike, so the drug release profiles remain similar. The model was tested on three different formulations. Two BCS I active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), pramipexole and levodopa, and one BCS II API, praziquantel, were used. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, water soluble) and a combination of vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVP-VA, water soluble) and ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA, water insoluble) were used as the polymer matrix. The curves were compared using the similarity factor (f2 value) and mean dissolution time (MDT). Using a hollow cylinder-based (HCb) geometry model, a dose-independent drug release could be realized. For the PVA formulations, an 8-fold dose change could be obtained and for the EVA-PVP-VA formulation a factor of 5.5 could be achieved, with f2 > 50. Due to the layer structure of the printed objects, very fine dose variation of 0.13 mg per layer is possible within these models. This allows variable dosing in small steps with only one basis formulation.}

Synthetic data generation is the process of using machine learning methods to train a model that captures the patterns in a real dataset. Then new or synthetic data can be generated from that trained model. The synthetic data does not have a one-to-one mapping to the original data or to real patients, and therefore has the potential of privacy preserving properties. There is a growing interest in the application of synthetic data across health and life sciences, but to fully realize the benefits, further education, research, and policy innovation is required. This article summarizes the opportunities and challenges of SDG for health data, and provides directions for how this technology can be leveraged to accelerate data access for secondary purposes.}

Social relationships include those with romantic partners, friends, siblings, children, and care professionals. These individuals play a significant role in the physical health, mental health, and well-being of a patient. Studying health and well-being and consideration of both partners in the context of these close social relationships is clearly important in health research. Where one or both individuals have a health condition, then an important part of relationship can include medicines optimization and illness management. Both partners become the unit of study—also known as a dyad. Dyadic research approaches can be utilized in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies. Literature on chronic illness and stages of illness has put a spotlight on the need to study dyads. An important, unique, and valuable perspective is obtained on the complex interactions that underpin the management of illness and medicines optimization by situating experiences of individuals within the context of the dyad. This chapter discusses how to utilize dyads in medicines optimization and illness management research.}

Concurrently, this study ameliorates the satisfaction of the retail customers of herbal medicines along with the large clients of second-generation biofuel. In order to achieve more desirable optimal value of main objective function, the present study develops an emended minmax method based semi-autonomized multi-objective optimization algorithm by amending the classical minmax method. Apart from determining the more desirable optimal values of this model with the proposed algorithm in certitude-state, this study determines another Pareto optimal solution of this model under fuzziness in incertitude-state. The sensitivity analysis of ten key parameters of proposed model together with five graphical patterns advocates for the usages of the advanced equipment at both pharmaceutical plants and recycle-plants. This study asks to cautiously and systematically upgrade the machinery at factory. For legislators, while this study appeals to shoot up the business-commitment of pharmaceutical plants to assure a steady availability of herbal medicines, this favors only a reasonable obligation to procure used substrates by recycle-plants.}

abstract = {Context
The need for refreshment courses on doctor-patient communication has long been recognized in view of acquired competences eroding in time. Although research shows positive effects of communication skills programs, less studies focus on which skills erode most, thus requiring particular attention. The goal of this study was to examine which communication skills tend to wear down among health professionals after a communication skills program.
Methods
The program for health professionals focused on basic relational competences throughout three months, after which participants were evaluated (T1) with the SEGUE framework applied to interviews with simulated patients. Six months later, participants were evaluated again (T2). Data were analyzed with GLM repeated-measures procedures.
Results
An analysis with 151 health professionals showed that, although some aspects improved significantly after six months since the first evaluation (all focusing on the patient), various communication aspects showed decreased use at T2, including some pertaining to the “doctor-centered” phase of the interview (e.g., exploring signs/symptoms; p = 0.033). In addition, significant effects emerged by professional group (e.g., explaining the benefits of a plan option; p = 0.023).
Conclusion
The results are surprising because more aspects of the patient-centered (rather than the doctor-centered) approach could be expected to erode. A possible explanation is that, although basic communication skills were practiced in the first three months of the course, the program continued after that, with such topics as delivering bad news, which might reinforce the focus on the patient. These results point to the importance of stressing doctor-centered aspects of the clinical encounter more, which the emphasis on patient-centered approaches might compromise in communication programs. Emphasis on different communication aspects for different professional groups might also be required.}

abstract = {Background
Teleconsultation can influence health behaviours through changes of doctor-patient communication. The aim of our study was to explore patients’ preferences regarding doctors’ behaviours in video consultation.
Methods
We conducted an exploratory study in both private and public medical centres and emergency services in Geneva in 2021. Patients in the waiting room were invited to watch videos displaying variations of doctor communication behaviours during video consultation and indicate which one they preferred. The videos featured 6 specific physician video communication behaviours with 2 variations for each: 1) Camera framing: face vs face and bust 2) Gaze orientation: towards screen vs towards screen and camera 3) Social phase: related to connexion quality or not 4) Privacy reminder regarding the online platform and environment: with or without 5) Pauses after physicians’ statements: usual / longer pauses 6) Empathy: with or without increased non-verbal expression.
Findings
417 patients watched three different videotaped standardized encounters illustrating specific video consultation behaviours (two variations each). A majority of patients preferred framing with both face and bust (50.7%) versus face alone (21.8%).They valued eye gazing towards the screen (42.9%) versus eye gazing shifting between screen and camera (13%). Social phase related to connection quality was praised (43.1% vs 17.1%) as well as the privacy reminder regarding the online platform and environment (80.8% vs 6.5%). Patients preferred usual pauses after physician’s statements (63.9 vs 14.9%) as well as expressive rather neutral non-verbal behaviour when associated with verbal empathy (46.7% vs 17.6%). The percentage of patients indicating no preference varied between 12.6% (privacy reminder) and 43.1% (eye gazing).
Discussion
Patients prefer the use of the video specific communication behaviours recommended by experts, with the exception of shifting eye gazing and pause duration. These recommendations, if confirmed by other studies, should be more consistently taught during medical training.}

Literature cited includes publications from January to December 2022. Last year, vitamin A derivatives caused musculoskeletal, mucocutaneous, bone, and electrolyte abnormalities. All-trans retinoic acid resulted in bone marrow necrosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, while isotretinoin produced back pain, sacroiliitis, skeletal hyperostosis, rhabdomyolysis, hair loss, and hypercalcemia. Available evidence suggests healthcare professionals must carefully identify drug-induced toxicity as misdiagnosed anaphylaxis occurred in a patient experiencing a niacin overdose. Thiamine dose optimization may be an appropriate primary prevention strategy for hypertension. Emerging evidence suggests vitamin C use in critical illness may increase risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction. A new drug–disease interaction was uncovered in a patient with sarcoidosis receiving vitamin D supplementation that resulted in hypercalcemia. Focused investigation into real-world vaping practices and pathophysiologic mechanisms is required to strengthen the link between vitamin E acetate in vaping products and E-cigarette or Vaping product use-Associated Lung Injury. Retrosternal discomfort and pill-induced esophagitis occurred in a pediatric patient receiving l-arginine. Energy-dense enteral nutrition increased patient risk of large gastric residual volumes and gastrointestinal complications. Patients receiving early parenteral nutrition, who are older, and have higher mortality risk scores should be monitored for refeeding hypophosphatemia. Finally, the first case of lipid emulsion-induced hypertension was identified. This chapter aims to increase healthcare practitioner knowledge to encourage appropriate identification, management, and prevention of toxicity.}

abstract = {Objectives
This was a study to explore the knowledge and attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) amongst patients at an academic cancer center. Our secondary objective was to determine if any patient characteristics affect their satisfaction of Integrative Medicine (IM) resources at our institution.
Methods
An online survey was sent to patients of the University of California Davis Health (UCDH) Comprehensive Cancer using the electronic health record. Eligible participants included patients of the UCDH Comprehensive Cancer Center who were greater than 18 years of age, had a clinic visit within the last year, with ICD-10 codes for cancer or precancer diagnoses, English-speaking and had Epic MyChart access. The survey consisted of 11 questions, with additional questions for follow up depending on participant answers. The survey collected self-reported information including demographics, cancer type, satisfaction rating of IM resources, and desire for additional IM resources. The study was hosted online in the UC Davis REDCap secure server.
Results
This voluntary, anonymous survey was sent to 7807 patients of the UCDH Comprehensive Cancer Center. It was distributed between 10/14/2021 and 2/2/2021. 1016 respondents initiated the survey, giving a response rate of 13%. 855 respondents completed the survey in entirety. Mean age of respondents was 65.4 years with. 67.3% of respondents were female, 32.4% were male and 0.3% responded in the other category. The majority (84.9%) of respondents were Caucasian/White, 86.8% reported being non-Hispanic. The other race categories all had less than 10% respondents. The largest group of responders were breast cancer patients (25.7%) followed by those with more than one cancer (11.3%), GU (9.57%), lymphoma (9.46%), other (8.08%), gynecologic (7.53%), lung (6.99%), GI (6.88%) and leukemia (5.27%). Brain, head and neck, sarcoma, skin and thyroid cancers had less than 3% response in each group. 78.7% reported no CAM use, 18.9% reported to using CAM, and 2.37% were not sure. Although a majority (53.7%) were satisfied of the resources, a large proportion (42.1%) reported that they were not aware not of any IM resources in the health system. 4.2% reported that they were dissatisfied with the resources. 48.7% wanted additional IM resources and 46.7% were not sure, only 4.63% did not want any additional resources. Of those who wanted additional resources (n=854), 47.9% wanted alternative medical systems (i.e. acupuncture or traditional Chinese medicine). 11.8% wanted more exercise therapies (i.e. yoga, taichi), 9.02% wanted manipulative and body based methods (i.e. massage, chiropractic), and 8.43% wanted nutrition therapeutics (i.e. vitamin and supplements).
Conclusions
This study to investigated patient perceptions of IM resources at the UCDH Comprehensive Cancer Center. Over 1000 participants responded, most were in their mid-60s, female, Caucasian/White race and were not currently using any forms of CAM. 42% of participants were not aware there were any IM resources at our institution. This accounts for a significant proportion of patients who may have received some benefit to their symptoms had they been aware of these services. Only 4.2% did not want any additional resources. The data from this analysis will help us build the IM program to improve the quality of life for our cancer patients. There is still much work that is needed to truly integrate IM into our health system and cancer center.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
The development of highly effective conjugate chemistry approaches is a way to improve the quality of drugs and of medicines. The aim of this paper is to highlight and review such hybrid compounds and the strategies underpinning their design. A variety of unique hybrid compounds provide an excellent toolkit for novel biological activity, e.g. anticancer and non-viral gene therapy (NVGT), and as templates for killing bacteria and preventing antibiotic drug resistance. First we discuss the anticancer potential of hybrid compounds, containing daunorubicin, benzyl- or tetrahydroisoquinoline-coumarin, and cytotoxic NSAID-pyrrolizidine/indolizine hybrids, then NVGT cationic lipid-based delivery agents, where steroids or long chain fatty acids as the lipid moiety are bound to polyamines as the cationic moiety. These polyamines can be linear as in spermidine or spermine, or on a polycyclic sugar template, aminoglycosides kanamycin and neomycin B, the latter substituted with six amino groups. They are highly efficient for the delivery of both fluorescent DNA and siRNA. Molecular precedents can be found for the design of hybrid compounds in the natural world, e.g., squalamine, the first representative of a previously unknown class of natural antibiotics of animal origin. These polyamine-bile acid (e.g. cholic acid type) conjugates display many exciting biological activities with the bile acids acting as a lipidic region and spermidine as the polycationic region. Analogues of squalamine can act as vectors in NVGT. Their natural role is as antibiotics. Novel antibacterial materials are urgently needed as recalcitrant bacterial infection is a worldwide problem for human health. Ribosome inhibitors founded upon dimers of tobramycin or neomycin, bound as ethers by a 1,6-hexyl linker or a more complex diether-disulfide linker, improved upon the antibiotic activity of aminoglycoside monomers by 20- to 1200-fold. Other hybrids, linked by click chemistry, conjugated ciprofloxacin to neomycin, trimethoprim, or tedizolid, which is now in clinical trials.}

This chapter will review the principles of adaptive designs as well as practical considerations for designing and implementing an adaptive clinical trial.}

abstract = {Background and aim
Sigma metrics are applied in clinical laboratories to assess the quality of analytical processes. A parameter associated to a Sigma > 6 is considered “world class” whereas a Sigma < 3 is “poor” or “unacceptable”. The aim of this retrospective study was to quantify the impact of different approaches for Sigma metrics calculation.
Material and methods
Two IQC levels of 20 different parameters were evaluated for a 12–month period. Sigma metrics were calculated using the formula: (allowable total error (TEa) (%) – bias (%))/(coefficient of variation (CV) (%)). Method precision was calculated monthly or annually. The bias was obtained from peer comparison program (PCP) or external quality assessment program (EQAP), and 9 different TEa sources were included.
Results
There was a substantial monthly variation of Sigma metrics for all combinations, with a median variation of 32% (IQR, 25.6–41.3%). Variation across multiple analyzers and IQC levels were also observed. Furthermore, TEa source had the highest impact on Sigma calculation with proportions of Sigma > 6 ranging from 17.5% to 84.4%. The nature of bias was less decisive.
Conclusion
In absence of a clear consensus, we recommend that laboratories calculate Sigma metrics on a sufficiently long period of time (>6 months) and carefully evaluate the choice of TEa source.}

The phytoconstituents composition was established by evaluating total bioactive contents and GC–MS analysis. For the biological potential, antioxidant (DPPH, FRAP, ABTS, CUPRAC), enzyme inhibition (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), and antibacterial assays were performed. The n-hexane extract was found to contain a comparatively higher amount of total phenolic (36.07 mg GAE/g extract) and flavonoid (831.58 QE/g extract) contents, and also showed the highest inhibition potential against both the tested enzymes. The chloroform extract was most active for antioxidant assays, whereas the hydro-methanol extract presented considerable antibacterial activity against E. coli. The GC–MS of the n-hexane fraction resulted in the tentative identification of several chemical compounds, most of these were belonging to alkane, alkene, and fatty acid derivatives. Furthermore, three main phytochemicals as identified by the GC–MS analysis from this plant were studied for the molecular docking studies against α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. To conclude, this plant could be further explored as a possible candidate for identifying novel potential bioactive lead compounds for functional food and medicine.}

abstract = {Objectives
Lifestyle recommendations, specifically diet, are foundational components of many clinical practice guidelines from major medical professional and other stakeholder associations. To support clinicians in appropriate treatment pathways, this study aims to identify commonalities among dietary recommendations of current practice guidelines.
Methods
Using a systematic review approach, this meta-epidemiological study (no clinical outcomes; guidelines as unit of analysis) assessed practice guidelines containing dietary pattern, food group, or food item recommendations for adults from general populations or with major chronic diseases. Search strategies were implemented in 5 databases for publications from January 2010 to 2022 and were augmented by hand searches in point-of-care resource databases and relevant stakeholder websites. Two investigators independently screened guidelines and extracted or checked data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Results
Of 2,435 screened records, 88 guidelines were included; preliminary results from 82 guidelines published by Nov. 2020 are presented. Most (95%) targeted adults with chronic diseases, and 45% focused on prevention or treatment of heart disease. Mediterranean-style diets, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or low-sodium diets, and a “healthy diet” (various definitions) were each recommended by about 30% of guidelines. Food groups most commonly recommended for daily intake were vegetables (74%), fruit (71%), whole grains (59%), and legumes (46%). Those most commonly recommended to limit/exclude/decrease were red (34%) and processed meats (30%). Fish/seafood was recommended by 51% of guidelines with many suggesting 1–2 servings a week. Food components most commonly recommended to limit/exclude/decrease were alcohol (65%), salt (50%), sugar sweetened beverages or added sugars (43%), and refined grains or "processed” foods (30%).
Conclusions
Guidelines aimed at preventing or treating major chronic diseases are closely aligned in their dietary recommendations for daily intakes of unrefined plant foods with limited alcohol and salt. Based on current evidence, clinicians should feel confident making these recommendations in accordance with their respective clinical practice guidelines.

abstract = {Knowledge of family health history can help to mitigate risk for chronic non-communicable diseases known to run in families. However, disclosure of disease or illness is not always a given. This paper explores the relationship between care and intrafamilial communication regarding chronic health conditions in Ghanaian families, drawing on concepts of generativity and reciprocity. Data were drawn from a qualitative description study on family histories and health. This paper analyzes four focus group discussions and two intergenerational family interviews conducted among 35 older adults and their adult children and grandchildren in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Data were analyzed thematically using an inductive approach and themes relating to care and intrafamilial communication were assessed for this analysis. Findings showed that intergenerational care can serve as a means to disclose and communicate family health histories while disclosure of illness serves as a means to receive and give care for oneself and one's family. Furthermore, care services can sometimes be a barrier to communication of family health histories while concealment of disease and of family health histories and identities may be a form of care. Finally, intergenerational family health history discussions may prompt encouragement of care-seeking behaviors and preventive care. The results of this pilot study suggest avenues through which care arrangements could be capitalized on to promote the sharing of health history information within families to better manage chronic disease risk. In addition, they illustrate the potential for family health history discussions to further encourage care-seeking for chronic disease prevention.}

abstract = {Background
Dietary risk factors contribute to over half of all deaths resulting from cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Relationships between diet intake and CVD can be assessed by diet quality indices (DQIs). While higher diet quality is typically observed in vegetarian diets compared to standard omnivorous patterns, improving diet quality among communities remains challenging. We hypothesized a plant-based culinary medicine (CM) intervention may enhance adoption of a healthful dietary pattern.
Objective
To determine changes in diet quality in clinical patients after participating in a vegan CM intervention.
Study Design, Settings, Participants
In a randomized crossover clinical trial, adults at risk for CVD recruited from medical clinics were assigned to follow two vegan diet patterns either high (4 tablespoons/day) or low (<1 teaspoon/day) in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) for 4 weeks each, separated by a 1-week washout period. Participants were asked to complete 5-7 consecutive days of dietary recalls assessed by the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24®) at baseline and during each diet period. Weekly virtual CM group cooking classes coincided with both diet phases.
Measurable Outcome/Analysis
Diet recalls were analyzed to confirm diet compliance and calculate Whole Plant Food Density (WPFD) DQI and subcomponents. Paired t-tests compared differences from baseline and between diets.
Results
Of 40 participants (75% female, BMI 32+7 kg/m2, 64+8 years mean+sd), WPFD increased from 2.93+1.48 cup/oz-equivalents per 1000 kcal pre-intervention to 4.96+1.37 and 6.41+2.05 cup/oz-equivalents per 1000 kcal during the high and low EVOO phases, respectively (p<0.0001). All subcomponents (whole grains, legumes, whole fruit, vegetables, and nuts/seeds) significantly increased compared to baseline (p<0.001).
Conclusion
Participation in a virtual vegan CM intervention increased diet quality through greater intake of whole plant foods. Enhanced diet quality may reduce CVD risk factors (reported elsewhere), which correlate to measures of WPFD. Beneficial findings warrant further research on the use of WPFD as a DQI and CM for supporting nutritional adherence in diverse populations.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The study of male reproductive aging and its associated concerns holds significant importance within the realm of health issues affecting the elderly population. Wubi Shanyao Pills (WSP), a traditional Chinese patent medicine originating from the Tang Dynasty, has been recognized for its ability to enhance male sexual functions while also tonifying the kidney and spleen. Nevertheless, the precise effects and underlying mechanisms through which WSP ameliorates the decline in reproductive function among aging men remain uncertain.
Aim of the study
This study elucidated the distinctive impacts of WSP on ameliorating the decline in reproductive function caused by natural aging, as well as its underlying mechanisms.
Materials and methods
Initially, male mice at the age of 15 months were administered WSP orally at doses of 0.375, 0.75, and 1.50 g/kg per day for a duration of 8 consecutive weeks. The impact of WSP on age-related manifestations in naturally aging mice was assessed based on their behavioral performance. The renal function of the mice was evaluated by measuring serum biochemical indicators, including Creatinine (CR), Uric acid (UA), and Blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Additionally, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Malonaldehyde (MDA) levels in renal tissue were determined using applied chemistry methods. Then assessed the levels of Nitric oxide (NO), Total nitric oxide synthase (T-NOS), Guanosine cyclase (GC), and Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the penile tissue, as well as the expression of Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and Guanylate Cyclase Activator (GUCA) protein, in order to investigate the erectile function of the penis. Additionally, the quality of epididymal sperm was examined using an electron microscope. Furthermore, the serum sex hormone level and related protein expression were determined through the utilization of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry techniques. Pathological alterations and the ultrastructure of the testis were investigated using hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. Subsequently, the apoptosis of spermatogenic cells in the testes was assessed employing TUNEL, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results
The administration of WSP has been found to enhance the behavioral performance and sexual behavior in aged mice. It's also could increase in serum levels of CR, UA, and BUN, as well as the elevation of SOD activity in kidney tissue, which subsequently leads to a reduction in MDA levels and an improvement in the structural damage caused by aging in the kidney tissue. Consequently, the renal function is enhanced. Additionally, WSP has been observed to elevate the levels of NO, T-NOS, GC, and cGMP in penile tissue, along with an increase in eNOS and GUCA protein expression, indicating an improvement in penile erectile function. The administration of WSP resulted in a decrease in the occurrence of programmed cell death in testicular germ cells, leading to an enhancement in sperm quality and the overall function of testicular spermatogenesis. This improvement can be attributed to the modulation of hormone levels and the regulation of SIRT1/3, p53, FOXO3, Bax, and Caspase-3 expression.
Conclusion
Collectively, our findings indicate that the administration of WSP has the potential to impede the occurrence of programmed cell death in testicular cells by modulating the expression of SIRT1/3 and subsequent genes associated with apoptosis. Consequently, this regulatory mechanism facilitates the proliferation of testicular cells and sustains the spermatogenic function of the testes. Consequently, by modulating the levels of sexual hormones in naturally aging mice, WSP ultimately enhances the quality of sperm and reproductive function. Concurrently, it also ameliorates age-related behavioral changes, renal function, and erectile function.}

In past decades, various clinical and bench studies have investigated the risk factors and underlying mechanisms of allergy and immunology. Meanwhile, conventional therapy is often unsatisfactory due to limitations in effectiveness and potential adverse effects. Occasionally, better solutions can be offered through integrative medicine (IM). Chinese medicine (CM) integrated with conventional therapy is the most popular preventive and therapeutic approach in Asian and Chinese communities around the world. CM has evolved as a unique system of medical practice from ancient China based on empirical knowledge. Through thousands of years of “real-world” situations with large numbers of patients, it has now been integrated with conventional approaches. IM plays a role in the diagnosis, treatment, and preventive approaches of immune-related diseases. Such as allergic rhinitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. IM techniques include decoctions, acupuncture, moxibustion, and mind-body exercises. Recently, the research development of CM and IM has improved due to global clinical needs and clinical research funding support. Thousands of clinical studies including clinical trials, observational studies, and systematic reviews have been developed and published. However, the studies vary based on quality, interventions, and recommendations. It is necessary to review the evidence to provide practical suggestions for clinical use.}

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been associated with detrimental effects on survival outcomes in cancer patients compared to standard of care medical interventions. CAM has received a significant increase in public awareness and interest in recent years. We sought to understand use patterns and perceptions in radiotherapy patients.
Materials/Methods
Data was collected from a cross-sectional survey of prospectively enrolled adult cancer patients, conducted at an NCI-designated cancer center and a comprehensive cancer center between 2020 and 2021. Cancer patients who received or were recommended radiotherapy were selected for analysis and grouped by CAM use. CAM users analyzed were those reporting use of enteral and parental interventions, including alternative medicines, special diets and herbal, vitamin and mineral supplements, and excluding mind/body practices. Differences between CAM users and non-users were analyzed with χ2 and two-sample t-tests. Predictors of CAM use were identified with multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Of the 749 respondents, 445 (59%) received or were recommended radiotherapy. Of those 445, 297 (67%) used enteral or parenteral CAM. Among CAM users, 81% were satisfied and 77% felt CAM was effective for intended use. The most common goal of CAM therapy was symptom management (44%), although CAM use as a curative-intent treatment (31%) was common. Compared to non-users, CAM users were more likely to be female (76% vs 62%, p<0.01), have self-reported incurable disease (73% vs 62%, p=0.04), to feel CAM is safe (45% vs 9%, p<0.01), effective at curing cancer (26% vs 11%, p<0.01), effective at managing symptoms (42% vs 20%, p<0.01), more likely to trust naturopaths (33% vs 22%, p=0.02) or chiropractors (26% vs 15%, p=0.01), more likely since COVID-19 to have a more favorable view of CAM (79% vs 42%, p=0.01) or use CAM (61% vs 40%, p=0.04), but less likely to decline recommended surgery (7% vs 19%, p<0.01) or recommended radiotherapy (5% vs 11%, p=0.03). No differences were noted between CAM users and non-users in trust of physicians or any media. Predictors of enteral or parenteral CAM use included female gender (OR 1.4, p=0.04), breast cancer (OR 2.1, p=0.03), colon cancer (OR 3.5, p=0.01), and metastatic cancer (OR 2.2, p<0.01).
Conclusion
The use of CAM is common among patients receiving or recommended radiotherapy, with nearly one-third of patients using CAM as a cancer cure. However, radiotherapy patients using CAM were less likely than non-users to decline other recommended therapies, dispelling the notion that CAM-users are more likely to eschew standard-of-care treatments, at least in this cohort. Understanding the patterns and perceptions of CAM use in radiotherapy patients is essential for improving patient-physician communication and treatment decision-making.}

Moreover, recent studies demonstrate that icaritin can serve as immune-modulating agent to exert anti-tumor effects. Nonetheless, both production efficiency and clinical applications of epimedium flavonoids have been restrained because of their low content, poor bioavailability, and unfavorable in vivo delivery efficiency. Recently, various strategies, including enzyme engineering and nanotechnology, have been developed to increase productivity and activity, improve delivery efficiency, and enhance therapeutic effects of epimedium flavonoids. In this review, the structure-activity relationship of epimedium flavonoids is described. Then, enzymatic engineering strategies for increasing the productivity of highly active baohuoside I and icaritin are discussed. The nanomedicines for overcoming in vivo delivery barriers and improving therapeutic effects of various diseases are summarized. Finally, the challenges and an outlook on clinical translation of epimedium flavonoids are proposed.}

An assortment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs), provide an ideal source for tissue engineering applications due to the absence of ethical concerns, their high availability, and the increasing number of methods for their isolation and expansion. ASCs and BMSCs possess the same multipotency, but substituting adipose tissue for bone marrow, as a source of stem cells for regenerative medicine, is greatly advantageous. ASCs are simple to procure via a method that is less invasive compared to BMSCs. In addition, the percentage of cells from adipose tissue with multipotency is high, mass culture is simple, and the cells function in a manner that is similar, and often better, than BMSCs. Thus human ASCs hold great potential in the field of regenerative medicine. In this chapter, we examine the utilization of ASCs for cartilage tissue engineering, to combat fibrosis/scarring, to improve fat grafting techniques, and further explore utilizing the ASC secretome as a cell-free modality for tissue engineering. Altogether, the regenerative potential of ASCs for tissue engineering is clear, and ultimately, further studies on these topics will provide innovative mechanisms for alleviating some of the limitations that are currently faced in the tissue engineering arena.}

abstract = {Background & AIMS
Antiviral treatment criteria are based on disease progression risk, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance recommendations for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) without cirrhosis is based on an annual incidence threshold of 0.2%. However, accurate and precise disease progression estimate data are limited. Thus, we aimed to determine rates of cirrhosis and HCC development stratified by age, sex, treatment status, and disease activity based on the 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines.
Methods
We analyzed 18,338 patients (8914 treated, 9424 untreated) from 6 centers from the United States and 27 centers from Asia-Pacific countries. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate annual progression rates to cirrhosis or HCC in person-years.
Results
The cohort was 63% male, with a mean age of 46.19 years, with baseline cirrhosis of 14.3% and median follow up of 9.60 years. By American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria, depending on age, sex, and disease activity, annual incidence rates ranged from 0.07% to 3.94% for cirrhosis, from 0.04% to 2.19% for HCC in patients without cirrhosis, and from 0.40% to 8.83% for HCC in patients with cirrhosis. Several subgroups of patients without cirrhosis including males younger than 40 years of age and females younger than 50 years of age had annual HCC risk near or exceeding 0.2%. Similar results were found using European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria.
Conclusion
There is great variability in CHB disease progression rates even among “lower-risk” populations. Future CHB modeling studies, public health planning, and HCC surveillance recommendation should be based on more precise disease progression rates based on sex, age, and disease activity, plus treatment status.}

This stems from intrinsic pitfalls of the current preclinical models used to test novel compounds. For example, animal models cannot replicate human genetics, the diversity of human brain cells, or certain aspects of human metabolism. The best models for drug development are those that can account for the effects that genetic and environmental diversity may have on basic tissue biology, at the same time being reproducible and accurately reflecting drug responses. Emerging technologies involving human pluripotent stem cells show great promise for developing such reliable, rapid, and cost-effective models to precisely reflect the diversity of human disease and responses to therapeutic agents that cannot be recapitulated in animals. Here we review some of these models and how they are starting to revolutionize the drug development pipeline.}

1. Participants will self-report the ability to describe important topics in palliative care for resident learners to master, and the effect of organized palliative education on residents’ performance. 2. Participants will self-report the ability to identify and understand the need for residency programs to implement organized palliative care didactics.
Introduction
Internal medicine residents are frequently asked to facilitate goals-of-care (GOC) conversations and end-of-life decisions without adequate prior training. We developed and taught a resident-focused palliative care curriculum with practice scenarios to better equip residents for GOC conversations during their training and beyond.
Methods
The curriculum consisted of a 2-hour didactic and practice session co-led by palliative care faculty and qualified residents. Topics included: intro to palliative care and hospice, GOC discussion structure with practice scenarios, and identifying a patient's legal decision maker. Resident learners completed pre- and post-surveys about their comfort level with topics including palliative care, hospice, healthcare surrogate and proxy, and leading GOC discussions. In total, 97 pre-didactic surveys and 89 post-didactic surveys were collected.
Results
Prior to the didactic session, the majority of residents felt neutral or were agreeably confident they could define and distinguish palliative care and hospice. Post didactic, 97.3% of residents were agreeable or strongly agreeable that they could confidently differentiate the two. There was an even greater impact on ability to identify healthcare proxies and surrogates: 68% of residents were neutral or not confident pre-survey versus 89.2% of residents feeling confident post-didactic. Additionally, prior to the didactic, only 12.5% of residents felt very confident in leading a GOC discussion. Another 53% were agreeably confident, 26% felt ambivalent, and 7% did not feel confident at all. Post-didactic, the number of residents who felt very confident leading a GOC discussion increased by 37.5%. Overall, the didactic session improved the total percent of residents feeling confident or very confident leading a GOC discussion to 93.2%.
Discussion
Overall, this project supports the need for residencies to implement organized palliative care didactics to better train residents in GOC discussions and beyond.}

abstract = {Background
Medication use is the main therapeutic intervention in people with intellectual disabilities (PWID). The limited evidence available in the literature suggests that pharmacists can make positive interventions in relation to the quality of the medication use process, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals, carers and PWID. The public health role of the pharmacist is yet to be clearly defined, broadly recognized and sufficiently promoted by public health agencies, pharmacy educators or other health care professionals.
Objective
Baseline audit of medication and public health communications provided by a pharmacist in a residential centre for PWID in Ireland.
Methods
Collation of pharmacy electronic and paper based information communication records. Survey of carers – electronic and paper based.
Findings
Pharmacist’s communication about health/ medicines is perceived important by carers. Proactive information is communicated without a query in advance for the benefit of staff and residents. “I value pharmacist’s interest in making information available to all those who are interested”.
Discussion
The pharmacist communicates information using finite resources (one pharmacy staff member) to support maximisation of outcomes and minimisation of medication risks and health risks. Impact of pharmacist’s interventions in this setting cannot be accurately measured. With the right communication, health systems can reduce the likelihood of certain conditions or improve the quality of life for PWID who already have these conditions. Specialist pharmacists can engage PWID and their carers with targeted communication. All types of health care provider should consider how to include pharmacy staffing into the overall skill mix for their service. Pharmacists have a role in optimising medication use, promoting health for PWID, preventing and delaying disease, and ensuring continuity of care. The pharmacist's role has expanded beyond the traditional product-oriented functions of dispensing. Pharmacists must learn how to communicate with PWID and their carers.}

abstract = {Background
Food insecurity is “a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food” and has been identified as a hidden epidemic which has expanded with the recent COVID pandemic. Increased attention has been given to the importance of health care provider (HCP) assessment of a patient’s food security. Little is known about if and how HCPs make the decision to discuss food insecurity with patients. Stereotypes of what types of patients experience food insecurity may result in patients at risk not being identified. Because HCPS may perceive this as a difficult topic to address in healthcare encounters, opportunity exists to understand how and when they choose to inquire about food insecurity. This study seeks to identify how HCPs make the decision to?screen patients for food insecurity and barriers and bias that may impact screening.
Methods
As a pilot study, 50 urban and rural HCPs will be surveyed about their?decision-making process when screening patients for food insecurity. A subset of respondents will participate in in-depth interviews exploring food security screening experiences and attitudes. Initial survey and interview data will be used to develop more salient survey questions to be distributed to all primary care physicians (N-310) who participate as volunteer subjects in an established statewide research network.
Findings
By ICCH 2022 the initial survey and interviews will have been completed. Findings: from the project should help identify how many providers regularly ask patients about food security and how and when they choose to do this. In addition, barriers and effective approaches to these conversations will be identified.
Discussion
Understanding food security screening practices and barriers can support identification of patients facing this health challenge and HCPs communication needs in engaging in food security conversations.}

abstract = {Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to investigate outcomes and risk factors of CKD progression and regression.
Methods
This is a longitudinal community-based cohort study of patients with NAFLD. Exclusion criteria included alcoholic liver diseases, sero-positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, sero-positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies, fatty liver index <60, individuals with only one year of data, missing data for fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4 score) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and advanced CKD at baseline. Main outcomes were stratified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria categories as state 1 (low risk), state 2 (moderately increased risk), and state 3 (high-risk/very-high risk of progression). The multi-state Markov model was used for outcome analysis.
Results
This study included 1628 patients with NAFLD with a median follow-up of 3.4 years. State 2 CKD was found in 9.3% of patients at 5 years (95% CI, 8.1%–10.6%). Most patients with state 2 CKD recovered to state 1 (69%; 95% CI, 63.7%–74%), while 17.6% progressed to state 3 (95% CI, 13.4%–22.7%). Advanced liver fibrosis was found to be associated with the risk of transitioning from state 1 to state 2 ((FIB-4 score) ≥1.3; hazard ratio (HR), 1.42; 95% CI, 1.02–2.00), and reduced recovery from state 2 to state 1 (NFS≥−1.455; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34–0.91).
Conclusion
NAFLD severity is associated with CKD, which may be reversible before becoming high-risk. Controlling metabolic risk factors and preventing advanced liver fibrosis are recommended.}

abstract = {Introduction
In a self-report study of women presenting to a gynecological clinic, 9 out of 10 women reported a sexual health concern (Nusbaum 2003). These concerns are best addressed using a biopsychosocial approach to assessment, treatment and prevention drawing on medical, behavioral and psychological science. At an academic health center in the United States, The Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service was launched in 2019 to provide evaluation, education, treatment and prevention interventions using an integrated practice model. The interdepartmental program currently includes an Advanced Practice Nurse from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology as well as two clinical health psychologists from the Department of Psychiatry all with expertise in women's health and women's sexual medicine. Our interprofessional team collaborates closely with providers in women's primary care, medical, gynecologic and radiation oncology, urogynecology, colorectal surgery, among others.
Objective
Review lessons learned from interdepartmental program design, funding, implementation, and evaluation of the Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service in an academic health center, summarize the types of sexual health concerns among women who presented to the integrated service, and highlight recommendations to generalize and/or adjust the program model to other types of health settings.
Methods
Review the program implementation and evaluation process for the Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service, summarize the data on the women seen for care from April 23 2019 through June, 2021 (e.g., the number of unduplicated patients evaluated, their age, sexual health concerns, and treatment offered, etc), and outline program challenges and strategies to sustain and expand the initiative during and following the COVID-19 pandemic through virtual and in-person care.
Results
The Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service saw 198 women from April 23 2019 through June, 2021. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 72 (mean: 45 years). While most patients (33%) referred themselves to this program, other women were referred by obgyns, medical oncologists, women's primary care providers and gynecologic oncologists. Primary sexual health concerns included one or more of the following issues: pain (100), low desire (76), difficulty with orgasm (19), difficulty with arousal (12) and other (55). Additional findings will be presented on the types of treatment offered as well as patient and referring provider satisfaction with the new integrated sexual health consult service.
Conclusions
Our interdepartmental Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service implemented a highly successful program that integrates sexual medicine, behavioral health, health psychology and sexual therapy to ensure access to state-of-the-art interprofessional education and care for women across the life span in all their diversities. We were able to sustain and expand this program through telehealth and in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anticipate further growth in patient referrals and treatment modalities moving forward. Providers across disciplines also routinely refer to and collaborate with the program. Several components of the model are generalizable or adjustable to other women's health settings.

Nearly 30% of these cancers may be driven by specific mutations that promote tumor growth and proliferation. These mutations are observed more frequently in young patients without significant smoking history and in certain racial and ethnic backgrounds. The past 15 years have marked a revolution for patients with molecularly driven lung cancer as novel, oral, targeted therapies have been developed that demonstrate superior activity with substantially better toxicity profiles in comparison to chemotherapy. Consideration of molecular testing for a driver mutation is imperative for all providers caring for patients with a new suspected lung cancer diagnosis, as discovery of an actionable mutation will have dramatic implications in regards to patient survival and quality of life.}

abstract = {Background
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are released by neutrophils to capture invading pathogens. Recent studies show that NETs also play a significant role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the clinical significance of NET-related genes (NETRGs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been fully elucidated.
Methods
The transcriptomic and clinical data of HCC patients were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. The prognostic NETRGs were screened based on Kaplan-Meier and univariate COX analyses, and different molecular clusters corresponding to NETs-related modification patterns were identified by unsupervised clustering analyses. A NETs-related prognostic signature (NETRPS) was then constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method, and the patients were accordingly classified into the low-risk and high-risk groups. The molecular clusters and risk groups were compared in terms of the tumor microenvironment characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response and clinical characteristics through various bioinformatic methods.
Results
Three distinct NETs-related clusters were identified, which were termed A, B and C. Notably, cluster C demonstrated high enrichment of infiltrating immune cells and stromal-related pathways, and was associated with worst prognosis. Furthermore, the low-risk group was characterized by better prognosis, stronger metabolic activation, higher immune cell infiltration, and greater responsiveness to immunotherapy, targeted and interventional therapies compared to the high-risk group. The nomogram based on NETRPS and other clinical information predicted patient prognosis with high accuracy.
Conclusion
NETs play a significant role in shaping the biological and immune landscape of the HCC microenvironment. NETRPS is a promising biomarker for predicting the prognosis and therapeutic responses of HCC patients.}
