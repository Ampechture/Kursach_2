Background
Traditional Medicine (TM) has a wide uptake in most countries. In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a common kind of primary health because of its beneficial effects. This review aimed to appraise the publication reporting quality of economic evaluations for selective TCM in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), Version 2020, based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.
Methods
Electronic databases were searched for economic evaluation that supported the TCM negotiations in NRDL (2020 version) published from 2001 to 2021, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, WanFang, and SinoMed. The CHEERS statement was used to appraise the reporting quality of included TCM economic evaluations.
Results
A total of 360 articles were retrieved, but only 38 economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. None of the articles reported all items in the CHEERS checklist. The mean score of included articles is low at 10.93±2.62, with an average scoring rate of 51.31±10.53%. The least reported items included: “Characterizing heterogeneity,” “Conflicts of interest”, “Discount rate,” and “Study perspective,” with a reporting rate of 0.00%, 5.26%, 7.89%, and 15.79%, respectively.
Conclusion
An upward trend occurred in the quantity and quality of the economic evaluation publications of TCM in China. TCM economic evaluations are still at an early stage, with an urgent need for improving reporting quality. It may result from research experiences or different ideas between TCM and Western Medicine. Adhering to reporting guidelines like CHEERS and educating economic evaluation investigators can improve TCM economic evaluations’ reporting quality.}

abstract = {Research Objectives
To examine patient-level predictors of referral to cancer rehabilitation medicine services following a physical activity screening assessment among cancer survivors.
Design
Secondary analysis of individuals that completed My Wellness Check Program (MWC), an electronic health record-integrated symptom screening and referral system for cancer survivors, between April 2021 and January 2022. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Setting
Ambulatory oncology clinics in an urban academic medical center.
Participants
1,174 cancer survivors who completed the Moving Through Cancer physical activity assessment and at least one MWC assessment battery.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures
Positive screening for physical inactivity (yes/no). Completed referral to cancer rehabilitation medicine services following a positive screen (yes/no).
Results
Forty-six percent of survivors screened positive as being physically inactive. Individuals with moderate-severe physical dysfunction compared to none-to-mild (aOR: 1.750; 95%CI: 1.137 - 2.693; p=0.0109) had higher odds and self-reporting Hispanic/Latino ethnicity compared to non-Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (0.720; 0.556, 0.932; p=0.0126) had lower odds of positive screening for physical inactivity. Only 31% of survivors with physical inactivity received a completed referral to cancer rehabilitation medicine services. There were no significant predictors associated with referral completion.
Conclusions
Self-reported physical function and ethnicity may help clinicians identify cancer survivors at risk for physical inactivity. Additional research on provider- and organizational-level variables are needed to determine the relationship between referral completion to cancer rehabilitation medicine services following physical activity assessments.

In the online medicine dispensing cabinet where the order images are captured along with the customer’s online order information, an automatic order check method is needed to verify whether the picked items match the order information and avoid the mis-dispensing of medicines. Well-built images dataset and annotations are needed for the task. However, it is difficult to construct datasets with fine annotations and keep the images up-to-date in the application scenario. Automatic order check is facing the problems of small samples, diverse and dynamic categories, weak supervision, and domain gaps. To deal with the order check task under incomplete data in real scenarios, we carried out the following works: (1) We proposed a framework for automatic order check (AOC), and collected an incomplete dataset in natural scenes. (2) We proposed a foreground detection method based on conventional image processing. Image matching methods based on local descriptors and text recognition were designed for classification. (3) We proposed a data simulation pipeline for rotated object detection model training with weak supervision. Our methods showed promising results on our challenging dataset.}

The Mongolian medicine Nuangong Qiwei Pill (NGQW) is a folk prescription with a long history of use by the Mongolian people. NGQW comprises seven Mongolian medicines, which have the effects of regulating and nourishing blood, warming the uterus, dispelling cold and relieving pain. For a long time, it has been used as a good remedy for gynecological diseases, with remarkable curative effects, favored by the majority of patients and recommended by doctors. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common gynecological endocrine disorder that can lead to menstrual disorders or infertility. In the gynecological classification of Mongolian medicine, polycystic ovary syndrome has not been distinguished in detail, and the mechanism of NGQW in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome has not been scientifically studied and standardized.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of action of NGQW and macelignan in the treatment of PCOS and to provide a reference for the clinical application of these drugs.
Materials and methods
The effect of intragastric administration of NGQW and macelignan on PCOS model mice was observed. The mental status of mice was examined behaviorally, and serum hormone levels and oxidative stress parameters were measured by ELISA. Giemsa staining was used to detect the reproductive cycle, and HE staining was used to observe the ovarian status. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to observe the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells. qRT‒PCR was conducted to measure the expression of IL-6, BAX, BCL-2, and estrogen synthesis-related genes in ovarian tissue and particle cells.
Results
In the dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS model mice, both NGQW and macelignan improved the estrous cycle; increased the estradiol (E2) content; lowered testosterone (T), progesterone (P) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels; reduced the number of polycystic follicles; promoted granulosa cell proliferation; reduced granulosa cell apoptosis; and alleviated depression and anxiety. In addition, Nuangong Qiwei Pill and macelignan reduced the mRNA levels of the ovarian inflammatory factor IL-6; improved the disordered levels of the antioxidant indicators GSH, MDA, and SOD; and activated the TGF-β3 signaling pathway to increase the transcription of Cyp19a1, which increases estrogen secretion.
Conclusion
NGQW and macelignan can treat PCOS through the TGF-β3/Smad/Cyp19a1 signaling pathway to regulate the secretion ability of ovarian granulosa cells. Our research justifies the traditional use of NGQW to treat PCOS and enriches the scope of action of macelignan.}

abstract = {Background
Due to the toxicity issues of synthetic compounds, herbal medicines are preferred in treating or curing many diseases in recent times. Because of limited treatment options for chronic kidney disease (CKD), the use of traditional herbal medication to alleviate urogenital problems is the alternate therapeutic selection.
Purpose
Here, we summarized the research outcomes for the use of herbal medicine in the treatment of CKD and hurdles in the way for further research.
Methods
A relevant literature based on combinations of keywords such as herbal medicines, Chinese herbal medicine, CKD, chronic renal failure, nephroprotection, renoprotection, vegetable-based diet, and plant-based diets was searched using Pub med, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. The original articles published from 2006 to 2021 were taken into consideration. The literature was evaluated by studying the abstract or full text, all irrelevant studies were ignored.
Results
About 54 studies were found to describe the utilization of herbal drugs in the treatment of CKD in both human and laboratory animals, 17 studies described the clinical application of about 13 medicinal plants used against CKD in humans and 37 studies demonstrated the beneficial use of 24 medicinal plants in animal models and in vitro studies for CKD treatment explaining possible mechanisms of their action. The herbal treatment displayed anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, chemopreventive, and immune-mediated properties. The anti-inflammatory action is well implicated via regulation of cyclooxygenase-2, signal transducer, and activation of transcription 3 and IκB kinase β pathways. These pathways are being hypothesized to produce convincing results in CKD. The CKD and gut microbiota is known to be closely related through inflammatory, renal, cardiovascular, and endocrine processes. The various concerns encountered during the use of herbal therapy in CKD are unpredictable pharmacokinetics, herbal and physiological interactions, electrolytic imbalance, and interaction with co-morbid conditions. The combined use of Chinese herbal medicine and Western medicine for the treatment of advanced-stage CKD was found to be effective in delaying dialysis initiation and reducing dialysis incidence.
Conclusions
A large number of medicinal plants have shown promising beneficial effects against several diseases including cancer, but only a handful of studies are available on CKD. Several studies explained the possible mechanisms of herbal medications in CKD for therapeutic use; however, the focussed molecular studies for identification of active components of medicinal herbs with their mechanism of action and safety standard are still awaited. The demand for well-designed clinical trials and rigorous pharmacological studies as well as a surge for combined use of herbal medicine and Western medicine for the treatment of CKD has been noticed. The nephrotoxicity issues of medicinal plants should not be ignored.}

The past twenty years have seen the increasingly important role of ontology in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, the development of TCM ontology faces many challenges. Since the epistemologies dramatically differ between TCM and contemporary biomedicine, it is hard to apply the existing top-level ontology mechanically. “Data silos” are widely present in the currently available terminology standards, term sets, and ontologies. The formal representation of ontology needs to be further improved in TCM. Therefore, we propose a unified basic semantic framework of TCM based on in-depth theoretical research on the existing top-level ontology and a re-study of important concepts in TCM. Under such a framework, ontologies in TCM subdomains should be built collaboratively and be represented formally in a common format. Besides, extensive cooperation should be encouraged by establishing ontology research communities to promote ontology peer review and reuse.}

The recognition of serum biomarkers for differentiation between traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes would greatly increase the objectivity and treatment results. The objective of this study was to identify whether adiponectin (ADIPOQ), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4 (IGFBP-4) are reliable biomarkers for differentiation between the heart-yang deficiency and heart-yin deficiency syndromes of TCM-based chronic heart failure.
Methods
Serum samples of 25 heart-yang deficiency patients, 25 heart-yin deficiency patients, and 25 healthy participants were analyzed. The participants were also subjected to blood pressure measurements and laboratory testing of the variables creatinine, CRP, BNP, NT-proBNP, IGFBP-2, ADIPOQ, and IGFBP-4. ELISA assays were performed to confirm the expression patterns of IGFBP-2, ADIPOQ, and IGFBP-4. ANOVA was used to compare variables between groups and the Tukey's Test was applied to statistically significant results for post-hoc analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between IGFBP-4 and dichotomous variables, while linear regression analysis was used to evaluate continuous variables. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the diagnostic ability of IGFBP-4.
Results
The ELISA results showed that only IGFBP-4 was significantly up-regulated (p < 0.01) in heart-yang deficiency patients, while ADIPOQ and IGFBP-2 were significantly upregulated in both groups. The ROC curve suggested that the area under the curve value of IGFBP-4 was as high as 0.969.
Conclusions
The results suggest IGFBP-4 may have diagnostic value as a potential biomarker for clinical differentiation between heart-yin deficiency and heart-yang deficiency patients.}

We speculate that the balance of tumor suppression signaling and the cell growth sustaining mechanisms in molecular genetics might reflect the balance between Yin and Yang in Chinese medicine. Some Chinese medicine herbs are known to sustain longevity, and help to prevent aging related diseases, such as Panax Ginseng, Ganoderma Lucidum etc. Based on Chinese medicine databases and the molecular signature database, we try to apply in silico systems pharmacology to analyze the function of these herbs in modulating signaling pathways. We found that most of these herbs could enhance cellular mitochondrial function: oxidative phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the lipids metabolism pathways were found in all the herbs analyzed. Interestingly, the cell proliferation pathways, such as telomere maintenance pathway, Myc pathway, E2F pathway, as well as the cell quality control pathway (apoptosis pathway) were also found to be enhanced in most herbs, which added evidences to our balancing hypothesis. Thus, our data revealed the sustainable energy production, the sustainable cell proliferation, and the quality control build the life triangle for the mechanism of action of Chinese medicinal herbs with longevity sustaining property. This methodology might help to predict the molecular mechanism of Chinese medicine herbs, and further understand the formulation of Chinese medicine in preventing aging-related diseases.

The World Health Organization defines interprofessional education (IPE) “as an experience where students from two or more professions learn about, from, and with each other to…improve health outcomes.”1 Recent studies have demonstrated that IPE experiences can produce positive outcomes, and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education Accreditation Standards require IPE experiences to be incorporated in both didactic and experiential components of pharmacy curricula. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of required rotation interprofessional activities on fourth-year pharmacy students' self-assessment of interprofessional collaboration behaviors.
Methods
This was an ambidirectional cohort study conducted among students enrolled in their inpatient general medicine advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) at the University of Texas at El Paso School of Pharmacy during academic year 2020–2021. Students completed the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) competency self-assessment instrument at the beginning and end of their six-week APPE. The survey instrument assessed IPEC competencies in the four IPE domains.
Results
During the 2020–2021 academic year, 29 APPE pharmacy students completed the pre- and post-assessment during their inpatient general medicine APPE. There was a significant increase (P < .001) in IPEC scores from baseline to post-assessment in each domain.
Conclusions
Students had a positive change in interprofessional collaboration behaviors after completing the required IPE on their inpatient general medicine APPE, which is consistent with prior studies. While students' perceived IPE behaviors improved, further research is needed to elucidate the value of IPE learning activities and impact on learning outcomes.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Tibetan Patent Medicines (TPMs) have unique advantages in the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS) with the features of multi-component, multi-channel, and multi-target. In China, five TPMs mainly consisting of precious medicinal materials such as gold, pearls, and agate are widely utilized to treat IS and have achieved good results according to the current clinical practice.
Aim of the study
To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the five TPMs orally in treating IS and provide a reference for future clinical application and research.
Materials and methods
We searched the following 24 databases up to December 11, 2022: China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, etc. Comprehensive searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the five TPMs for IS were conducted. Outcome measures included clinical effective rate, neurological impairment score, activities of daily living (ADL), hematologic indices, and adverse events (AEs). The meta-regression, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the sources of heterogeneity. We assessed the evidence grade of outcomes via the GRADE system. TSA software was used for trial sequential analyses of the clinical effective rate, neurological impairment score, and ADL.
Results
17 RCTs (1603 patients) met our criteria. Compared with the control groups, the five TPMs showed greater improvement in clinical effective rate (RR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.29, P < 0.00001), neurological impairment score (SMD = −1.71, 95% CI -2.31 to −1.10, P < 0.00001), ADL (SMD = 1.97, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.68, P < 0.00001), hematocrit (MD = −1.56, 95% CI -2.83 to −0.29, P = 0.02), and hypersensitive-c-reactive-protein (MD = −2.96, 95% CI -3.30 to −2.61, P < 0.00001). AEs were reported in four RCTs and there was no statistical difference between groups (RD = −0.00, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.03, P = 0.82). The quality of evidence of the outcomes was rated as low to very low according to the GRADE system. The results of TSA provided firm evidence for the significant effect of the five TPMs on clinical effective rate, neurological impairment score, and ADL.
Conclusions
This review showed that the five TPMs were beneficial in improving clinical effective rate, neurological impairment scores, and ADL. However, no definite conclusions for hematologic indices and AEs were drawn due to insufficient studies. Further high-quality clinical trials are required to confirm these findings.}

In a previous study, evidence was found of the variability of signs/symptoms (s/s) of blood stasis syndrome among texts of Chinese and Asian origin and English language texts including evidence of the differences between non-Asian and Asian patients. In the current study the diagnostic patterns of qi deficiency (QD) and qi stagnation (QS) were examined to see if similar results could be found.
Methods
The study consisted of two phases – a search of libraries and a search of electronic databases, and searching for texts describing QD and QS s/s ensuring inclusion of Asian origin texts (principally Chinese) and Western origin texts. More commonly mentioned s/s were compared for each type of source and across all sources.
Results
Study one: From the 21 included QD texts, six s/s were generally agreed upon with three more commonly mentioned in Western origin texts, three more commonly mentioned in Chinese origin texts. From the 17 included QS texts, three s/s were more generally agreed upon with three more commonly mentioned in Western origin texts. Study two: Comparing s/s in 13 QD studies, five were mentioned by more than half the studies. Comparing six QS studies, six s/s were more generally agreed upon. In a comparison of s/s for QD mentioned by Western and Chinese origin texts and the Asian studies, three were mentioned by >50% sources, one more often by Chinese texts, three more often by Western texts and one more often by Asian studies. In a comparison of s/s for QS mentioned by Western and Chinese origin texts and the Asian studies, two were mentioned by >75%, two more often by Western texts and two more often by Asian studies.
Conclusion
English language texts and studies describing QD and QS s/s were examined. Evidence of agreement on a few s/s were identified. English origin texts showed differences in texts originating from Asia, which may support the hypothesis that QD and QS may manifest differently among Western and Asian patients.}

Atherosclerosis (AS) is a common systemic disease with increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with characteristics of multiple pathways and targets, presents advantages in the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.
Aim of the study
With the modernization of TCM, the active ingredients and molecular mechanisms of TCM for AS treatment have been gradually revealed. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the existing studies on TCM therapies aimed at regulating AS over the past two decades.
Materials and methods
Using “atherosclerosis” and “Traditional Chinese medicine” as keywords, all relevant TCM literature published in the last 10 years was collected from electronic databases (such as Elsevier, Springer, PubMed, CNKI, and Web of Science), books and papers until March 2022, and the critical information was statistically analyzed.
Results
In this review, we highlighted extracts of 8 single herbs, a total of 41 single active ingredients, 20 TCM formulae, and 25 patented drugs, which were described with chemical structure, source, model, efficacy and potential mechanism.
Conclusion
We summarized the cytopathological basis for the development of atherosclerosis involving vascular endothelial cells, macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, and categorically elaborated the medicinal TCM used for AS, all of which provide the current evidence on the better management of atherosclerosis by TCM.}

HBV infection is still one of the serious public health problems in the world. NAs as the first line drugs effectively inhibit viral replication, whereas the suppressive effects are much weaker on HBV antigen expression. Chinese patent medicine Liuweiwuling tablet (LWWL) has been used for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients for more than 10 years as an adjuvant treatment. Objective. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LWWL combined with NAs in treating CHB by meta-analysis. Methods. Systematic searches for randomized controlled trials (RCT) were conducted in four databases (up to December 2020) without language restrictions. Data were analyzed using Cochrane RevMan software version 5.3.0 and Stata software version 13.1, and reported as weight mean difference (WMD) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcomes were negative conversion rate of serum HBV DNA and HBeAg. The secondary outcomes were improvement of liver function including ALT and AST, and adverse drug reactions. The quality of evidence was evaluated according to criteria from the Cochrane risk of bias. Results. A total of 201 potentially relevant publications were identified, and 20 RCTs were eligible for inclusion. For the negative rate of HBV DNA (OR ​= ​2, 95%CI:1.64–2.45, P ＜0.05) and HBeAg (OR ​= ​1.83, 95%CI:1.46–2.30, P＜0.05), there were both statically significant benefit in favor of LWWL combined with NAs. In addition, Meta-analysis also showed that LWWL combined with NAs significantly reduced ALT (WMD ​= ​−17.73, 95%CI: 21.37∼-14.09, P ​< ​0.01), AST (MD ​= ​-23.49, 95%CI: −30.52∼-16.45, P ​< ​0.05), and increased the normalization rate of ALT (OR ​= ​3.89, 95%CI:2.82–5.36, P ​< ​0.01). Conclusion. The negative conversion rates of HBV DNA, HBeAg, and improvement of liver function in patients treated with LWWL combined with NAs were significantly higher than those treated with NAs alone, and no serious ADRs were identified. This work provides a reference to the evidence, for the beneficial effects of LWWL combined with NAs in treating CHB.}

abstract = {Objectives
In the Emergency Department (ED), ultrasound-guided nerve blocks (UGNBs) have become a cornerstone of multimodal pain regimens. We investigated current national practices of UGNBs across academic medical center EDs, and how these trends have changed over time.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional electronic survey of academic EDs with ultrasound fellowships across the United States. Twenty-item questionnaires exploring UGNB practice patterns, training, and complications were distributed between November 2021–June 2022. Data was manually curated, and descriptive statistics were performed. The survey results were then compared to results from Amini et al. 2016 UGNB survey to identify trends.
Results
The response rate was 80.5% (87 of 108 programs). One hundred percent of responding programs perform UGNB at their institutions, with 29% (95% confidence interval (CI), 20%–39%) performing at least 5 blocks monthly. Forearm UGNB are most commonly performed (96% of programs (95% CI, 93%–100%)). Pain control for fractures is the most common indication (84%; 95% CI, 76%–91%). Eighty-five percent (95% CI, 77%–92%) of programs report at least 80% of UGNB performed are effective. Eighty-five percent (95% CI, 66%–85%) of programs have had no reported complications from UGNB performed by emergency providers at their institution. The remaining 15% (95% CI, 8%–23%) report an average of 1 complication annually.
Conclusions
All programs participating in our study report performing UGNB in their ED, which is a 16% increase over the last 5 years. UGNB's are currently performed safely and effectively in the ED, however practice improvements can still be made. Creating multi-disciplinary committees at local and national levels can standardize guidelines and practice policies to optimize patient safety and outcomes.}

abstract = {Pien Tze Huang (PZH), a class-1 nationally protected traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been used to treat liver diseases such as hepatitis; however, the effect of PZH on the progression of sepsis is unknown. Here, we reported that PZH attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis in mice and reduced LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages by inhibiting the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signalling. Mechanistically, PZH stimulated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation to induce the expression of A20, which could inhibit the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signalling. Knockdown of the bile acid (BA) receptor G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) in macrophages abolished the effects of PZH on STAT3 phosphorylation and A20 induction, as well as the LPS-induced inflammatory response, suggesting that BAs in PZH may mediate its anti-inflammatory effects by activating TGR5. Consistently, deprivation of BAs in PZH by cholestyramine resin reduced the effects of PZH on the expression of phosphorylated-STAT3 and A20, the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signalling, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas the addition of BAs to cholestyramine resin-treated PZH partially restored the inhibitory effects on the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Overall, our study identifies BAs as the effective components in PZH that activate TGR5-STAT3-A20 signalling to ameliorate LPS-induced sepsis.}

Through in-depth interviews with clinicians, state officials, and organizational stakeholders, this paper examines opioid prescribing limits legislation (PLL) in North Carolina and how it impacts clinical practice. Since the advent of PLL, clinicians report being more mindful when prescribing opioids and as expected, writing for shorter durations for both acute and postoperative pain. But clinicians also report prescribing opioids less frequently for acute pain, refusing to write second opioid prescriptions, foisting responsibility for patient pain care onto other clinicians, and no longer writing opioid prescriptions for chronic pain patients. They directly credit PLL for these changes, including institutional policies enacted in response to PLL, and, to a lesser degree, notions of “do no harm.” However, we argue that misapplication of and ambiguities in PLL along with defensive medicine practices whereby clinicians and their institutions center their legal interests over patient care, amplify these restrictive changes in clinical practice. Clinicians’ narratives reveal downstream consequences for patients including undertreated pain, being viewed as drug-seeking when questioning opioid-prescribing decisions, and having to overuse the medical system to achieve pain relief.}

This feature makes the definition of family medicine complex due to its inclusive, holistic and continuous approach. The definition of family medicine should include the professional individual aspect of the family physician as well as its duties, authorities and responsibilities.1 Since the development of family medicine, definitions of the discipline have been frequently modified and updated, continuing to the present day. Family medicine represents the most basic aspect of the health-care system, which makes developing such definitions quite complex, and definitions must be revised and updated as conditions change. The first definition of family medicine, presented in 1974, was followed by a definition by Olesen et al. in 2000, and later by the European Society of General Practice/Family Medicine (WONCA Europe) in 2002. The WONCA Europe definition was then updated in 2011. Although this last definition explains family medicine in the most detailed way, today it needs updating especially in defining the individual characteristics of family medicine and its relations with the environment. There is a need to define the highly intensive role of family physicians while considering, the physicians’ spiritual and personal agenda as human beings. The Göktaş definition of family medicine/general practice, which was suggested at the WONCA Europe 2018 conference in Krakow, Poland, represents a suitable means of completing the 2011 WONCA Europe definition in this regard.
Resumen
La medicina familiar es la primera puerta de entrada a la atención primaria de salud en los sistemas de salud. Esta característica hace que la definición de medicina familiar sea compleja debido a su enfoque inclusivo, holístico y continuo. La definición de medicina familiar debe incluir el aspecto profesional individual del médico de familia, así como sus deberes, autoridades y responsabilidades.1 Desde el desarrollo de la medicina familiar, las definiciones de la disciplina se han modificado y actualizado con frecuencia, hasta el día de hoy. La medicina familiar representa el aspecto más básico del sistema de atención de la salud, lo que hace que el desarrollo de tales definiciones sea bastante complejo, y las definiciones deben revisarse y actualizarse a medida que cambian las condiciones. La primera definición de medicina familiar, presentada en 1974, fue seguida por una definición de Olesen et al. en 2000, y posteriormente, por la European Society of General Practice/Family Medicine (WONCA Europa) en 2002. La definición de WONCA Europa se actualizó en 2011. Aunque esta última definición explica la medicina familiar de la manera más detallada, hoy necesita actualizarse especialmente en la definición de las características individuales de la medicina familiar y sus relaciones con el entorno. Existe la necesidad de definir el papel altamente intensivo de los médicos de familia, considerando la agenda espiritual y personal de los médicos como seres humanos. La definición de Göktaş de medicina familiar/práctica general, que se sugirió en la conferencia WONCA Europa 2018 en Cracovia, Polonia, representa un medio adecuado para completar la definición de WONCA Europa 2011 en este sentido.}

Cancer is the leading cause of death in China. Studies have found positive effects of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as adjuvant therapy for cancer. The purpose of this study was to describe the belief in and use of TCM in Chinese patients with cancer receiving outpatient care, and explore factors influencing these two variables.
Methods
A consecutive sample of 287 patients with cancer in an outpatient clinic were surveyed on their belief in TCM, previous use of TCM for non-cancer, and use of TCM for cancer. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) were used to analyze the data.
Results
Participants had a strong belief in TCM for the treatment of both non-cancer and cancer. Over 50% of them had sometimes or often used TCM for a non-cancer illness and 84% of them used TCM as adjuvant therapy for cancer. OLR results demonstrated that belief in TCM for non-cancer and perceived effectiveness of herbs for cancer were significant predictors for belief in TCM for cancer, while income, number of prescribed herb names recalled and the total score of perceived effectiveness of TCM for cancer significantly predicted the total number of TCM modalities used for cancer.
Conclusion
Chinese patients with cancer receiving outpatient care had strong beliefs in TCM. However, the beliefs were not associated with the use of TCM. Income, the total number of names recalled for the herbal prescription used, and the perceived effectiveness of TCM affected the number of TCM modalities patients used.}

Mongolian medicine (MM) is an effective treatment option in China, however, the core group medicines (CGMs) in the treatment of PID and their underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, through the method of data mining, the CGMs of MM for the treatment of PID were excavated, and the possible mechanism of action of the CGMs in the treatment of PID was explored by using network pharmacology.
Methods
First, 89 MM formulae for the treatment of pulmonary infectious diseases collected from Gan Lu Si Bu, Meng Yi Jin Kui, People's Republic of China Ministry of Health Drug Standards (Mongolian Medicine Volume), Standard of Mongolian Medicine Preparations in Inner Mongolia (2007 Edition), and Standard of Mongolian Medicine Preparations in Inner Mongolia (2014 Edition). The CGMs of MM for PID were excavated through association rule analysis and cluster analysis. Then, the active ingredients and potential targets of the CGMs were obtained from TCMSP, TCMIP, BATMAN-TCM databases. PID targets information was collected from OMIM, GeneCards, and DrugBank databases. The possible targets of CGMs treatment for PID were obtained by intersection. The PPI network was constructed through the STRING database, and the topology analysis of the network was performed. Through the enrichment analysis of the intersection targets by R language, the main action pathways and related target proteins of CGMs in the treatment of PID were screened out. The results were verified by molecular docking.
Results
A total of 89 formulae were included, involving 164 MM herbs. The efficacy of the drugs was mainly cough-suppressing and panting-calming herbs, and heat-clearing herbs. The nature and flavor were mainly bitter and cold. The CGMs of MM to treatment of PID was excavated as the classic famous formula Sanzi Decoction (Toosendan Fructus-Chebulae Fructus-Gardeniae Fructus). A total of 28 candidate components and 237 predicted targets of CGMs were collected, and 61 common targets with PID were obtained, including key compounds such as quercetin, kaempferol, β-sitosterol and stigmastero and key targets such as VEGFA, IL6, TP53, AKT1. KEGG enrichment analysis yielded AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, IL-17 signaling pathways, and TNF signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed that the key targets were well matched with the potential active ingredients of CGMs.
Conclusion
This study found that MM commonly used cough-suppressing and panting-calming herbs in combination with heat-clearing herbs to treat PID, and the CGMs for the treatment of PID is “Toosendan Fructus-Chebulae Fructus-Gardeniae Fructus”. CGMs mainly play a role in the treatment of PID by acting on VEGFA, IL6, TP53, AKT1 and other targets, regulating AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, IL-17 signaling pathways, and TNF signaling pathways.}

abstract = {Objectives
It was recognised in the 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration that the integration of traditional medicine into modern health systems is a major lever for achieving universal health coverage. In several African countries, the integration of traditional medicine still faces constraints, despite the development of policies and regulations in favour of this integration. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the limitations of integrating traditional medicine in Africa.
Study design
This is a systematic review protocol for qualitative studies.
Methods
The aim will be to conduct a systematic review of qualitative studies according to PRISMA guidelines. Given the qualitative nature of the primary studies, the COREQ guidelines will also be used to complement PRISMA. The search for primary studies will be conducted in Medline, Science Direct, Hinari and Google Scholar databases, using search equations designed based on the keywords constituting the thesauri of the search question. This will be done independently by two authors. The screening steps of the identified articles will be presented in PRISMA 2009 flowchart. The assessment of the risk of bias of the primary studies and the strength of the conclusions or recommendations will be performed by the GRADE tool.
Results
The results of this systematic review will consist of the primary qualitative studies on the limitations of integrating traditional medicine into conventional health systems in African countries. These will be categorised into policy, legal, organisational and sociocultural limitations. They will be reported in accordance with the PRISMA and COREQ guidelines.
Conclusion
A systematic qualitative study of the limitations of effective integration of traditional medicine into conventional health systems in Africa is needed to guide national policies and regulations on traditional medicine. The application of PRISMA and COREQ standards to this review will ensure its quality and reproducibility.

abstract = {Worldwide, cancer is a growing epidemic that results in large social and economic burdens. Despite advances in current diagnosis and treatment, most of the prognosis in cancer patients remains poor. It is urgent to find alternative therapies with effective cancer prevention and treatment. Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have been increasingly used worldwide for cancer prevention and treatment due to their privileged properties. CHMs are useful in the suppression of various types of cancers through different mechanisms of action. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, are closely involved in the cancer progression and development. Regulation of ncRNAs in tumor cells may be a useful pharmacological strategy for the cancer prevention and treatment. Substantial evidence exists that various phytochemicals from CHMs exert potent anticarcinogenic effects by regulating ncRNAs-related targets and signaling pathways. Herein, the purpose of this paper is to conclude the current understanding of phytochemicals from CHMs in ncRNAs-mediated cancer suppression and the molecular mechanisms. This review will help to provide beneficial clues related to the clinical use of CHMs in the cancer prevention and treatment and further promote new drug discovery against cancer.}

When effectively executed, content alignment can aid student performance in associated courses. Limited research exists for content alignment of evidence-based medicine (EBM) and pharmacotherapy courses. This study assesses the impact of EBM and pharmacotherapy course alignment on student performance.
Methods
Content alignment included assignment of 6 landmark trials in EBM coursework. The articles were identified by pharmacotherapy instructors as “landmark” to management of associated diseases in the aligned pharmacotherapy semester. Articles were the basis for quizzes over skills taught in the EBM course and were referenced during pharmacotherapy lectures.
Results
During the alignment semester, students were more likely to cite specific guidelines and/or primary literature to rationalize pharmacotherapeutic plans on examinations compared with the prealignment period (54% vs 34%). Overall, pharmacotherapy case performance and plan rationale scores were significantly higher in the alignment semester compared with prealignment. Student performance on the Assessing Competency in Evidence-Based Medicine tool improved from the start of the semester (8.64, SD 1.66) to the end (9.5, SD 1.49; mean score +0.86). Comfort in applying EBM analysis to primary literature increased significantly between the first and final assignments, with 6.7% and 71.7% of students self-reporting a high degree of confidence, respectively. Students (73%) reported an enhanced understanding of pharmacotherapy due to alignment compared with a previous semester of pharmacotherapy without alignment.
Conclusion
The use of landmark trial assignments to align EBM and pharmacotherapy coursework demonstrated a positive impact on student rationale for clinical decision-making and student confidence in evaluating primary literature.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA).
Study Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Materials and methods
A computer was used to retrieve all RCTs of CHM in the treatment of KOA from 7 databases (PubMed; Embase; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; Chinese VIP Information Database; Chinese Biomedical Database and Wanfang Med Database) from the establishment to August 2021. The literature was organized using NoteExpress, and literature screening and data extraction were conducted by two researchers independently by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality evaluation was performed using GRADE, and the meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.4.
Results
A total of 31 RCTs and 3115 cases are included. The following meta-analysis results are observed: (1) WOMAC: CHM vs. placebo (SMD = −0.87, 95% CI: −1.27 to −0.47, P < 0.0001), CHM vs. Western medicine (SMD = −1.64, 95% CI: −2.09 to −1.19, P < 0.00001), and CHM + Western medicine vs. Western medicine (SMD = −2.17, 95% CI: −3.01 to −1.33, P < 0.00001); (2) VAS: CHM vs. Western medicine (SMD = −1.02, 95% CI: −1.63 to −0.41, P < 0.00001) and CHM + Western medicine vs. Western medicine (SMD = −2.68, 95% CI: −4.36 to −1.00, P < 0.00001); (3) Lequesne severity index: CHM vs. Western medicine (SMD = −0.90, 95% CI: −1.40 to −0.39, P = 0.0005) and CHM + Western medicine vs. Western medicine (SMD = −0.94, 95% CI: −1.36 to −0.52, P < 0.0001); (4) Lysholm knee joint function score: CHM vs. Western medicine (MD = 9.10, 95% CI: 4.20 to 14.01, P = 0.0003), and CHM + Western medicine vs. Western medicine in a single trial (MD = 21.15, 95% CI: 19.71 to 22.59, P < 0.00001); (5) SOD: in a single trial, CHM vs. Western medicine (MD = 1.62, 95% CI: 0.9 to 2.30, P < 0.00001) and CHM + Western medicine vs. Western medicine (MD = 17.08, 95% CI: 10.71 to 23.44, P < 0.00001); (6) TNF-α: CHM vs. Western medicine (SMD = −1.90, 95% CI: −2.04 to −0.14, P = 0.02) and CHM + Western medicine vs. Western medicine (SMD = −2.32, 95% CI: −4.33 to −0.30, P = 0.02); (7) IL-1β: CHM vs. Western medicine (SMD = −1.60, 95% CI: −2.36 to −0.84, P < 0.0001); and (8) IL-6: in a single trial, CHM vs. Western medicine (MD = −0.75, 95% CI: −1.20 to −0.30, P = 0.001) and CHM + Western medicine vs. Western medicine (MD = −3.18, 95% CI: −6.24 to −0.12, P = 0.04).
Conclusion
The efficacy of CHM in the treatment of KOA is superior to those of placebo and Western medicine. At the same time, the combination of CHM + Western medicine is superior to Western medicine alone in the treatment of KOA. However, due to the existence of certain biases in the included studies, and the need for further study on the effective components of Chinese medicine, a positive conclusion on the efficacy of traditional CHM in the treatment of KOA cannot be drawn and needs to be confirmed by high-quality clinical RCTs.}

We conducted a qualitative study of patients’ perspectives on dry mouth outcomes to explore their personal experiences and investigate which outcomes are most important to them. This work was part of the WONDER initiative (World Workshop on Oral Medicine Outcomes Initiative for the Direction of Research) exploring Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials.
Study Design
Using a study-specific topic guide, we conducted digitally recorded, semi-structured interviews of focus groups of patients with dry mouth secondary to Sjögren syndrome and head and neck radiotherapy. We conducted interviews until data saturation had been achieved and evaluated all transcripts for accuracy before we anonymized the data.
Results
Two focus groups consisting of 4 participants per group identified 4 distinct themes: (1) impact on oral health and function, (2) social isolation and withdrawal, (3) frustration with dry mouth management, and (4) limited knowledge of the medical community and lack of understanding of family and friends.
Conclusions
The diversity of self-reported outcomes and the complexity of patient perceptions identified in our work may represent additional barriers to successful dry mouth management that should be considered in the design of future clinical trials.}

A systematic literature search was conducted to extract RCTs adopting lifestyle interventions of diet, exercise, and stress management or emotional well-being. Results showed that 65 studies were eligible. Exercise was the most promising lifestyle intervention that improved various cognitive functions among people with MCI and dementia, and was more effective in MCI than in dementia. Interventions on stress management or emotional well-being did not show a significant effect on people with MCI, and the evidence for people with dementia was insufficient to conclude. Similarly, due to the lack of RCTs on a healthy dietary pattern, the effectiveness of diet interventions was not examined. In conclusion, the exercise component of lifestyle medicine can be an effective and clinically significant intervention for protecting people with MCI and dementia against cognitive declines, especially when served as an early intervention at the stage of MCI.}

abstract = {Purpose
Interdisciplinary training is a critical part of pharmacy education, and often much of the interdisciplinary participation occurs during the advanced practice experiences of the final professional year of pharmacy education. Creation and maintenance of these experiences can be difficult for faculty members, especially faculty at community hospitals or those with multiple roles and responsibilities at their practice site. The purpose of this article is to reflect on the development process and student acceptance of a collaborative, three-day a week internal medicine rounding student experience.
Description
Instead of a traditional five-day a week rounding schedule with a single, primary faculty preceptor, students participated in a three-day a week internal medicine rounding experience where their primary faculty preceptor had a faculty partner who functioned as a substitute. The student activities on the other days were adapted by each faculty preceptor based on their internal medicine subspecialty duties and needs of the practice site.
Analysis/Interpretation
Results from a seven-question, anonymous survey to students who participated in the three-day a week internal medicine rounds found high impact on their reported confidence and knowledge. Those responding “positive impact” or “extreme positive impact” ranged from 67% to 100%. In addition, 78% indicated comfort with the substitute faculty preceptor.
Conclusions
This collaborative, three-day a week rounding experience was well received by pharmacy students.
Implications
Non-traditional rounding may be an option that could help decrease pharmacy student and faculty burnout, while still providing a positive learning experience for students.}

Therefore, it is appealing to identify the common and specific perturbed genes from multiple cancer networks. We developed an integrative network medicine approach to identify novel biomarkers and investigate drug repurposing across cancer types. We used a network-based method to prioritize genes in cancer-specific networks reconstructed using human transcriptome and interactome data. The prioritized genes show extensive perturbation and strong regulatory interaction with other highly perturbed genes, suggesting their vital contribution to tumorigenesis and tumor progression, and are therefore regarded as cancer genes. The cancer genes detected show remarkable performances in discriminating tumors from normal tissues and predicting survival times of cancer patients. Finally, we developed a network proximity approach to systematically screen drugs and identified dozens of candidates with repurposable potential in several cancer types. Taken together, we demonstrated the power of the network medicine approach to identify novel biomarkers and repurposable drugs in multiple cancer types. We have also made the data and code freely accessible to ensure reproducibility and reusability of the developed computational workflow.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the robustness of sports medicine and arthroscopy related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting nonsignificant results by calculating the reverse fragility index (RFI) and reverse fragility quotient (RFQ).
Methods
All sports medicine and arthroscopic-related RCTs from January 1, 2010, through August 3, 2021, were identified. Randomized-controlled trials comparing dichotomous variables with a reported P value ≥ .05 were included. Study characteristics, such as publication year and sample size, as well as loss to follow-up and number of outcome events were recorded. The RFI at a threshold of P < .05 and respective RFQ were calculated for each study. Coefficients of determination were calculated to determine the relationships between RFI and the number of outcome events, sample size, and number of patients lost to follow-up. The number of RCTs in which the loss to follow-up was greater than the RFI was determined.
Results
Fifty-four studies and 4,638 patients were included in this analysis. The mean sample size and loss to follow-up were 85.9 patients and 12.5 patients, respectively. The mean RFI was 3.7, signifying that a change of 3.7 events in one arm was needed to flip the results of the study from non-significant to significant (P < .05). Of the 54 studies investigated, 33 (61%) had a loss to follow-up greater than their calculated RFI. The mean RFQ was 0.05. A significant correlation between RFI with sample size (R2 = 0.10, P = .02) and the total number of observed events (R2 = 0.13, P < .01) was found. No significant correlation existed between RFI and loss to follow-up in the lesser arm (R2 = 0.01, P = .41).
Conclusions
The RFI and RFQ are statistical tools that allow the fragility of studies reporting nonsignificant results to be appraised. Using this methodology, we found that the majority of sports medicine and arthroscopy-related RCTs reporting nonsignificant results are fragile.
Clinical Relevance
RFI and RFQ serve as tools that can be used to assess the validity of RCT results and provide additional context for appropriate conclusions.}

Background
Dental sleep medicine education (DSME) should be emphasised in postgraduate orthodontic training; however, there appears to be no clear guideline for its implementation into the curriculum.
Objective
The aim was to investigate the current status of DSME as well as its feasibility and implementation in postgraduate orthodontic programmes.
Methods
A structured interview with predetermined response options was chosen as a data collection method to gather relevant information from representatives of all accredited postgraduate orthodontic programmes in Thailand. These interviews were conducted online via the Cisco Webex Meeting platform. A combination of data analysis techniques was employed to achieve a thorough comprehension of the research findings, including descriptive statistics, quantitative content analysis, thematic analysis, and alignment analysis.
Results
All participating programmes reported the inclusion of DSME in their curricula. A didactic approach was adopted by all programmes. However, only 2 out of 7 programmes offered clinical sessions for their students. Several challenges in implementing DSME within orthodontic programmes were identified, including a shortage of expertise and limited patient access. The participants also suggested that knowledge and resource sharing amongst institutions could serve as a potential solution to enhance the feasibility of DSME.
Conclusions
This research highlighted the significant disparities and inadequacy of DSME within postgraduate orthodontic programmes in Thailand due to various challenges. Consequently, there is a compelling need to place greater emphasis on DSME and establish a national-level standardisation within orthodontic programmes. This effort is essential for enhancing the awareness and competency of orthodontists in the field of DSME.}

We introduced meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) into the evidence-based evaluation of the efficacy of the Mongolian medicine formula Gurigumu for liver diseases as an evidence-based medicine approach to identify the problems in the modernization process of Mongolian medicine.
Methods
Randomized controlled trials of Gurigumu formulae for liver diseases were collected from several bibliographic databases by combining subject words and free words. The Cochrane Collaboration Network Bias Risk Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the quality of the studies included in the analysis. RevMan software (version 5.3) was used to evaluate the total effective rate; other outcome indicators including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels underwent meta-analysis and subgroup analysis before and after treatment. TSA was used for the sequential analysis of total efficiency to verify the stability of the results.
Results
Fifteen randomized controlled trials involving 1188 patients were included in the analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the Gurigumu formulae had potential effects for liver disease in the total effective rate, ALT, AST, TG, and TC. Further, the total effective rate was were found to be stable via TSA verification.
Conclusion
This study determined the potential impact of Gurigumu formulae on liver diseases. Through the process of evidence-based research, key problems in the experimental design of Mongolian medicine and in the clinical methods were identified. The results introduce a new direction for the construction and improvement of a modern Mongolian medical system.}

abstract = {Background
Few studies have focused on the relationship between the traditional Chinese medicine constitution (TCMC) and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in older populations. We sought to investigate the distribution of MAFLD and the TCMC in older people, and provide a theoretical basis for TCMC-based management of MAFLD in this population.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among older (≥65 years) individuals in Zhongshan, China. Information on common sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, anthropometric measurements, and the TCMC was collected. The chi-square test, multivariable logistic regression analysis, subgroup analysis, and inverse probability weighting of the propensity score were used to explore the relationship between MAFLD and the TCMC.
Results
Of 7085 participants, 1408 (19.9 %) had MAFLD. The three most common TCMC types in MAFLD patients were “phlegm-dampness”, “gentleness”, and “yin-deficiency”. After adjustment for gender, age, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, abnormal waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, MAFLD was positively associated with the phlegm-dampness constitution (PDC) (ORadjusted (95 % CI) = 1.776 (1.496–2.108), P < 0.001), and negatively correlated with the qi-depression constitution (0.643 (0.481–0.860), 0.003). A stronger correlation between the PDC and MAFLD was observed in men compared with women (ORadjusted = 2.04 (95%CI = 1.47–2.84) vs. 1.70 (95%CI = 1.39–2.08), Pinteraction = 0.003) as well as between people who smoked tobacco and non-tobacco-smoking individuals (2.11 (1.39–3.21) vs. 1.75 (1.45–2.12), 0.006).
Conclusions
A positive relationship was observed between MAFLD and the PDC in older people living in Zhongshan. Early detection and treatment of the PDC (especially in men and smokers) could prevent the occurrence and development of MAFLD.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has saved countless lives and maintained human health over its long history, especially in respiratory infectious diseases. The relationship between the intestinal flora and the respiratory system has been a popular research topic in recent years. According to the theory of the “gut-lung axis” in modern medicine and the idea that “the lung stands in an interior-exterior relationship with the large intestine” in TCM, gut microbiota dysbiosis is a contributing factor to respiratory infectious diseases, and there is potential means for manipulation of the gut microbiota in the treatment of lung diseases. Emerging studies have indicated intestinal Escherichia coli (E. coli) overgrowth in multiple respiratory infectious diseases, which could exacerbate respiratory infectious diseases by disrupting immune homeostasis, the gut barrier and metabolic balance. TCM is an effective microecological regulator, that can regulate the intestinal flora including E. coli, and restore the balance of the immune system, gut barrier, and metabolism.
Aim of the review
This review discusses the changes and effects of intestinal E. coli in respiratory infection, as well as the role of TCM in the intestinal flora, E. coli and related immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism, thereby suggesting the possibility of TCM therapy regulating intestinal E. coli and related immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism to alleviate respiratory infectious diseases. We aimed to make a modest contribution to the research and development of new therapies for intestinal flora in respiratory infectious diseases and the full utilization of TCM resources. Relevant information about the therapeutic potential of TCM to regulate intestinal E. coli against diseases was collected from PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and so on. The Plants of the World Online (https://wcsp.science.kew.org) and the Plant List (www.theplantlist.org) databases were used to provide the scientific names and species of plants.
Results
Intestinal E. coli is a very important bacterium in respiratory infectious diseases that affects the respiratory system through immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism. Many TCMs can inhibit the abundance of E. coli and regulate related immunity, the gut barrier and the metabolism to promote lung health.
Conclusion
TCM targeting intestinal E. coli and related immune, gut barrier, and metabolic dysfunction could be a potential therapy to promote the treatment and prognosis of respiratory infectious diseases.}

abstract = {Background
Cancer management faces multiple obstacles, including resistance to current therapeutic approaches. In the face of challenging microenvironments, cancer cells adapt metabolically to maintain their supply of energy and precursor molecules for biosynthesis and thus sustain rapid proliferation and tumor growth. Among the various metabolic adaptations observed in cancer cells, the altered glucose metabolism is the most widely studied. The aberrant glycolytic modification in cancer cells has been associated with rapid cell division, tumor growth, cancer progression, and drug resistance. The higher rates of glycolysis in cancer cells, as a hallmark of cancer progression, is modulated by the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), a downstream target of the PI3K/Akt signaling, the most deregulated pathway in cancer.
Aim of Review
We provide a detailed overview of current, primarily experimental, evidence on the potential effectiveness of flavonoids to combat aberrant glycolysis-induced resistance of cancer cells to conventional and targeted therapies. The manuscript focuses primarily on flavonoids reducing cancer resistance via affecting PI3K/Akt, HIF-1α (as the transcription factor critical for glucose metabolism of cancer cells that is regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway), and key glycolytic mediators downstream of PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α signaling (glucose transporters and key glycolytic enzymes).
Key Scientific Concepts of Review
The working hypothesis of the manuscript proposes HIF-1α – the transcription factor critical for glucose metabolism of cancer cells regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway as an attractive target for application of flavonoids to mitigate cancer resistance. Phytochemicals represent a source of promising substances for cancer management applicable to primary, secondary, and tertiary care. However, accurate patient stratification and individualized patient profiling represent crucial steps in the paradigm shift from reactive to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM / 3PM). The article is focused on targeting molecular patterns by natural substances and provides evidence-based recommendations for the 3PM relevant implementation.}

Studies of mentorship in emergency medicine show that mentored residents are twice as likely to describe their career preparation as excellent as compared to nonmentored peers. There has been significant interest in the mentor–mentee relationship in medicine; however, there is minimal guidance and published literature specific to emergency medicine residents.
Methods
In this narrative review, we described the emergency medicine mentor–mentee relationship, discussed alternatives to the traditional dyadic model, and highlighted current barriers to effective mentorship. We conducted a structured literature review to identify relevant published articles regarding the mentoring of emergency medicine residents. Additional studies from general mentoring literature were included based on relevancy.
Results
We identified 39 studies in emergency medicine literature based on our search criteria. Additional studies from general medicine literature were included based on relevancy to this review. Based on the limited available literature, we recommend maximizing the resident mentoring relationship by developing formal mentoring programs, supporting the advancement of women and underrepresented minority mentors, and moving toward team mentoring, including peer, near-peer, and collaborative mentorship. The development of a mentoring network is a logical strategy for residents to work with a diverse group of individuals to maximize benefits in multiple areas.
Conclusion
Alternative approaches to the traditional and hierarchal dyadic mentoring style (eg, team mentoring) are effective methods that residencies may promote to increase effective mentoring. Future efforts in mentoring emergency medicine residents emphasize these strategies, which are increasingly beneficial given the constraints and use of technology highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.}

One of the key aspects of these fields is the development of such types of biomaterials that can mimic the extracellular matrix and provide a conducive environment for tissue regeneration. In this regard, chitosan has played a vital role which is a naturally derived linear bi-poly-aminosaccharide, and has gained significant attention due to its biocompatibility and unique properties. Chitosan possesses many unique physicochemical properties, making it a significant polysaccharide for different applications such as agriculture, nutraceutical, biomedical, food, nutraceutical, packaging, etc. as well as significant material for developing next-generation hydrogel and bio-scaffolds for regenerative medicinal applications. Moreover, chitosan can be easily modified to incorporate desirable properties, such as improved mechanical strength, enhanced biodegradability, and controlled release of bioactive molecules. Blending chitosan with other polymers or incorporating nanoparticles into its matrix further expands its potential in tissue engineering applications. This review summarizes the most recent studies of the last 10 years based on chitosan, blends, and nanocomposites and their application in bone tissue engineering, hard tissue engineering, dental implants, dental tissue engineering, dental fillers, and cartilage tissue engineering.}

abstract = {Background
Xin-tong-tai Granule (XTTG), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat atherosclerosis (AS), but its mechanism is poorly understood. Intriguingly, oxidative stress has been recognized as vital factors in the treatment of atherosclerosis.
Purpose
This study aims to explore the potential mechanism of XTTG for treating AS.
Methods
An in-vivo model of AS was established by feeding ApoE-/- mice with a high-fat diet (HFD), and the Human Aortic Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells (HAVSMCs) were induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in vitro. After treatment, the blood lipid levels and pathological aortic changes of each group were observed, and the cell proliferation and lipid droplet aggregation in each group were evaluated. The oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and related NOX/ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway indicators were observed.
Results
XTTG improved blood lipid levels and pathological aortic changes of ApoE−/− mice with HFD feeding, inhibited HAVSMCs proliferation and lipid droplet aggregation induced by ox-LDL, reduced MDA content, increased SOD content, inhibited NOX4 and p22phox protein expression, downregulated ROS content, inhibited IKK-α, IKK-β, NF-κB protein and mRNA expression and the phosphorylation of NF-κB.
Conclusion
XTTG can inhibit NOX/ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway, reduce damages caused by oxidative stress, and exert anti-AS effects.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for centuries to treat various types of inflammation and tumors of the digestive system. Portulaca oleracea L. (POL), has been used in TCM for thousands of years. The chemical composition of POL is variable and includes flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids and organic acids and other classes of natural compounds. Many of these compounds exhibit powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer-transforming effects in the digestive system.
Aim of study
In this review, we focus on the potential therapeutic role of POL in NASH, gastritis and colitis and their associated cancers, with a focus on the pharmacological properties and potential mechanisms of action of the main natural active compounds in POL.
Methods
The information and data on Portulaca oleracea L. and its main active ingredients were collated from various resources like ethnobotanical textbooks and literature databases such as CNKI, VIP (Chinese literature), PubMed, Science Direct, Elsevier and Google Scholar (English literatures), Wiley, Springer, Tailor and Francis, Scopus, Inflibnet.
Results
Kaempferol, luteolin, myricetin, quercetin, genistein, EPA, DHA, and melatonin were found to improve NASH and NASH-HCC, while kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin played a therapeutic role in gastritis and gastric cancer. Apigenin, luteolin, myricetin, quercetin, genistein, lupeol, vitamin C and melatonin were found to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of colitis and its associated cancers. The discovery of the beneficial effects of these natural active compounds in POL supports the idea that POL could be a promising novel candidate for the treatment and prevention of inflammation-related cancers of the digestive system.
Conclusion
The discovery of the beneficial effects of these natural active compounds in POL supports the idea that POL could be a promising novel candidate for the treatment and prevention of inflammation-related cancers of the digestive system. However, clinical data describing the mode of action of the naturally active compounds of POL are still lacking. In addition, pharmacokinetic data for POL compounds, such as changes in drug dose and absorption rates, cannot be extrapolated from animal models and need to be measured in patients in clinical trials. On the one hand, a systematic meta-analysis of the existing publications on TCM containing POL still needs to be carried out. On the other hand, studies on the hepatic and renal toxicity of POL are also needed. Additionally, well-designed preclinical and clinical studies to validate the therapeutic effects of TCM need to be performed, thus hopefully providing a basis for the validation of the clinical benefits of POL.}

abstract = {Background
The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies has surged since the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. However, the efficacy and safety of these CAM therapies remains majorly unexplored.
Objective
To understand the efficacy and safety of Nochi Kudineer Chooranam (5 gm), Mahasudarsan Chooranam (3 gm) , Adathodai Manapagu (10 ml), Omatheeneer (10 ml), Maldevi chenduram (100 mg) with honey in management of COVID 19 patients.
Methods
We conducted a randomised, controlled, open label trial in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 90% or more while breathing ambient air. Patients were randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention group, receiving seven days of siddha medicine (Intervention group; n = 50) or standard care (control group; n = 50). The primary end point was clinical markers and patient recovery status on day 8.
Results
A total of 100 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with average age of 37 yrs (interquartile range, 28–49) participated in the study. There was no statistically difference between groups at baseline (P > 0.05). After intervention, patients in the intervention group had statistically (P < 0.05) significant reduction in the symptoms when compared to standard care. By end of the intervention period, 6 patients (12%) were hospitalized in the control group and none of them were reported for intervention group.
Conclusion
Among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, 7 days of siddha medicine showed a significant reduction in the clinical symptoms and requirement of hospitalisation, with no adverse events. Therefore, the particular siddha medicine preparation could be used safely and effectively for the management of COVID-19 patients.}

abstract = {Background
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs) are major contributing factors to disease burden in dementia patients. Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) has received attention in the management of dementia in patients with BPSDs. This overview aimed to comprehensively and critically review previous systematic reviews (SRs) of CIM modalities for BPSD management.
Methods
Thirteen databases were searched in November 2021 to identify SRs on CIM for BPSDs. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2.
Results
Among 38 SRs, aromatherapy was the most commonly studied intervention, followed by herbal medicine (HM), acupuncture/acupressure, mindfulness-based interventions, relaxation, and Taichi. Half of the studies on aromatherapy reported significantly improved BPSDs, especially agitation, while the remainder reported mixed results/insufficient evidence. Most studies (85.71%) on HM supported its significant benefits in BPSDs. Yokukansan, an individual HM, was most frequently studied for BPSDs, with a significant beneficial effect on delusions, hallucinations, and agitation/aggression. Moreover, some meta-analyses supported the benefits of HM as an adjunct to psychotropic drugs in BPSD management. Other CIM interventions had insufficient clinical evidence. The methodological quality of the included studies was poor, and most were rated low or critically low (92.11%).
Conclusion
Aromatherapy, the most frequently investigated CIM for BPSD, had mixed results or insufficient evidence. HM, as an adjunct to psychotropic drugs including antipsychotics, exhibited additional benefits regarding the efficacy and safety for BPSDs. This overview emphasizes the requirement for greater quantity and quality of research in this field.

Word embeddings can be computed by many different algorithms, usually trained on large amounts of textual data aiming to capture semantic relationships between words. These embeddings revolutionized many Natural Language Processing applications, enabling more accurate and nuanced language understanding. Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to employ word embeddings to uncover latent knowledge, i.e., information that may be implicit in a set of texts and that would hardly be perceptible to humans. In this context, this study extends such strategy by combining different unsupervised models to accelerate discoveries in medicine. Our word embeddings were trained on a large corpus of medical papers related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a highly malignant form of cancer. Our study shows that established therapies could have been developed before their first proposal due to treatment testing notifications issued by our system up to 11 years in advance. The results show the potential of uncovering latent knowledge from the biomedical field to empower faster and more efficient drug testing for medical discoveries.}

The educational role of elementary/primary school gardens for school-aged children has been well-researched and documented. Within tertiary education, limited published research exists regarding the role that on-campus gardens have as a practical teaching resource for the learning of degree curriculum. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to ascertain the role that an extensive on-campus herb garden had in facilitating teaching and learning for students enroled in a naturopathic and herbal medicine degree.
Methods
Twenty-one students enroled in a naturopathy and herbal medicine degree at a naturopathic college in Auckland, New Zealand were individually interviewed. Data was analysed using an inductive thematic approach.
Results
A number of themes and subthemes were identified. The on-campus herb garden provided students with ongoing access to a wide range of herbs and plants that are not readily accessible in the wider community. The herb garden acted as a practical resource for teaching and learning, as it aided coursework by providing students with salient opportunities for practical learning, which included the manufacturing of products for assessments. The direct physical interaction that the herb garden provided, was perceived by students as taking their learning of course material to a level beyond what a textbook could provide. The herb garden provided sensory/kinaesthetic learning opportunities, which were perceived to aid student learning. Students also utilised the herb garden for the acquisition of herbs for food and tea consumption, including the preparation of tea to provide to clients in the student clinic.
Conclusions
The present study provided qualitative insights from students regarding the salient role and multiple ways in which an extensive on-campus herb garden supported and aided their learning within a naturopathic and herbal medicine degree curriculum.}

abstract = {Viral and non-viral vectors have revolutionised in the last 5 years the approaches to tackling pandemics, cancers and genetic diseases. The intrinsic properties of these vectors present new separation challenges to their manufacture in terms of both the process-related impurities to be removed and the complex labile nature of the target products. These characteristics make them susceptible to heterogeneity and the formation of product-related impurities. Conventional polyethersulfone membrane filters used for sterile filtration and ultrafiltration of viral vectors and lipid nanoparticles can display limited selectivity and cause product losses. To address these challenges, novel membrane materials and fabrication techniques to overcome the boundary of selectivity-permeability performance have become of interest. Isoporous membranes with well-defined pore size and pore dispersity at the nano-scale show promising separation performance but have only been demonstrated at small scales to date. This review summarises the decision process for the development of new membrane candidates for vector manufacturing in genomic medicine, including membranes fabricated by lithography, track-etched membranes, anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) membranes and self-assembled block copolymer membranes. By comparing these membranes to existing commercially available products, the possible advantages presented by novel materials and fabrication approaches are identified.}

Parents/caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) try different approaches to manage their child’s condition, of which one of the popular approaches is using Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) treatment.
Objectives
The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence and describe the pattern of CAM usage in a tertiary care South Indian hospital.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among the parents/caregivers of children with ASD to specifically report the usage of CAM in their children. Data was also collected about the type of CAM, source, reasons, expectations, effectiveness, harmful effects, and the treating pediatrician’s opinion on CAM usage.
Results
A total of 257 parents/caregivers of children with ASD participated in the study. 24.5% of the children were exposed to at least one CAM therapy. The most commonly given CAM therapy was herbal medicine (71.4%). Parents/caregivers tried CAM therapy as their children’s core symptoms of ASD did not show much improvement with the existing therapy (80.9%). They expected that CAM therapy would at least control the progression of the disability (61.9%). CAM usage did not produce any adverse effects (100%). The baseline characteristics between the CAM users and non-users were similar expect for gender, which showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.008). About 55.5% of the parents/caregivers did not discuss the usage of CAM for their child with their treating pediatrician.
Conclusion
Herbal medicines are frequently given CAM to children with ASD in India. History of CAM therapy usage should be a part of the medication history interview.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Heart failure (HF) is a complex disease with high prevalence, incidence and mortality rates leading to high healthcare burden. In Spain, there are multidisciplinary HF units coordinated by cardiology and internal medicine. Our objective is to describe its current organizational model and their adherence to the latest scientific recommendations.
Materials and methods
In late 2021, a scientific committee (with cardiology and internal medicine specialists) developed a questionnaire that was sent as an online survey to 110 HF units. 73 from cardiology (accredited by SEC-Excelente) and 37 from internal medicine, (integrated in UMIPIC program).
Results
We received 83 answers (75.5% total: 49 from cardiology and 34 from internal medicine). The results showed that HF units are mostly integrated by specialists from cardiology, internal medicine and specialized nurse practitioners (34.9%). Patient characteristics from HF units are widely different when comparing those in cardiology to UMIPIC, being the latter older, more frequently with preserved ejection fraction and higher comorbidity burden. Most HF units (73.5%) currently use a hybrid face-to-face/virtual model to perform patient follow-up. Natriuretic peptides are the biomarkers most commonly used (90%). All four disease-modifying drug classes are mainly implemented at the same time (85%). Only 24% of HF units hold fluent communication with primary care.
Conclusions
Both models from cardiology and internal medicine HF units are complementary, they include specialized nursing, they use hybrid approach for patient follow-up and they display a high adherence to the latest guideline recommendations. Coordination with primary care remains as the major improvement area.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivos
La insuficiencia cardíaca (IC) es una patología compleja con una alta prevalencia, incidencia y mortalidad que conlleva un importante coste sanitario. En España existen unidades de IC (UIC) multidisciplinares, lideradas por cardiología y medicina interna. Nuestro objetivo es conocer su organización actual y adherencia a las últimas recomendaciones científicas.
Materiales y métodos
Un comité científico formado por cardiólogos e internistas elaboró una encuesta a finales de 2021, que fue enviada a 110 UIC. 73 de cardiología, acreditadas por SEC-Excelente, y 37 de medicina interna, integradas en el programa UMIPIC.
Resultados
Se recibieron 83 encuestas cumplimentadas (75,5%). 49 de cardiología y 34 de medicina interna. Los resultados mostraron que las UIC están integradas mayoritariamente por un cardiólogo, internista y enfermería especializada (34,9%). El perfil de paciente atendido en las UIC cardiológicas es muy diferente al paciente de las UMIPIC, siendo estos últimos mayores, con fracción de eyección ventricular izquierda conservada y más carga de comorbilidad. La mayoría de UIC actualmente realizan seguimiento mixto, presencial y telemático (73,5%). Los péptidos natriuréticos son los biomarcadores más utilizados (90%). Se titulan los cuatro grupos farmacológicos fundamentales de tratamiento de la IC a la vez mayoritariamente (85%). Solo un 24% de las unidades mantienen una comunicación fluida con Atención Primaria.
Conclusiones
Los dos modelos de UIC liderados por cardiología y medicina interna son complementarios, disponen de enfermería especializada, y siguen al paciente de forma mixta, con una adherencia farmacológica muy alta a las últimas recomendaciones científicas. El principal punto de mejora es la coordinación con Atención Primaria.}

The materialization and advancement of this field depend on the ability to demonstrate precision in the reprogramming and functional differentiation of the stem cell as per the specified need. However, multiple challenges exist in the form of ineffective production and extensive and complex procedures. This has created a need for rapid and more precise approaches that may support experimental analysis by establishing morphology-based identification of different cellular stages. Moreover, the need to generate in-depth insights into the molecular mechanisms working parallel to a variety of disorders has also gained attention. In this scenario, the importance of multiscale computational models and sophisticated algorithm development has gained momentum in order to revitalize induced pluripotent stem cell-driven regenerative medicines. This chapter covers the recent advances of multiscale computational and machine-learning models in stem cell-based regenerative medicine and their application in redefining clinical usage.}

However, due to the limitations of commonly used stem cell sources, their application in therapy is often restricted to the experimental stage and constrained by ethical considerations. In contrast, urine-derived stem cells (USCs) offer promising advantages for clinical trials and applications. The noninvasive nature of the collection process allows for repeated retrieval within a short period, making it a more feasible option. Moreover, studies have shown that USCs have a protective effect on organs, promoting vascular regeneration, inhibiting oxidative stress, and reducing inflammation in various acute and chronic organ dysfunctions. The application of USCs has also been enhanced by advancements in biomaterials technology, enabling better targeting and controlled release capabilities. This review aims to summarize the current state of research on USCs, providing insights for future applications in basic and clinical settings.}

The accurate identification of LJF and LF and their geographical origin are of great significance to the quality control and correct medication. In this work, a simple, rapid and efficient strategy for identification of Lonicerae japonicae flos and Lonicerae flos and their geographical origin was proposed by combining excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) with chemometrics. Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) spectra of LJF and LF samples were characterized by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to acquire chemically meaningful information. Classification models were built using three chemometric methods, including partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) and random forest (RF). These models were utilized to identify LJF and LF and their geographical origin. Results revealed that PCA-LDA model gained the optimal performance with 100% classification accuracy for distinguishing between LJF and LJF from different geographical origin. Therefore, the proposed strategy could be a competitive alternative for fast and accurate differentiation of LJF and LF and their geographical origin.}

There is growing evidence that stress can promote cancer biological processes, including proliferation, genomic instability, angiogenesis, metastasis, immune evasion, and metabolic disorders, through neuroendocrine mechanisms, immune and inflammatory responses, and epigenetic alterations, and may even impact tumor therapy. In addition, as the tumor development process advances, the body also promotes depressive and anxiety-like behaviors through one or more of these mechanisms, generating a vicious cycle that contributes to the tumor's poor prognosis. However, psychosomatic behavioral interventions (PBI) and Chinese medicine can also effectively mitigate the effects of stress in cancer patients.

Challenges facing community pharmacists in delivering and adapting services during the COVID-19 response have been reported. However, few qualitative studies have examined the impact of these experiences on their wellbeing, and what supports the profession requires in the future.
Aim(s)
To examine the work-related experiences and psychosocial needs of community pharmacists situated in the Republic of Ireland arising from the COVID-19 response.
Method
11 pharmacists and 1 representative were interviewed and data analysed through inductive thematic analysis.
Results
Work experiences were characterised by increased workload linked to multiple roles pharmacists played during the pandemic. Remaining open, meeting the social and medical needs of patients unable to easily access other primary services exerted its toll on pharmacists while at the same time providing a sense of professional fulfilment. Participants felt contributions made to the community during COVID-19 went largely unrecognised by the wider healthcare structure. This added to a prior sense of professional disenchantment arising from long-standing under-resourcing, lack of clinical autonomy and high administrative burden eroding their sense of purpose and meaning. Informal, peer-support networks were preferred over formal psychological support initiatives.
Conclusions
The post-pandemic environment is an opportune time for policy makers to reconsider the role of community pharmacists. Greater clinical autonomy beyond dispensing of medicines, for example, for example, would also serve to enhance the sense of purpose and meaning of pharmacists as healthcare professionals. The longer-term well-being of community pharmacists is contingent on recognition of the value that community pharmacy bring both to the healthcare system and wider society as a whole.}
