abstract = {Herbal medicines are popular natural medicines that have been used for decades. The use of alternative medicines continues to expand rapidly across the world. The World Health Organization suggests that quality assessment of natural medicines is essential for any therapeutic or health care applications, as their therapeutic potential varies between different geographic origins, plant species, and varieties. Classification of herbal medicines based on a limited number of secondary metabolites is not an ideal approach. Their quality should be considered based on a complete metabolic profile, as their pharmacological activity is not due to a few specific secondary metabolites but rather a larger group of bioactive compounds. A holistic and integrative approach using rapid and nondestructive analytical strategies for the screening of herbal medicines is required for robust characterization. In this study, a rapid and effective quality assessment system for geographical traceability, species, and variety-specific authenticity of the widely used natural medicines turmeric, Ocimum, and Withania somnifera was investigated using Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy-based metabolic fingerprinting. Four different geographical origins of turmeric, five different Ocimum species, and three different varieties of roots and leaves of Withania somnifera were studied with the aid of machine learning approaches. Extremely good discrimination (R2 > 0.98, Q2 > 0.97, and accuracy = 1.0) with sensitivity and specificity of 100% was achieved using this metabolic fingerprinting strategy. Our study demonstrated that FT-NIR-based rapid metabolic fingerprinting can be used as a robust analytical method to authenticate several important medicinal herbs.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the real-world effectiveness of integrative medicine treatment on quality of life using the Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Effectiveness Registry (PRIMIER).
Design
A prospective, longitudinal, observational evaluation of patient reported outcomes for quality of life.
Setting
Participants were patients from 17 integrative medicine clinics who received personalized, integrative medicine treatments between August 2013 and October 2017.
Main outcome measures
Participants completed the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)− 29, Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4), and the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) at index (baseline) visit and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 month follow-up assessments. Electronic health record data included diagnostic and billing codes/descriptions. A linear mixed-effects model was used to test whether outcomes changed from index through 12 months
Results
During enrollment, 4883 participants began the assessment, 3658 completed the index measures, and 2374 (65 %) completed at least 1 follow-up assessment, had electronic health record data and at least 1 integrative medicine visit. Most participants (mean age=51.4 years) were white (88.4 %), female (79.7 %), and college-educated (78.5 %). Significant improvements (p < 0.001) were observed at 12-months on all PROMIS-29 measures, PSS-4, and PAM. At 12 months, clinically meaningful improvements were found for 38 % and 28 % on PROMIS-29 Mental and Physical Health Summary scores respectively.
Conclusions
PRIMIER is the largest study to assess the real-world effectiveness of integrative medicine. Results indicate a statistical and clinical improvement across all measures at 12 months. Future research could explore whether dosing, timing or combinations of integrative medicine interventions have differential impacts on quality of life.}

abstract = {Animal experimentation has long been an integral part of biomedical and cosmetics research, with historical roots dating back to ancient Greece. During that period, physicians constrained by cultural taboos that forbade the use of human cadavers, turned to the dissection of animals for their anatomical studies. The use of specific animal models in research has often been justified by the remarkable biological similarities between animals and humans. However, there are instances where animal models, such as fish and frogs, are used, despite significant disparities in their anatomy and physiology compared to humans. In herbal medicine research, animal experimentation has found various applications. Numerous plant species from diverse global regions, including the United Kingdom, United States, China, India, and Africa, have been studied to identify their pharmacological properties and therapeutic indications. Nevertheless, the use of animals in these studies, while offering undeniable advantages, remains a subject of intense debate and contention, mainly arising from the ethical challenges it presents, as well as the substantial financial burden it imposes, and its inability to reliably predict human responses. This paper, therefore, proposes a comprehensive list of research methodologies that are ethical, practical, cost-effective, and consistent with the real ethos of herbal medicine. These alternative methods, which include in vitro studies, human cell cultures, computational modelling, culturally sensitive clinical trials, and ethnobotanical surveys, have the potential to provide cost-effective healthcare solutions, without subjecting animals to unnecessary suffering.}

abstract = {Objective
This systematic review analysed the effectiveness of mind-body modalities (MBMs) in Hwa-byung (HB).
Methods
Ten electronic databases were searched. Intervention studies using MBMs for individuals with HB, published up to July 2023, were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane RoB and ROBINS-I tools. Meta-analysis of continuous variables was presented as mean differences (MDs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results
Nine studies including five randomized controlled clinical trials, were included. The MBM types were meditation, relaxation, biofield therapy, art therapy, and forest-based MBM, and comprehensive HB programs. Most studies used an MBM group, with 5–6 sessions delivered during an average of 4–5 weeks. As a result of the meta-analysis, art therapy showed a statistically significantly better effect on improving the Hwa-Byung Scale (HB-S) score compared to the waitlist control (MD = −7.74; 95% CI = −9.81 to −5.66). In the before-and-after comparison, MBMs were frequently reported to have significant benefits for improving the HB-S total score (7/7, 100%), depressive mood (4/5, 80%), and state anxiety (6/8, 75%). Some methodological flaws were identified in the included studies, including the reliability of diagnosis, non-implementation of assessor blinding, and inappropriate control groups.
Conclusions
This review identified potentially promising MBMs that were not previously recommended in the current HB clinical practice guidelines. In the future, high-quality clinical studies that include the use of standardized HB diagnostic criteria, homogeneous interventions, appropriate control groups, standard assessment tools such as the HB-S, and assessor blinding are needed.}

Recent research on the effects of gut microbiota on brain function has produced essential data on the relationship between them. It has been discovered that dysregulation of the gut-brain axis is related to insomnia. Certain metabolites of gut microbiota have been linked to insomnia, and disturbances in gut microbiota can worsen insomnia. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has unique advantages for the treatment of insomnia. Taking the gut microbiota as the target and determining the scientific relevance of TCM to the prevention and treatment of insomnia may lead to new concepts for the treatment of sleep disorders and improve the therapeutic effect of sleep. Taking the gut microbiota as an entry point, this paper reviews the relationship between gut microbiota and TCM, the relationship between gut microbiota and insomnia, the mechanism by which gut microbiota regulate sleep, and the mechanism by which TCM regulates gut microbiota for insomnia prevention and treatment. This review provides new ideas for the prevention and treatment of insomnia through TCM and new ideas for drug development.}

abstract = {Study objective
The inherent pressures of high-acuity, critical illness in the emergency department create a unique environment whereby acute goals-of-care discussions must be had with patients or substitute decision makers to rapidly decide between divergent treatment paths. Among university-affiliated hospitals, resident physicians are often conducting these highly consequential discussions. This study aimed to use qualitative methods to explore how emergency medicine residents make recommendations regarding life-sustaining treatments during acute goals-of-care discussions in critical illness.
Methods
Using qualitative methods, semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of emergency medicine residents in Canada from August to December 2021. Inductive thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was conducted using line-by-line coding, and key themes were identified through comparative analysis. Data collection continued until thematic saturation was reached.
Results
Seventeen emergency medicine residents from 9 Canadian universities were interviewed. Two factors guided residents’ treatment recommendations (a duty to provide a recommendation and the balance between disease prognosis and patient values). Three factors influenced residents’ comfort when making recommendations (time constraints, uncertainty, and moral distress).
Conclusion
While conducting acute goals-of-care discussions with critically ill patients or their substitute decision makers in the emergency department, residents felt a sense of duty to provide a recommendation informed by an intersection between the patient’s disease prognosis and the patient’s values. Their comfort in making these recommendations was limited by time constraints, uncertainty, and moral distress. These factors are important for informing future educational strategies.}

Overall, the quality of investigations and the production of material evidence in alleged crimes against fauna is crucial. For this, there is a need for trained professionals to implement protocols and tools based on animal welfare science and Legal Veterinary Medicine (LVM). In the routine and history of Veterinary Medicine, cases of suspected intoxication in companion animals, such as dogs and cats, are common. In Brazil, the act of intoxicating animals is considered a crime of mistreatment under the Environmental Crimes Law (Article 32, n. 9.605 of February 12, 1998). Therefore, it is necessary to examine the cadaver to confirm this suspicion. In this way, Legal Veterinary Medicine is a recent specialty in Brazil, created by the Federal Council of Veterinary Medicine's resolution in 2003. In this area, the evaluation of clinical signs, characteristic anatomopathological lesions, and toxicological analysis for identification of the toxic agents allow confirmation of suspected cases. Thus, the objective of this review is to address the application of scientific knowledge to Forensic Veterinary Medicine in confirming cases of animal poisoning and to list the main toxic substances found in animal poisoning cases identified through forensic examinations in the central region of Brazil. Additionally, it is intended to demonstrate that expertize in this area ensures the production of material evidence used in judicial criminal proceedings to defend animal welfare.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Blood-activating and stasis-transforming traditional Chinese medicines (BAST) are a class of herbs that have the effect of dilating blood vessels and dispersing stagnation. Modern pharmaceutical research has demonstrated that they are capable of improving hemodynamics and micro-flow, resist thrombosis and promote blood flow. BAST contain numerous active ingredients, which can theoretically regulate multiple targets at the same time and have a wide range of pharmacological effects in the treatment of diseases including human cancers. Clinically, BAST have minimal side effects and can be used in combination with Western medicine to improve patients' quality of life, lessen adverse effects and minimize the risk of recurrence and metastasis of cancers.
Aim of the review
We aimed to summarize the research progression of BAST on lung cancer in the past five years and present a prospect for the future. Particularly, this review further analyzes the effects and molecular mechanisms that BAST inhibit the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer.
Materials and methods
Relevant studies about BSAT were collected from PubMed and Web of science.
Results
Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest mortality rate. Most patients with lung cancer are diagnosed at an advanced stage and are highly susceptible to metastasis. Recent studies have shown that BAST, a class of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with the function of opening veins and dispersing blood stasis, significantly improve hemodynamics and microcirculation, prevent thrombosis and promote blood flow, and thereby inhibiting the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. In the current review, we analyzed 51 active ingredients extracted from BAST. It was found that BAST and their active ingredients contribute to the prevention of invasion and metastasis of lung cancer through multiple mechanisms, such as regulation of EMT process, specific signaling pathway and metastasis-related genes, tumor blood vessel formation, immune microenvironment and inflammatory response of tumors.
Conclusions
BSAT and its active ingredients have showed promising anticancer activity and significantly inhibit the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. A growing number of studies have realized their potential clinical significance in the therapy of lung cancer, which will provide substantial evidences for the development of new TCM for lung cancer therapy.}

Topical Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is commonly used to relieve atopic dermatitis (AD); however, the up-to-date evidence concerning the effectiveness of topical CHM on treating AD is lacking. Moreover, the CHM prescriptions are often too complicated to realize the overall mechanisms of CHM, especially when compared to western medicines (WM).
Aim of the study
To evaluate the effectiveness of topical CHM for treating AD by conducting a meta-analysis on randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
Methods
Twenty RCTs comparing topical CHM to active control/placebo were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was the symptom scores changed from baseline and the effectiveness rate was the secondary outcome. Subgroup analysis on different initial symptom severity and the different interventions in control groups was performed. System pharmacology analysis was performed to explore core CHM and possible pharmacological mechanisms of CHM for AD.
Results
Compared with active/blank placebo, topical CHM seemed more effective (SMD: −0.35, 95 %CI: −0.59 to −0.10, p-value = 0.005, I2 = 60%). The effectiveness rate was higher (RR: 1.29, 95 %CI 1.15–1.44, p-value <0.00001, I2 = 71%). In subgroup analysis, mild and moderate AD patients with topical CHM were more effective than placebo (SMD: −0.28, 95 %CI -0.56 to −0.01, p-value = 0.04, I2 = 5%; −0.34, 95%CI -0.64 to −0.03, p-value = 0.03, I2 = 0%, separately). Topical CHM has 1.25 times more effective than the topical glucocorticoid (95 %CI 1.09–1.43, p-value = 0.001, I2 = 64%). Core CHMs, such as Phellodendron chinense C.K. Schneid., Sophora flavescens Ait., Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson, and Dictamnus dasycarpus Turcz., had effects on the pathways on immune and metabolism systems different from WM.
Conclusion
Our results exploit the potential role of CHM on treating AD, especially for mild and moderate AD.}

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and several virus variants have emerged. Vaccines are administered to help prevent the infection. In Republic of Korea, most people take herbal medicine. This study investigated the use of herbal medicine to counter the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey. Chi-square tests were used to determine differences in the use of herbal medication according to sociodemographic characteristics. Independent two-sample and paired t-tests were performed to examine the effect and satisfaction of herbal medicine use for countering the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine vaccine-related differences.
Results
A total of 233 and 181 participants received the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. The majority of herbal medicine users were in their thirties, had a bachelor’s degree, suffered from side effects of vaccination, and received Vaxzevria for their first COVID-19 vaccine dose and Comirnaty for their second dose. The herbal medicine group had a higher satisfaction level of post-vaccination side effects than the non-herbal medicine group (P < 0.0001). The numeric rating scale scores for vaccination side effects were lower among participants who took herbal medication to alleviate those symptoms (P < 0.0001). The most commonly used herbal formula was Shuanghetang.
Conclusion
A third of participants receiving COVID-19 vaccines used herbal medication to counter the side effects of vaccination. The use of herbal medicine was associated with age, education level, vaccine brand, and whether side effects of vaccination occurred. Herbal medication use was associated with greater satisfaction compared to vaccine recipients not using herbal medication. Please cite this article as: Yoon HC.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional Chinese medicine, with the feature of synergistic effects of multi-component, multi-pathway and multi-target, plays an important role in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, etc. However, chemical components in traditional Chinese medicine are complex and most of the pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear, especially the relationships of chemical components change during the metabolic process.
Aim of study
Our aim is to provide a method based on complex network theory to analyze the causality and dynamic correlation of substances in the metabolic process of traditional Chinese medicine.
Materials and methods
We proposed a framework named CDCS-TCM to analyze the causality and dynamic correlation between substances in the metabolic process of traditional Chinese medicine. Our method mainly consists two parts. The first part is to discover the local and global causality by the causality network. The second part is to investigate the dynamic correlations and identify the essential substance by dynamic substance correlation network.
Results
We developed a CDCS-TCM method to analyze the causality and dynamic correlation of substances. Using the XiangDan Injection for ischemic stroke as an example, we have identified the important substances in the metabolic process including substance pairs with strong causality and the dynamic changes of the core effector substance clusters.
Conclusion
The proposed framework will be useful for exploring the correlations of active ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine more effectively and will provide a new perspective for the elucidation of drug action mechanisms and the new drug discovery.}

In this work, a rapid and efficient inhibitor screening method of PTP1B was established based on capillary electrophoresis (CE), and used for screening and evaluating the inhibition effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine on PTP1B. Response Surface Methodology was used for optimizing the conditions of analysis. After method validation, the enzyme kinetic study and inhibition test were performed. As a result, the IC50 of PTP1B inhibitors Ⅳ and ⅩⅧ were consistent with reported values measured by a conventional method. It was found that the extracts of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bunge and Morus alba L. showed prominent inhibition on the activity of PTP1B, which were stronger than the positive controls. Meanwhile, on top of the excellent advantages of CE, the whole analysis time is less than 2 min. Thus, the results demonstrated that a fast and efficient screening method was successfully developed. This method could be a powerful tool for screening inhibitors from complex systems. It can also provide an effective basis for lead compound development in drug discovery.}

Some patients with viral encephalitis in China seek treatment with Chinese patent medicine (CPM) to improve their symptoms, but few studies have focused on the impact of CPM on the prognosis of viral encephalitis (VE). The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to assess the benefit of adjunctive CPM therapy on the outcome of children with VE in China.
Methods
This study retrospectively included 834 children with viral encephalitis who were hospitalized at five medical institutions from 2018 to 2021. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of CPM on sequelae in patients with VE. 1:1 propensity score matching was used to exclude the effect of confounding factors. Forest plots were used to observe the effect of CPM on the prognosis of VE in different subgroups.
Results
There were fewer patients with sequelae in the group of patients using CPM regardless of whether they were matched or not. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the use of CPM was an independent protective factor for the development of sequelae in VE patients (OR = 0.063, 95 % CI: 0.011–0.350, p = 0.002). Subgroup analyses showed that CPM was a protective factor for the development of sequelae regardless of the presence or absence of coma and comorbidities. In addition, we evaluated other outcome indicators and found shorter duration of illness, fever and headache in children with EV in the CPM group.
Conclusion
Adjunctive CPM therapy may significantly reduce sequelae in children with VE, as well as effectively alleviate patients' clinical symptoms. However, more prospective studies and clinical trials are needed to further evaluate its efficacy and safety.}

Premature ovarian failure (POF) is defined as amenorrhea lasting for more than 4 months before 40 years of age, which is accompanied by a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration above 40 mlU/mL. POF can cause a series of symptoms associated with low estrogen levels, such as hot flushes, excessive sweating, and infertility. This study aimed to report three cases of POF that were treated successfully with Korean medicine.
Case representation
Three patients with POF were selected for inclusion in this study. The treatment regimen consisted of herbal medicines, electroacupuncture, moxibustion, and Hominis placental pharmacopuncture. The basic treatment period was 3 months, and follow-up was performed after menstrual recovery. Following treatment, all three patients resumed menstruation without any adverse events. One patient also conceived successfully.
Conclusions
These case reports suggest that Korean medicine could be effective for treating POF. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to investigate the mechanism of action of herbal medicines and acupuncture in improving menstruation and FSH levels.}

abstract = {Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder in women that often leads to ovulatory infertility. This study aims to establish and validate an effective predictive model for PCOS and to explore the correlation of features between patients with irregular menstruation and those with PCOS, using pulse wave parameters and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical indices.
Methods
From August 2018 to January 2022, women with irregular menstruation were enrolled in this study. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were categorized into PCOS and non-PCOS groups based on diagnostic criteria. Pulse wave parameters and TCM clinical indices were collected by two medical professionals. After data cleaning, recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) was used for feature selection. Four supervised machine learning classifiers were used to build PCOS prediction models, including Extra Trees (ET), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB/XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values based on the optimal model were visualized for further feature explanation.
Results
A total of 450 women with irregular periods were enrolled in the study, consisting of 294 patients with PCOS and 156 without PCOS. Based on RFECV, 31 features, including 12 pulse parameters and 19 TCM clinical indices, were selected for building prediction models. Using pulse and TCM clinical index was superior to using pulse parameters or TCM clinical index alone in prediction. SVM achieved the best PCOS prediction results (accuracy=0.837, AUC=0.878, F1 score=0.878). For pulse parameters, lower values of right As, right h4, left h1, left h3, left h5, left w/t, and higher right t5 showed an obvious positive PCOS predictive effect. Women with PCOS were more likely to experience delayed menstruation, negative emotions, a slightly jelly-like menstrual texture, higher BMI, and a TCM assessment of greasy tongue coating.
Conclusion
A PCOS prediction model based on the SVM algorithm was established and verified as the best model for distinguishing between patients with PCOS and patients without PCOS with irregular menstruation. The new prediction model that uses pulse wave parameters and TCM clinical indices offers a non-invasive and cost-effective way to diagnose PCOS, and the model provides objective evidence for TCM diagnosis.}

By integrating cutting-edge technologies with drug delivery systems, greater precision can be achieved at the tissue and cellular levels through the use of stimuli-responsive nanoparticles, and the development of electrochemical sensor systems. This precision targeting – by virtue of nanotechnology – allows for therapy to be directed specifically to affected tissues while greatly reducing side effects on healthy tissues. As such, nanomedicine has the potential to transform the treatment of conditions such as cancer, genetic diseases, and chronic illnesses by facilitating precise and cell-specific drug delivery. Additionally, personalized dosage forms and wearable devices offer the ability to tailor treatment to the unique needs of each patient, thereby increasing therapeutic effectiveness and compliance. Companion diagnostics further enable efficient monitoring of treatment response, enabling customized adjustments to the treatment plan. The question of whether all the potential therapeutic approaches outlined here are viable alternatives to current treatments is also discussed. In general, the application of nanotechnology in the field of biomedicine may provide a strong alternative to existing treatments for several reasons.

Unani medicine is gaining popularity as primary or adjunct therapy in the treatment of type-2 diabetes; however, no published data on the prevalence of its use, usage pattern and perceived benefits in diabetes patients are available. Therefore, the present study was aimed to estimate the prevalence, pattern of use and perceived benefits of Unani medicines for diabetics.
Materials and methods
A hospital-based cross-sectional study on 484 type-2 diabetes patients was conducted from January to December 2018 at an urban primary health centre in Bengaluru, India. Systematic random sampling method was used to obtain the required sample size. Information from patients was gathered through personal interview using a semi-structured questionnaire after obtaining their written informed consent. A treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (version 1.4) was used to assess the major dimensions of patient’s satisfaction with treatment.
Results
Unani medicine use was found in 25.6 % of diabetics. Qurs ziabetes was the most used Unani drug, with majority of users taking four tablets three times a day. Most of the patients had been using Unani medicines for 1 year. Usage of Unani medicines improved all aspects of patient satisfaction including effectiveness, safety, and overall satisfaction in comparison to non-users (p = 0.001). Glycemic control was found to be better in Unani medicine users than non-users (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
The finding of the study leads us to conclude that a considerable proportion of diabetics utilize Unani medicines together with conventional treatment and that their use was found to be effective and safe in controlling blood sugar levels.}

However, excessive production of medicines will face serious disposal problems once they are expired, and how to achieve safe and efficient utilization of resources becomes another challenge. In this study, the diverse organic components of traditional Chinese patent medicine-YanReQing Granules (YGE) have been extracted and enriched using a low-temperature extraction method, and the main compositions have been analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The inhibition performance of YGE for Q235 steel in 0.1 mol L−1 HCl solution was evaluated by various methods. The results indicated that the corrosion rate of metal decreased significantly with the addition of YGE, and the corrosion potential shifted positively as the increase of cathodic and anodic Tafel slopes, indicating that the YGE belongs to a mixed type of corrosion inhibitor with the simultaneously inhibition on cathode and anode. The inhibition efficiency of YGE increased gradually with the more additive amounts, and exceeded 99% calculated by the fitting current density in polarization curves. The active ingredients in YGE are mainly composed of hydroxyl and carbon-based aromatic hydrocarbons, which are easily protonated in hydrochloric acid solution and carry a positive charge, and then adsorb at the metal interface electrostatically to form a shielding layer. Moreover, the theoretical calculations have confirmed that the chemical adsorption can be achieved between the polar atoms and metal to enhance the protective layer ultimately.}

The objective of this study was to analyze the accessibility of psychotropic medicine in developing countries based on the availability, price, and affordability indicators to create international evidence to guide the development of policies on the accessibility of medicines.
Methods
This study included 5 types of psychotropic medicines listed in the 22nd edition of the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines published by the World Health Organization in 2021. Derived from 84 surveys in 59 countries, this study summarizes the availability, price, and affordability of originator branded drugs (OBs) and lowest-price generic drugs (LPGs) in the public and private sectors and compares them based on income levels in different countries.
Results
The average availability of psychotropic medicine was 45% in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs) compared with 49% in high- and upper-middle-income countries (HUMICs) whereas the availability of LPGs was higher than that of OBs in all country groups. The average patient price for OBs and LPGs was 94.0 and 23.2, respectively, and the overall patient price of psychotropic medicine in LLMICs was higher than that in HUMICs. The affordability of psychotropic medicine in LLMICs was lower than that in HUMICs.
Conclusions
Psychotropic medicines in lower-middle-income countries have lower availability, a higher average patient price, and lower average affordability than in HUMICs, which requires lower-middle-income countries to take effective and various measures to improve the accessibility of psychotropic medicine.}

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Due to the burden of the disease, some patients try complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
Objective
To identify characteristics associated with CAM use in children and adults with AD.
Methods
We conducted a literature review in accordance with the PRISMA international guidelines for literature reviews and meta-analyses. A systematic search was performed in the PubMed database. Qualitative and quantitative analyses using a χ2 test were performed to compare characteristics between CAM users and non-users. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Out of 514 articles retrieved, 12 studies were included, giving a total of 2240 patients. Our statistical analysis identified an association between CAM use and rhino-conjunctivitis (p = 0.015 in children, p = 0.041 in adults), topical corticosteroid use (p = 0.042 in children, p = 0.008 in adults), and daily application of moisturizing cream (p = 0.002 in children, p < 0.001 in adults). Gender did not affect the decision to use CAM (p > 0.05). In studies, a higher number of affected eczema sites (p < 0.001), prior use of more than two conventional treatments (p = 0.047), and food avoidance diets (p = 0.016) were predictive of CAM use in children. In adults, a younger age (p < 0.05), higher education level (p = 0.043), and lower age at AD onset (p = 0.004) were related to CAM use.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first literature review focusing on socio-demographic and disease determinants related to CAM use among AD patients. The lack of homogeneity in measuring tools makes it difficult to compare and synthesize the studies.}

abstract = {Study objective
The influence of workplace mistreatment on the well-being and career satisfaction of emergency medicine residents is unknown. This study examined the relationships between burnout, career choice regret, and workplace mistreatment in a national sample of emergency medicine residents.
Methods
This was a secondary analysis of a survey study on the prevalence of workplace mistreatment among emergency residents. Residents who reported emotional exhaustion or depersonalization at least once per week were considered to have burnout. Residents who reported dissatisfaction with their decision to become an emergency physician were considered to have career choice regret. Respondents also reported the type (discrimination, abuse, sexual harassment) and frequency of mistreatment over the academic year. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for program characteristics, was used to examine resident characteristics associated with burnout and career choice regret, with the frequency of mistreatment as a covariate.
Results
Of the 8,162 eligible residents, 7,680 (94.1 %) participated. About a third of respondents reported burnout (2,188 of 6,902, 31.7%), whereas a minority (224 of 6,923, 3.2%) reported career choice regret. Of the 7,087 responses on mistreatment frequency, 2,117 (29.9%) reported “a few times per year,” and 1,296 (18.3%) reported “a few times per month or more.” Compared with residents who never experienced mistreatment, residents who reported increasing frequencies of mistreatment were associated with having burnout—from mistreatment a few times per year (OR [odds ratio],1.6; 99% CI [confidence interval], 1.3 to 1.9) to a few times per month or more (OR, 3.3; 99% CI, 2.7 to 4.1). Compared with residents without burnout, residents who reported burnout were associated with having career choice regret (OR, 11.3; 99% CI, 7.0 to 18.1). After adjusting for burnout, there were no significant relationships between the frequency of mistreatment and career choice regret.
Conclusions
Workplace mistreatment is associated with burnout, but not career choice regret, among emergency medicine residents. Efforts to address workplace mistreatment may improve emergency medicine residents’ professional well-being.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to quantify the median time from marketing authorization (MA) to the inclusion of medicines in the reimbursement list after the introduction of the health technology assessment process in Greece.
Methods
From July 2018 to April 2022, the Ministerial Decisions (MDs) and reimbursement lists, posted on the website of the Ministry of Health, were reviewed. The following information was collected for the medicines: the date that MDs and positive reimbursement lists were issued, the MA date, the date of the official price publication, and the type of the health technology assessment application. The time from MA to listing was calculated as the difference between the MA date and the date that the relevant reimbursement list was issued.
Results
During the study period, 93 MDs were issued, from which 79 (85%) were positive and 14 (15%) were negative. Focusing on medicines included in the positive list for the first time, the median time from MA to listing for the new molecules was found to be 34.8 (interquartile range 25.7-41.3) months. This time was statistically significantly shortened for fixed dose combinations (20.9 [15.3-45.4] months, P = .008), and biosimilars (23 [16.6-28.2] months, P = .001). For generics was 17.6 (interquartile range 10-30) months, statistically significantly lower than that of new molecules (P < .001).
Conclusions
The time from MA to the inclusion of medicines in the reimbursement list in Greece is significantly long, especially for innovative medicines. Thus, policy makers should consider this point to optimize and improve patients’ subsidized access.}

Patients with cancer frequently utilize complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM); prior to this, many seek information about these therapies online. Little is known about the quality of this web-based consumer health information. Our study aimed to address this paucity of research by evaluating the quality of CAIM consumer health information on websites discussing the treatment and/or management of cancer.
Methods
Six search terms were entered into Google across four English-speaking countries (Canada, United States, United Kingdom and Australia) on January 4, 2023. The first 20 results of each search were assessed and included if they contained CAIM consumer health information for the treatment and/or management of cancer. Eligible websites were assessed using the 16-item DISCERN instrument, designed to evaluate information quality.
Results
Of 480 identified websites, 393 were duplicates, and 48 fit the eligibility criteria and were assessed using the DISCERN instrument. Mean summed DISCERN scores across all websites was 48.28 (SD = 14.26), and mean scores of the overall quality of each website was 3.11 (SD = 0.66). Several website quality issues were identified, including a lack of transparency surrounding sources of information, areas of uncertainty regarding treatment, consequences of foregoing treatment, and treatment impacts on quality of life.
Conclusion
Healthcare providers should be aware that patients may use these websites for CAIM information. To facilitate informed decision-making, healthcare providers are encouraged to ask about patients’ usage and interest in CAIM and direct them to credible and trustworthy resources.}

abstract = {Introduction
The limitations of hormone therapy for managing primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) have prompted trialists to evaluate the Chinese herbal medicine, Er-xian decoction (containing Curculiginis Rhizome, Epimrdii Herba, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Morindae Officinalis Radix, Phellodendri Chinrnsis Cortex and Anemarrhenae Rhizoma) for treating POI. This review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Er-xian decoction alone or in addition to hormone therapy in treating POI.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on Er-xian decoction alone or in addition to hormone therapy in women with POI. Seven databases were searched from inception to 7 June 2023. The included studies were screened with Endnote X9, and methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane “Risk of bias” tool v1.0. Effects were calculated as mean difference (MD), standard mean difference (SMD), or relative risk with 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager 5.4.1, and data not suitable for statistical analyses were assessed by qualitative methods.
Results
Fifteen studies involving 1274 participants (13 drop-outs) were included. Er-xian decoction plus hormone therapy significantly lowered the follicle-stimulating hormone level (MD –12.48, 95 %CI –15.90 to –9.06; N = 8; P < 0.001) and luteinizing hormone level (MD –8.20, 95 %CI –11.22 to –5.17; N = 8; P < 0.001) and increased the estrogen level (SMD 2.35, 95 %CI 1.52 to 3.18; N = 8; P < 0.001) compared with hormone therapy. There was no significant difference between Er-xian decoction alone and hormone therapy alone in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone level (MD –0.69; 95 %CI, –7.94 to 6.56; N = 5; P = 0.85), luteinizing hormone level (MD 0.29, 95 %CI –3.96 to 4.54; N = 5; P = 0.89) or estrogen level (SMD 0.16, 95 %CI –0.36 to 0.67; N = 5; P = 0.55). In addition, both Er-xian decoction alone and Er-xian decoction plus hormone therapy effectively improved women's menopausal symptoms. Seven studies reported on the occurrence of adverse events, and no severe events were reported.
Conclusion
The findings suggest Er-xian decoction, with or without hormone therapy, may be an effective treatment for POI. However, limitations in the evidence included a high risk of bias and substantial heterogeneity. Further research should be conducted in well-designed and rigorously executed clinical trials with large samples.

To determine which residency programs the fellows of the top 10 orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs attended and whether residents are selected from the same residency programs multiple years.
Methods
The residency programs of current and former fellows at each of the top 10 orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs (based on a recent study) over the last 5 to 10 years was determined by searching program websites and/or contacting program coordinators/directors. For each program, we determined the number of occurrences of at least 3 to 5 fellows from the same residency program. We also calculated a “pipelining ratio,” defined as the ratio of the total number of fellows at the program over the duration of the study to the number of different residency programs represented within the fellowship program during that same time period.
Results
Data were obtained from 7 of the top 10 fellowship programs. Of the remaining 3 programs, 1 declined to provide the information and 2 did not respond. Pipelining was found to be highly prevalent at one program, with a pipelining ratio of 1.9. Two different residency programs had at least 5 residents match at this fellowship program over the past 10 years. Four additional programs demonstrated evidence of pipelining with ratios of 1.4-1.5. Two programs exhibited minimal pipelining (ratio of 1.1). One program was found to take 2 residents from the same program in the same year on 3 different occasions.
Conclusions
Most of the top orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs have matched fellows from the same orthopaedic surgery residency programs in multiple years.
Clinical Relevance
It is important to understand how fellows are selected for sports medicine fellowship programs and to recognize the potential for inequitable bias in the selection process.}

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a therapeutic system, wherein mixtures of natural products mostly act synergistically to modulate multiple targets. Its therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in several disease conditions. Despite the unknown panoramic composition and impurity toxicity of TCM, screening for bioactive ingredients from TCM is still a good path for drug discovery owing to its narrow scope. NMBINP is a TCM-inspired nanomedicine established based on the two major advantages of TCM: (1) screening pharmaceutically active molecules from natural products and (2) achieving effective synergistic therapy with multiple targets. Recently, the isolation of bioactive ingredients from TCM and their delivery using nanoparticles have been extensively developed against diverse diseases. NMBINP possesses synergistic therapeutic features of TCM with multiple identified ingredients and its verifiable efficacy demonstrates bright prospects. Further NMBINP exploration can create more effective therapeutics and contribute to better TCM development as NMBINP takes root in TCM. The current review discusses the strengths and deficiencies of TCM, the development of bioactive ingredients isolated from TCM, and NMBINP as a robust tool for developing traditional medicine. Finally, this article is summarized and future perspectives of NMBINP are discussed.}

This study explored the effectiveness of a time-tracking evaluation method for functional exercises in analyzing the communication and joint task-processing capabilities of various medical and social welfare organizations in response to a citywide heavy-rain disaster. Each exercise inject was analyzed in advance to create a task-processing chain according to the emergency medical response plan. The actions of the exercise players were then compared with the expected tasks in the processing chain. The exercise created overload for some player groups. The completion rates and average execution times of the tasks were compared across task types and player groups, indicating the potential weaknesses of the current emergency operation plan. Responses of local medical associations to similar exercise injects were compared to analyze the range of diversity in responses and the merits of past exercise participation. Although the results of this time-tracking evaluation need to be carefully interpreted by combining the results regarding the quality of players' exercise actions, this method provides a new perspective for evaluating emergency operation plans through functional exercises.}

First, we propose that advances in genomics have the potential to enhance assessment of disease risk, improve prognostic predictions, and guide treatment development and application. Clinical implementation of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) has emerged as an area of active research. The pathway from genomic discovery to implementation is an iterative process. Second, we provide examples on how genomic medicine has the potential to solve problems in prevention and treatment using two examples: Lung cancer screening and evidence-based tobacco treatment are both under-utilized and great opportunities for genomic interventions. Third, we discuss the translational process for developing genomic interventions from evidence to implementation by presenting a model to evaluate genomic evidence for clinical implementation, mechanisms of genomic interventions, and patient desire for genomic interventions. Fourth, we present potential challenges in genomic interventions including a great need for evidence in all diverse populations, little evidence on treatment algorithms, challenges in accommodating a dynamic evidence base, and implementation challenges in real world clinical settings. Finally, we conclude that research to identify genomic markers that are associated with smoking cessation success and the efficacy of smoking cessation treatments is needed to empower people of all diverse ancestry. Importantly, genomic data can be used to help identify patients with elevated risk for nicotine addiction, difficulty quitting smoking, favorable response to specific pharmacotherapy, and tobacco-related health problems.}

abstract = {Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread worldwide. Integrated Chinese and Western medicine have had some successes in treating COVID-19.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three traditional Chinese medicine drugs and three herbal formulas (3-drugs-3-formulas) in patients with COVID-19.
Search strategy
Relevant studies were identified from 12 electronic databases searched from their establishment to April 7, 2022.
Inclusion criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and cohort studies that evaluated the effects of 3-drugs-3-formulas for COVID-19. The treatment group was treated with one of the 3-drugs-3-formulas plus conventional treatment. The control group was treated with conventional treatment.
Data extraction and analysis
Two evaluators screened and selected literature independently, then extracted basic information and assessed risk of bias. The treatment outcome measures were duration of main symptoms, hospitalization time, aggravation rate and mortality. RevMan 5.4 was used to analyze the pooled results reported as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous data and risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous data.
Results
Forty-one studies with a total of 13,260 participants were identified. Our analysis suggests that compared with conventional treatment, the combination of 3-drugs-3-formulas might shorten duration of fever (MD = –1.39; 95% CI: –2.19 to –0.59; P < 0.05), cough (MD = –1.57; 95% CI: –2.16 to –0.98; P < 0.05) and fatigue (MD = –1.36; 95% CI: –2.21 to –0.51; P < 0.05), decrease length of hospital stay (MD = –2.62; 95% CI –3.52 to –1.72; P < 0.05), the time for nucleic acid conversion (MD = –2.92; 95% CI: –4.26 to –1.59; P < 0.05), aggravation rate (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.64; P < 0.05) and mortality (RR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.62; P < 0.05), and increase the recovery rate of chest computerized tomography manifestations (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.3; P < 0.05) and total effectiveness (RR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.42; P < 0.05).
Conclusion
The 3-drugs-3-formulas can play an active role in treating all stages of COVID-19. No severe adverse events related to 3-drugs-3-formulas were observed. Hence, 3-drugs-3-formulas combined with conventional therapies have effective therapeutic value for COVID-19 patients. Further long-term high-quality studies are essential to demonstrate the clinical benefits of each formula.

abstract = {Background
With the increasing popularity of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by the global community, how to teach basic knowledge of TCM to international students and improve the teaching quality are important issues for teachers of TCM. The present study was to analyze the perceptions from both students and teachers on how to improve TCM learning internationally.
Methods
A cross-sectional national survey was conducted at 23 universities/colleges across China. A structured, self-reported on-line questionnaire was administered to 34 Chinese teachers who taught TCM course in English and to 1016 international undergraduates who were enrolled in the TCM course in China between 2017 and 2021.
Results
Thirty-three (97.1%) teachers and 900 (88.6%) undergraduates agreed Chinese culture should be fully integrated into TCM courses. All teachers and 944 (92.9%) undergraduates thought that TCM had important significance in the clinical practice. All teachers and 995 (97.9%) undergraduates agreed that modern research of TCM is valuable. Thirty-three (97.1%) teachers and 959 (94.4%) undergraduates thought comparing traditional medicine in different countries with TCM can help the students better understand TCM. Thirty-two (94.1%) teachers and 962 (94.7%) undergraduates agreed on the use of practical teaching method with case reports. From the perceptions of the undergraduates, the top three beneficial learning styles were practice (34.3%), teacher's lectures (32.5%), case studies (10.4%). The first choice of learning mode was attending to face-to-face teaching (82.3%). The top three interesting contents were acupuncture (75.5%), Chinese herbal medicine (63.8%), and massage (55.0%).
Conclusion
To improve TCM learning among international undergraduates majoring in conventional medicine, integration of Chinese culture into TCM course, comparison of traditional medicine in different countries with TCM, application of the teaching method with case reports, and emphasization of clinical practice as well as modern research on TCM should be fully considered.}

This crime is often perpetrated by current or former intimate partners, thus taking the name of intimate partner femicide (IPF). Although international comparisons are essential for prevention policies, cross-country comparative studies are scarce in this context. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare clinical, epidemiological and medico-legal characteristics of IPF autopsy cases investigated at the Institutes of Legal Medicine of two Western European cities, in order to identify a potential medico-legal pattern of IPF. Autopsy and police reports of IPF cases occurred in the judicial district of Freiburg (Germany) and Padova (Italy) from 2000 to 2022 were analyzed. Data relating to victims, perpetrators, relationship context, and circumstantial and pathological-forensic characteristics of the homicide were collected. Statistical analyses were performed to explore potential relationships between the data collected. Additionally, a review of the literature dealing with autopsy-based studies on IPF was performed. Overall, 82 cases of IPF were analyzed, 39 from Freiburg and 43 from Padova. A total of 6 papers fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. Our study identified a medico-legal pattern of IPF and demonstrated that it did not vary substantially between the two European Countries considered, suggesting that certain IPF characteristics are shared at the European level. However, a significant finding emerged regarding the higher prevalence of firearm-related IPFs in Italy compared to Germany. Forensic pathology research might contribute to developing targeted prevention policies to protect women from this lethal form of violence.}

This paper will convert TCM into porous carbon-based materials through pyrolysis technology, and then combine it with TCM extract activator to synthesize a new type of adsorbent. The two main ingredients of Chinese patent medicine “Lianhua Qingwen Capsules”, Honeysuckle and Forsythia suspensa, will be used as raw materials. After the two herbs are crushed, the leachate is extracted, and the remaining residue is collected. The dried residue is activated and carbonized at high temperature to generate biochar. Further, the biochar will be soaked in TCM extraction liquid to load active ingredients. The adsorption mechanism of tetracycline (TC) by TCM biochar was explored based on the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm fitting results. The microstructure, surface functional groups and crystal structure of TCM biochar will reveal the material properties of the adsorbent. The results show that compared with biochar without extract activation, the adsorption effect of combined biochar (BC-C) with the proportion of “Lianhua Qingwen Capsules” is greatly improved. BC-C has richer surface functional groups through TCM extract loading, which provides superior TC adsorption capacity (36.92 mg/g). The adsorption process of TC by TCM biochar follows the pseudo-second-order adsorption kinetic model and Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. The adsorption mechanism mainly involves pore filling, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction and π-π interaction.}

abstract = {Background
Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is a potentially life-saving intervention to treat noncompressible torso hemorrhage. Traditionally, REBOA use has been limited to surgeons. However, emergency physicians are often the first point-of-contact and are well-versed in obtaining rapid vascular access and damage control resuscitation, making them ideal candidates for REBOA training.
Study Objectives
To fill this gap, we designed and evaluated a REBOA training curriculum for emergency medicine (EM) residents.
Methods
Participants enrolled in an accredited 4-year EM residency program (N = 11) completed a 12-hour REBOA training course. Day 1 included lectures, case studies, and hands-on training using REBOA task trainers and perfused cadavers. Day 2 included additional practice and competency evaluations. Assessments included a 25-item written knowledge exam, decision-making on case studies, REBOA placement success, and time-to-placement. Participants returned at 4 months to assess long-term retention. Data were analyzed using t-tests and nonparametric statistics at p < 0.05.
Results
Scores on a 25-item multiple choice test significantly increased from pre-training (65% ± 5%) to post-training (92% ± 1%), p < 0.001. On Day 2, participants scored 100% on correct recognition of REBOA indications and scored 100% on correct physical placement of REBOA. Exit surveys indicated increased preparedness, confidence, and support for incorporating this course into EM training. Most importantly, REBOA knowledge, correct recognition of REBOA indications, and correct REBOA placement skills were retained by the majority of participants at 4 months.
Conclusion
This course effectively teaches EM residents the requisite skills for REBOA competence and proper placement. This study could be replicated at other facilities with larger, more diverse samples, aiming to expand the use of REBOA in emergency physicians and reducing preventable deaths in trauma.}

abstract = {Precision medicine aims to understand the mechanisms of diseases and to find treatments adapted to each individual or group of patients, on the basis of biological characteristics and environment. It uses new tools based on digital technologies. Narrative medicine was theorized, in the 2000s, as a reaction to the increasing technicality and the notion of a lack of human relations in care: It focuses on recognizing the essential place of the patient's experience of illness and life history in the diagnosis and management of diseases as well as in the training of caregivers. These two opposite currents are rarely considered together. In fact, they have in common the basic principle that each patient is unique, and both are often more closely intertwined than we think, especially in the field of child neurology. Five case histories and discussions presented here aim to demonstrate that combining the precision approach with the narrative approach can improve the diagnosis, treatment, classification, and understanding of neurological conditions, as well as enhance the dialog with families and make teaching more meaningful. Not only rare diseases but common problems, such as paroxysmal events, pain, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, are addressed from both perspectives.}

Use patient demographic and clinical characteristics at admission and time-varying in-hospital measures of patient mobility to predict patient post-acute care (PAC) discharge.
Design
Retrospective cohort analysis of electronic medical records.
Setting and Participants
Patients admitted to the two participating Hospitals from November 2016 through December 2019 with ≥72 hours in a general medicine service.
Methods
Discharge location (PAC vs home) was the primary outcome, and 2 time-varying measures of patient mobility, Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) Mobility “6-clicks” and Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility, were the primary predictors. Other predictors included demographic and clinical characteristics. For each day of hospitalization, we predicted discharge to PAC using the demographic and clinical characteristics and most recent mobility data within a random forest (RF) for survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (RF-SLAM) data. A regression tree for the daily predicted probabilities of discharge to PAC was constructed to represent a global summary of the RF.
Results
There were 23,090 total patients and compared to PAC, those discharged home were younger (64 vs 71), had shorter length of stay (5 vs 8 days), higher AM-PAC at admission (43 vs 32), and average AM-PAC throughout hospitalization (45 vs 35). AM-PAC was the most important predictor, followed by age, and whether the patient lives alone. The area under the hospital day–specific receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.76 to 0.79 during the first 5 days. The global summary tree explained 75% of the variation in predicted probabilities for PAC from the RF. Sensitivity (75%), specificity (70%), and accuracy (72%) were maximized at a PAC probability threshold of 40%.
Conclusions and Implications
Daily assessment of patient mobility should be part of routine practice to help inform care planning by hospital teams. Our prediction model could be used as a valuable tool by multidisciplinary teams in the discharge planning process.}

abstract = {Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease. Due to its unclear etiology, conventional treatment (medication) for RA has continuously updated clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). There is also growing demand for alternative medicine, including Korean medicine (KM); however, there are no KM-CPGs for RA. Our study aimed to investigate current clinical practice and recognition of KM doctors (KMDs) for RA management as the first step in KM-CPG development.
Methods
We conducted a web-based survey from September 28, 2021, to October 11, 2021, by sending e-mails twice. The survey was based on RA-related articles and previous studies that conducted surveys on KM-CPGs for other musculoskeletal disorders. Questionnaires were completed by a predefined process and contained sections on clinical practice status, diagnosis, treatment, progress and prognosis, and perception of KM on RA.
Results
A total of 595 KMDs responded to our survey. They evaluated RA symptoms, impacting factors, and the degree of daily activity in diagnosis and prognosis (over 70%). KMDs used average of 4.24 KM treatments, of which acupuncture ranked high in usage and perception (importance, 95.1%). The other KM treatments herbal medicine, pharmacopuncture, and moxibustion followed. KMDs focused on improving joint symptoms, functions, and quality of life (over 90%).
Conclusion
There were some limitations including the possibility of insufficient statistics in the report. However, our study could be helpful for the future establishment of KM-CPGs that reflect clinical practice, and will induce additional research to supplement the current deficiency.}

Their hard work and sacrifice have forged new perceptions of healthcare workers. These changes may potentially influence students' interest in medicine. This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected premedical students’ decisions to pursue medicine as a career.
Methods
A cross-sectional study using a self-designed online questionnaire was carried out amongst pre-medical students across Pakistan.
Results
A total of 1695 students from 93 public and private schools filled in the survey. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly more pre-medical students want to pursue medicine (60.7%–62.9%) and less are unsure (20.2%–17%). Students are significantly more likely to be motivated to pursue medicine due to altruistic benefits to society (57% vs. 62.7%) and be deterred by the risk of contracting infections on duty (10%–14.6%). There is a minor but significant increase in the popularity of internal medicine (17.1%–18.9%), public health (4.1% vs. 5.7%), emergency medicine (3.8% vs. 5.7%), pediatrics (3.8% vs. 4.7%), and radiology (2.1% vs. 2.9%). Most pre-medical students felt that doctors routinely undergo physical and emotional turmoil (84%).
Conclusions
Although awareness of hardships faced by medical professionals has increased, motivation to pursue medicine has grown. Through understanding trends in the motivations of students to pursue medicine, medical schools can accommodate the expectations of incoming students and reach out to potential applicants.}

abstract = {Objective
To present the comprehensive methodology for generating personalized three-dimensional (3D) printed uterine models from 3D ultrasound (US) volumes in individuals diagnosed with Müllerian anomalies and discuss potential applications in the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility.
Design
Pilot study.
Setting
Single large university-affiliated teaching hospital.
Patient(s)
Patients with the presence of a Müllerian anomaly between the ages of 18 and 45 years attending the maternal-fetal medicine as well as reproductive endocrinology and infertility outpatient offices from 2018 to 2023 were included in the study.
Intervention(s)
Subjects underwent 3D US transvaginal scanning for the collection of data. The 3D US volumes were acquired, edited, and exported from a US cart Voluson E10 system (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). High-definition virtual models were created and modified, making them suitable for printing using Materialise 3-Matic Medical (Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium). The models were printed on a J5 MediJet 3D printer (Stratasys, Rehovot, Israel). Colors were set to mimic a realistic appearance, and shore values were set before printing.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Successful creation and utilization of personalized 3D-printed uterine models for individuals with Müllerian anomalies.
Results(s)
Three-dimensional models were created for a uterus without anomalies, 2 variations of a partial septum, a unicornuate, and a didelphys uterus. Models were used as a tactile and customized tool for patient education, counseling, and medical student and resident teaching. This technique illustrates that the creation of personalized 3D-printed uterine models for utilization in the fields of reproductive endocrinology and infertility is feasible.
Conclusion(s)
We propose a novel use of individualized 3D-printed uterine models in the evaluation of individuals with Müllerian anomalies. These models may play a complementary role to standard imaging options in the assessment of these anomalies, with a special potential for application in highly complex or yet-to-be-determined types of anomalies.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine Nursing Clinical Preceptors (TCMN-CPs) are crucial to cultivate undergraduates' evidence-based practice (EBP) competence during clinical practicum in traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) hospitals. However, the TCMN-CPs' EBP teaching competence is unclear. Underpinned by Rogers' innovation-decision process, our study aimed to investigate TCMN-CPs' EBP teaching competence and the related characteristic factors at five stages of knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation.
Methods
An online survey was conducted by using a modified evidence-based practice teaching competence questionnaire (EBPT-COQ) encompassing attitude, knowledge/skill and practice of EBP teaching in four TCM teaching hospitals in Beijing, China.
Results
A total of 654 TCMN-CPs were included, with a response rate of 91.47 %. Most TCMN-CPs were in knowledge stage (339, 51.83 %), followed by the persuasion stage (166, 25.38 %), decision stage (123, 18.81 %), implementation stage (23, 3.52 %) and confirmation stage (3, 0.46 %). The total and dimension scores of EBPT-COQ increased as the diffusion stage developing, the confirmation stage was the highest (5.48 ± 0.80). Twenty-three items' mean scores were higher than 4 points (95.83 %), except for “Research skills” (3.58 ± 1.38). The related characteristic factors were 1) age (Z = -4.177), working experience (H = 11.087), clinical teaching experience (H = 12.602), management position (Z = 2.565), research experience (Z = -2.867) and EBP training (Z = 3.146) at Knowledge stage; 2) research experience (ZPersuasion = −2.617; ZDecision = −3.510), EBP training (ZPersuasion = 2.528; ZDecision = 3.433) at Persuasion and Decision stage (all P<0.05). And the first three stages TCMN-CPs' EBPT-COQ scores were positively correlated with TCMN-CPs' attitude toward clinical teaching (r = 0.244–0.331, P<0.001).
Conclusions
Most of the TCMN-CPs' EBP teaching status are in the first three diffusion stages. Though their attitude, knowledge/skills and practice to EBP teaching competence have gradually improved with the deepening of the diffusion stage, much efforts should be made to keep progressing. TCMN-CPs' qualifications of EBP teaching could include rich clinical work and teaching experience, enjoying teaching. Nursing managers, with higher EBP teaching competence, might play a crucial role in promoting the diffusion of EBP teaching. All TCMN-CPs showed an inadequacy of research skills of EBP teaching. Therefore, it is warranted to explore the minimum research skill requirements for EBP teaching and to establish academic-practice partnerships.}

In this review, we firstly discussed the biological properties of hAM-derived cells in vivo or in vitro, along with their stemness of markers, pointing out a promising source of stem cells for regenerative medicine. Then, we systematically summarized current knowledge on the collection, preparation, preservation, and decellularization of hAM, as well as their characteristics helping to improve the understanding of applications in tissue engineering. Finally, we highlighted the recent advances in which hAM has undergone additional modifications to achieve an adequate perspective of regenerative medicine applications. More investigations are required in utilizing appropriate modifications to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of hAM in the future.}

In Rwanda, chronic shortages of essential medicines are an important barrier to robust healthcare delivery and discourage snakebite victims from seeking hospital care. The aim of this retrospective, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the availability and affordability of commodities to treat SBE at hospitals and health centers. In total, our team interviewed pharmacy managers at 111 public and 31 private health facilities (N = 142) to complete a validated quantitative questionnaire, entering data electronically through KoBoCollect. Commodity prices were collected in 2023RWF and for the lowest cost item across any category. A commodity was considered affordable if a treatment regimen cost less than one day's wages, using the international poverty line to approximate a low-income worker's wages. Across all health facilities, mean availability of SBE commodities was relatively good (77.1%). Snake antivenom was only available at public hospitals and was concentrated in urban rather than rural areas. Two snake antivenom types were observed, one of which was not appropriate for treating envenomation by East African snakes. Overall, this meant that only 4.2% of facilities stocked safe and effective antivenom. Black stones, an ineffective traditional treatment, were sold by 5.6% of health providers. Moreover, antivenom did not meet the minimum threshold for affordability, costing on average 10 days of work for a single dose among uninsured individuals. Altogether, this study highlights serious performance gaps among pharmacies responsible for procuring and supplying SBE commodities and helps to explain the widespread belief that SBE treatment is unaffordable at hospitals and health centers. Urgent action is needed to ensure that all hospital and health center pharmacies located in high-risk areas stock appropriate antivenom and that re-stocking time for essential medicines is reduced.}

abstract = {Background
The Discharge Medicines Review (DMR) is a community pharmacy service in Wales that aims to reduce medicines-related harm after care transitions, including hospital discharge. To undertake a DMR, the Community Pharmacist must receive a patient's discharge medicines information, either electronically, by fax or presented by the patient. Although the DMR has evidenced benefits for improving patient safety, its evaluation showed inconsistent uptake, which Community Pharmacists partially attributed to hospitals not providing the necessary information.
Objective
Aiming to develop recommendations to improve hospital engagement to DMR referrals, this study explores hospital pharmacy professionals' views of the service.
Methods
Qualitative focus groups, using hermeneutic phenomenology, were conducted in 16 hospitals across Wales, using a quota sampling method to include 61 Pharmacists and 31 Pharmacy Technicians. To understand the suboptimal engagement to DMR referrals, framework analysis was undertaken using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).
Results
The data were mapped onto all five CFIR domains, each containing barriers and facilitators to engagement with DMR referrals and suggestions for improvement. Only one hospital had successfully implemented DMR referrals, with many participants lacking any knowledge of the service or how to refer to it. Specific barriers included a clear absence of processes to implement referrals and engage hospital pharmacy professionals. A considerable barrier was many participants' perceptions that Community Pharmacist roles were less clinically orientated and patient-centred than their own, viewing them almost as a different profession. Participants believed that local champions for DMR referrals could promote engagement and integrate them into the workflow of hospital pharmacy professionals. Further recommendations to improve engagement was staff training for DMRs and regular feedback of its value.
Conclusion
Policymakers may use the findings and recommendations from this study to promote hospital pharmacy staff engagement to similar community pharmacy services like the Discharge Medicines Service in England.}

Pulmonary drug delivery is complex due to several challenges including disease-, patient-, and clinicians-related factors. Although many inhaled medications are available in aerosol medicine, delivering aerosolized medications to patients requires effective disease management. There is a large gap in the knowledge of clinicians who select and provide instructions for the correct use of aerosol devices. Since improper device selection, incorrect inhaler technique, and poor patient adherence to prescribed medications may result in inadequate disease control, individualized aerosol medicine is essential for effective disease management and control. The components of individualized aerosol medicine include: (1) Selecting the right device, (2) Selecting the right interface, (3) Educating the patient effectively, and (4) Increasing patient adherence to therapy. This paper reviews each of these components and provides recommendations to integrate the device and interface into the patient for better clinical outcomes.}

However, due to the unique nature of this patient population, inappropriate paediatric medication administration has been widely observed worldwide. According to previous surveys carried out in other countries including the UK and Japan, there has been a wide variation in the handling of paediatric devices among children. To date, little is known about the current situation in China where the variety of available paediatric administration devices is more limited than in Europe and the UK. The aim of this study was therefore to conduct a China-wide survey to gain a better understanding of the perspectives of children and their caregivers on paediatric medicines and devices. This study was conducted throughout China with 215 children as well as 749 caregivers of paediatric year groups from 1 to less than 18 years old. The majority of participants (83%) took oral dosage forms where granules, syrup and tablets were ranked as the Top 3 commonly used oral dosage forms. The most commonly used devices, i.e., measuring cups (47.3%) and household spoons (41.1%) were both well accepted by the vast majority of children. More instruction and demonstration by the healthcare professionals were provided to inhalation devices users with the nebuliser and facemask being the most commonly used. In particular, the role of pharmacists in China is expected to be better defined, which may in turn help with the education provided to paediatric users in operating medical devices.

abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine, as a complementary and alternative medicine, has been practiced for thousands of years in China and possesses remarkable clinical efficacy. Thus, systematic analysis and examination of the mechanistic links between Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and the complex human body can benefit contemporary understandings by carrying out qualitative and quantitative analysis. With increasing attention, the approach of network pharmacology has begun to unveil the mystery of CHM by constructing the heterogeneous network relationship of “herb-compound-target-pathway,” which corresponds to the holistic mechanisms of CHM. By integrating computational techniques into network pharmacology, the efficiency and accuracy of active compound screening and target fishing have been improved at an unprecedented pace. This review dissects the core innovations to the network pharmacology approach that were developed in the years since 2015 and highlights how this tool has been applied to understanding the coronavirus disease 2019 and refining the clinical use of CHM to combat it.}

The literature on scientific publication errors in medical research is limited, and no studies on emergency medicine publications have been conducted yet. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the publication errors in emergency medicine literature.
Methods
This bibliometric study reviewed intervened publication errors in the manuscripts of seven high-impact emergency medicine journals from 2000 to 2020, covering twenty years, and evaluated the corrections in the forms of an erratum, corrigendum, addendum, and retracted papers. The detected publication error rate and the trend, error severity, and error types were calculated.
Results
We detected 257 intervened scientific papers consisting of 251 corrections due to one or more publication errors and six retractions. Authors were the primary source of the errors (93.2%). Most of the errors were in the author attribution section (40.5%). The published errors of 7.2% had an impact on the paper's conclusion. Simple typographic errors were the most common error type (62.5%). The corrected publication error rate was 1.3%, with a steady trend over the twenty years.
Conclusions
Publications errors are inevitable, but it is possible to minimize them. The number of corrections in emergency medicine literature is at a low rate and show many similarities with the previous literature.}

The effectiveness of pretrained large language models (LLM) has witnessed further enhancement, holding potential for applications in the field of medicine, particularly in the context of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). However, the application of these general models to specific domains often yields suboptimal results, primarily due to challenges like lack of domain knowledge, unique objectives, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, requires comprehensive evaluation. To address the above issues, we propose a novel domain specific TCMDA (TCM Domain Adaptation) approach, efficient pre-training with domain-specific corpus. Specifically, we first construct a large TCM-specific corpus, TCM-Corpus-1B, by identifying domain keywords and retrieving from general corpus. Then, our TCMDA leverages the LoRA which freezes the pretrained model’s weights and uses rank decomposition matrices to efficiently train specific dense layers for pre-training and fine-tuning, efficiently aligning the model with TCM-related tasks, namely TCM-GPT-7B. We further conducted extensive experiments on two TCM tasks, including TCM examination and TCM diagnosis. TCM-GPT-7B archived the best performance across both datasets, outperforming other models by relative increments of 17% and 12% in accuracy, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the pioneering validation of domain adaptation of a large language model with 7 billion parameters in TCM domain. We will release both TCM-Corpus-1B and TCM-GPT-7B model once accepted to facilitate interdisciplinary development in TCM and NLP, serving as the foundation for further study.}

abstract = {Introduction
Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has a multitude of applications in modern medicine and can be used from both a diagnostic perspective as well as an adjunct to performing invasive medical procedures. POCUS in appropriately trained professionals has revolutionised medical practice.1 However, unregulated adoption of POCUS by inappropriately trained operators can have devastating implications. As such POCUS has been recognised as a top 10 technological hazard for patient safety.2 Furthermore, despite the implementation of the new internal medicine trainee (IMT) curriculum, there is currently no POCUS training requirement for IMTs. This is despite several core procedural skills mandating the use of point of care ultrasound.3,4
Materials and methods
A multicentre survey was designed and distributed via mass email to all internal medicine trainees (IMT1-ST8) across two deaneries in the Southwest of England (Peninsula and Severn). Follow up emails were sent via the assistance of trust wide postgraduate medical education centres or general medicine rota co-ordinators. Non internal medicine trainee responses were subsequently removed.
Results and discussion
41.8% (213/509) doctors training in internal medicine completed the survey. Of these 97.2% (207/213) contributed to either the acute medical take or the general medical rota. 94.8% (202/213) stated that their duties involved performing invasive medical procedures when on call. Despite which only 29.6% (63/213) stated they were ultrasound trained to identify the appropriate sites for undertaking such procedures. 92.0% (196/213) stated they would feel more confident in being able to identify a procedural site following receiving further training on point of care ultrasound. Only 10.8% (23/213) of current trusts provided some form of point of care ultrasound training. 29.6% (63/213) of respondents were aware of any region wide point of care ultrasound training courses and 28.6% (61/213) or respondents had attended such courses. 16.0% (34/213) had formally accredited with a national award body. On a 10-point Likert scale the majority of trainees felt point of care ultrasound training would be useful in their current role (Median = 10, IQR 8-10). A range of free text responses would suggest trainees are very eager to undergo POCUS training with many trainees stating such training should be a core component of IMT. Furthermore, IMTs responses highlight the current dichotomy that exists in the training curriculum. That is, IMTs are expected to be technically proficient at skills that mandate ultrasound training, without any formal ultrasound training requirements in the IMT curriculum. However, concerns have been raised regarding the availability of POCUS facilitators to supply training and assessment, and the frequency of scans to ensure maintenance of skills.
Conclusion
Point of Care ultrasound has a number of applications including being used as an important diagnostic tool and as a key cornerstone to ensuring adequate site selection for invasive medical procedures. Despite the multitude of POCUS applications, few IMT trainees are obtaining sufficient experience or training of POCUS. IMTs perceive POCUS training as highly valuable and would relish in the opportunity for an enhanced POCUS training programme to be delivered (1)Nicholas S, Martin D.

Indeed, one of today’s most used medicinal drugs, salicylic acid (Aspirin), was in common use in ancient Egypt, more than 3000 years ago. Aspirin inhibits pro-inflammatory COX-1 and promotes the anti-inflammatory activity of COX-2 to reduce inflammation, a mechanism useful in curbing pain and reducing fever. Another example is artemisinin, a compound extracted from a Chinese medicinal herb known as artemisia, which has been widely used to treat against malaria. Across the world similar compounds are being used in traditional medicine with crucial relevance to modern psychoneuroimmunology. This Special Issue highlights outstanding mechanistic and reproducible research on traditional medicines that will inform modern psychoneuroimmunology and related study. This Special Issue showcases traditional medicines from across the globe, from the Himalayas to Africa and many places in between. The Special Issue describes important anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of a variety of botanicals with clinical and pre-clinical outcomes. It also describes some equally important “negative” data on some popular candidates including green tea and cannabis. Together these studies reveal candidate traditional medicines with real-world effects at least as good as current pharmaceuticals.}

To systematically study the excipients that play a unique role in TCM processing, this study focuses on honey as the representative and CM as the model drug. The overall components of honey-processed CM, stir-fried CM, and raw CM were determined using the fingerprint method, resulting in 36 chromatographic peaks with significant differences. The principal component analysis (PCA) results showed significant differences among honey-fried, stir-fried, and raw CM. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to screen the important differential components. Network pharmacology and molecular docking technology were used to correlate the efficacy of the marker components. Oxyresveratrol, kuwanon G, and morusin were identified as potential markers. This study proved that the addition of honey as an excipient can affect the chemical composition of the drug itself, thereby impacting its efficacy.}

There are low rates of transition planning in this vulnerable group leading to medical complications, increased use of emergency rooms and gaps in care. We examined what parents of YSHCN have been taught and prepared for regarding their child's medical issues, educational support, social support and legal processes in an effort to ensure transition readiness. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients (14–24 y/o) with one or more of the following diagnoses: autism, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy or seizure disorder, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, or down syndrome, who presented to a general pediatric or adolescent medicine hospital-based clinic for an annual physical, follow up visit or form renewal visit. Data regarding demographics, medical history, participation in social programs, discussions of reasons to see a doctor or escalate care to the emergency department, established health care coordinators, identification of an adult doctor to transition care to and discussion of guardianship were recorded from eligible charts. Data from 122 medical charts (general pediatrics, 70; adolescent medicine, 52) were included with 70 patients (57%) being cared for by a general provider and 52 patients (43%) being cared for by a transition-focused provider. The median patient age was 18, with 70% of patients (n = 85) being between the ages of 14 to 17 y/o and 30% of patients (n = 37) being in the transition age range of 18–24 y/o. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the 18–24 y/o age group (35%) than the 14–17 y/o age group (9%) had identified an adult medical provider to transition care. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the 18–24 y/o age group (54%) than the 14–17 y/o age group (29%) had discussed obtaining guardianship. A significantly greater percentage of patients with transition-focused providers (46%) than patients with a general provider (14%) had an established health care coordinator. A significantly greater percentage of patients with transition-focused providers (35%) than patients with a general provider (4%) had identified an adult medical provider to transition to for adult care. Outcomes showed that being in the transition age group (18–24 y/o) and having a transition-focused provider had a positive influence on discussions about the legal and social aspects of care for YSHCN. This emphasizes the importance of having transition focused providers in both general pediatric and adolescent medicine offices, as well as, incorporation of structured transition readiness protocols to ensure a safe transition.}

The application of manures to land as a form of organic fertiliser presents a pathway by which these bioactive chemicals can enter the environment. However, to date, there is limited understanding regarding the influence of commonly used manure application methods on veterinary medicine fate in soil systems. To bridge this knowledge gap, a semi-field study was conducted to assess the influence of commonly used application methods such as, broadcast, chisel sweep, and incorporation on veterinary medicine losses to waters. A range of veterinary medicines were selected and applied as a mixture; these were enrofloxacin, florfenicol, lincomycin, meloxicam, oxytetracycline, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim and tylosin. All the assessed veterinary medicines were detected within surface runoff and leachates, and the concentrations generally decreased throughout the irrigation period. The surface runoff concentrations ranged from 0.49 to 183.47 μg/L and 2.26–236.83 μg/L for the bare soil and grass assessments respectively. The leachate concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 309.66 μg/L and 0.33–37.79 μg/L for the bare soil and grass assessments respectively. More advanced application methods (chisel sweep) were found to significantly reduce the mass loads of veterinary medicines transported to surface runoff and leachate by 13–56% and 49–88% over that of broadcast. Incorporating pig slurries reduced the losses further with surface runoff and leachate losses being 13–56% and 49–88% lower than broadcast. Our results show that manure application techniques have a significant effect on veterinary medicine fate in the environment and as such these effects should be considered in the decision-making processes for the management of manures as well as from a risk mitigation perspective for aquatic compartments.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) with pathogenic strain resistance leading to a high recurrence rate affect health quality and have become a high-priority issue due to the economic burden on the health care system.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to investigate the supportive benefits of traditional herbal medicines (THMs) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
Materials and methods
Systematic searches of databases, including PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were conducted to collect eligible studies for meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials that investigated UTI recurrence using THM treatment.
Results
The results of 22 studies showed that THM treatment led to significantly fewer UTI events in the experimental group than in the control group (OR = 0.348; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.257 to 0.473; p < 0.001). Seventeen studies reported UTI events during the follow-up period, and the recurrence rate was lower in the experimental group than in the control group (OR, 0.326; 95% CI, 0.245–0.434; p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis further showed that compared to antibiotics alone, treatment with THM plus antibiotics significantly reduced UTI events in the acute phase (OR = 0.301; 95% CI = 0.201 to 0.431; p < 0.001) as well as in the follow-up period (OR = 0.347; 95% CI = 0.241 to 0.498; p < 0.001). However, THM treatment alone was not superior to antibiotics in the acute treatment phase (OR = 0.540; 95% CI = 0.250 to 1.166; p = 0.117) or in the follow-up period (OR = 0.464; 95% CI = 0.111 to 1.951; p = 0.295). Herbal ingredients for recurrent UTI events also showed benefits compared to placebo treatment in the acute phase (OR = 0.337; 95% CI = 0.158 to 0.717; p = 0.005) and during follow-up (OR = 0.238; 95% CI = 0.139 to 0.409; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
THM combined with antibiotics is helpful for people with acute UTIs and for reinfection prevention. THMs alone, although less effective for recurrent UTIs, could be considered a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics.}

abstract = {Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have become the delivery medium of choice for a variety of genomic medicine applications i.e., gene therapy, gene editing/regulation, and ex-vivo cell therapy. AAVs are protein-DNA complexes which have unique stability characteristics that are susceptible to various stress exposure conditions commonly seen in the drug product (DP) life cycle. This review takes a comprehensive look at AAV DP formulation and process development considerations that could impact critical quality attributes (CQAs) during manufacturing, packaging, shipping, and clinical use. Additional aspects related to AAV development reviewed herein are: (1) Different AAV serotypes with unique protein sequences and charge characteristics potentially leading to discrete stability profiles; (2) Manufacturing process challenges and optimization efforts to improve yield, recovery and purity especially during early development activities; and (3) Defining and identifying CQAs with analytical methods which are constantly evolving and present unique characterization challenges for AAV-based products.}

abstract = {Medical Knowledge Graph (KG) has shown great potential in various healthcare scenarios, such as drug recommendation and clinical decision support system. The factors that determine the role of a medical KG in practical applications are the scale, coverage, and quality of the medical knowledge it can provide. Most existing medical KGs are extracted from a single or a few information sources. However, medical knowledge extracted from insufficient information sources is usually highly incomplete or even biased, which results in a lack of data completeness and may lessen their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Besides, the coverage of entity and relation types is inadequate in most previous works, which also might restrict their potential usage in future applications. In this paper, we build a unified system that can extract and manage medical knowledge from heterogeneous information sources. We first employ named entity recognition and relation extraction methods to extract knowledge triplets from medical texts. Then we propose a hierarchical entity alignment framework for further knowledge refinement. Based on our system, we construct a large-scale, high-quality, multi-source, and multi-lingual medical KG named LMKG, which includes 13 entity types and 17 relation types, and contains 403,784 entity and 1,225,097 relation instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the quality of LMKG. Experimental results show that LMKG can effectively enhance the performance of both upstream and downstream intelligent medicine applications. We have publicly released the KG resources and corresponding management service interface to facilitate research and applications in the medical field.}
