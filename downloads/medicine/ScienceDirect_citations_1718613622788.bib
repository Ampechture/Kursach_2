abstract = {Background
Vitiligo causes patchy hypo-pigmentation of skin and mucous membrane, with cosmetic and psychological effects. Studies suggest Psoralea corylifolia (PC) has pigmentor properties and that individualized homeopathic medicines (IH) are a promising treatment option in vitiligo. This pilot trial was aimed at testing the feasibility of a future definitive trial comparing the effects of three treatment regimens – 1. IH, 2. PC mother tincture (MT) external application, and 3. IH and PC (IHPC) in the treatment of vitiligo.
Methods
An open, randomized (1:1:1), three parallel arms, pragmatic, pilot trial was conducted on 60 patients at the dermatology and Materia Medica outpatients of National Institute of Homoeopathy (NIH), India. Primary outcome was Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI); and secondary outcomes were Vitiligo Quality of Life (VitiQoL) and Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI); assessed at baseline, 3rd month and 6th month. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed; intra-group and inter-group comparisons were made by Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests respectively.
Results
Five patients dropped out (IH: 2, PC: 2, IHPC: 1). Intra-group changes over 3 and 6 months were mostly statistically significant in all 3 outcomes (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in VASI and DLQI total scores among the three groups over either 3 or 6 months. Differences among groups after 3 and 6 months showed statistical significances in VitiQoL total scores (P = 0.038 and 0.037 respectively) favoring PC and IHPC respectively.
Conclusion
A definitive trial appears feasible. All three regimens appeared equally effective and safe, though a small positive direction of effect towards PC and IHPC was observed. As a pilot trial, no definite conclusions could be drawn. Trial registration: CTRI/2018/04/013446.}

Diagnosing human sleep quality and problems quickly and accurately is an important issue for human well-being. Therefore, many automatic sleep scoring methods have been proposed. However, the methods have been developed using sleep data from different individuals or groups. The accuracies of these proposed methods might decrease, due to existing individual differences. In this study, the self-attention generative adversarial network (SAGAN) was applied as an advanced data augmentation technique to propose an improved personalized automatic sleep scoring classification. First, the spectrograms were converted from electroencephalography (EEG). Then, SAGAN was used to generate synthesized spectrograms for each subject. Finally, the real and synthesized spectrograms of each subject were utilized to train a personalized classifier. The averaged accuracy and standard deviation of the proposed method are 95.74% and 3.78%, respectively. Compared to the classifier trained with all subjects’ training data, the average accuracy increased by 8.08%. The results proved that the generated spectrograms significantly improved the performance of the personalized automatic sleep scoring classification. The contributions of the proposed method were that made the medical staff and subjects save massive medical resources and time for manual recording and scoring.}

Review, describe, and analyze gaps in legal and medical systems for protecting LGBTQ+ people at the end of life The field of hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) is increasingly recognizing the importance of care that is respectful and attentive to gender and sexual orientation. LGBTQ+ people face several unique health disparities that may affect their care at the end of life. Some may not feel comfortable disclosing their LGBTQ+ identity to providers, either in an office or a hospice setting; studies have shown that LGBTQ+ patients feel less comfortable in their own homes with home care services involved, fearing discrimination.1 Frequently, palliative care follows a patient across multiple levels of care; however, care transitions can bring risk of unaccepting environments or poor patient-provider interactions. In some cases, it has been documented that patients feel they are pushed “back into the closet” due to actual or feared bigotry.2 Support networks differ as well, as many LGBTQ+ individuals rely on families of choice. If these support systems are not appropriately identified or there is lack of adequate documentation, these chosen families may fail to be recognized as decision makers under state laws.3 Transgender individuals are uniquely vulnerable, relying on others to honor their gender identity at the end of life and may face violation of that gender identity by being misgendered.4 Lack of education in LGBTQ+ palliative and end-of-life care in HPM fellowship programs can theoretically create further healthcare disparities. Education should emphasize the unique challenges that LGBTQ+ people often face, sensitive and open dialogue, extension of support to chosen families, and means to ensure wishes are carried forward. This session will serve as a workshop for fellowship, academic, and community-based hospice and palliative care programs to help create and develop specific LGBTQ+ educational competences that can be presented to the academy to provide guidance for training and clinical programs to ensure high-quality palliative care for LGBTQ+ people living with serious illness.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The bark of Matayba oppositifolia (A. Rich.) Britton (commonly known as “huaya” or “palo huacax”) is commonly utilized in traditional Mayan medicine for treating diarrhea and for canker and other sores.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of M. oppositifolia bark extracts against drug-susceptible and -resistant ESKAPE-E pathogens. In addition, the phytochemical composition of the best antibacterial extract was analyzed.
Materials and methods
The bark extracts were prepared with different solvents, including water, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol. These were tested against ESKAPE-E (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp., including Escherichia coli) strains using Resazurin Microtiter Assay. In addition, the composition of the most active extract was analyzed by GC-MS.
Results
The aqueous and organic bark extracts showed activity on drug-susceptible and -resistant ESKAPE-E microbes (MIC = 1000–31.25 μg/mL). The n-hexane bark extract was more active against the superbugs carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (MIC = 500–31.25 μg/mL) and A. baumannii (MIC = 250-125 μg/mL). The GC-MS analysis of this extract allowed the identification of 12 phytochemicals as the potential antibacterial compounds. The major compounds identified were palmitic acid (1), friedelan-3-one (2) and 7-dehydrodiosgenin (3).
Conclusion
The present study reveals the strong in-vitro antibacterial activity of the n-hexane extract from the bark of M. oppositifolia and demonstrates the potential of natural products as a source of antibacterial compounds or phytomedicines that are specifically effective against drug-resistant ESKAPE-E bugs. Additionally, our investigation contributes to the ethnopharmacological knowledge and reappraisal of Mayan medicinal flora, as well as supports the traditional use of the bark of the medicinal plant M. oppositifolia for the treatment of infectious diseases.}

abstract = {Research Objectives
The current evidence regarding the efficacy of regenerative injections on the improvement of function, pain, and other related symptoms of knee osteoarthritis remains to be highly controversial. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical outcomes of individuals who have received regenerative injections for symptomatic knee OA.
Design
Case series.
Setting
The Non-Surgical Center of Texas in San Antonio, Texas (private practice).
Participants
Ten participants' reports were collected from the Non-Surgical Center of Texas in San with symptomatic knee OA to observe the clinical outcomes of regenerative medicine injections between 2018 to 2021. All participants were treated with PRP or prolotherapy injections. Each patient received 1 to 7 injections, in and out of series, based on medical advice, patient-reported pain, and severity of symptoms during functional activity.
Interventions
All participants were treated with PRP or prolotherapy injections. Each patient received 1 to 7 injections, in and out of series, based on medical advice, patient-reported pain, and severity of symptoms during functional activity.
Main Outcome Measures
Visual analog scale (VAS) and manual muscle testing (MMT).
Results
Overall, there was a statistically significant reduction in pain using the VAS (p< 0.05). However, results did not show an improvement in pain with an increased number of injections. Of the ten patients, 8 had an MMT baseline of 5/5 knee flexion and extension while the other 2 patients began at 4/5 MMT. At follow-up visits, 80% of patients demonstrated improvement in pain and strength of symptomatic knee OA. The participant perspectives expressed positive benefits from regenerative injections in regard to their overall function, pain, and quality of life.
Conclusions
The results suggest regenerative medicine injections are an effective conservative treatment for symptomatic knee OA. Regenerative injections appear to be beneficial for improved knee function however further studies are needed to observe long-term effects for continued benefits.

abstract = {Ethanopharmacological importance
Alpinia galanga (L.) Willd (AG), belonging to Zingiberaceae family is used as a spice and condiment in various culinary preparations of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. It has been also used as a key ingredient in various traditional systems of medicine for the treatment of throat infection, asthma, urinary ailments, inflammation and rheumatism amongst other conditions. AG is widely used as a functional food and included in various preparations to obtain its nutraceutical and pharmacological benefits of its phytoconstituents such as phenyl propanoids, flavonoids and terpenoids. Over the past decades, several researchers have carried out systematic investigation on various parts of AG. Numerous studies on AG rhizomes have shown positive pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antipsoriasis, antiallergic, neuroprotective and thermogenesis. Till date, no comprehensive review summarizing the exploitation of AG into nanomedicine has been published.
Aim of the review
This comprehensive review aims to briefly discuss cultivation methods, propagation techniques, extraction processes for AG. The ethnopharmacological uses and pharmacological activities of AG extracts and its isolates are discussed in detail which may contribute well in further development of novel drug delivery system (NDDS) i.e. future nanomedicine.
Materials and methods
Information about AG was collected using search engine tools such as Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, Google Patent, Web of Science and bibliographic databases of previously published peer-reviewed review articles and research works were explored. The obtained data sets were sequentially arranged for better understanding of AG's potential.
Results
More advanced genetic engineering techniques have been utilized in cultivation and propagation of AG for obtaining better yield. Extraction, isolation and characterization techniques have reported numerous phytoconstituents which are chemically phenolic compounds (phenyl propanoids, flavonoids, chalcones, lignans) and terpenes. Ethnopharmacological uses and pharmacological activity of AG are explored in numerous ailments, their mechanism of action and its further potential to explore into novel drug delivery system are also highlighted.
Conclusions
The review highlights the importance of plant tissue culture in increasing the production of AG plantlets and rhizomes. It was understood from the review that AG and its phytoconstituents possess numerous pharmacological activities and have been explored for the treatment of cancer, microbial infection, gastrointestinal disorders, neuroprotective effects, obesity and skin disorders. However, the use of AG as alternative medicine is limited owing to poor solubility of its bioactive components and their instability. To overcome these challenges, novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) have been utilized and found good success in overcoming its aforementioned challenges. Furthermore, efforts are required towards development of scalable, non-toxic and stable NDDS of AG and/or its bioactives.}

abstract = {Recent advances in pharmacogenomics have revealed the significance of individual suspected gene variants that influence the drug response and have answered the numerous medical problems, in order to promote the individualized therapy based on genetic makeup. Pharmacogenomics provides guidance not only for the pharmaceutical companies in discovery and development of personalized medicines but also to physicians in selecting the right drug with right dose for the right patients according to their genetic characteristics. Such genetic based prescription and implementation of particular therapy not only reduces the adverse drug reaction, toxicity and drug price but also improve the treatment protocol. Now, the drug selection criteria are based on sex, age, weight, lifestyle, liver, and kidney enzymes levels. Scientists and health experts can identify genetic variation in an individual or small subset of population which express variation in response to a drug. Thus, pharmacogenomics is the best source to provide the support and to implement the application of personalized medicine. The food and drug administration have pharmacogenomics information such as efficacy, dosage guidelines and side effects of only 150 drugs that based on genetic characteristics. Hence, innovative and improved technologies are required, along with clarification of legal and ethical issues. Additionally, trained health care professionals are required to give public guidance and information on genetic testing in medication therapy and illness management.}

This review focuses on the fundamental principles of AI and the current state of cardiovascular AI. Various types of cardiovascular AI have been developed for evaluating examinations such as X-rays, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiovascular AI achieves high accuracy in diagnostic support and prognosis prediction. Furthermore, it can even detect abnormalities that were previously difficult for cardiologists to detect. Randomized controlled trials begin to be reported to verify the usefulness of cardiovascular AI. The day is approaching when cardiovascular AI will be commonly used in clinical practice. Various types of medical AI will be used for cardiovascular care; however, it will not replace medical doctors. We need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of medical AI so that cardiologists can effectively use AI to improve the medical care of patients.}

Currently, industrial production of HupA relies primarily on direct extraction from Huperzia serrate, a perennial herbaceous plant. However, this strategy cannot satisfy the increasing demand for HupA due to scarcity of H. serrate whose growth is quite slow. Pathway engineering has emerged as a novel strategy for the production of HupA. Unfortunately, the biosynthesis mechanism of HupA has not been well documented. In this review, we summarize not only the methods for plant extraction and chemical synthesis but also state-of-the-art advances in biosynthesis of HupA, including synthetic pathways, key enzymes, and especially catalytic mechanisms. Overall, this review aims to provide valuable insights for complete biosynthesis of Hup A.}

Diabetes may also be caused due to the insulin resistance of the body cells in which the cells become unable to receive insulin, in spite of its normal secretion. Herbal medicines for diabetes have a very significant importance in the regulation of blood glucose level. Unlike pharmaceutically synthesized drugs for diabetes, herbal drugs have negligible adverse effects, and they can be consumed by the patient over a long period of time. There are many active compounds which are present in these herbal products which have anti-diabetic potential. In this chapter, importance of different herbal plants and their extracts for the treatment of DM has been discussed. The recent advancement and development for the efficacy of these herbal plants in treatment of diabetes is explained by cellular and molecular mechanism for active compounds present in these herbal drugs as evidenced by some laboratory-based studies.}

abstract = {Background
Lifestyle medicine (LM) is gaining increasing attention as a treatment option for anxiety, but the current state of evidence has not yet been systematically examined.
Methods
Six electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to February 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of multicomponent LM interventions on anxiety symptoms with either care-as-usual, waitlist, no intervention, or attention control group on anxiety symptoms were identified.
Results
A total of 53 RCTs with 18,894 participants were included for qualitative synthesis, in which 45 RCTs with data available were included for meta-analysis. Multicomponent LM intervention was significantly more effective than the control groups in reducing anxiety symptoms at immediate posttreatment (d = 0.19, p < .001) and at short-term follow-up (d = 0.29, p < .001). However, no significant difference at medium-term was found (p = .14), whereas more studies are needed to study the long-term effects. The subgroup analyses suggested that baseline anxiety symptoms was a significant moderator, suggesting that those with moderate level of baseline anxiety symptoms appeared to have greater improvements (d = 0.66, p < .05).
Limitations
Minimal anxiety symptoms at baseline contributed to the floor effect and influenced the degree of improvement. The included RCTs had a high risk of bias in general with potential publication bias detected.
Conclusion
The findings of this meta-analysis provided support for the positive effects of multicomponent LM interventions for anxiety symptoms. Future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of multicimponent LM and the optimal baseline anxiety severity.}

abstract = {Research Objectives
To investigate if a one-time instruction in a diaphragmatic breathing exercise program, in a primary care setting, performed remotely or in person, was adequate at reducing symptoms of gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and anti-reflux medications usage.
Design
This is a prospective before-and-after, interventional study. Follow up surveys were taken at 1, 3 and 6 months via phone or email.
Setting
Family practice at Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF) provided the subjects whom were recruited, consented and instructed either virtually or in person due to Covid-19
Participants
918 individuals were contacted for recruitment. 185 were recruited into the study and 55 completed the study. One withdrew due to increased pain.
Interventions
Subjects were instructed in diaphragmatic breathing, supplemented with both video recorded instruction and by a brochure. Prior to and after Covid lockdown, individuals were instructed in person, also video instruction and pamphlets issuance was used. The prescribed exercise was to be performed 10 times before and after each meal, and as needed for symptoms control for the duration of the study.
Main Outcome Measures
Reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ) score changes. Initially anti-reflux medication changes were not addressed but a modification was added to monitor any voluntary medication changes.
Results
A total of 185 patients were included in the analysis, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate the change in RDQ score from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months. All tests were two-sided with p value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Median changes of RDQ score from baseline to 1, 3 and 6 months were -6, -11 and -12, and all the changes were statistically significant at < 0.0001 level. Of the 55 patients completing the final survey, 11 persons were either able to reduce or stop anti reflux medication.
Conclusions
A one-time instruction with supplemental materials was effective at reducing symptoms of reflux progressively at the 1, 3 and 6 month follow-up periods.
Author(s) Disclosures
No researchers in this study have any conflicts of interest to report.}

1. Define the factors contributing to increased PTSD incidence due to COVID-19 among hospice and palliative medicine professionals. 2. Implement measures to screen and proactively mitigate workplace related factors associated with increased risk of PTSD in pandemic- and potentially non-pandemic-related situations. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 557 million people globally. In order to assess its psychological effect on healthcare workers in hospice and palliative medicine, a survey was solicited to AAHPM members. Participation was voluntary and anonymous, with all responses kept in confidence. The survey consisted of three parts: demographics, attitudes/sentiments relating to COVID-19, and the DSM-IV-TR Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Specific (PCL-S). The PCL-S has clinical and research utility to screen for PTSD in response to a specific stressor, in this case COVID-19. A total of 323 AAHPM members participated, of which 290 (89.8%) completed the PCL-S. Utilizing the most conservative and reliable scoring method for the PCL-S, 16.6% (48/290) met diagnostic criteria for symptomatic PTSD. Demographic factors including age, relationship status, child status, years of experience, geographical location, and gender did not affect odds of PTSD symptomology, yet non-male gender was associated with higher PCL-S scores (3.2 ± 1.5; p = 0.38). Attitudes surrounding the use and perceived efficacy of telemedicine did not impact the incidence of PTSD. Those providing critical care services (33/156; 21.2%) were at greater risk of symptomatic PTSD than those not providing critical care services to COVID-19 patients (15/135; 11.1%; RR = 1.9[1.08-3.35]; p=0.026). Furthermore, PCL-S scores increased as a function of the number of patients where critical care (but not non-critical care) was provided (p=0.0006). Increased workload (p=0.009) and having to perform new job duties (p=0.004) as a result of COVID-19 were also associated with symptomatic PTSD. Personal stress was also a contributory factor; the risk of symptomatic PTSD was higher among respondents reporting a friend, family member, or colleague's death from COVID-19 (23.8% vs. 13.1%; RR = 1.82[1.08-3.05]). As COVID-19 continues to impact us all, understanding factors affecting the mental health of an integral part of the healthcare workforce is crucial.}

abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the occurrence of dental students’ misconceptions of oral radiology and medicine.
Study Design
A self-administered anonymous questionnaire comprising multiple-choice questions on oral radiology and medicine was applied to undergraduate dental students. The questions were distributed into 2 groups: 10 knowledge-type questions (less demand for reasoning) and 5 scenario-type questions (higher demand for reasoning). The students’ responses were assessed for correctness (right or wrong) and confidence level (sure or unsure), and misconceptions were identified when a student were sure in a wrong response. Pearson's chi-square test was performed to analyze the variables (α = .05).
Results
A total of 1380 responses were collected. Misconceptions represented 24.3% (n = 336) of the total responses and 56.8% of the wrong responses. The mean of misconceptions per student was 3.7 (range, 0 to 8). Students who chose wrong answers tended to have higher confidence levels (P < .001). Moreover, misconceptions were more frequent in scenario-type questions (25.7%) than in knowledge-type questions (23.7%; P = .000).
Conclusions
A large number of misconceptions were found. Thus, strategies can be established to prevent the development of misconceptions to overcome them.}

abstract = {As part of an institutional effort to develop an atmosphere of communication and encourage mutual appreciation of respective viewpoints, we used a cross-sectional survey to investigate the perceptions of emergency (EM) and internal medicine (IM) residents and faculty, particularly, their attitudes about collaboration, mutual respect, and mistreatment. This cross-sectional survey was administered to the EM and IM faculty and residents of a county, academic hospital with a Level 1 Trauma Center to evaluate each specialty's current perception of professional behavior and observations of unprofessional behavior in order to identify areas for improvement. The survey items were answered using a 5-point Likert scale and was analyzed using the unpaired t-test. A total of 68 residents and faculty completed the survey, 32 (59.4% residents) from EM and 36 (94.4% residents) from IM. Among all EM and IM clinicians, 48.6% felt that there was a culture of clinical collaboration. Approximately half of the respondents (51.5%) felt that the state of professionalism between the two departments was below that of other departments. About 10% (11.8%) of all respondents reported experiencing unprofessional behaviors from the other department at least once a month. Challenges identified by EM faculty and residents included time to consult, recommendations, and disposition. Challenges identified by IM included difficulty contacting EM providers and lack of communication regarding patient's clinical status changes. Both specialties emphasized the importance of improved patient care transitional processes. This study is an important first look at the prevalence of negative attitudes and misperceptions between EM and IM providers. These perspectives can occur due to breakdown of communication and differing expectations. Such asynchronies can cause a toxic workplace environment, diminished performance, and poor patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Introduction
In a self-report study of women presenting to a gynecological clinic, 9 out of 10 women reported a sexual health concern (Nusbaum 2003). These concerns are best addressed using a biopsychosocial approach to assessment, treatment and prevention drawing on medical, behavioral and psychological science. At an academic health center in the United States, The Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service was launched in 2019 to provide evaluation, education, treatment and prevention interventions using an integrated practice model. The interdepartmental program currently includes an Advanced Practice Nurse from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology as well as two clinical health psychologists from the Department of Psychiatry all with expertise in women's health and women's sexual medicine. Our interprofessional team collaborates closely with providers in women's primary care, medical, gynecologic and radiation oncology, urogynecology, colorectal surgery, among others.
Objective
Review lessons learned from interdepartmental program design, funding, implementation, and evaluation of the Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service in an academic health center, summarize the types of sexual health concerns among women who presented to the integrated service, and highlight recommendations to generalize and/or adjust the program model to other types of health settings.
Methods
Review the program implementation and evaluation process for the Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service, summarize the data on the women seen for care from April 23 2019 through June, 2021 (e.g., the number of unduplicated patients evaluated, their age, sexual health concerns, and treatment offered, etc), and outline program challenges and strategies to sustain and expand the initiative during and following the COVID-19 pandemic through virtual and in-person care.
Results
The Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service saw 198 women from April 23 2019 through June, 2021. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 72 (mean: 45 years). While most patients (33%) referred themselves to this program, other women were referred by obgyns, medical oncologists, women's primary care providers and gynecologic oncologists. Primary sexual health concerns included one or more of the following issues: pain (100), low desire (76), difficulty with orgasm (19), difficulty with arousal (12) and other (55). Additional findings will be presented on the types of treatment offered as well as patient and referring provider satisfaction with the new integrated sexual health consult service.
Conclusions
Our interdepartmental Women's Sexual Health Consultation Service implemented a highly successful program that integrates sexual medicine, behavioral health, health psychology and sexual therapy to ensure access to state-of-the-art interprofessional education and care for women across the life span in all their diversities. We were able to sustain and expand this program through telehealth and in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anticipate further growth in patient referrals and treatment modalities moving forward. Providers across disciplines also routinely refer to and collaborate with the program. Several components of the model are generalizable or adjustable to other women's health settings.

In this paper, we report on wearable glove-embedded sensors for non-invasive and selective determination of therapeutic drugs and a biomarker in sweat samples. Electrochemical sensing was made with an array of sensors printed on four fingers of a plastic glove. Uric acid was detected using the index finger functionalized with carbon black with a limit of detection of 1.37 × 10–6 mol L–1. Paracetamol and paroxetine were detected using the middle and ring fingers coated with Printex Carbon with limits of detection of 2.47 × 10–7 and 4.93 × 10–7 mol L–1, respectively. Ethinylestradiol (EE2) detection was performed with a pre-treated screen-printed carbon electrode on the little finger with limit of detection of 9.35 × 10–7 mol L–1. The high sensitivity and selectivity achieved with the glove-embedded sensors were possible due to a judicious choice of sensing layers and optimized working conditions for differential pulse voltammetry. Monitoring of the analytes was carried out in sweat samples with suitable recovery between 90 and 110%. The glove-embedded sensors were robust against multiple flexion cycles, stable and reproducible, with no response to interference from other molecules in sweat. They may be extended to detect other targets for on-site analysis, in addition to applications in environmental and water samples.}

The human genome includes 25 genes coding for Sec that employ it to catalyze challenging reactions. Selenoenzymes control thyroid hormones, calcium activities, immune responses, and perform other vital roles, but most are devoted to preventing and reversing oxidative damage. As the most potent intracellular nucleophile (pKa 5.2), Sec is vulnerable to binding by metallic and organic soft electrophiles (E*). These electron poor reactants initially form covalent bonds with nucleophiles such as cysteine (Cys) whose thiol (pKa 8.3) forms adducts which function as suicide substrates for selenoenzymes. These adducts orient E* to interact with Sec and since Se has a higher affinity for E* than sulfur, the E* transfers to Sec and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme's activity. Organic electrophiles have lower Se-binding affinities than metallic E*, but exposure sources are more abundant. Individuals with poor Se status are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of high E* exposures. The relative E*:Se stoichiometries remain undefined, but the aggregate effects of multiple E* exposures are predicted to be additive and possibly synergistic under certain conditions. The potential for the combined Se-binding effects of common pharmaceutical, dietary, or environmental E* require study, but even temporary loss of selenoenzyme activities would accentuate oxidative damage to tissues. As various degenerative diseases are associated with accumulating DNA damage, defining the effects of complementary E* exposures on selenoenzyme activities may enhance the ability of preventative medicine to support healthy aging.}

Electrospinning/air-blowing technique was firstly used for production of PCL cotton-like fibers (PCLCLF). PCL/COL scaffold was then fabricated via mechanical compression of PCLCLF, infiltration of the compressed PCLCLF with hydrogel-forming COL solution and finally lyophilization. The large-volume PCL/COL porous scaffold demonstrated unique micro/nanofibrous architecture and highly porous structure, in addition to high water-uptake capacity, good cuttability and excellent punchability.

Droperidol is a butyrophenone that has recently been reintroduced after a United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) black box warning in 2001. Evidence demonstrates utility in a variety of clinical conditions.
Objective
This paper provides evidence-based updates concerning the use of droperidol for the emergency clinician.
Discussion
Droperidol received a black box warning by the US FDA in 2001 due to concerns for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; however, reevaluation of the available data suggests droperidol is a safe and efficacious medication. It can be used in the emergency department (ED) setting for many conditions, including acute agitation, headaches, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Extensive literature supports that the QT-prolonging effects are transient and that the risk of torsades de pointes is rare with doses utilized in the ED. An electrocardiogram does not need to be routinely obtained before droperidol use but should be considered in patients at high risk for QT prolongation.
Conclusions
Current evidence suggests that droperidol is a safe and effective medication for treating nausea and vomiting, headache, vertigo, and agitation in the ED setting.}

The exposome is a proposed concept representing all external factors that influence health, and exposomics is the science systematically characterizing the resulting health effects of environmental exposures. Environmental factors can have sex-specific effects due to sex-specific exposures, such as different occupational roles and exposures to personal care products as well as due to sex-specific responses that are the consequence of dysregulated hormonal signaling. Furthermore, the types of environmental exposures one has depend on additional factors including gender identity, race, and socioeconomic status. Thus, it is important to consider environmental factors in sex-specific medicine, particularly for individuals who exist at the intersection of multiple marginalized groups, to better understand health and the pathogenesis of diseases, and to inform policy surrounding the regulation of harmful environmental exposures.}

The adsorption of the studied compounds on copper surface was analyzed based on molecular modeling and material dynamic simulation. Furthermore, the spontaneous adsorption of copper surface of these molecules was performed in mixed DMSO/H2O (80/20, v/v). The copper surface adsorbed by the target molecules showed superior antialgae performance of Chlorella, and the maximum diameters of bacteriostatic zones against E. coli and S. aureus reached about 3.5 cm and 2.8 cm. Besides, the dynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that the target compounds achieved over 96% corrosion inhibition efficiency at 0.100 mM in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The adsorption of copper surface of the target molecules was deeply characterized such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which revealed that the target molecules are chemically adsorbed on the metal surface through the complexation of heteroatoms with metals.}

In accordance, over the last years, basic research focusing on the aberrations underlying malignant transformation of myeloid cells has provided the basis for precision medicine approaches and subsequently has led to the development of powerful therapeutic strategies. In this review article, we will recapitulate what has happened since in the 1980s the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), as a first targeted cancer therapy, has changed one of the deadliest leukemia subtypes, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), into one that can be cured without classical chemotherapy today. Similarly, imatinib, the first molecularly designed cancer therapy, has revolutionized the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Thus, targeted treatment approaches have become the paradigm for myeloid malignancy, but many questions still remain unanswered, especially how identical mutations can be associated with different phenotypes. This might be linked to the impact of the cell of origin, gene-gene interactions, or the tumor microenvironment including the immune system. Continuous research in the field of myeloid neoplasia has started to unravel the molecular pathways that are not only crucial for initial treatment response, but also resistance of leukemia cells under therapy. Ongoing studies focusing on leukemia cell vulnerabilities do already point to novel (targetable) “Achilles heels” that can further improve myeloid cancer therapy.}

Participants will be able to model a similar study using the validated screening tool to aid in developing like processes to demonstrate the value of embedding a PC clinician in the ED.
Key Message
Embedding a specialty palliative medicine physician assistant consultant in the emergency room one day per week to upstream palliative care services for patients and their loved ones living with serious illness(es) offered to improved healthcare outcomes and reduce healthcare utilization.
Introduction
In an effort to upstream palliative care services for patients living with serious illnesses, embedding a specialty palliative care providers has demonstrated improved patient outcomes including improved patient experience, positive impact on the emergency room faculty, and reduced hospital length of stay as well as decreased health care costs in various studies.
Objectives
In this study, we sought to explore outcomes including hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and imaging orders in the ED and in the hospital, for patients with palliative care needs being seen by a palliative care physician assistant in the emergency room.
Methods
For one day per week, a specialty palliative care physician assistant (PA) was embedded in the emergency room. Using the validates PCARES screening tool, the PA manually reviewed all patients in the ED during their shift to identify patients who screened positive. In a randomized fashion, the PA would see every other patient who screened positive for palliative consultation, which served as the intervention group. This data was manually tracked in Excel. Duplicate patients were removed from the study to reduce for confounding factors.
Results
A total of 60 unique patients served in the intervention arm and 62 in the control arm of the study. Preliminary results demonstrated reduced total hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, and reduced imaging orders in ED and in hospital.
Conclusion
Preliminary results demonstrate that embedding a specialty level palliative care PA in the emergency department demonstrated improved healthcare outcomes and reduction in healthcare utilization.

However, the COVID-19 restrictions have met with mixed responses in India and the US. Despite recommendations to continue social isolation and personal hygiene measures, India has not been able to curb the rise in daily cases. Our findings demonstrate the difference in the manner by which India and the US differ in their emergency handling of patients. We conducted a thorough review of the existing protocols and data concerning emergency responses in India and the US. The triage and care of suspected COVID-19 positive patients is different across India and the US. We find that there is a shortage of oxygenation, vaccination and other essential supplies in India. Further, the US is able to triage patients through telemedicine and EMS before suspected COVID-19 patients arrive, which is less prevalent in India. Our study identifies the importance of the emergency department (ED) as a critical contributor to the prevention and care of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Hospitals in India have been struggling to accommodate a huge influx of patients during its second wave with the ED playing a key link in their COVID-19 response.}

Among various bioinks, cellulose is the most abundantly available natural polymer & widely used as bioink for 3D bioprinting applications. To mitigate the demanding crosslinking needs of cellulose, it is frequently chemically modified or blended with other polymers to develop stable hydrogels. In this study, we have developed a thermoresponsive, composite bioink using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and agarose in different ratios (9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, and 5:5). Among the tested combinations, the 5:5 ratio showed better gel formation at 37 °C and were further characterized for physicochemical properties. Cytocompatibility was assessed by in vitro extract cytotoxicity assay (ISO 10993–5) using skin fibroblasts cells. CMC-agarose (5:5) bioink was successfully used to fabricate complex 3D structures through extrusion bioprinting and maintained over 80 % cell viability over seven days. Finally, in vivo studies using rat full-thickness wounds showed the potential of CMC-agarose bulk and bioprinted gels in promoting skin regeneration. These results indicate the cytocompatibility and suitability of CMC–agarose bioinks for tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting applications.}

Nanodrug delivery systems show great potential in overcoming chemoresistance, but limited by the lack of identification of chemoresistance targets from cancer patients. In the present study, we enrolled chemotherapy-resistant or sensitive CRC patients and used the next-generation RNA sequencing to reveal that Asporin (ASPN) is highly expressed in tumor tissues from oxaliplatin (OXA)-resistant patients and closely correlated with a poor prognosis of CRC. Downregulation of ASPN reversed OXA resistance and promoted cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. To overcome ASPN-mediated OXA resistance, we constructed a nanoparticle-based co-delivery system (denoted as PPO-siASPN) for simultaneous delivery of OXA and siRNA targeting ASPN (siASPN). PPO-siASPN not only facilitated the intracellular delivery of OXA through the enhanced cellular uptake, but effectively suppressed ASPN expression for synergistic antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In the more clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model, systemic administration of PPO-siASPN achieved a remarkable therapeutic effect. This study uncovered the critical role of ASPN in causing OXA resistance in CRC patients and suggests a promising nanoformulation that may be more effective than current standard-of-care medications.}

Background
Spontaneous regression of advanced solid tumors is infrequent but may occur. Quantifying response rates from placebo in cancer drug trials may provide important information for physicians, patients, and regulators. We aimed to provide a pooled placebo response rate from drug trials in advanced solid tumors.
Methods
We pooled the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR) and partial response rates (PR) in the placebo arm of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cancer drugs for advanced solid tumors published during 2015–2021 using random-effects model.
Findings
45 phase 3 RCTs including 5684 patients on placebo met our inclusion criteria and formed the study cohort. The pooled overall ORR, CR and PR rates in the placebo arm were 1% (95% CI, 0%–2%), 0% (95% CI, 0%–0%), and 1% (95% CI, 0%–2%) respectively. Higher placebo responses were observed in prostate cancer and sarcoma trials.
Interpretation
Overall, 1% patients with advanced solid tumors can expect to achieve some response even in absence of treatment. However, complete regression without treatment is extremely rare, almost zero percent. This information will be helpful to patients in their decisions, as well as regulators in evaluating cancer drugs’ efficacy based on response rates alone.
Funding
None.}

abstract = {Benign thyroidal disease is one of the leading endocrine disorders. Therapeutical management of goiter depends on thyroidal function status and the etiology underlying condition. To date, pillars of therapy are surgery, thyroid-specific medication and/or radioactive iodine. Thyroidectomy should be preferred in specific scenarios e.g., suspicion of thyroid malignancy and concerns about compression. Antithyroid drugs (ADTs) are indicated as a first-line treatment of Graves’ disease (GD), particularly in young subjects, and for short-term treatment. TSH suppressive therapy with levothyroxine to treat nontoxic goiters is obsolete. Radioactive iodine (RAI) should be the first-line definitive treatment for adults with GD, unless ADTs are likely to achieve remission or unsuitable. Moreover, RAI should be the therapy of choice also in adults with hyperthyroidism secondary to hyperfunctioning nodule(s). The aim of RAI therapy in toxic goiter and GD is to treat hyperthyroidism by destroying sufficient thyroid tissue to render the patient eu-/hypothyroid. Dosimetry-based and empiric approaches are currently applied to calculate the RAI activity to be administrated. Both aim to achieve a certain dose within the target tissue, that will theoretically lead to the desired results. Hypothyroidism is nowadays accepted as a favorable outcome of RAI in GD and toxic goiter. The aim of RAI in nontoxic goiter is the reduction of thyroid volume. RAI therapy is generally well tolerated, whether it is administrated for a hyperthyroid disorder or nontoxic goiter. Not often adverse effects may occur. As it comes to long term adverse events, controversial results are published regarding the risk for secondary malignancies, with most studies indicating that there is no elevation of the risk from RAI per se. Biochemical monitoring thyroid gland and ultrasound are of major importance during follow up. The development of novel therapies, especially the image-guided thermal ablation procedures is gaining interest.}

abstract = {Background
During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, physician focus shifted from continuity of care to pandemic duties. However, patients still required in-person visits for acute or chronic complaints. Specially trained pharmacists were utilized to alleviate Family Medicine Walk-In (FMWI) provider shortages.
Objective
To describe the innovative practice utilizing diagnostic pharmacists in FMWI, evaluate their impact on provider time, compare workload with traditional advanced practice providers (APPs), and evaluate type of visits and medications prescribed.
Practice description
Pharmacists at an Indian Health Service medical center staffed FMWI 2.5 days per week to alleviate provider shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. The privileged pharmacist had a diagnostic scope like APPs. Non-privileged pharmacists provided care to patients utilizing current protocols and were required to present all new complaints to providers.
Practice innovation
The facility utilized pharmacists that have completed or were progressing through the local diagnostic training program to alleviate provider shortages.
Evaluation methods
The absolute number of visits by pharmacists was determined and the number of provider hours shifted to pharmacy estimated. The number of visits by provider type was calculated and compared. ICD-10 codes were evaluated for purpose of visits. New prescriptions written by pharmacists were categorized and reimbursement rates determined.
Results
Pharmacists were responsible for 677 visits during 88 clinic days, with an estimated 338 provider hours shifted to pharmacists. Pharmacists saw 5.8 patients per day, APPs 5.2, and physicians 5.7. Pharmacists primarily evaluated hypertension, diabetes, musculoskeletal, and infectious disease complaints. New prescription categories included pain management, endocrine, cardiovascular, and infectious disease. The single billable pharmacist was reimbursed $77,945.
Conclusion
Diagnostic pharmacists in FMWI have allowed providers to shift to other pandemic duties and demonstrate similar workload as APPs. Most visits and prescriptions fall within known pharmacist practice. Pharmacists in this setting pay for the existence of this position and remain integrated in FMWI.}

Reproductive health encompasses the proper functioning of the reproductive system at all stages of life. The male reproductive system is susceptible to various diseases, disorders, and dysfunction, which may develop during multiple phases of life. Adverse and life-threatening effects of modern therapies targeting reproductive conditions are widespread. Recently, an alternative to modern medicine that takes advantage of nature's benefits has been investigated. Herbal medicine has long been used to treat various diseases in different countries, especially among rural and ethnic peoples, due to its profitability, easy availability, low cost, ease of use, and little to no adverse effect. Various medicinal plants have been evaluated for their therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of various reproductive dysfunctions. This chapter summarizes multiple medicinal plants and their extracts used to treat common reproductive disorders in this chapter.}
