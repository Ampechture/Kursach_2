Objective
Air medical transportation (AMT) of patients plays a critical role in the prehospital care of the ill patient. Despite its importance, there is no requirement in emergency medicine training programs to have direct experience or education on the topic, and data detailing current AMT experiences across programs are limited.
Methods
A survey detailing program characteristics, AMT experience characteristics, and curriculum factors relating to AMT experience was sent to all 275 credentialed emergency medicine residency training programs in the United States. Our outcomes were to describe the characteristics of AMT and non-AMT programs (proportions) and to evaluate associations (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals) between program characteristics and 1) AMT experience opportunity and 2) level of resident participation among AMT programs.
Results
Two hundred (73%) programs responded, with 135 of 200 (68%) offering some type of AMT experience. The majority of programs offering AMT were 3 years (113 [84%]), university based (63 [47%]), and located in small urban areas (57 [42%]). When AMT was offered, most programs reported that the overall resident participation was low (≤ 20%). Programs that did not offer shift reduction or additional pay for participation in AMT were significantly more likely to have low participation than those with incentives (odds ratio = 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-15.3). Around one third of AMT experiences allowed for direct patient care. Less than half of the responding programs reported a dedicated AMT curriculum.
Conclusion
The majority of emergency medicine residency training programs offer an AMT experience, but this experience is highly variable, and overall participation by residents is low. Given the importance of AMT in the care of emergency patients, standardization and increased access to AMT experience and education should be considered by emergency medicine training programs moving forward.}

abstract = {Objective
Functional constipation (FC) is a common intestinal disease worldwide. Despite the presence of criteria such as Roman IV, there is no standardized diagnosis and treatment algorithm in Hong Kong that combines both Western and Chinese medicine approaches. This study integrates current effective and safe diagnosis and treatment methods for FC and provides a clear and scientific pathway for clinical professionals and patients.
Methods
A systematic search of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases was performed from their inception to June 30th, 2022, collecting the current evidence about the efficacious integrative management for FC. We organized a meeting of professionals in fields relevant to treatment and management of FC to develop a consensus agreement on clinical pathway process.
Results
We developed a clinical pathway for the treatment of FC based on the most recent published guidelines and consultation with experts. This pathway includes a hierarchy of recommendations for every step of the clinical process, including clinical intake, diagnostic examination, recommended labs, diagnostic flowchart, and guidance for selection of therapeutic drugs.
Conclusion
This pathway establishes clinical standards for the diagnosis and treatment of FC using Chinese medicine and Western medicine; it will help to provide high-quality medical services in Hong Kong for patients with FC.

abstract = {Depression is considered to be an “emotional disease” in ancient books of traditional Chinese medicine. Its clinical features are similar to those of “Lily disease” in the ancient Chinese medicine book Synopsis of the Golden Chamber written by Zhang Zhongjing in the Han Dynasty. Baihe Zhimu (Lilium lancifolium bulb and Anemarrhena asphodeloides rhizome) decoction (LBRAD) is the first prescription of “Lily Disease” in this book. It is also a special remedy for “Lily disease” after sweating. The classic recipe LBRAD consists of two herbs, fresh lily bulbs and dried Rhizoma Anemarrhena slice. It has the effect of supplementing nutrition and clearing heat, nourishing Yin and moistening. After more than two thousand years of clinical practice, it has been currently widely used in clinical treatment of depression. In this paper, the relationship between LBRAD and depression was systematically reviewed from both clinical and experimental studies, as well as the preparation, the clinical application, the pharmacological mechanism and the effective material basis for the treating depression of LBRAD. The core targets and biological processes of the depression treatment were explored through network pharmacological analysis, so as to speculate its potential mechanism. Finally, the association between LBRAD and post-COVID-19 depression was discussed. We concluded with a summary and future prospects. This review may provide a theoretical basis for the expansion of the clinical application of LBRAD and the development of new drugs for the treatment of depression, as well as new ideas for the secondary development of classical prescriptions.}

To characterize the precise syndromes, precise diseases and precise targets of the precise targets between complex diseases and CHM formulas, we developed an artificial intelligence-based quantitative predictive algorithm (DeepTCM). DeepTCM has gone through multilevel model calibration and validation against a comprehensive set of herb and disease data so that it accurately captures the complex cellular signaling, molecular and theoretical levels of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). As an example, our model simulated the optimal CHM formulas for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) with depression, and through model sensitivity analysis, we calculated the balanced scoring of the formulas. Furthermore, we constructed a biological knowledge graph representing interactions by associating herb-target and gene-disease interactions. Finally, we experimentally confirmed the therapeutic effect and pharmacological mechanism of a novel model-predicted intervention in humans and mice. This novel multiscale model opened up a new avenue to combine “disease syndrome” and “macro micro” system modeling to facilitate translational research in CHM formulas.}

abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an essential part of the Chinese medical system and is recognized by the World Health Organization as an important alternative medicine. As an important part of TCM, TCM diagnosis is a method to understand a patient’s illness, analyze its state, and identify syndromes. In the long-term clinical diagnosis practice of TCM, four fundamental and effective diagnostic methods of inspection, auscultation-olfaction, inquiry, and palpation (IAOIP) have been formed. However, the diagnostic information in TCM is diverse, and the diagnostic process depends on doctors’ experience, which is subject to a high-level subjectivity. At present, the research on the automated diagnosis of TCM based on machine learning is booming. Machine learning, which includes deep learning, is an essential part of artificial intelligence (AI), which provides new ideas for the objective and AI-related research of TCM. This paper aims to review and summarize the current research status of machine learning in TCM diagnosis. First, we review some key factors for the application of machine learning in TCM diagnosis, including data, data preprocessing, machine learning models, and evaluation metrics. Second, we review and summarize the research and applications of machine learning methods in TCM IAOIP and the synthesis of the four diagnostic methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and research directions of using machine learning methods for TCM diagnosis.}

According to the European Union (EU) directives, under the EU framework for (traditional) herbal medicinal products, herbal medicines with long history of use can be registered in EU. However, there is a condition in this directive in which only those that have at least 10–15 years in the EU market are accepted for registration and/or marketing authorization. In author opinion, the condition of 10–15 years of use in EU countries set within the EU regulatory framework is with consideration of the genetic differences which can result in variation in adverse drug responses among different world populations. With this concept in mind, it is reasonable to project the principal of the EU directive to the Asian countries where TCM is originated. Countries like China, Singapore, Japan and South Korea that have well established drug registration framework are in best position in executing the best practice and facilitate harmonization of registration for TCM within the region. Furthermore, the registration process itself allows more safety and efficacy data to be collected systemically before and after product registration/marketing authorization. These are valuable information for future drug development. The therapeutic value of TCM is limitless, it has been left out in the EU regulatory framework, and the opportunity for it to be expanded and carried forward in modern medicines is shadowed by the limited number of TCM that are qualified to be registered under the EU regulatory framework. An early establishment of a harmonized risk-based registration process for TCM in Asian countries is important. This will strengthen the database to substantiate the history of safe use and further preserving and expanding the therapeutic values of TCM within and beyond the Asian region.}

abstract = {Summary
Cardiometabolic diseases are the leading preventable causes of death in most geographies. The causes, clinical presentations, and pathogenesis of cardiometabolic diseases vary greatly worldwide, as do the resources and strategies needed to prevent and treat them. Therefore, there is no single solution and health care should be optimised, if not to the individual (ie, personalised health care), then at least to population subgroups (ie, precision medicine). This optimisation should involve tailoring health care to individual disease characteristics according to ethnicity, biology, behaviour, environment, and subjective person-level characteristics. The capacity and availability of local resources and infrastructures should also be considered. Evidence needed for equitable precision medicine cannot be generated without adequate data from all target populations, and the idea that research done in high-income countries will transfer adequately to low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is problematic, as many migration studies and transethnic comparisons have shown. However, most data for precision medicine research are derived from people of European ancestry living in high-income countries. In this Series paper, we discuss the case for precision medicine for cardiometabolic diseases in LMICs, the barriers and enablers, and key considerations for implementation. We focus on three propositions: first, failure to explore and implement precision medicine for cardiometabolic disease in LMICs will enhance global health disparities. Second, some LMICs might already be placed to implement cardiometabolic precision medicine under appropriate circumstances, owing to progress made in treating infectious diseases. Third, improvements in population health from precision medicine are most probably asymptotic; the greatest gains are more likely to be obtained in countries where health-care systems are less developed. We outline key recommendations for implementation of precision medicine approaches in LMICs.}

The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine uses social media to increase awareness of the Society and its key programs and to foster community and discussion around perinatal health, especially on Twitter. The influence and role of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter account in public discourse around issues relevant to pregnancy have not been studied.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to evaluate the trends in engagement with the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine on Twitter by analyzing Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine follower growth and discussion topics on Twitter compared with Facebook and by quantifying public engagement during the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting.
STUDY DESIGN
This retrospective study analyzed follower growth data from August 2019 to July 2022 for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter (@MySMFM) and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Facebook (@SocietyforMaternalFetalMedicine) accounts. We identified the top 10 tweets and Facebook posts during the study period using Twitter Analytics and Facebook data. The popularity of tweets and Facebook posts was determined by “impressions” and “reach,” respectively; these metrics reflect the number of times a post was viewed. To evaluate annual trends in Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter engagement, we analyzed data associated with the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting, including the number of tweets using the hashtag (#SMFM(Year)) and overall impressions for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter account for each meeting from 2016 to 2023.
RESULTS
The absolute number of new followers for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter and Facebook accounts was similar, but the relative increase and rate of follower growth was higher for Twitter than for Facebook. The Twitter account consistently gained followers, whereas the Facebook account experienced intermittent periods of stagnancy or follower loss. More than half of the top-ranked posts on Twitter and Facebook mentioned the COVID-19 vaccine; other popular topics included COVID-19 and abortion. During the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting, the number of tweets using the meeting hashtag consistently peaked on meeting day 4, coincident with the opening plenary session (mean 1270±499). An upward trend in annual pregnancy meeting tweets was observed each year until 2021—the first virtual Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine meeting.
CONCLUSION
The trends in Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter engagement suggest increasing use and popularity of the platform for timely dissemination of pregnancy-related news, guidelines, and research. The reduction in annual pregnancy meeting tweets and impressions in 2021 and 2022 suggests the potential negative effect of virtual meetings on Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine member engagement around annual meeting content.}

Biophysical phenotyping can yield timely and rich information on physiological and pathological state of cells for disease diagnosis, drug screening, precision medicine, etc. However, precise measurement on single-cell impedance is challenging, particularly hard to figure out the detailed biophysical parameters of single cell due to coupling and complexity of impedance model. Here, we propose an analytic determination method to decode single-cell electrophysiological parameters (including cell-substrate interface capacitance, cell membrane capacitance, cell membrane conductivity, and cytoplasm conductivity) from the impedances measured at optimized frequencies by using analytic solution rather than spectrum fitting. With this simple and fast analytic solution method, the physiological parameters of single cell in natural adhesion state can be accurately determined in real time. We validate this cell parameter determination method in monitoring the change of cell adhesion under hydraulic effects and exploring electrophysiological differences among MCF-7, HeLa, Huh7, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Particularly, we apply the approach to optimize tumor treating fields (TTFields) therapy, realizing individualized precision medicine. Our work provides an accurate and efficient approach for characterizing single-cell biophysical properties with real-time, in-situ, label-free, and less invasive advantages.}

abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a major holistic approach to health and disease, has been used for a long time globally (>100 years) and in China (>1000 years) for various medical conditions. However, the contrast between TCM and modern medicine is remarkable, and the underlying mechanisms of TCM remain unclear. In modern medicine, immunology is a complex, holistic defense system against pathogens, preserving homeostasis and influencing disease development. Notably, TCM and immunology share core concepts, such as holism, defense mechanisms, equilibrium, balance, and circadian rhythms. This review focuses on the similarities and distinctions between these two disciplines and sheds light on ancient TCM theories by leveraging modern immunological parameters. In addition, we emphasize the potential of advanced “omics” research methods to unravel TCM's mechanisms, providing compelling biological evidence for its therapeutic principles and effects using immunological data.}

abstract = {Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a rich history spanning thousands of years, with its applications ranging from treating female infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss to managing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Yet the safety of pregnant women consuming Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) still lacks sufficient modern clinical research data. On April 19, the journal Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica published a research article titled "Maternal traditional Chinese medicine exposure and risk of congenital malformations: a multi-center prospective cohort study." The study claimed that "Periconceptional TCM exposure is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformation," drawing attention from both English and Chinese media outlets, which extensively reported and commented on the findings. In response, various TCM organizations contested the research, asserting that it failed to adhere to fundamental standards of academic rigor, statistical analysis, and necessary methodologies to draw conclusions. International TCM practitioners and scholars thoroughly examined the article, uncovering multiple errors and arguing that these misleading conclusions significantly undermined the reputation of CHM. These scholars communicated their doubts directly to the corresponding author and the journal's chief editor, emphasizing that the article's conclusion was derived from secondary data analysis of another clinical research project and funding sources, therefore, called for withdrawal of the article. Eventually, the article was retracted due to flaws with the study design in collecting data on exposure to TCM in pregnant women, which affects the validity of the data to support the conclusions of the study. This article conducts a comprehensive academic inquiry into the article, meticulously outlining the identified errors, discusses the reproductive toxicity of CHM, and provides suggestions for future research to evaluate the safety of pregnant women using CHM rigorously, emphasizing evaluation on teratogenicity research of CHM should not only be based on study using healthy animals, but also incorporate clinical epidemiological research and disease-syndrome-based toxicology.}

abstract = {Background
Intranasal administration has been adopted in traditional medicine to facilitate access to the bloodstream and central nervous system (CNS). In modern medicine, nasal drug delivery systems are valuable for disease treatment because of their noninvasiveness, good absorption, and fast-acting effects.
Objective
This study aimed to systematically organize preclinical and clinical studies on intranasal herbal medicines to highlight their potential in drug development.
Methods
A comprehensive search for literature until February 2023 was conducted on PubMed and the Web of Science. From the selected publications, we extracted key information, including the types of herbal materials, target diseases, intranasal conditions, methods of toxicity evaluation, main outcomes, and mechanisms of action, and performed quality assessments for each study.
Results
Of the 45 studies, 13 were clinical and 32 were preclinical; 28 studies used herbal extracts, 9 used prescriptions, and 8 used natural compounds. The target diseases were rhinosinusitis, influenza, fever, stroke, migraine, insomnia, depression, memory disorders, and lung cancer. The common intranasal volumes were 8–50 µl in mice, 20–100 µl in rats, and 100–500 µl in rabbits. Peppermint oil, Ribes nigrum folium, Melia azedarach L., Elaeocarpus sylvestris, Radix Bupleuri, Da Chuan Xiong Fang, Xingnaojing microemulsion, and Ginsenoside Rb1 emerged as potential candidates for rapid intranasal therapy. The in vivo toxicity assessments were based on mortality, body weight, behavioral changes, mucociliary activity, histopathology, and blood tests. Most intranasal treatments were safe, except for Cyclamen europaeum, Jasminum sambac, Punica granatum L., and violet oil, which caused mild adverse effects. At lower doses, intranasal herbal treatments often show greater effects than oral administration. The actions of intranasal herbal medicine mainly involve regulating inflammation and neurotransmission, with the olfactory bulb and anterior cingulate cortex to be relevant brain regions.
Conclusion
Intranasal delivery of herbal materials holds promise for enhancing drug delivery efficacy and reducing treatment duration, offering a potential future perspective for developing intranasal therapies for various diseases.}

The relationship between gut microbiota and human health has gradually been recognized. Increasing studies show that the disorder of gut microbiota is related to the occurrence and development of many diseases. Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota are responsible for their extensive regulatory roles. In addition, naturally derived medicine food homology species with low toxicity and high efficiency have been clearly defined owing to their outstanding physiological and pharmacological properties in disease prevention and treatment.
Aim of review
Based on supporting evidence, the current review summarizes the representative work of medicine food homology species targeting the gut microbiota to regulate host pathophysiology and discusses the challenges and prospects in this field. It aims to facilitate the understanding of the relationship among medicine food homology species, gut microbiota, and human health and further stimulate the advancement of more relevant research.
Key scientific concepts of review
As this review reveals, from the initial practical application to more mechanism studies, the relationship among medicine food homology species, gut microbiota, and human health has evolved into an irrefutable interaction. On the one hand, through affecting the population structure, metabolism, and function of gut microbiota, medicine food homology species maintain the homeostasis of the intestinal microenvironment and human health by affecting the population structure, metabolism, and function of gut microbiota. On the other hand, the gut microbiota is also involved in the bioconversion of the active ingredients from medicine food homology species and thus influences their physiological and pharmacological properties.}

However, the characterization of the chemical profiles of TCM prescriptions (TCMPs) which often consist of multiple herbal medicines and contain diverse structural types, presents several challenges, such as component overlapping and time-consuming. In this study, a novel strategy known as the multi-module structure labelled molecular network (MSLMN), which integrates molecular networking, database annotation, and cluster analysis techniques, has been successfully proposed, which facilitates the identification of chemical constituents by leveraging a high-structural similarity ion list derived from the MSLMN. It has been effectively applied to analyze the chemical profile of Xiaoyao San (XYS), a classical TCMP. Through the MSLMN method, a total of 302 chemical constituents were identified, covering nine structural types in XYS. Furthermore, a validated and quantitative analytical method using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS technology was developed for 31 identified chemicals, encompassing all eight herbal medicines present in XYS, and the developed analytical approach was applied to investigate the content distribution across 40 different batches of commercially available XYS. In total, the proposed strategy has practical significance for improving the insight into the chemical profile of XYS and serves as a valuable approach for handling complex system data based on UHPLC-MS, particularly for TCMPs.}

abstract = {Introduction
Reporting guidelines (RGs) provide the minimum information for inclusion to ensure that research reports can be understood by readers, reproduced or otherwise utilized by other researchers, or guide decisions by clinicians. The Reporting Guidelines for Clinical Studies in Traditional Chinese Medicine (RGCS-TCM) were established to guide the development of reporting standardization of clinical studies in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). However, the characteristics and methodological quality of existing RGCS-TCM are yet to be investigated. We therefore performed a cross-sectional study to identify and evaluate the adequacy of RGCS-TCM and propose recommendations to optimize the development standards and future directions for RGCS-TCM.
Methods
Seven databases including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data and VIP Chinese Medical Journal Database, the EQUATOR network website, tracking references to included studies, and Google Scholar were searched up to 20th Oct 2023 for RGCS-TCM. The characteristics of included RGCS-TCM were summarized. The methodological quality of included RGCS-TCM were critically appraised.
Results
Thirty published RGCS-TCM and six registered (under development) RGCS-TCM for different types of studies were included. Nine RGCS-TCM did not use a consensus method and lacked a consensus process, and fourteen RGCS-TCM failed to retrieve and use existing relevant evidence and lacked preliminary systematic reviews. Thirteen RGs had a relatively complete research and development process, which met the 3 basic criteria for determining high-quality RGs. Most RGCS-TCM reported the details of 1) rationale of TCM (10/15, 66.7 %), 2) reason for selected certain type of TCM intervention (9/15, 60.0 %), 3) diagnosis of TCM conditions (9/15, 60.0 %), 4) details about the intervention and its controls (13/15, 86.7 %), 5) dynamic changes of Pattern Differentiation and Treatment (2/15, 13.3 %), 6) outcome assessment specifically linked with TCM (8/15, 53.3 %), and 7) potential side effects related to TCM (4/15, 26.7 %).
Conclusion
There are opportunities to rationalise and improve the quality of existing RGCS-TCM and reduce research waste. Further research is indicated to investigate the barriers and facilitators for optimizing the development and application of RGCS-TCM.}

Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a fibrotic interstitial lung disease caused by continuous damage and excessive repair of alveolar epithelial cells, the pathogenesis of which is not fully understood. At present, the incidence of PF has increased significantly around the world. The therapeutic arsenals against PF are relatively limited, with often poor efficacy and many adverse effects. As a conventional and effective therapeutic strategy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely applied in treating lung fibrosis for thousands of years in China. Due to the multi-ingredient, multi-target characteristics, Chinese medicines possess promising clinical benefits for PF treatment.
Aim of this review
This review aims to systematically analyze the clinical efficacy of Chinese medicine on PF, and further summarize the relevant mechanisms of Chinese medicine treating PF in preclinical studies, in order to provide a comprehensive insight into the beneficial effects of Chinese medicines on PF.
Methods
Eight major Chinese and English databases were searched from database inception up to October 2022, and all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of Chinese medicine intervention on effectiveness and safety in the treatment of PF patients were included. Subsequently, preclinical studies related to the treatment of PF in Chinese medicine, including Chinese medicine compounds, Chinese herbal materials and extracts, and Chinese herbal formulas (CHFs) were searched through PubMed and Web of science to summarize the related mechanisms of Chinese medicine against PF.
Results
A total of 56 studies with 4019 patients were included by searching the relevant databases. Total clinical efficacy, pulmonary function, blood gas analysis, lung high resolution CT (HRCT), 6 min walk test (6-MWT), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, clinical symptom scores, TCM syndrome scores and other outcome indicators related to PF were analyzed. Besides, numerous preclinical studies have shown that many Chinese medicine compounds, Chinese herbal materials and extracts, and CHFs play a preventive and therapeutic role in PF by reducing oxidative stress, ameliorating inflammation, inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and myofibroblasts activation, and regulating autophagy and apoptosis.
Conclusion
Chinese medicines show potential as supplements or substitutes for treating PF. And studies on Chinese medicines will provide a new approach to better management of PF.}

Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires and reported using descriptive statistics. Variables included demographic characteristics and awareness of the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Act 2016 (Act 775).
Results
We obtained 440 responses, 186 (42.3%) from men and 254 (57.7%) from women, with ages ranging from 18 to 81 years. The majority of respondents (97.3%) were Malaysian from the non-Malay ethnic group. Almost half (47.5%) of the respondents had a bachelor's degree. The awareness of the traditional and complementary medicine law governing chiropractic was low (4.8%). Binary logistic regression revealed marital status as the only significant predictor of awareness of the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Act, with married individuals showing higher awareness (adjusted odds ratio: 2.77; 95% CI, 1.38-5.58).
Conclusion
For this sample of adults, the awareness of the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Act 2016 governing chiropractic was found to be low.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are leading causes of death and people with cancer are at higher risk of developing CVD than the general population. Many cancer medicines have cardiotoxic effects but the size of the population exposed to these potentially cardiotoxic medicines is not known. We aimed to determine the prevalence of exposure to potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines in Australia.
Methods
We identified potentially cardiotoxic systemic cancer medicines through searching the literature and registered product information documents. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Australians dispensed potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines between 2005 and 2021, calculating age-standardised annual prevalence rates of people alive with exposure to a potentially cardiotoxic medicine during or prior to each year of the study period.
Findings
We identified 108,175 people dispensed at least one potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicine; median age, 64 (IQR: 52–74); 57% female. Overall prevalence increased from 49 (95%CI: 48.7–49.3)/10,000 to 232 (95%CI: 231.4–232.6)/10,000 over the study period; 61 (95%CI: 60.5–61.5)/10,000 to 293 (95%CI: 292.1–293.9)/10,000 for females; and 39 (95%CI: 38.6–39.4)/10,000 to 169 (95%CI: 168.3–169.7)/10,000 for males. People alive five years following first exposure increased from 29 (95%CI: 28.8–29.2)/10,000 to 134 (95%CI: 133.6–134.4)/10,000; and from 22 (95%CI: 21.8–22.2)/10,000 to 76 (95%CI: 75.7–76.3)/10,000 for those alive at least 10 years following first exposure. Most people were exposed to only one potentially cardiotoxic medicine, rates of which increased from 39 (95%CI: 38.7–39.3)/10,000 in 2005 to 131 (95%CI: 130.6–131.4)/10,000 in 2021.
Interpretation
The number of people exposed to efficacious yet potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines in Australia is growing. Our findings can support the development of service planning and create awareness about the magnitude of cancer treatment-related cardiotoxicities.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a rich repository of empirically-developed traditional medicines. The findings call for more rigorous study into the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of TCM remedies to strengthen the evidence base.
Aim of the study
To systematically review the quality of insomnia clinical practice guidelines that involve TCM recommendations and to summarize the certainty of evidence supporting the recommendations, strength, and consistency of recommendations, providing valuable research references for the development of future insomnia guidelines.
Materials and methods
We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Medical Association, Chinese Sleep Research Society, Medsci, Medlive, British National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), and the International Guidelines Collaboration Network (GIN) for clinical practice guidelines on insomnia from inception to March 5, 2023. Four evaluators conducted independent assessments of the quality of the guidelines by employing the AGREE II tool. Subsequently, the guideline recommendations were consolidated and presented as evidence maps.
Results
Thirteen clinical practice guidelines addressing insomnia, encompassing 211 recommendations (consisting of 127 evidence-based and 84 expert consensus recommendations), were deemed eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The evaluation results revealed an overall suboptimal quality, with the “scope and purpose” domain achieving the highest score (58.1%), while the “applicability” domain garnered the lowest score (13.0%). Specifically, it was observed that 74.8% (n = 95) of the evidence-based recommendations were supported by evidence of either very low or low certainty, in contrast to the expert consensus recommendations, which accounted for 61.9% (n = 52). We subsequently synthesized 44 recommendations into four evidence maps, focusing on proprietary Chinese medicines, Chinese medicine prescriptions, acupuncture, and massage, respectively. Notably, Chinese herbal remedies and acupuncture exhibited robust support, substantiated by high-certainty evidence, exemplified by interventions such as Xuefu Zhuyu decoction, spleen decoction, body acupuncture, and ear acupuncture, resulting in solid recommendations. Conversely, proprietary Chinese medicines needed more high-certainty evidence, predominantly yielding weak recommendations. As for other therapies, the level of certainty was predominantly categorized as low or very low. Recommendations about magnetic therapy, bathing, and fumigation relied primarily on expert consensus, needing more substantive clinical research evidence, consequently forming weak recommendations. Hot ironing and acupoint injection recommendations were weakly endorsed, primarily based on observational studies. Furthermore, interventions like qigong, gua sha, and moxibustion displayed a relatively limited number of clinical studies, necessitating further exploration to ascertain their efficacy.
Conclusions
Our analysis revealed a need for substantial improvement in the quality of all the included guidelines related to insomnia. Notably, recommendations for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments predominantly rely on low-certainty evidence. This study represents a pioneering effort in the utilization of recommendation mapping to both present and identify existing gaps in the evidence landscape within TCM therapies, thus setting the stage for future research initiatives. The evidence supporting TCM therapy recommendations must be fortified to achieve a more substantial level of recommendation and higher certainty. Consequently, there exists a critical and pressing demand for high-quality clinical investigations dedicated to TCM, with a specific focus on ascertaining its long-term efficacy, safety, and potential side effects in the context of insomnia treatment. These endeavors are poised to establish a robust scientific foundation to inform the development of TCM therapy recommendations within the insomnia guidelines.}

abstract = {Personalized medicine has witnessed remarkable progress with the emergence of RNA therapy, offering new possibilities for the treatment of various diseases, and in particular in the context of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The ability to target the human genome through RNA manipulation offers great potential not only in the treatment of cardiac pathologies but also in their diagnosis and prevention, notably in cases of hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarctions. While only a few RNA-based treatments have entered clinical trials or obtained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, the growing body of research on this subject is promising. However, the development of RNA therapies faces several challenges that must be overcome. These include the efficient delivery of drugs into cells, the potential for immunogenic responses, and safety. Resolving these obstacles is crucial to advance the development of RNA therapies. This review explores the newest developments in medical studies, treatment plans, and results related to RNA therapies for heart disease. Furthermore, it discusses the exciting possibilities and difficulties in this innovative area of research.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Acute gouty arthritis (AGA) is characterized by a rapid inflammatory reaction caused by the build-up of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the tissues surrounding the joints. This condition often associated with hyperuricemia (HUA), is distinguished by its symptoms of intense pain, active inflammation, and swelling of the joints. Traditional approaches in AGA management often fall short of desired outcomes in clinical settings. However, recent ethnopharmacological investigations have been focusing on the potential of Traditional Herbal Medicine (THM) in various forms, exploring their therapeutic impact and targets in AGA treatment.
Aim of the review
This review briefly summarizes the current potential pharmacological mechanisms of THMs – including active ingredients, extracts, and prescriptions –in the treatment of AGA, and discusses the relevant potential mechanisms and molecular targets in depth. The objective of this study is to offer extensive information and a reference point for the exploration of targeted AGA treatment using THMs.
Materials and methods
This review obtained scientific publications focused on in vitro and in vivo studies of anti-AGA THMs conducted between 2013 and 2023. The literature was collected from various journals and electronic databases, including PubMed, Elsevier, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The retrieval and analysis of relevant articles were guided by keywords such as "acute gouty arthritis and Chinese herbal medicine," "acute gouty arthritis herbal prescription," "acute gouty arthritis and immune cells," "acute gouty arthritis and inflammation," "acute gouty arthritis and NOD-like receptor thermoprotein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3)," "acute gouty arthritis and miRNA," and "acute gouty arthritis and oxidative stress."
Results
We found that AGA has a large number of therapeutic targets, highlighting the effectiveness the potential of THMs in AGA treatment through in vitro and in vivo studies. THMs and their active ingredients can mitigate AGA symptoms through a variety of therapeutic targets, such as influencing macrophage polarization, neutrophils, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and addressing factors like inflammation, NLRP3 inflammasome, signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and miRNA multi-target interactions. The anti-AGA properties of THMs, including their active components and prescriptions, were systematically summarized and categorized based on their respective therapeutic targets.
Conclusion
phenolic, flavonoid, terpenoid and alkaloid compounds in THMs are considered the key ingredients to improve AGA. THMs and their active ingredients achieve enhanced efficacy through interactions with multiple targets, of which NLRP3 is a main therapeutic target. Nonetheless, given the intricate composition of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), additional research is required to unravel the underlying mechanisms and molecular targets through which THMs alleviate AGA.}

abstract = {Background
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and over 95 million people live with alcohol dependence globally. The estimated heritability of AUD is 50–60 %, and multiple genes are thought to contribute to various endophenotypes of the disease. Previous clinical trials support a precision medicine approach using ondansetron (AD04, a 5-HT3 antagonist) by segregating AUD populations by the bio-genetic endophenotype of specific serotonergic genotypes and the bio-psychosocial endophenotype of the severity of drinking or both. By targeting the modulation of biogenetic signaling within the biopsychosocial context of AUD, low-dose AD04 holds promise in reducing alcohol consumption among affected individuals while minimizing adverse effects.
Methods
This was a phase III, 6-month, 25-site, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial using AD04 to treat DSM-V–categorized AUD individuals who were pre-stratified into the endophenotypes of heavy or very heavy drinking individuals and possessed a pre-defined profile of genetic variants related to the serotonin transporter and serotonin-3AB receptor. Participants (N = 303) presented moderate to severe AUD, >80 % were men, mostly in their fifties, and >95 % were of European descent. Low-dose AD04 (approx. 033 mg twice daily) or a matching placebo was administered twice daily for 6 months. Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET [53]) was administered every two weeks to enhance medication compliance and clinic attendance.
Results
There was a significant reduction in the monthly percentage of heavy drinking days, PHDD (-46·7 % (2·7 %), 95 %CI: -52·1 % to -41·2 % vs. -38·1 % (2·9 %), 95 %CI: -43·8 % to -32·5 %, respectively; LS mean difference=-8·5 %; p = 0.03) among AD04-treated vs. placebo-receiving heavy drinking individuals at month 6. Heavy drinking individuals were also less likely to be diagnosed with AUD [Month 1: -32·0 % (2·8 %), 95 %CI: -37·5 % to -26·5 % vs. -23·2 % (2·9 %), 95 %CI: -28·9 to -17·5 %; LS mean difference= -8·8 %; p = 0·026)], and improved on the WHO quality of life BREF scale with a significant effect for at least a 1-level downward shift (OR = 3.4; 95 % CI: 1·03–11·45, p = 0·044). Importantly, heavy drinking individuals, as distinct from very heavy drinking individuals, were the bio-psychosocial endophenotype more predictive of therapeutic response to AD04. AD04 had an exceptional safety and tolerability profile, like the placebo's.
Conclusions
In this Phase 3 clinical trial, AD04 was shown to be a promising treatment for currently drinking heavy drinking individuals with AUD who also possess a specific genotypic profile in the serotonin transporter and serotonin-3AB receptor complex. Using AD04 to reduce the harm of AUD in heavy drinking individuals who are currently drinking, without the necessity of abstinence or detoxification from alcohol use, is an important advance in the field of precision medicine. AD04’s adverse events profile, which was like placebo, should enhance accessibility and acceptance of modern medical treatment for AUD by lowering the incorrect but commonly perceived stigma of personal failure.}

abstract = {Objectives
The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) stemmed from the search of humans for other means of relieving pain and managing diseases which has plagued its existence. CAM use is on the increase among the general population in both the developed and developing nations and also among surgical patients. There is therefore a need to ascertain the perceived adverse effects, the safety perception and the determinants of its use so as to improve the advocacy for adequate regulation.
Methods
It was a cross-sectional study carried out among surgical outpatients in a tertiary hospital. One hundred and fifty patients between the ages of 18 and 85 years were recruited. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from each participant. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 22.
Results
The lifetime prevalence of CAM use among the respondents was 76 % while the point/current prevalence was 37.3 %. The percentage of current users using CAM for surgical complaints was 30.4 %. Biological based therapy accounted for 110 (72 %) of CAM used and unbranded herbal products was responsible for more than two-third of it. Almost a third of the patients (46, 30.7 %) perceived that CAM is safe while 62 (41.3 %) were not sure of its safety. Only 15 (13.2 %) and 6 (5.3 %) have ever recorded side effects and drug interactions respectively. Older age group, income less than 10,000 Naira, positive safety perception and belief about CAM were identified as determinants of CAM usage.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CAM usage among surgical outpatients was quite high and the major determinants of its use are the patient's age, safety perception and their level of income.}

abstract = {The concept of sepsis has recently evolved from one of a ‘systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection’ to a ‘severe, potentially fatal organic dysfunction caused by an inadequate or imbalanced host response to infection’. Organ dysfunction is closely related to sepsis. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most serious outcome of sepsis, often leading to a poor prognosis. However, specific drugs for sepsis and MODS caused by sepsis remain undetermined, and the fatality rate is relatively high. Under the guidance of modern medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained a wealth of experience in the prevention and treatment of sepsis and plays a key role via the effects of its numerous components, pathways and targets. This study used ‘Sepsis’, ‘Organ dysfunction’ and ‘Traditional Chinese medicine’ as strategies for searching the databases of Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, PubMed and The Web of Science. This paper presents an overview of the current status of TCM component formulations for preventing and treating sepsis with MODS to provide a theoretical basis for clinical treatment and drug development.}

abstract = {Objectives
Guidelines and essential medicine lists (EMLs) bear similarities and differences in the process that lead to decisions. Access to essential medicines is central to achieve universal health coverage. The World Health Organization (WHO) EML has guided prioritization of essential medicines globally for nearly 50 years, and national EMLs (NEMLs) exist in over 130 countries. Guideline and EML decisions, at WHO or national levels, are not always coordinated and aligned. We sought to explore challenges, and potential solutions, for decision-making to support trustworthy medicine selection for EMLs from a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) Working Group perspective. We primarily focus on the WHO EML; however, our findings may be applicable to NEML decisions as well.
Study Design and Setting
We identified key challenges in connecting the EML to health guidelines by involving a broad group of stakeholders and assessing case studies including real applications to the WHO EML, South Africa NEML, and a multiple sclerosis guideline connected to a WHO EML application for multiple sclerosis treatments. To address challenges, we utilized the results of a survey and feedback from the stakeholders, and iteratively met as a project group. We drafted a conceptual framework of challenges and potential solutions. We presented a summary of the results for feedback to all attendees of the GRADE Working Group meetings in November 2022 (approximately 120 people) and in May 2023 (approximately 100 people) before finalizing the framework.
Results
We prioritized issues and insights/solutions that addressed the connections between the EML and health guidelines. Our suggested solutions include early planning alignment of guideline groups and EMLs, considering shared participation to strengthen linkage, further clarity on price/cost considerations, and using explicit shared criteria to make guideline and EML decisions. We also provide recommendations to strengthen the connection between WHO EML and NEMLs including through contextualization methods.
Conclusion
This GRADE concept article, jointly developed by key stakeholders from the guidelines and EMLs field, identified key conceptual issues and potential solutions to support the continued advancement of trustworthy EMLs. Adopting structured decision criteria that can be linked to guideline recommendations bears the potential to advance health equity and gaps in availability of essential medicines within and between countries.}

abstract = {Background
Huachansu (HCS), a known Chinese patent drug extracted from the Chinese toad skin, is frequently used for the treatment of various advanced cancers, especially gastric cancer, due to the good therapeutic effect. However, it is rather difficult to clarify the active substances and molecular mechanisms involved owing to the lack of appropriate research strategies. We recently proposed the concept and research ideas of compound-composed Chinese medicine formula.
Purpose
To discover compound-composed Chinese medicine from Huachansu and to explore its mechanism of action in inducing apoptosis of gastric cancer cells.
Method
Network pharmacology combined with serum pharmacochemistry was utilized to screen the predominant active constituents from HCS against gastric cancer. Then, the compound-composed Chinese medicine of HCS (CCMH) was prepared according to their relative contents in serum. The pharmacological effects and potential mechanisms for CCMH were investigated by assays for cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), proteomics, reactive oxygen species (ROS), N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) antagonism, proteasome activity, and western blot.
Results
CCMH was comprised of arenobufagin (11.14%), bufalin (18.67%), bufotalin (7.33%), cinobufagin (16.67%), cinobufotalin (16.74%), gamabufotalin (8.45%), resibufogenin (12.03%), and telocinobufagin (8.97%). CCMH evidently induced proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and MMP collapse in gastric cancer cells, possessing the better activities than HCS. Proteomic analysis showed that CCMH influenced ROS pathway, ubiquitin proteasome system, and PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. CCMH markedly enhanced intracellular ROS levels in gastric cancer cells, which was reversed by NAC. Accordingly, NAC antagonized the apoptosis-inducing effect of CCMH. Significantly decreased proteasome 20S activity by CCMH was observed in gastric cancer cells. CCMH also regulated the expression of key proteins in PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways.
Conclusion
CCMH possesses more significant apoptotic induction effects on gastric cancer cells than HCS, which is achieved primarily through suppression of proteasome activities and increase of ROS levels, followed by regulating PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Network pharmacology combined with serum pharmacochemistry is an effective strategy for discovering compound-composed Chinese medicine from traditional Chinese medicine, which can help clarify the pharmacological substances and mechanisms of action for traditional Chinese medicine.}

This study aimed to determine the effects of traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicines used to treat oral mucositis on nerve conduction.
Methods
The effects of Kampo medicines, crude drugs, and chemical compounds on compound action potentials (CAPs) were analyzed using extracellular recordings in frog sciatic nerves.
Results
Among the Kampo medicines, inchinkoto demonstrated the most significant reduction in CAP amplitude, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.4 mg/mL. Hangeshashinto, shosaikoto, hochuekkito, and juzentaihoto also showed a significant reduction. Regarding inchinkoto, Artemisiae Capillari Spica (artemisia) was the most effective crude drug, with an IC50 of 4.2 mg/mL for CAP amplitude reduction, whereas Gardeniae Fructus (gardenia) exerted no significant effect. However, the combined use of artemisia and gardenia reduced the CAP amplitude more effectively than artemisia alone, indicating a synergistic interaction. The chemical ingredient eugenol from artemisia administered at 1 and 3 mmol/L reduced CAP amplitude, whereas other chemical ingredients administered at 0.1 and 1 mmol/L had no significant effects.
Conclusions
Inchinkoto exhibited the most effective reduction in CAP amplitude in the sciatic nerve of frogs, primarily through the action of artemisia, with potential synergistic interaction between artemisia and gardenia.}

abstract = {Introduction
Person-centred care (PCC) emphasises the need for the health care professional to prioritise individual patient needs, thereby fostering a collaborative and emphatic environment that empowers patients to actively participate in their own care. This article will explore the purpose of PCC in Nuclear Medicine (NM), while discussing strategies that may be used to implement PCC during diagnostic NM examinations performed on adult patients.
Methods
The scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The search was performed on PubMed, Embase and Cinhal in June 2023 and included studies in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. The research equation combined keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms (MeSH) related to person-centred care (PCC), for all types of nuclear medicine diagnostic examinations performed. Three independent review authors screened all abstracts and titles, and all eligible full-text publications were included in this scoping review.
Results
Fifty-three articles, published between 1993 and 2022, met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Seven articles were published in 2015 while 56.6 % of all included studies were performed in Europe. Most studies (n = 39/53) focused on the patients only, with the identified patient benefits being: improve patient experience (67.9 %), increase patient comfort (13.2 %), increase patient knowledge (5.7 %), reduction of patient anxiety (9.4 %) and reduction of waiting/scan time (3.8 %).
Conclusion
The scoping review identified a lack of research investigating the use of person-centred care strategies in NM. Future research will focus on using an international survey to explore this topic in nuclear medicine departments overseas.
Implications for practice
By applying PCC principles, the NM professional can improve the patient care pathway and increase patient satisfaction, leading to enhanced clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {Introduction
Programmed death-ligand 1 expression currently represents the only validated predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibition in metastatic NSCLC in the clinical routine, but it has limited value in distinguishing responses. Assessment of KRAS and TP53 mutations (mut) as surrogate for an immunosupportive tumor microenvironment (TME) might help to close this gap.
Methods
A total of 696 consecutive patients with programmed death-ligand 1–high (≥50%), nonsquamous NSCLC, having received molecular testing within the German National Network Genomic Medicine Lung Cancer between 2017 and 2020, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status less than or equal to 1 and pembrolizumab as first-line palliative treatment, were included into this retrospective cohort analysis. Treatment efficacy and outcome according to KRAS/TP53 status were correlated with TME composition and gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas lung adenocarcinoma cohort.
Results
Proportion of KRASmut and TP53mut was 53% (G12C 25%, non-G12C 28%) and 51%, respectively. In KRASmut patients, TP53 comutations increased response rates (G12C: 69.7% versus 46.5% [TP53mut versus wild-type (wt)], p = 0.004; non-G12C: 55.4% versus 39.5%, p = 0.03), progression-free survival (G12C: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59, p = 0.009, non-G12C: HR = 0.7, p = 0.047), and overall survival (G12C: HR = 0.72, p = 0.16, non-G12C: HR = 0.56, p = 0.002), whereas no differences were observed in KRASwt patients. After a median follow-up of 41 months, G12C/TP53mut patients experienced the longest progression-free survival and overall survival (33.7 and 65.3 mo), which correlated with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte densities in the TME and up-regulation of interferon gamma target genes. Proinflammatory pathways according to TP53 status (mut versus wt) were less enhanced and not different in non-G12C and KRASwt, respectively.
Conclusions
G12C/TP53 comutations identify a subset of patients with a very favorable long-term survival with immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, mediated by highly active interferon gamma signaling in a proinflammatory TME.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
The current version of the Fetal Medicine Foundation competing risks model for preeclampsia prediction has not been previously validated in Brazil.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed (1) to validate the Fetal Medicine Foundation combined algorithm for the prediction of preterm preeclampsia in the Brazilian population and (2) to describe the accuracy and calibration of the Fetal Medicine Foundation algorithm when considering the prophylactic use of aspirin by clinical criteria.
STUDY DESIGN
This was a cohort study, including consecutive singleton pregnancies undergoing preeclampsia screening at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation, examining maternal characteristics, medical history, and biophysical markers between October 2010 and December 2018 in a university hospital in Brazil. Risks were calculated using the 2018 version of the algorithm available on the Fetal Medicine Foundation website, and cases were classified as low or high risk using a cutoff of 1/100 to evaluate predictive performance. Expected and observed cases with preeclampsia according to the Fetal Medicine Foundation–estimated risk range (≥1 in 10; 1 in 11 to 1 in 50; 1 in 51 to 1 in 100; 1 in 101 to 1 in 150; and <1 in 150) were compared. After identifying high-risk pregnant women who used aspirin, the treatment effect of 62% reduction in preterm preeclampsia identified in the Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial was used to evaluate the predictive performance adjusted for the effect of aspirin. The number of potentially unpreventable cases in the group without aspirin use was estimated.
RESULTS
Among 2749 pregnancies, preterm preeclampsia occurred in 84 (3.1%). With a risk cutoff of 1/100, the screen-positive rate was 25.8%. The detection rate was 71.4%, with a false positive rate of 24.4%. The area under the curve was 0.818 (95% confidence interval, 0.773–0.863). In the risk range ≥1/10, there is an agreement between the number of expected cases and the number of observed cases, and in the other ranges, the predicted risk was lower than the observed rates. Accounting for the effect of aspirin resulted in an increase in detection rate and positive predictive values and a slight decrease in the false positive rate. With 27 cases of preterm preeclampsia in the high-risk group without aspirin use, we estimated that 16 of these cases of preterm preeclampsia would have been avoided if this group had received prophylaxis.
CONCLUSION
In a high-prevalence setting, the Fetal Medicine Foundation algorithm can identify women who are more likely to develop preterm preeclampsia. Not accounting for the effect of aspirin underestimates the screening performance.}

Machine learning enables the analysis of large volumes of data to establish complex relationships between “input” and “output” variables. These relationships may be more complex than could be established through traditional statistical analysis and can lead to the ability to predict the “output” with high levels of accuracy. Supervised learning is the most common ML approach for healthcare data and recent studies have developed algorithms to predict patient-specific outcome after surgical procedures such as hip arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Deep learning is a higher-level ML approach that facilitates the processing and interpretation of complex datasets through artificial neural networks that are inspired by the way the human brain processes information. In orthopaedic sports medicine, deep learning has primarily been used for automatic image (computer vision) and text (natural language processing) interpretation. While applications in orthopaedic sports medicine have been increasing exponentially, one significant barrier to widespread adoption of ML remains clinician unfamiliarity with the associated methods and concepts.

abstract = {Introduction
Herbal medication has a long history of use in Sudan for various illnesses. The Corona-19 virus (COVID-19), a disease that affects the respiratory system, is the cause of the most recent global pandemic. Since there is no cure, some individuals in the Sudanese population have chosen to use herbal medication to prevent and treat symptoms of COVID-19. This study aims to assess the use of herbal medications among the Sudanese population in Khartoum for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
Methods
A descriptive, community-based, cross-sectional online survey was conducted on Sudanese adults over the age of 18 from June 2021 to August 2021.
Results
A total of 1012 participants from seven different localities in the state of Khartoum were included. Of the participants, 66.4% were female and 33.6% were male. Among them, 53.8% admitted to using herbal medication to prevent COVID-19. The most commonly used herbal medications for COVID-19 symptoms were Quarad (22.4%), Citrus (20.1%), Ginger (15.7%), and Black seed (11.7%). The majority of participants who contracted COVID-19 believed that herbal medication helped with the symptoms (68.4%), followed by those who thought it might have helped (28.4%). Family and friends were the main sources of knowledge about herbs. A significant association was found between the use of herbal medication and the female gender and middle-aged groups.
Conclusion
Herbal medication was commonly used in Khartoum during the pandemic.Health authorities should consider the effectiveness of herbal medication in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the peer-reviewed orthopaedic sports medicine literature for reference errors within 2 high-impact journals.
Methods
In total, 769 references with 1,082 in-line citations were assessed from 20 randomly selected peer-reviewed articles published in 2 high-impact orthopaedic sports medicine journals, Arthroscopy and the American Journal of Sports Medicine. Full-text copies of references were obtained through online literature subscription databases. Two investigators evaluated each citation for agreement between the reference’s study design, methods, data, discussion, and conclusion with the citing authors’ claims. Error rates, interobserver agreement, and association between error rates and journal demographics were assessed.
Results
Cohen’s κ coefficient representing interobserver agreement was 0.61. The mean citation error rate across 20 articles from 2 orthopaedic sports medicine journals was 6.6%. The most common error was failure to support the authors’ assertions within the citing article, accounting for 32% of errors. There was no significant association between error rate and journal impact factor, number of cited references or total references, ratio of in-line citations to cited references (citation ratio), and number of authors. There was no significant relationship between error rate and journal, study type, and level of evidence.
Conclusions
Inaccurate claims and citations are common within the orthopaedic sports medicine literature, occurring in every reviewed article and 6.6% of all in-line citations. Failure to support the assertions of the article in which a reference is cited is a common error. Authors should take care to rigorously assess references with particular attention to accurate citation of primary sources.
Clinical Relevance
This study highlights the prevalence of citation errors within a random sampling of high-level orthopaedic sports medicine articles. Given science is cumulative, these errors perpetuate inaccuracies and are at odds with evidence-based practice.}

abstract = {Grubs, called Qicao in China, have a long tradition as herbal medicine in East Asia. These larvae belong to the diverse family Scarabaeidae and are typically harvested from the wild during their immature stage based on morphological characteristics. However, rapid and accurate identification becomes challenging when relying solely on external morphological features, as the lack of clarity on biological sources raises safety concerns for clinical applications. The application of DNA metabarcoding provides a solution by enabling the determination of the biological source of a large sample. In the current study, we collected 19 batches of Grubs, consisting of 11,539 individuals, from the market and analyzed their biological composition through metabarcoding. We identified 49 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs), 21 of which were Grubs. The 21 ASVs were classified into seven Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) through species delimitation, which revealed that commercially available Grubs are predominantly sourced from Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis, while species of Rutelinae, Anomala, and Holotrichia were also abundant in some commercial batches. Among the identified ASVs, 28 belonged to non-Grub species and indicated adulteration from different animal families; high abundances of these ASVs were detected for Bombycidae, Tabanidae, and Viviparidae. Our findings underscore the complexity of Grubs' species composition and advocate for a deeper understanding of the wildlife sources contributing to herbal products. This research contributes valuable insights into the molecular identification of Grubs, paving the way for enhanced quality assurance in traditional medicine applications to provide safe and effective medicines for humanity.}

abstract = {Background
Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of acute respiratory failure in many critical diseases and are among the main respiratory diseases with high clinical mortality. The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe ARDS, resulting in a steep rise in the number of patient deaths. Therefore, it is important to explore the pathogenesis of ALI and find effective therapeutic agents. In recent years, thanks to modern biomedical tools, some progress has been made in the application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment principles based on syndromic differentiation and holistic concepts in clinical and experimental studies of ALI. More and more TCM effective components and formulae have been verified to have significant curative effects, which have a certain guiding significance for clinical practice.
Purpose
It is hoped to provide reference for the clinical research of ALI/ARDS and provide theoretical basis and technical support for the scientific application of TCM in respiratory related diseases.
Methods
We performed a literature survey using traditional books of Chinese medicine and online scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and others up to January 2023.
Results
In recent years, thanks to modern biomedical tools, some progress has been made in the application of TCM treatment principles based on syndromic differentiation and holistic concepts in clinical and experimental studies of ALI. This paper mainly reviews the research progress of ALI/ARDS mechanism, the understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis by TCM, and the therapeutic effects of TCM formulae and active ingredients of Chinese medicine. A large number of studies have shown that the effective components and formulae of TCM can prevent or treat ALI/ARDS in vivo and in vitro experiments.
Conclusion
TCM effective components and formulae play an important role in the prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS through multiple approaches and multiple targets, and provide necessary theoretical support for the further development and utilization of TCM resources.}

abstract = {Background
Alkaloids have attracted enduring interest worldwide due to their remarkable therapeutic effects, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties, thus offering a rich source for lead compound design and new drug discovery. However, some of these alkaloids possess intrinsic toxicity. Processing (Paozhi) is a pre-treatment step before the application of herbal medicines in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics, which has been employed for centuries to mitigate the toxicity of alkaloid-rich TCMs.
Purpose
To explore the toxicity phenotypes, chemical basis, mode of action, detoxification processing methods, and underlying mechanisms, we can gain crucial insights into the safe and rational use of these toxic alkaloid-rich herbs. Such insights have the great potential to offer new strategies for drug discovery and development, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions of people.
Methods
Literatures published or early accessed until December 31, 2023, were retrieved from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI. The following keywords, such as “toxicity”, “alkaloid”, “detoxification”, “processing”, “traditional Chinese medicine”, “medicinal plant”, and “plant”, were used in combination or separately for screening.
Results
Toxicity of alkaloids in TCM includes hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and other forms of toxicity, primarily induced by pyrrolizidines, quinolizidines, isoquinolines, indoles, pyridines, terpenoids, and amines. Factors such as whether the toxic-alkaloid enriched part is limited or heat-sensitive, and whether toxic alkaloids are also therapeutic components, are critical for choosing appropriate detoxification processing methods. Mechanisms of alkaloid detoxification includes physical removal, chemical decomposition or transformation, as well as biological modifications.
Conclusion
Through this exploration, we review toxic alkaloids and the mechanisms underlying their toxicity, discuss methods to reduce toxicity, and unravel the intricate mechanisms behind detoxification. These offers insights into the quality control of herbs containing toxic alkaloids, safe and rational use of alkaloid-rich TCMs in clinics, new strategies for drug discovery and development, and ultimately helping improve the quality of life for millions of people.}

abstract = {Background
Frostbite is a medically significant form of tissue injury that can lead to the potential need for amputation or necessitate tissue regeneration. It occurs most frequently at cryogenic temperatures in extreme altitude climbing, winter sports, and military activities. While acupuncture and herbal medicine have been reported to possess tissue regeneration effectiveness, there is currently no clinical evidence supporting their use in treating grade 3 frostbite cases at risk of amputation.
Case presentation
Three patients were diagnosed with grade 3 frostbite based on the extent and severity of tissue damage after alpine climbing in the Himalayas. After an urgent treatment, partial body amputation was advised. In order to seek any complementary treatment options and avoid amputation, they were referred to a frostbite expert in traditional Korean medicine. They received a comprehensive treatment consisting of acupuncture, bloodletting, direct moxibustion, and herbal medicine. All the patients showed notable healing of the damaged tissue, which prevented the need for amputation. No adverse effects or other sequelae were observed.
Conclusion
This case series suggests that complementary medicine, primarily acupuncture and herbal medicine, could be effective for severe frostbite. Further studies with larger sample sizes and control groups are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality for frostbite management.}

The unprecedented number of unfilled emergency medicine post-graduate year 1 (PGY-1) residency positions in the 2023 National Resident Matching Program shocked the emergency medicine community. This study investigates the association between emergency medicine program characteristics and the likelihood of unfilled positions in the 2023 Match.
Methods
This cross-sectional, observational study examined 2023 National Resident Matching Program data, focusing on program type, length, location, size, proximity to other programs, previous American Osteopathic Association (AOA) accreditation, first accreditation year, and emergency department ownership structure. We constructed a generalized linear mixed model with a logistic linking function to determine predictors of unfilled positions.
Results
A total of 554 of 3,010 (18.4%) PGY-1 positions at 131 of 276 (47%) emergency medicine programs went unfilled in the 2023 Match. In our model, predictors included having unfilled positions in the 2022 Match (odds ratio [OR] 48.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.04 to 110.15), smaller program size (less than 8 residents, OR 18.39, 95% CI 3.90 to 86.66; 8 to 10 residents, OR 6.29, 95% CI 1.50 to 26.28; 11 to 13 residents, OR 5.88, 95% CI 1.55 to 22.32), located in the Mid Atlantic (OR 14.03, 95% CI 2.56 to 77.04) area, prior AOA accreditation (OR 10.13, 95% CI 2.82 to 36.36), located in the East North Central (OR 6.94, 95% CI 1.25 to 38.47) area, and corporate ownership structure (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 9.72).
Conclusion
Our study identified 6 characteristics associated with unfilled emergency medicine residency positions in the 2023 Match.

abstract = {Introduction
Human constitution is closely linked to health and disease and serves as a basis for disease diagnosis. In this work, the urinary metabolomics of three basic traditional Mongolian medicine constitution (MMC) types were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques.
Materials and methods
90 volunteers majoring in Mongolian medicine from a university during 2021.1–2023.1 were averagely grouped based on the characteristics of MMC using the Classification and Scoring Scale for Mongolian Medicine Constitution: Khii group, Shar group, and Badgan group. NMR technology was employed to determine the urinary metabolites of subjects in different groups. UHPLC-QTOF-MS technology was applied to identify differential metabolites in urine. Multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were adopted to analyze the impacts of urinary metabolites.
Results
the positive ion mode exhibited higher signal intensity with better separation efficiency. Accuracy of UHPLC-QTOF-MS and NMR in Mongolian urinary metabolites exceeded 99%. PCA demonstrated satisfactory clustering analysis results. Covered metabolic pathways encompassed tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), fatty acid beta-oxidation, as well as protein, nucleic acid, and amino acid metabolisms.
Conclusion
the three basic Mongolian constitutions may involve several small molecular metabolites (SMMs) like bile acids, carnitine, aromatic acids, amino acids, and small molecular carboxylic acids. When clinically diagnosing and treating diseases based on Mongolian constitution, constitutional factors should be considered.}

The search encompassed 41 in vitro studies and 22 clinical studies. CSCs exhibit diverse molecular profiles and unique biomarker expression patterns, offering significant potential for HNSCC diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, thereby enhancing patient survival. Their remarkable self-renewal ability and adaptability are closely linked to tumorigenicity development and maintenance. Assessing biomarkers before and after therapy can aid in identifying various cell types associated with cancer progression and relapse. Screening for CSCs, senescent tumor cells, and cells correlated with the senescence process post-treatment has proven highly beneficial. However, the clinical application of precision medicine in HNSCC management is hindered by the lack of specific and definitive CSC biomarkers. Furthermore, our limited understanding of CSC plasticity, governed by genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic alterations during tumorigenesis, as well as the bidirectional interaction of CSCs with the tumor microenvironment, underscores the need for further research. Well-designed studies involving large patient cohorts are, therefore, essential to establish a standardized protocol and address these unresolved queries.}

Kidney stones (renal calculi), are a common urological problem affecting millions worldwide. Madhuca longifolia (M. longifolia), commonly known as Mahua, has a rich history of medicinal use in various traditional systems, including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This review aims to explore the therapeutic potential of M. longifolia in the management of kidney stones through the lens of TCM.
Methods
Examination of the therapeutic efficacy of M. longifolia in the context of TCM for the treatment of kidney stones was undertaken by performing an exhaustive literature review via internet-based databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Keywords such as "Madhuca longifolia," "Mahua," "kidney stones," "renal calculi," "Pharmacological activity," and "Traditional Chinese Medicine" were used to ensure the inclusivity of relevant literature. Studies published between 1972 and 2019 were considered. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, focusing on the health impacts of plant-based diets. Information on the subspecies and cultivars of common names and the scientific names was verified using the Plant List (www.theplantlist.org) database. We retrieved and utilised it for the review of 80 articles.
Results
The literature review revealed several studies highlighting the potential therapeutic effects of M. longifolia in the management of kidney stones. The bioactive compounds present in M. longifolia, including flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and saponins, exhibit diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and litholytic properties, which contribute to the dissolution and prevention of kidney stones. Furthermore, Madhuca longifolia demonstrates various pharmacognostic activities, reducing the risk of renal damage associated with kidney stone formation.

Focusing on the interplay between behaviours, psychological processes, and biological factors, the field applies behavioural principles to prevent, diagnose, and treat medical conditions. Its key components include application of psychosocial and behavioural paradigms for the analysis of health promotion, disease prevention, and adherence to medical treatment. In public health, behavioural medicine plays a pivotal role by contributing to initiatives promoting healthy behaviours, identifying risk factors, and addressing social determinants of health. Despite its potential to contribute to this field, behavioural medicine has limitations, including the complexity of human behaviour and challenges in sustaining long-term behaviour change. In modern era medicine, focus is on evidence-based practice. In this context, N-of-1 trials, or single-subject trials, introduce a personalized approach to behavioural medicine research. The logic for the focus on individual patients is that ‘each person is unique’. These trials focus on individual patients, systematically implementing and evaluating behavioural interventions over multiple cycles. By randomizing and blinding interventions, collecting repeated measures of outcomes, and prioritizing patient-centred outcomes, N-of-1 trials offer a nuanced understanding of how specific interventions impact individual health. While literature on N-of-1 trials in behavioural medicine is limited, they hold promise in tailoring interventions to individuals, addressing the diverse and dynamic nature of human behaviour in health contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Combinations of Chinese patent medicines (CPM) with antidepressants (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSA)) are frequently utilized for treating depression in adults. However, the efficacy and safety of these combination treatments remain to be established.
Methods
Systematic search was conducted in seven electronic databases, regulatory websites and international registers of trials from 1994 to 2023 that included adult patients with depressive disorders who received CPM combined with antidepressants. The Multiple-Treatment Meta-Analysis (MTMA) was conducted using a random effects model with Stata/MP17 and R4.3.5 software. Primary outcomes were total efficacy rate, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score, and Treatment Emergency Symptom Scale (TESS) score. Secondary outcomes included brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels.
Results
A total of 146 randomized controlled trials (13,754 participants: 6929 in intervention and 6825 in control groups) were included. For total effective rate, Multiple-Treatment Meta-Analysis results showed that the overall effect of combined intervention was better compared with antidepressants alone, where Jieyuanshenkeli (JYASKL) presented the optimal option for improving total efficacy (OR = 5.39, 95% CI [2.60, 11.18], SUCRA = 84.50%). In reduding the HAMD, Shuganjieyujiaonang (SGJYJN) was most likely to reduce the HAMD score (SMD = −2.20, 95% CI [-3.06, −1.33], SUCRA = 86.10%), Jieyuanshenkeli (JYASKL),Tianewangbuxindan (TWBXD), Shuyukeli (SYKL), Anshenbuxinwan (ASBXW) combination intervention did not appear to be statistically superior to antidepressants alone. In theTreatment Emergency Symptom Scale (TESS), Wulinjiaonang induced the most significant reduction in TESS score (SMD = −1.98, 95% CI [-3.59, −0.36], SUCRA = 90.40%). Tianmengjiaonang (TMJN) + Antidepressants(AD) (SUCRA = 88.30%) displayed the highest scores in increasing the levels of BDNF, although not statistically significant compared to Antidepressants(AD) alone (SMD = 1.23, 95% CI [0.90, 1.55]).
Conclusion
Combinations of CPM and antidepressants showed superior efficacy over antidepressants alone. The optimal combinations were determined as Shuganjieyu Jiaonang (SGJYJN)/SSRIs and Jieyuanshenkeli (JYASKL)/SSRIs. In terms of safety, results showed that combination therapy did not show better TESS efficacy than antidepressants alone.Although some of the combination interventions were not superior than antidepressants alone in reducing HAMD scores,our findings provide a potentially significant alternative option for clinical complementary therapy. However, these results require further validation through larger sample sizes, multicenter randomized controlled trials, and real-world data.}

Purpose
Describe our process for returning genetic results to participants in the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine biobank.
Methods
Enrollment in the biobank is open to all adult UCHealth patients. Participants who provided a sample that was genotyped and signed the proper consent were eligible to receive results. Genetic data were generated using a custom genotyping array and confirmed via Sanger sequencing. We employed two models for returning results and conducted interviews with participants to assess satisfaction with our process, follow-up care and family communication.
Results
As of July 2022, 73,313 participants had provided a sample and proper consent. Of these, 10,489 samples were genotyped, 137 (1.3%) had initial results, and 62 were confirmed and eligible for return. We returned results to 51 participants, 33% for cardiac risk, 31% cancer, 15% familial hypercholesterolemia and 21% for other conditions (11 participants refused or did not respond). Less than half of participants had a relevant family history. The majority of participants were glad to receive results and satisfied with our process.
Conclusions
Although array-based genotyping has known limitations that reduce its accuracy, we were able to identify persons with underlying genetic risk who were previously unaware. It is important to establish a process for returning results that follows clinical guidelines, protects participant autonomy, and is amenable to all participants.}

The similarity between the actual and predicted physical fingerprints of all validation samples and test samples was high when using the GRNN models (cosine coefficient > 0.99, Mahalanobis distance < 1.30). Additionally, the simplified GRNN models based on the 40 selected variables of hygroscopicity and angle of repose still showed the ideal predictive capacity.}

abstract = {Objective
The incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) co-morbidity, as well as the number of individuals affected, is on the rise due to their shared molecular and cellular factors. This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets and medicines for comorbid CD and RA.
Methods
We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, Mendelian randomization, and colocalization analysis results from public databases to analyse immune cell subgroups in CD and RA patients and identify candidate therapeutic targets. We further screened potential medicines for the identified candidate targets using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
Results
The proportion of CD8 effector memory T cells (Tem) was consistently elevated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of both CD and RA patients. MYBL1 had a causal effect on the onset of both CD (OR = 1.23; 95 % CI, 1.05–1.45; P = 0.046) and RA (OR = 1.45; 95 % CI, 1.14–1.85; P = 0.04). Four potential therapeutic molecules were retrieved from the CTD database, among which tretinoin (docking score: −6.3 kcal/mol) showed the best potential.
Conclusion
Our comprehensive analysis suggests that CD8 Tem cells are a key cell group in comorbid RA and CD and that MYBL1 has a causal effect. Tretinoin was identified as a potential targeted therapeutic drug, which is of great clinical research value.}

To summarize the characteristics and evaluate the quality of the methodology and evidence within systematic reviews (SRs) of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) in children.
Methods
SRs of randomized controlled trials were searched using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Databases (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), Wanfang, and the SinoMed Database. SRs on the use of CHM alone or in combination with Western medications for MPP in children were included. The study compared the effects of Western medicine alone with those of CHM. The evidence quality using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. The primary indicators were the total effective rate, fever subsidence time, and cough disappearance time. The secondary outcomes were pulmonary rale disappearance time, average hospitalization time, lung X-ray infiltrate disappearance time, immunological indices, and inflammatory cytokine levels.
Results
Twelve relevant SRs were included; 75% (9/12) were assessed as very low quality, and 25% (3/12) were rated as low quality using the AMSTAR 2 criteria. According to the PRISMA 2020 checklist, the average SR score was 20.3 out of a 27 point maximum. In all SRs, CHM demonstrated improvement in symptoms and signs among children with MPP. The evidence quality using the GRADE criteria ranged from “very low” (>50%) to “moderate” (<5%). The most common downgrading factor was imprecision, followed by publication bias and inconsistency.
Conclusion
This overview highlights the limited quality of the methodology and evidence of the included SRs. Although the included studies showed the beneficial effects of CHM on MPP in children, it was difficult to draw firm conclusions owing to methodological flaws.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Medicinal nature is a unique index in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to measure the efficacy of Chinese medicines. Hyperthyroidism, qi-Yin deficiency syndrome in TCM was regarded as the classic heat syndrome category in Chinese medicine. Moreover, it is extensively employed to evaluate the medicinal nature of herbs within the framework of the ‘hot/cold’ nature theory. Ginseng, red and black ginseng (GS, RG, and BG, respectively), and ginseng leaves (GL) are qi-tonifying herbs with different medicinal natures and were just right used to examine the underlying mechanisms between the nature of ginseng medicines and their tonifying effect.
Aim of the study
To examine the different mechanisms between different natures of ginseng medicines and their qi-tonifying action by comparison of their effects on hyperthyroidism and elucidate the nature of BG.
Materials and methods
The hyperthyroidism model was induced through the oral administration of Euthyrox. Steroids belonging to hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axes were determined with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) method. Furthermore, the biochemical indexes associated with energy metabolism, including the serum cyclic nucleotide system and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways were examined. Additionally, the gut microbiota was subjected to 16 S rDNA sequencing, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).
Results
GS, RG, and BG could treat hyperthyroidism rats by regulating the hypothalamus pituitary thyroid (HPT) axis. The RG also had a strong regulatory effect on the HPA and HPG axis. The BG has a regulatory effect on the HPG axis. GL had a strong regulatory effect on HPA, HPG, and HPT axes. GS had the ability to regulate Firmicutes/Bacteroides of the intestinal flora, and GS, RG, and BG ameliorated the decrease of SCFAs induced by hyperthyroidism. According to PCA, BG is similar to GS, indicating a mild-warm nature.
Conclusion
The nature of BG was attributable to mild-warm and the GL with cold nature is best for the treatment of hyperthyroidism based on PCA analysis with all the bio-indices. In addition, the mechanism study indicated that the qi-tonifying effects of ginseng medicines are involved in HPT, HPA, and HPG axes to alleviate hyperthyroidism. In addition, the primary indexes reflected different natures of ginseng medicines are cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), AchE, and substance metabolism associated with Na+-K+-ATPase and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which are potential biomarkers for evaluation on the natures of qi-tonifying medicines.}

abstract = {Introduction
In April 2022, the “Guidance and recommendations on Chinese Medicine Rehabilitation during COVID-19 recovery stage (pilot version)” (the CM Rehabilitation Guidance) was formulated for Hong Kong COVID-19 survivors. However, no consensus regarding traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostic patterns, symptoms, and herbal formulas in the Guidance has been reached among Hong Kong Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs). Thus, this study aimed to establish a consensus among them as a guidance for practice.
Methods
A modified Delphi method was conducted from July 28 to September 14, 2022. Each survey gathered feedback by using a five-point Likert scale and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data were used. The consensus was defined as ≥80 % level of agreement with interquartile range (IQR) ≤1.
Results
A total of 13 CMPs with clinical experience in managing COVID-19 survivors participated in the three-round Delphi survey. A final consensus was reached regarding the following: (1) the diagnostic pattern qi deficiency of the lung and spleen (median = 4; IQR = 0; level of agreement = 92.31 %) with six new suggested symptom items; (2) the diagnostic pattern dual deficiency of qi and yin (median = 4; IQR = 0.5; level of agreement = 100 %) with three new suggested symptom items; and (3) the suggested herbal formulas for these two diagnostic patterns after modification.
Conclusions
Through the three-round Delphi survey, we established a modified CM Rehabilitation Guidance for Hong Kong COVID-19 survivors. The modified Guidance based on the views of Hong Kong CMPs with frontline clinical experience in COVID-19 should be more applicable to current COVID-19 survivors.}

abstract = {Kaiy (medieval cautery) is an ancient method of heat therapy in traditional Persian medicine (TPM). Some of its important applications have been neglected during the medical revolution. Meanwhile, different treatment modalities that incorporate heat, including moxibustion, have progressed in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we reviewed the main TPM textbooks that were written specifically in the field of kaiy. We considered the traditional teachings in the context of contemporary information, gathered from the scientific literature about moxibustion and modern cauterization. Some surgical therapeutic indications of kaiy (e.g., debridement and coagulative procedures) have been advanced by the innovation of electro-cauterization. However, those therapeutic applications that were based on the TPM humoral theory for relieving body coldness or myofascial pains—which are similar to moxibustion usages—have not received the same attention. Apart from the broad similarities of kaiy and moxibustion as thermal therapies with similar indications, there is a striking correspondence between kaiy point mapping and acupoints. Therefore, further research on different kaiy aspects is recommended. Please cite this article as: Jaladat AM, Alizadeh Vaghasloo M, Atarzadeh F, Ayati MH, Kazemi AH, Akin E, Hashempur MH.

This scoping review aims to document Chinese Patent Medicines (CPMs) for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, explore whether CPMs can improve patients’ health outcomes, and set priorities in addressing research gaps in this area.
Methods
Following the framework of PRISMA-SCr, we proposed the research questions based on PICOS principle, and searched the CPMs for T2DM from three drug lists, followed by a systematic search of the literature in eight databases from their inception to June 22, 2023. Then, we developed the eligibility criteria and systematically reviewed the relevant studies, retained the studies about CPMs for T2DM, extracted the related data, and identified the differences across studies in structured charts.
Results
A total of 25 types of CPMs were extracted from the three drug lists. Radix astragali appeared most frequently (19 times) among the herbal medicinal ingredients of CPMs. A total of 449 articles were included in the full-paper analysis ultimately, all of which were about 20 types of CPMs, and there were no related reports on the remaining five CPMs. Except about a quarter (25.39 %, 114/449) using CPMs alone, the remaining studies all involved the combination with oral hypoglycemics for T2DM. Biguanides are the most common drugs used in combination with CPMs (50.14 %, 168/335). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is the most frequently reported outcomes in efficacy evaluation (82.41 %, 370/449).
Conclusion
There are a total of 25 types of CPMs currently available for T2DM patients. However, the volume of related evidence on these CPMs varies. It is necessary to standardize the combined use of CPMs and conventional medicine and select appropriate outcomes in future studies.}

abstract = {Background
When patients feel more involved in their care, there tends to be a higher rate of adherence and improved health outcomes. This can be more difficult to achieve in pediatric care since children have varying levels of medicine comprehension and parents are an integral component of the child's learning.
Objectives
This study aimed to determine the satisfaction of children and families being treated for cancer with their medicine education and determine areas for improvement.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews were conducted over six months (2016/2017) with families and children with cancer, ages 7 to 19 years, (n = 6) and healthcare providers (n = 9) to assess the current method of medicine education delivery.
Results
Families reported increased stress and anxiety levels at the time of diagnosis, negatively impacting their information retention. Patients, families, and healthcare providers reported inconsistent education delivery, including varying amounts of information throughout the treatment and inconsistencies between providers, such as medication names. Parents mentioned a desire for a more consistent and standardized delivery of medicine education, which was found to be helped by a pharmacist-led approach. Receiving supplemental written materials to support verbal education helped with learners' understanding and information retention. Ensuring that the parents are comfortable and familiar with the medicines is a significant component of medicine teaching in pediatric care because they are often responsible for the child's medications and their children see them as a trusted source of information. Ensuring parents' needs are met translates to improved medicine adherence for children with cancer.
Conclusion
Medicine education should occur sometime post-diagnosis once the patient/family has had time to adjust and the anxiety lessens. Medicine education should be given as consistently as possible by a recurring member of the care team, ideally the pharmacist. The learners' ability to understand and retain information should be individually assessed to determine the delivery of medicine education. Motivating and empowering learners, including children, through frequent medicine encounters could help improve adherence, patient health outcomes, and quality of life and make them more self-managing throughout life.}

To evaluate the gender composition of fellows, faculty, and leaders within orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs to provide a more complete description of gender diversity within this subspecialty.
Methods
Official program websites of orthopaedic sports medicine fellowships listed on the Arthroscopy Association of North America fellowship directory were examined. Data collected for analysis included the gender of program directors, fellowship faculty, orthopaedic surgery department faculty, current sports medicine fellows, and fellows who graduated within the last 5 years.
Results
Of the 132 orthopaedic sports medicine fellows in training in the United States in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, 113 (85.6%) were men and 19 (14.4%) were women (P < .001). Within the past 5 years, 419 fellows were listed as completing a sports medicine fellowship, with 375 (89.5%) being men, and 44 (10.5%) being women (P < .001). There was no significant difference in the gender composition of current fellows compared with the composition of fellows within the last 5 years (P = .74). When we examined gender trends in sports medicine faculty, 639 (86.6%) were men and 99 (13.4%) were women (P < .001). There were 14 women (14.4%) orthopaedic sports medicine faculty in leadership positions (i.e., program director or assistant program director) compared with 83 men in such positions (85.6%) (P < .001).
Conclusions
Orthopaedic sports medicine fellowships remain heavily male-dominated on all levels, including fellows, faculty, and leadership. There were no differences in the gender composition of current fellows when compared with those who graduated in the last 5 years, suggesting persistent gender disparity and the need for novel initiatives to enhance gender diversity in sports medicine.

TCM, including single components of natural products, Chinese patent medicines (CPM), and TCM decoction, is expected to treat GU by regulating various mechanisms, such as redox balance, inflammatory factors, angiogenesis, gastric mucosal protective factors, intestinal flora, apoptosis, and autophagy.
Conclusions
We discussed and summarized the mechanism of TCM in the treatment of GU, which provided a sufficient basis for TCM treatment of GU.}

This study aimed to develop a systems medicine framework that can predict and validate drug combinations that can be repurposed for treating COVID-19 and its comorbidities, specifically type 2 diabetes and hypertension. This study found that gut microbes could potentially influence the action of drugs, innate immune response, intestinal dysfunction, and susceptibility to the virus in individuals with these comorbidities. It was also discovered that the spike protein of the virus interacts with 57 human genes, many of which are linked to food-borne bacteria. An analysis of disease enrichment showed that arthritis and hypertension were frequently observed as comorbidities in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs, including Fluvoxamine, Donepezil, and Ifenprodil, have been identified as potentially repurposable drugs for treating COVID-19 in individuals with hypertension. Moreover, nitazoxanide and tocilizumab (antivirals), bacitracin (antibacterial), and gliclazide (antidiabetics) were also identified as potential repurposable drugs. Tocilizumab and gliclazide are effective drug combinations for treating COVID-19 in individuals with type 2 diabetes. A combination of tocilizumab and lidocaine has also been suggested for treating COVID-19 in individuals infected with food-borne bacteria.}

Postbiotics are bioactive compounds produced by beneficial microorganisms during the fermentation of a substrate, while parabiotics are inactivated beneficial microbial cells, either intact or broken. Unlike probiotics, which are live microorganisms, PP are produced from a fermentation process without live cells and show significant advantages in promoting animal health owing to their distinctive stability, safety, and functional diversity. PP have numerous beneficial effects on animal health, such as enhancing growth performance, improving the immune system and microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, aiding ulcer healing, and preventing pathogenic microorganisms from colonizing in the skin. Moreover, PP have been identified as a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics in veterinary medicine due to their ability to improve animal health without the risk of antimicrobial resistance. This review comprehensively explores the current research and applications of PP in veterinary medicine. We aimed to thoroughly examine the mechanisms of action, benefits, and potential applications of PP in various species, emphasizing their use specifically in livestock and poultry.

The EML can also deliver important messages on appropriate medicine use. Since 2017, in response to the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics on the EML have been reviewed and categorized into three groups: Access, Watch, and Reserve, leading to a new categorization called AWaRe. These categories were developed taking into account the impact of different antibiotics and classes on antimicrobial resistance and the implications for their appropriate use. The 2023 AWaRe classification provides empirical guidance on 41 essential antibiotics for over 30 clinical infections targeting both the primary health care and hospital facility setting. A further 257 antibiotics not included on the EML have been allocated an AWaRe group for stewardship and monitoring purposes. This article describes the development of AWaRe, focussing on the clinical evidence base that guided the selection of Access, Watch, or Reserve antibiotics as first and second choices for each infection. The overarching objective was to offer a tool for optimizing the quality of global antibiotic prescribing and reduce inappropriate use by encouraging the use of Access antibiotics (or no antibiotics) where appropriate. This clinical evidence evaluation and subsequent EML recommendations are the basis for the AWaRe antibiotic book and related smartphone applications. By providing guidance on antibiotic prioritization, AWaRe aims to facilitate the revision of national lists of essential medicines, update national prescribing guidelines, and supervise antibiotic use. Adherence to AWaRe would extend the effectiveness of current antibiotics while helping countries expand access to these life-saving medicines for the benefit of current and future patients, health professionals, and the environment.}

The aim of this research is to examine the usage of Complementary and Integrated Medicine (CIM) in individuals with epilepsy and the impact of CIM usage on medication adherence.
Materials and methods
This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted in a university hospital in northern Turkey between July and October 2023, involving 101 individuals with epilepsy (PWE). Descriptive information forms and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-4 (MMS-4) were used as data collection tools. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, and post-hoc LSD analyses were employed for data evaluation.
Results
The participants consisted of 65.3 % males, 25.7 % were not working due to epilepsy, and 61.4 % with generalized epilepsy. The average MMS-4 score was found to be 3.08 ± 0.96. MMS-4 scores showed significant differences based on epilepsy type (F = 3.998, p = 0.021; η2 = 0.07). 76.2 % (n = 21) of the participants who used at least one CIM technique preferred “having a religious person read a prayer.”
Conclusion
Medication adherence in PWE was at a moderate level. Individuals with focal and secondary generalized epilepsy showed better medication adherence compared to those with generalized types. Of those participant who used at least one CIM technique to improve their general health or control seizures, the most common was “having a religious person read a prayer.”}

Chronic diseases are the leading cause of disability and mortality and are responsible for 90% of health care expenditure. The most common chronic diseases are diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease (stroke and vascular cognitive impairment). Modifiable risk factors (MRFs) for these conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, poor diet, and low-physical activity; with hypertension being the most prevalent MRF. Most MRFs can be successfully targeted through lifestyle medicine (LSM), which is a medical specialty that addresses the root causes of chronic diseases through its primary, secondary, and tertiary preventative approaches. Lifestyle medicine comprises 6 pillars (nutrition, physical activity, sleep health, stress reduction, social connections, and substance use) which through various behavioral approaches, focus on regular physical activity, healthy eating, good quality and quantity sleep, and meaningful social connections coupled with the reduction of stress and substance use. This paper will briefly review the evidence and promise of individual LSM pillars in addressing the underlying MRFs of DM, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (specifically stroke and vascular cognitive impairment). Lifestyle medicine holds a great promise for comprehensive and much improved population health. However, the adoption of LSM at the societal scale requires a multifaceted approach and widespread integration would galvanize a paradigm shift to prevent, treat or reverse chronic diseases from the root causes and achieve health equity.}

Cancer patients frequently turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to mitigate the adverse effects of conventional cancer treatments, alleviate stress, manage comorbidities, and address the cancer itself. This systematic review aims to investigate descriptive studies conducted in Iran, focusing on the prevalence and methods of CAM use among cancer patients.
Methods
A thorough search of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Magiran, and the Scientific Information Database (SID) was conducted in both English and Persian from inception to July 2023. Inclusion criteria targeted studies exploring the frequency and patterns of CAM utilization among Iranian patients across diverse cancer types.
Results
A total of 604 articles were found in the preliminary search, and 14 were included in this review. Among the 3,990 participants in the included studies, a weighted average of 51.83% (range 4.6%-100%) had used at least one CAM method. The most commonly used CAM methods were prayer (41.8%), medicinal herbs (30.1%), traditional and folk treatments (27.2%), bloodletting (17.3%), and hydrotherapy (13%). Patients reported using CAM for various reasons, including their beliefs, desire to cure the disease, reduce stress, positive past experiences, and improve physical condition. On average, 39% of patients informed their physicians about their CAM use.
Conclusion
The findings underscore the relatively prevalent adoption of CAM by Iranian cancer patients. Given the low rate of disclosure to physicians, there is a compelling need for healthcare system vigilance and monitoring to ensure comprehensive patient care.}

abstract = {Objectives
Given the widespread use of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) in combination with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) for Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nine CPMs combined with 5-ASA in the treatment of UC.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted in eight databases from inception to May 2023 to identify eligible RCTs evaluating the effects of CPM combined with 5-ASA for the treatment of UC. The methodological quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool in Review Manager 5.4. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was the overall response rate. The secondary outcomes included excellent rate, disease activity index (DAI), IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, mean platelet volume (MPV), fibrinogen (FIB) levels, recurrence rate, and adverse event rate. Network meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 15.0.
Results
In total, 70 RCTs including 5973 patients and 10 treatment regimens were included. The combination of Kangfuxin Liquid (KFL) and 5-ASA showed the greatest efficacy in improving FIB levels and the overall response rate. Bupi Yichang Pill (BYP) combined with 5-ASA was associated with the fewest adverse events and the lowest recurrence rate. Hudi Enteric-coated Capsule (HEC) combined with 5-ASA ranked first in improving DAI. ZhiKang Capsule (ZKC), ChangYanNing Capsule (CYN), and Danshen Injection (DSI) combined with 5-ASA ranked first in improving IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels, respectively. Shenling Baizhu Powder (SBP) combined with 5-ASA was associated with the highest excellent rate.
Conclusions
CPM combined with 5-ASA may be more effective than 5-ASA alone for treating UC. Besides, CPM combined with 5-ASA could better reduce the recurrence rate and adverse event rate in UC patients. The current meta-analysis provides statistical evidence for clinical application.

abstract = {Purpose
To describe the currently available literature reporting clinical outcomes for bioactive and bioinductive implants in sports medicine.
Methods
In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search of 4 databases was completed to identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria were studies using bioactive or bioinductive implants in human clinical studies for sports medicine procedures. Data were extracted and reported in narrative form, along with study characteristics.
Results
In total, 145 studies were included involving 6,043 patients. The majority of included studies were level IV evidence (65.5%), and only 36 included a control group (24.8%). Bioactive materials are defined as any materials that stimulate an advantageous response from the body upon implantation, whereas bioinductive materials provide a favorable environment for a biological response initiated by the host. Bioactivity can speed healing and improve clinical outcome by improving vascularization, osteointegration, osteoinduction, tendon healing, and soft-tissue regeneration or inducing immunosuppression or preventing infection. The most common implants reported were for knee (67.6%, primarily cartilage [most commonly osteochondral defects], anterior cruciate ligament, and meniscus), shoulder (16.6%, primarily rotator cuff), or ankle (11.7%, primarily Achilles repair). The most common type of implant was synthetic (44.1%), followed by autograft (30.3%), xenograft (16.6%), and allograft (9.0%). In total, 69% of implants were standalone treatments and 31% were augmentation.
Conclusions
The existing bioactive and bioinductive implant literature in sports medicine is largely composed of small, low-level-of-evidence studies lacking a control group.
Clinical Relevance
Before bioactive implants can be adapted as a new standard of care, larger, comparative clinical outcome studies with long-term follow-up are essential.}

abstract = {Objectives
Early access to innovative oncology medicine is crucial to provide better treatment alternatives to patients with cancer. However, innovative oncology medicines often come at higher prices, thus limiting the government’s ability for its universal coverage. Hence an alternative paying mechanism is needed. This study is intended to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for innovative oncology medicines among Malaysians.
Methods
A cross-sectional contingent valuation study on 571 Malaysians was conducted to elicit respondents’ WTP value via bidding game approach. A double-bounded dichotomous choice was used in 3 hypothetical scenarios: innovative diabetes medicine, innovative oncology medicine one-off (IOMO), and innovative oncology medicine insurance. Univariate logistic regression was used to determine the factors affecting respondent’s WTP, whereas the mean WTP value and the factors affecting amount to WTP was determined using a parametric 2-part model.
Results
This study received 95% response rate. The mean age of the respondents is 48 years (SD 17) with majority of the respondents female (60.3%) and from ethnic Malay (62%). About 343 (64.7%) of the respondents expressed WTP for IOMO. Those in higher income bracket were willing to pay more for the access of IOMO than the overall WTP mean value (P = .046, coefficient 351.57).
Conclusions
More than half of Malaysian are willing to pay for IOMO at mean value of Malaysian Ringgit 279.10 (US dollar 66.77).

Introduction
Hyperplasia of the mammary gland (HMG) is a proliferative condition triggered by an imbalance in endocrine hormones. Studies have revealed the potential role of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating endocrine disorders. TCM offers the advantages of multitarget regulation, significant therapeutic effects, and fewer side effects. TCM exhibits a liver-soothing function, improving clinical efficacy and relieving symptoms including hyperplasia and pain. Therefore, in this systematic review, we investigated the efficacy and safety of TCM with liver-soothing effects in alleviating HMG.
Methods
Eight databases were searched to obtain randomised controlled trials on the use of ‘TCM with the liver-soothing function’ for ‘hyperplasia of mammary glands.’ The quality of collected studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Data were extracted from good-quality studies using RevMan. Stata 15.0 software was used for meta-analysis.
Results
In total, 24 studies with 2 584 patients were included in this investigation. Among them, 1 312 patients in the intervention group received TCM with liver-soothing function and 1 272 patients in the control group received conventional western medicine or other TCM. TCM with liver-soothing function outperformed the control group in terms of clinical efficacy. Furthermore, TCM with liver-soothing function significantly decreased HMG-associated adverse events, breast pain score, lump score, and other scores.
Conclusions
Traditional Chinese medicine with liver-soothing properties can effectively improve clinical efficacy and prevent adverse reactions in patients with HMG. More rigorous randomised controlled trials are warranted in the future to provide more concrete evidence.}

abstract = {Summary
The development of molecular biomarkers for disease makes it possible for preventative medicine approaches to be considered. Therefore, therapeutics, treatments, or clinical management can be used to delay or prevent disease development. The problem with genetic mutations as biomarkers is the low frequency with genome-wide association studies (GWASs), generally at best a 1% association of the patients with the disease. In contrast, epigenetic alterations have a high-frequency association of greater than 90%–95% of individuals with pathology in epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). A wide variety of human diseases have been shown to have epigenetic biomarkers that are disease specific and that detect pathology susceptibility. This review is focused on the epigenetic biomarkers for disease susceptibility, and it distinct from the large literature on epigenetics of disease etiology or progression. The development of efficient epigenetic biomarkers for disease susceptibility will facilitate a paradigm shift from reactionary medicine to preventative medicine.}

title = {Obesity medicine as a subspecialty and United States certification – A review},
journal = {Obesity Pillars},

author = {Angela Fitch and Deborah B. Horn and Christopher D. Still and Lydia C. Alexander and Sandra Christensen and Nicholas Pennings and Harold Edward Bays},
keywords = {Obesity, Certification},
abstract = {Background
Certification of obesity medicine for physicians in the United States occurs mainly via the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM). Obesity medicine is not recognized as a subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). This review examines the value of specialization, status of current ABOM Diplomates, governing bodies involved in ABMS/AOA Board Certification, and the advantages and disadvantages of an ABMS/AOA recognized obesity medicine subspecialty.
Methods
Data for this review were derived from PubMed and appliable websites. Content was driven by the expertise, insights, and perspectives of the authors.
Results
The existing ABOM obesity medicine certification process has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of Obesity Medicine Diplomates. If ABMS/AOA were to recognize obesity medicine as a subspecialty under an existing ABMS Member Board, then Obesity Medicine would achieve a status like other ABMS recognized subspecialities. However, the transition of ABOM Diplomates to ABMS recognized subspecialists may affect the kinds and the number of physicians having an acknowledged focus on obesity medicine care. Among transition issues to consider include: (1) How many ABMS Member Boards would oversee Obesity Medicine as a subspecialty and which physicians would be eligible? (2) Would current ABOM Diplomates be required to complete an Obesity Medicine Fellowship? If not, then what would be the process for a current ABOM Diplomate to transition to an ABMS-recognized Obesity Medicine subspecialist (i.e., “grandfathering criteria”)? and (3) According to the ABMS, do enough Obesity Medicine Fellowship programs exist to recognize Obesity Medicine as a subspecialty?
Conclusions
Decisions regarding a transition to an ABMS recognized Obesity Medicine Subspecialty versus retention of the current ABOM Diplomate Certification should consider which best facilitates medical access and care to patients with obesity, and which best helps obesity medicine clinicians be recognized for their expertise.}
