abstract = {Summary
Paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that is associated with high rates of mortality and long-term morbidity. Factors that distinguish PARDS from adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) include changes in developmental stage and lung maturation with age, precipitating factors, and comorbidities. No specific treatment is available for PARDS and management is largely supportive, but methods to identify patients who would benefit from specific ventilation strategies or ancillary treatments, such as prone positioning, are needed. Understanding of the clinical and biological heterogeneity of PARDS, and of differences in clinical features and clinical course, pathobiology, response to treatment, and outcomes between PARDS and adult ARDS, will be key to the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies and a precision medicine approach to care. Studies in which clinical, biomarker, and transcriptomic data, as well as informatics, are used to unpack the biological and phenotypic heterogeneity of PARDS, and implementation of methods to better identify patients with PARDS, including methods to rapidly identify subphenotypes and endotypes at the point of care, will drive progress on the path to precision medicine.}

To critically evaluate and summarize the methodological quality of systematic reviews (SRs) and present objective and important outcomes on the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies, including Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), acupuncture, and moxibustion, for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search for SRs in 7 databases until April 16, 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the reviews according to the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), the Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews (ROBIS) tool, and the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to rate the quality of evidence.
Results
IBS-D patients included in 12 reviews were diagnosed in accordance with the Rome criteria, 9 reviews focused on CHM, 2 articles observed moxibustion and heat-sensitive moxibustion, 1 article studied acupuncture and CHM. The outcomes of the SRs were the effectiveness rate, the total effectiveness rate, global symptom improvement, and adverse effects. Based on AMSTAR-2, which measures the quality of methodology, all of the included studies were of low or critically low quality. According to the ROBIS tool, 10 SRs (83.33%) had a high risk of bias. With the PRISMA checklist, only 3 SRs reached over 90% compliance. Based on GRADE, most evidence was of low quality, and there was a moderate quality of evidence that the effectiveness rate of modified-Tongxie Yaofang was superior to Western medicine in the treatment of IBS-D.
Conclusion
Given the suboptimal reporting and methodological quality of existing SRs, more studies are needed to clarify whether TCM therapies are more effective or safe than pharmacological medicine. Future studies should combine evidence-based medicine with TCM research according to the characteristics of TCM.}

abstract = {Introduction
Herbal medicine has been integrated into Thai culture for many centuries. However, studies on using herbal medicine in combination with antidiabetic agents for glycemic control in managing diabetes are limited. Herein, we aimed to assess the use of herbal medicines with different dosages of antidiabetic agents and their association with glycemic control in Thai patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods
This hospital-based study included 739 patients with T2DM who consecutively visited four district hospitals in Thailand. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect patient-specific information, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations and predictors, respectively.
Results
The prevalence of herbal medicine use was 37.5% (n = 264); 70.5% of the patients received information about herbal medicine usage for glycemic control from their relatives and friends, and 21 herbal plants were consumed in combination with their prescribed antidiabetic drugs. The use of herbal medicine was associated with the patients’ educational level (p = 0.001), income (p < 0.001), and duration of diabetes (p < 0.001). Good glycemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%) was associated with the use of bitter gourd in combination with 500 mg/day of the antidiabetic drug metformin (adjusted odds ratio = 8.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.04–66.49, p = 0.046). These patients were 2.92 times more likely to have good glycemic control than those who relied solely on 500 mg/day of metformin (adjusted OR = 2.921, 95% CI = 1.227–6.952, p = 0.015).
Conclusions
The prevalence of herbal plant use was associated with different variables, including age, BMI, T2DM duration, and metformin dosage. Among the 21 herbal plants, the consumption of bitter gourd with 500 mg/day of metformin was associated with good glycemic control.}

abstract = {Summary
The tumor heterogeneity, which leads to individual variations in tumor microenvironments, causes poor prognoses and limits therapeutic response. Emerging technology such as companion diagnostics (CDx) detects biomarkers and monitors therapeutic responses, allowing identification of patients who would benefit most from treatment. However, currently, most US Food and Drug Administration-approved CDx tests are designed to detect biomarkers in vitro and ex vivo, making it difficult to dynamically report variations of targets in vivo. Various medical imaging techniques offer dynamic measurement of tumor heterogeneity and treatment response, complementing CDx tests. Imaging-based companion diagnostics allow for patient stratification for targeted medicines and identification of patient populations benefiting from alternative therapeutic methods. This review summarizes recent developments in molecular imaging for predicting and assessing responses to cancer therapies, as well as the various biomarkers used in imaging-based CDx tests. We hope this review provides informative insights into imaging-based companion diagnostics and advances precision medicine.}

Methods
The scientific support for this CPS is based upon published citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by the Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
Topics in this CPS include the relationship between psychological stress and obesity, including both acute and chronic stress. Additionally, this CPS describes the neurobiological pathways regarding stress and addiction-like eating behavior and explores the relationship between psychiatric disease and obesity, with an overview of psychiatric medications and their potential effects on weight gain and weight reduction.
Conclusions
This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) on stress and psychiatric disease is one of a series of OMA CPSs designed to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of obesity. Knowledge of stress, addiction-like eating behavior, psychiatric disease, and effects of psychiatric medications on body weight may improve the care obesity medicine clinicians provide to their patients with obesity.}

abstract = {Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is a common avian pathogen that mainly infects poultry, causing significant reductions in body weight gain and egg production, along with damage to immune organs and immunosuppression. MG is susceptible to co-infections with other pathogens, leading to increased mortality rates and significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. While antibiotics have been extensively applied worldwide to treat MG infections in poultry production, concerns regarding antibiotic resistance and residue remain prevalent. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), renowned for its natural, safe, and non-toxic properties, has shown significant anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of TCM on production performance and its impact on MG-induced immunosuppression through the MAPK/ERK/JNK signaling pathway in chickens. Our results showed that TCM alleviated the negative effects of MG infection on production performance, as evidenced by improvements in body weight gain, feed conversion rate, survival rate, and immune organ index. TCM exhibited direct inhibition of the MG proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TCM treatment promoted the normalization of trachea and lung tissue structure in MG-infected chickens, leading to a significant reduction in inflammatory damage. Moreover, following the treatment with the TCM, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) decreased significantly, accompanied by the downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes caspase3, caspase9, and BAX, both in vitro and in vivo. A mechanism-based study showed that in vitro and in vivo treatment with the TCM significantly reduced the expression of key proteins, including early growth response gene1 (EGR1), p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-JUN. Altogether, TCM improved body weight gain, inhibited pro-inflammation responses, and alleviated tissue damage by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK/JNK signaling pathway to protect the performance and immune system of MG-infected chickens.}

Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) is a relatively nascent yet rapidly evolving field in low-middle-income countries (LMIC) with an associated increase in scientific publications. The aim of this study is to analyze the characteristics of literature on PCCM research and education published from Pakistan.
Methods
We conducted bibliometric analysis of literature pertaining to PCCM published between January 2010 and December 2021 from Pakistan. A comprehensive search was conducted through Medline, Google Scholar, and PakMediNet (a Pakistani medical repository). The search strategy included the following free text and MeSH terms: “pediatric critical care medicine Pakistan” OR “Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Pakistan” OR “critically ill children Pakistan” OR “critically injured children Pakistan” OR “children Pakistan.” Data was extracted on a structured spreadsheet, and bibliometric analysis was performed. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Common keywords were extracted from bibliographic database files from PubMed and a frequency network was mapped using VOSviewer (version 1.6.18).
Results
The search strategy yielded a total of 7514 papers, out of which 146 articles were identified to meet the inclusion criteria. These were published in 51 journals (13.3 per year). Most of the studies were descriptive and related to clinical profiles and outcomes. Around 73.3% (n = 107) articles were published as original articles, 65.8% (n = 96) of the articles were published in PubMed-indexed journals and one-quarter of the articles 24% (n = 35) were published in locally indexed journals. 69.4% (n = 100) were published from five pediatric intensive care units in Karachi (the largest city) and 56% (n = 81) of the total publications were contributed by a single private sector hospital. The total citation count was 1072, with two articles receiving more than 50 citations. There was a linear trend with some skewing and an annual growth rate of >15%.
Conclusion
PCCM-related publications from Pakistan showed positive linear growth. Most publications were descriptive clinical studies with a paucity of multicenter studies, RCTs, and high-impact publications.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional and complementary medicines (T&CMs) are not typically covered in medical curricula despite 80% of the world's population using some form of herbal product as part of their healthcare. Concurrent use of T&CMs with conventional therapies is common, and both are primarily accessed in pharmacies. There is an expectation that pharmacists should be knowledgeable about T&CMs. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate what is currently known about pharmacists' T&CMs education and training to inform developments in pharmacy education.
Methods
Eligible studies published between 01/01/2016 and 28/02/2023 were identified across six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and MEDLINE). Data were extracted from included studies and categorized into key themes and sub-themes and reported descriptively.
Findings
Fifty-eight studies were identified, conducted across 30 countries, that included information about pharmacists’ T&CMs education and training. Within the four main themes extracted, six subthemes were identified including: T&CMs education and training received; inadequate education and training opportunities; knowledge, and confidence towards T&CMs in the pharmacy setting; professional practice behaviour associated with T&CM; university education for pharmacy students; and continuing professional development for practicing pharmacists, including T&CM-drug interactions, interpreting T&CM research, T&CM-specific communication skills, T&CM use in pregnancy and breastfeeding, and efficacy and safety of T&CM in specific conditions.
Conclusion
Overall pharmacists are receiving limited T&CM education in undergraduate and continuing professional training and report a lack of resources to inform the advice they provide to consumers. The findings of this review can inform developments in T&CMs curriculum and accreditation standards that support the training needs of pharmacists who play a role in fostering the safe and appropriate use of these products.}

Due to its origin, blood’s clinical use is associated with various risks that may cause adverse reactions and events. Progress in quality and safety of blood components has eliminated numerous risks, especially those of infectious origin. However, some risks cannot be predicted, while others cannot always be prevented. Globalisation and climate change constantly favour the spread of infectious agents. Against this, epidemiology plays a central role in ensuring the safety of transfusion treatment, by continuous surveillance and timely identification of risks, and in the development of routine and additional tests as measures for risk mitigation. As a quantitative discipline based on research methods, epidemiology is a method of reasoning; it relies on the generation and testing of hypotheses; it utilises other scientific resources, particularly in the field of blood donation and blood transfusion, thus having many applications. The main focus falls on transfusion-transmissible infections, and on environmental or occupational diseases, injuries, disabilities and death causes at large. The practice of epidemiology relies on a systematic approach and measurement of disease frequencies. Surveillance is a key element, involving continuously gathering, analysing, and evaluating data regarding diseases, morbidity and mortality, and disseminating the conclusions of the analyses to relevant competent authorities; in this way, action is taken for disease prevention and control. Surveillance systems also provide an important tool for risk assessment, a method to assess and characterise the critical parameters in the functionality of equipment, systems or processes of using scientific data in order to estimate the magnitude of any health effect that derives from decisions of policy makers. Epidemiological surveillance, particularly for the incidence of adverse reactions and adverse events associated with blood transfusion at the national and international levels, has demonstrated the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation between blood and public health services.}

abstract = {Objective
There is a significant lack of ophthalmologists who self-identify as underrepresented in medicine (URiM) in the physician workforce. Prior literature has revealed bias in traditional metrics for selection relied on by resident programs such as United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores, letters of recommendation (LOR), and induction into medical honors societies such as Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA). The purpose of this study was to elucidate race-based differences in word usage within ophthalmology residency letters of recommendation that may disproportionately affect URiM applicants.
Design
This was a retrospective, cohort study.
Setting
This was a multicenter study across the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins, the University of California San Francisco, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Participants
San Francisco (SF) Match applications submitted to three ophthalmology residency programs between 2018 and 2020 were reviewed. URiM status, USMLE Step 1 score, and AOA membership were recorded. Letters of recommendation were analyzed using text analysis software. T-tests and chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Frequency of word/summary term usage in letters of recommendation were the main outcome measures.
Results
Relative to non-URiM applicants, URiM applicants had lower USMLE Step 1 scores (mean difference=7.0; p<0.001). Non-URiM letters of recommendation were more likely to describe applicants as “dependable” (p=0.009) and highlight “research” (p=0.046). URiM letters were more likely to describe applicants as “warm” (p=0.02) and “caring” (p=0.02).
Conclusions
This study identified potential barriers for URiM ophthalmology residency applicants which can help guide future interventions to increase workforce diversity.}

abstract = {Background
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the early stage of dementia, requires effective intervention for symptom management and improving patients’ quality of life (QoL). Jujadokseo-hwan (JDH) is a Korean herbal medicine prescription used to improve MCI symptoms, such as memory deficit. This study evaluates the improvement in QoL through JDH. Alongside a clinical trial, it estimates the cost-effectiveness of JDH, compared to placebo, for MCI over 24 weeks.
Methods
Changes in QoL were measured using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Korean version QoL-Alzheimer's Disease (KQOL-AD). Direct medical and non-medical costs were surveyed and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per QALY for JDH were produced.
Results
In total, 64 patients were included in the economic evaluation (n = 35 in JDH, n = 29 in placebo). In the JDH group, EQ-5D and KQOL-AD improved by 0.020 (p = .318) and 3.40 (p = .011) over 24 weeks, respectively. In the placebo group, they increased by 0.001 (p=.920) and 1.07 (p=.130), respectively. The ICER was KRW 76,400,000 per QALY and KRW 108,000 per KQOL-AD for JDH, compared to the placebo group.
Conclusion
JDH is not considered a cost-effective treatment option compared with placebo; however, it positively affects QoL improvement in patients with MCI.}

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in connective tissue disease (CTD). Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential for informing treatment decisions and prognosis in this setting. Clear guidance on CTD-ILD screening, however, is lacking.
Objective
To establish recommendations for CTD-ILD screening based on the current evidence.
Method
Following an extensive literature research and evaluation of articles selected for their recency and relevance to the characterization, screening, and management of CTD-ILD, an expert panel formed by six pulmonologists from the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology, six rheumatologists from the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology, and six radiologists from the Portuguese Society of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine participated in a multidisciplinary discussion to produce a joint statement on screening recommendations for ILD in CTD.
Results
The expert panel achieved consensus on when and how to screen for ILD in patients with systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren syndrome, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and systemic lupus erythematous.
Conclusions
Despite the lack of data on screening for CTD-ILD, an expert panel of pulmonologists, rheumatologists and radiologists agreed on a series of screening recommendations to support decision-making and enable early diagnosis of ILD to ultimately improve outcomes and prognosis in patients with CTD.}

abstract = {Background
Vasopressor medications raise blood pressure through vasoconstriction and are essential in reversing the hypotension seen in many critically ill patients. Previously, vasopressor administration was largely limited to continuous infusions through central venous access.
Objectives of the Review
This review addresses the clinical use of vasopressors in various shock states, including practical considerations and innovations in vasopressor administration. The focus is on the clinical administration of vasopressors across a range of shock states, including hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock.
Discussion
Criteria for starting vasopressors are not clearly defined, though early use may be beneficial. A number of physiologic factors affect the body's response to vasopressors, such as acidosis and adrenal insufficiency. Peripheral and push-dose administration of vasopressors are becoming more common. Distributive shock is characterized by inappropriate vasodilation and vasopressors play a crucial role in maintaining adequate blood pressure. The use of vasopressors is more controversial in hypovolemic shock, as the preferred treatment is correction of the volume deficit. Evidence for vasopressors is limited in cardiogenic shock. For obstructive shock, vasopressors can temporize a patient's blood pressure until definitive therapy can reverse the underlying cause.
Conclusion
Across the categories of shock states, norepinephrine has wide applicability and is a reasonable first-line agent for shock of uncertain etiology. Keeping a broad differential when hypotension is refractory to vasopressors may help to identify adjunctive treatments in physiologic states that impair vasopressor effectiveness. Peripheral administration of vasopressors is safe and facilitates early administration, which may help to improve outcomes in some shock states.}

The prevalence of CAM use among populations with diabetes worldwide varies widely, depending on the country or geographic region. In the general population, some of the characteristics that are associated with CAM use are; gender, race, age and education. In addition other predictors of CAM use include poor perceived health status and the presence of multiple health complaints. Besides, diabetes has been discovered to be an independent predictor of CAM use in the general population and in individuals with diabetes. The primary aim of this study was to assess utilisation of complementary and alternative medicine among patients with diabetes at Mzuzu Central Hospital in Malawi.
Methods
A descriptive cross sectional quantitative study was conducted among 385 clients with diabetes seeking care at Mzuzu Central Hospital who were diagnosed with diabetes for at least one month prior to conducting this study. Participants were recruited through simple random sampling technique. Data was collected using a structured interviewer administered questionnaire. A chi-square test was performed to establish the association between CAM use and socio-demographic factors. Bivariate and multivariate (controlling for socio-demographic factors) logistic regression was done to find predictors of CAM in diabetes. The p-value was set at 0.05 with 95 % CI.
Results
The study found that 54 % of the participants used CAM in managing their condition with the point prevalence of 151 per 1000 patients; however, cumulative prevalence was estimated at 538 per 1000 patients. Age, educational level, occupation, duration of diabetes, no health insurance, family history of CAM use and cultural or religious beliefs were factors influencing use of CAM.
Conclusion
The study findings confirm use of CAM among clients with diabetes at Mzuzu Central Hospital in Malawi.}

Presently, organ transplant recipients must undergo lifelong immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection, while autoimmune disorders lack definitive cures. In the last years, there has been notable advancement in comprehending the biology of both antigen-specific and polyclonal Tregs. Clinical trials involving Tregs have demonstrated their safety and effectiveness. To maximize the efficacy of Treg immunotherapy, it is essential for these cells to migrate to specific target tissues, maintain stability within local organs, bolster their suppressive capabilities, and ensure their intended function's longevity. In pursuit of these goals, the utilization of biomaterials emerges as an attractive supportive strategy for Treg immunotherapy in addressing these challenges. As a result, the prospect of employing biomaterial-enhanced Treg immunotherapy holds tremendous promise as a treatment option for organ transplant recipients and individuals grappling with autoimmune diseases in the near future. This paper introduces strategies based on biomaterial-assisted Treg immunotherapy to enhance transplant medicine and autoimmune treatments.}

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are the most common diagnoses in gastroenterology and represent a group of chronic unexplained gut syndromes. The best-known disorders are irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD). Jawarish Shahi (JS) is used for gastrointestinal disorders in Unani Medicine (UM). Aims of the study: The present review aims to evaluate the FD and IBS in Unani medicine and scientific evidence for the safety and efficacy of JS and its herbal ingredients in the management of FD and IBS.
Material and methods
Sources of data are from the classical literature of UM, Canon of medicine, Khazainul Advia, Indian Medicinal Plants-An Illustrated Dictionary. Databases, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, were explored for related studies.
Results
An updated review on the concept of FGIDs in Unani medicine, its pathophysiology, and management is presented. Comprehensive information on JS and its traditional and ethnopharmacological clinical attributes, standardization and toxicity study, biomedical studies of herbs in JS for their efficacies in FD and IBS are presented.
Conclusions
The outcome of the work clearly indicates that disease conditions similar to FD and IBS and their successful treatment are described in Unani Medicine. JS has been used for disease conditions similar to FD and IBS by the physicians of the medieval period. The herbs in JS are widely researched for pharmacologically active substances and were reported for antioxidant, immunomodulatory, gastroprotective, antispasmodic, analgesic, antidiarrheal, antisecretory, laxative, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and antidepressant properties. Nevertheless, further explorations, particularly well-designed clinical trials are required for efficacy.}

It has been speculated that infertile women use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) frequently in addition to conventional therapy. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine use by Iranian infertile women.
Design
This multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted in four public and private referral infertility clinics located in different metropolitan areas of Iran including Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan and Shiraz from August to December 2019. Any infertile woman attending an infertility clinic was checked for eligibility and 282 infertile women were selected by convenience sampling. A self-structured questionnaire consisted of three parts of demographic, infertility-related and CAM-related data was administered. This was completed on a self-report basis. SPSS-IBM 25 was used for data analysis using descriptive statistical methods and Logistic regression models.
Results
The mean number of different CAM methods used was 2.95 ± 1.88. Also, 49.61% of women used CAM at least once for infertility in the last year. CAM use included Iranian traditional medicine (ITM), Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and other CAM methods. The most commonly used method and mode of CAM were ITM (95. 4%) and Iranian herbal medicine (70.2%), respectively. Most of participants (61. 3%) did not disclose their use of CAM to the physicians. The majority of participants (72. 7%) received recommendations from family and friends for CAM use.
Conclusions
CAM use was prevalent among Iranian infertile women and ITM as well as herbal medicines were the most common. Therefore, it is required that a coherent plan be developed to integrate CAM use into the allopathic medicine.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-derived organoids (PDO) are promising tumor avatars that could enable ex vivo drug tests to personalize patients’ treatment in the frame of functional precision oncology (FPM). Yet, clinical evidence remain scarce. This study aims to evaluate whether PDO can be implemented in clinical practice to benefit patients with advanced refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Methods
During 2021-2022, 87 patients were prospectively enrolled in an IRB-approved protocol. Inclusion criteria were: histologically-confirmed PDAC, tumor site accessible. A panel of 25 approved antitumor therapies (chemogram) was tested and compared to patient responses to assess PDO predictive values and map the drug sensitivity landscape in PDAC.
Results
Fifty-four PDOs were generated from 87 pretreated patients (take-on rate 62%). The main PDO mutations were KRAS (96%), TP53 (88%) and CDKN2A/B (22%), with 91% concordance rate with their tumor of origin. The mean turnaround-time to chemogram was 6.8 weeks. In 91% of cases, ≥1 hit was identified (gemcitabine (n=20/54), docetaxel (n=18/54) and vinorelbine (n=17/54) with a median of 3 hits/patient [range:0-12]). Our cohort included 34 evaluable patients with full clinical follow-up. We report a chemogram sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 92.9%. The overall-response rate and progression-free survival were higher when patients received a “hit” treatment as compared to patients that received a “non-hit” drug (as part of routine management). Finally, we leveraged our PDO collection as a platform for drug validation and combo identification. We tested the anti-KRASG12D (MRTX1133), alone or combined, and identified a specific synergy with anti-EGFR therapies in KRASG12D variants.
Conclusion
We report the largest prospective study aiming at implementing PDO-based FPM and identify very robust predictive values in this clinical setting. In a clinically relevant turnaround-time, we identify putative hits for 91% of patients, providing unexpected potential survival benefits in this very aggressive indication. While this remains to be confirmed in interventional precision oncology trials, PDO collection already provide powerful opportunities for drugs and combinatorial treatment development.}

abstract = {Equitable and sustainable access to medicines is a global challenge, including for high-income countries. Over the last two decades, launch prices of new medicines have considerably increased, making some medicines unaffordable for many countries. This article is based on a presentation held by the author at the IQWiG Autumn Symposium in November 2021. The medicine price situation in European countries and beyond is presented informed by international evidence. Medicine prices vary across countries, and for some therapeutic groups (e.g., cancer drugs) medicines are largely unaffordable and/or unsustainable for most countries. Selected policy options to improve affordability, which are commonly applied and considered as potential solutions, are discussed. The article stresses the importance of price regulation, and of transparency of prices and further components across the pharmaceutical value chain. Many governments opted for concluding managed-entry agreements (e.g., pay-for-performance) with confidential discounts to make new medicines with high price tags affordable and/or to manage uncertainty about their performance. However, this policy is linked to limitations, particularly due to its secrecy of discounts. Patent expiry of biological medicines can contribute to affordable access; however, it is important to strategically exploit the biosimilar potential by implementing a mix of appropriate policies to foster competition and enhance the uptake of biosimilar medicines.
Zusammenfassung
Regierungen, einschließlich jene in wohlhabenden Ländern, stehen vor der Herausforderung, fairen und nachhaltigen Zugang zu Arzneimitteln zu schaffen. Im Laufe der letzten beiden Jahrzehnte kamen Medikamente mit immer höheren Preisen auf den Markt, die sich viele Staaten nicht leisten können. Der vorliegende Beitrag basiert auf einer Präsentation der Autorin bei der IQWiG-Herbsttagung im November 2021. Grundlegende Muster bei Arzneimittelpreisen in den europäischen Ländern und global werden auf Basis internationaler Evidenz skizziert: Die Medikamentenpreise sind je nach Land unterschiedlich, und in einigen Indikationen (z.B. Onkologika) sind sie für zahlreiche Länder nicht leistbar bzw. gefährden die Nachhaltigkeit der Solidarsysteme. Der Beitrag beleuchtet ausgewählte Politikmaßnahmen, die zu leistbaren Arzneimittelpreisen beitragen sollen – sowohl solche, die von zahlreichen Ländern angewendet werden, als auch Ideen im Diskussionsstadium. Die Bedeutung von Preisregulierung und Transparenz – von Preisen wie auch von weiteren arzneimittelsystemrelevanten Komponenten – wird dargelegt. Um hochpreisige Arzneimittel leistbar zu machen und/oder mit der Unsicherheit über ihre Wirkung besser umzugehen, haben viele Staaten sogenannte Managed Entry Agreements (z.B. Pay for Performance) mit den pharmazeutischen Unternehmern abgeschlossen, die jedoch wegen der dabei vereinbarten Vertraulichkeit der Rabatte problematisch sind. Patentabläufe von Biologika tragen zur Leistbarkeit von Medikamenten bei, allerdings ist dabei wichtig, mit einem guten Mix an adäquaten Maßnahmen Wettbewerb und Nachfrage nach den Biosimilar-Medikamenten zu fördern.}

abstract = {As research on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has expanded, our understanding of the role it can have in controlling the immune system has increased. Polysaccharides from medicinal plants exhibit numerous beneficial therapeutic properties, presumably owing to their modulation of innate immunity and macrophage function. Numerous studies have demonstrated the multiple ways whereby certain polysaccharides can affect the immune system. In addition to stimulating immune cells, such as T cells, B lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells, polysaccharides stimulate complements and increase cytokine secretion. The biological functions of polysaccharides are directly correlated with their structures. This paper summarizes the sources, TCM uses, extraction and purification methods, structural characterization, in vitro and in vivo immune activities, and underlying molecular mechanisms of TCM root polysaccharides. Moreover, the structure–activity relationships of TCM root polysaccharides are emphasized and discussed. This review can provide a scientific basis for the research and industrial utilization of TCM root polysaccharides.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Natural products, particularly medicinal plants, have been utilized in traditional medicine for millennia to treat various diseases. The genus Balanophora (Balanophoraceae) consists of 23 accepted species. These species are the most controversial flowering plants, with highly reduced morphologies and are found parasitizing on the roots of their host. They have been used in traditional medicine as a remedy for stomach pain, detumescence, uterine prolapse, wounds, syphilis, gonorrhea, treating injuries from falls, and other conditions. However, there is no review of this genus on its traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology.
Aim
The present narrative review discusses the scientific data supporting the traditional uses of Balanophora species. The available information on its botanical properties, traditional uses, chemical contents, pharmacological activities, and toxicity was summarized to help comprehend current research and offer a foundation for future research.
Materials and methods
The materials used in combining data on the genus Balanophora comprises online sources such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for Chinese-related materials. World Flora online was used in validating the scientific names of this genus while ChemBio Draw Ultra Version 22.2 software was employed in drawing the phytochemical compounds.
Results
Nine Balanophora species including B. harlandii, B. japonica, B. polyandra, B. fungosa, B. fungosa subsp. indica, B. laxiflora, B. abbreviata, B. tobiracola, and B. involucrata have been documented as vital sources of traditional medicines in different parts of Asia. A total of 159 secondary metabolites have been isolated and identified from the ten species of this genus comprising tannins, flavonoids, sterols, lignans, chalcones, terpenes, and phenylpropanoids. Among these compounds, tannins, lignans, terpenoids, chalcones and phenolic acids contribute to the pharmacological activities of the species in this genus with several biological activities both in vitro and in vivo such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, hypoglycemic activity, cytotoxicity, anti-microbial, melanin synthesis etc.
Conclusion
This review summarizes the available literature on the traditional uses, pharmacological properties, and phytoconstituents of Balanophora species indicating that they contain fascinating chemical compounds with diverse biological activities. The traditional uses of the species in this genus have been confirmed by scientific data such as antimicrobial, hemostatic effect, gastroprotective activity and others. However, many species in this genus are yet unknown in terms of their botanical uses, chemical composition and biological activities. Thus, more research into the scientific connections between traditional medicinal uses and pharmacological activities, mode of action of the isolated bioactive constituents, and toxicity of other Balanophora species is needed to determine their efficacy and therapeutic potential for safe clinical application.}

1. Define primary palliative care and its role in emergency medicine. 2. Explain the components of a multi-level, complex palliative care intervention.
Key Message
A multi-level, complex primary palliative care intervention in 18 emergency departments did not decrease acute care utilization in older adults at high risk for short-term mortality.
Importance
Palliative care interventions in the Emergency Department (ED) capture high-risk patients at a time of crisis and can dramatically improve patient-centered outcomes.
Objective(s)
To test the impact of primary palliative care education, training, and technical support for emergency medicine (PRIM-ER) on ED disposition, healthcare utilization, and survival in older adults with serious, life-limiting illness.
Scientific Methods Utilized
PRIM-ER was a cluster-randomized stepped wedge designed to administer interventions aimed at improving providers’ palliative care practices across 29 EDs in the United States. Our study used Medicare claim records accessed through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse. Patients were included if they were aged 66 and older, visited one of our 29 EDs between May 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022, had 12 months of prior inpatient, outpatient, and carrier claims with a Gagne Index > 6 representing a >30% risk of mortality. We used summary statistics and a generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the effect of our primary outcome, the patient's ED disposition to an acute care setting (Yes/No) in the 6 months following their initial ED visit.
Results
We identified 98,922 initial visits with 52% occurring during the baseline period and 48% in the intervention period. Mean age was 78 (SD 8.4), 50% of patients were female, 78% were White and the average Gagne score was 9.0 (SD 2.2). 63% of the patients had an inpatient admission during the baseline period and 62% in in the intervention period. After adjusting for naturally occurring changes over time, there was no difference between acute care admission in the intervention period (OR 0.94, CI: 0.84 - 1.05) compared to the baseline period.
Conclusion(s)
A multi-level, complex primary palliative care intervention in 18 emergency departments did not decrease acute care utilization in older adults at high risk for short-term mortality.
Impact
Unlike the strong evidence base for specialty palliative care, a primary palliative care intervention in the emergency department did not demonstrate an impact on healthcare utilization in older adults at high risk for short-term mortality.

As the NHS long-term plan leans towards a focus on preventive health and streamlining budgets, using SEM physicians in promoting exercise medicine as part of the holistic treatment of patients, and in creating active hospitals, to encourage people to move more and reduce ‘pyjama paralysis’, can be a way for NHS Trusts to achieve these goals. SEM physicians would improve the healthcare burden of musculoskeletal conditions on public services. These physicians are trained in musculoskeletal medicine, exercise medicine, sports and team care. They can be a great asset to primary or secondary care settings, treating sport and physical activity-related injuries or conditions, as well as promoting physical activity for staff and patients alike. Many patients end up with complex musculoskeletal injuries that inevitably cause a reduction in physical activity levels, and seeing an SEM physician can prevent this happening. They can translate the lessons learned from elite sport and use this to treat the general population. This article focuses on key topics in which an SEM can be used, from concussion to overuse injuries.}

Tibetan medicine Qi-Sai-Er-Sang-Dang-Song Decoction(QSD, ཆུ་སེར་སེང་ལྡེང་སུམ་ཐང་།)is a traditional Tibetan medical formulation with demonstrated clinical benefits in atopic dermatitis (AD). However, its potential mechanism and molecular targets remain to be elucidated.
Aim of the study
This study aims to explore the activity and mechanism of QSD on AD in multiple dimensions by combining in vitro and in vivo experiments with network pharmacology.
Materials and methods
The AD effect of QSD was investigated by evaluating the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW264.7 cells. AD-like skin lesions in female BALB/c mice were induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). QSD or dexamethasone (positive control) were gavagely administered daily for 15 consecutive days. The body weight and skin lesion severity were recorded throughout the study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB) analysis were used to illuminate the molecular targets associated with the anti-AD effects of QSD. Meanwhile, the ingredients of QSD in the blood were revealed and analyzed by Ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) method. Network pharmacology was used to predict the targets and mechanism of active ingredient therapy for AD. In addition, the network pharmacology outcomes were further verified by molecular docking.
Result
After treatment with QSD, the levels of NO and IL-6 were decreased in the cell supernatant. Herein, QSD markedly decreased the eosinophil and mast cells infiltration in the dorsal skin of the 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Moreover, QSD reconstructed the epidermal barrier by increasing the content of collagen fibers and changing the arrangement of DNCB-treated mice. QSD not only inhibited the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) but also inhibited phosphorylation of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins in the dorsal skin. Four active ingredients were identified through UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, including (−)-epicatechin, kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, cassiaside, and questin. After the network pharmacological analysis, six core targets of QSD closely related to AD were obtained, including TNF-α, IL-6, Caspase-3 (CASP3), Epidermal growth factor (EGFR), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), and Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1 (NTRK1). Meanwhile, through Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway occupies an important position in the QSD treatment of AD. The molecular docking results showed that the six core targets are stable in binding to the four active ingredients as indicated by the molecular docking results.
Conclusions
The anti-AD effect of QSD might be related to the reconstruction of the epidermal barrier and inhibition of inflammation, which regulated the MAPK pathway. Hence, it provided a promising idea for the study of Tibetan medicine prescriptions for the treatment of AD.}

Currently, researchers mainly employ various statistical correlation analytical methods to investigate metabolome-microbiome correlations. However, these conventional correlation techniques often focus on statistical correlations and their biological meanings are always ignored, especially the functional relevance between them. Here, we developed a novel enzyme-based functional correlation (EBFC) algorithm to further improve the interpretability and the identified scope of microbe-metabolite correlations based on the conventional Spearman’s analysis. The proposed EBFC algorithm is successfully utilized to reveal the therapeutic mechanisms of Jian-Pi-Yi-Shen (JPYS) formula on the treatment of adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats. JPYS, a TCM formula for treating CKD, has beneficial clinical effects. We tentatively revealed the potential mechanism of JPYS for treating CKD rats from the perspective of the serum metabolome, gut microbiome, and their interactions. Specifically, 11 metabolites and 19 bacterial genera in the CKD rats were significantly regulated to approaching normal status after JPYS treatment, suggesting that JPYS could ameliorate the pathological symptoms of CKD rats by reshaping the disturbed metabolome and gut microbiota. Further correlation analysis between the significantly perturbed metabolites, microbiota, and the related enzymes provided more strong evidence for the study of host metabolism-microbiota interactions and the therapeutic mechanism of JPYS on CKD rats. In conclusion, these findings will help us to deeply understand the pathogenesis of CKD and provide new insights into the therapeutic mechanism of JPYS.}

Phytomedicines, also known as improved traditional medicines (ITMs), are increasingly used in the management of diseases throughout the world. While quality control widely known to be an essential tool that can ensure the efficacy and safety of health products, most ITMs lack appropriate analytical methods for their control. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable analytical method for the quality control of ITMs commonly used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R. Congo). For this purpose the method needs to be validated and transferred.
Objectives
The objective of this research was to develop, transfer, and validate an affordable, rapid and easily implementable analytical method by HPLC-DAD for the quality control of herbal medicines marketed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Also, to determine these drugs fingerprint and their stability under accelerated conditions.
Methods
Chromatographic separation was achieved using two chromatographic columns, an XBridge C18 (250 × 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 μm particle size) and an XBridge C18 (100 × 4.6 mm i.d.; 3.5 μm particle size), column maintained at 30 °C. The mobile phase consisted of a gradient mixture of mobile phases A (acetonitrile) and B (aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid 0.05%) pumped at 1.0 mL/min. UV detection was performed at 280 nm. The method using the short column was validated using the total extracts as references. The strategy of total error was used to decide on the reliability of the method taking into account the acceptance limits fixed at ± 10%.
Results
The validation results show that the developed HPLC-DAD method presented an adequate trueness, linearity, precision and accuracy. Two extra peaks found in the finish products did not interfere with phytomarkers, thus confirming the selectivity of the developed method as appropriate chromatographic profiles. The method was successfully used to determine the content of the phytomarkers in six ITMs. Furthermore, we could notice that the ITMs submitted to the accelerated degradation studies remained chemically stable over six months of harsh treatments.
Conclusion
A generic method of analysis of herbal medicines was developed using HPLC-DAD, and subsequently validated before being applied in a stability study of these drugs. The proposed method holds the promise of providing a new tool for quality product development in the field of traditional herbal medicines.}

However, large pooled international studies are not available. This study investigates the current representation of women in the internal medicine workforce internationally and identifies specialties in which underrepresentation is evident. Peer-reviewed studies, government reports, and medical association reports were used to determine proportions of specialists and doctors training in internal medical specialties and in comparator surgical specialties. Data were available from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, the United States, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A total of 380,263 doctors were studied, including 268,822 practicing specialist physicians (also known as attendings or consultants) and 53,226 doctors in internal medicine specialty training programs (also known as residents, fellows, advanced trainees, or specialist registrar trainees). Among practicing physician specialists, the rate of representation of women was 35% (95,195/268,822, p <0.001). Among trainees, the rate of representation of women was 43% (22,728/53,226, p <0.001). Among physician specialties evaluated, cardiology (15%, 4,152 of 27,328), gastroenterology (20%, 3,765 of 18,893), and respiratory/critical care (24%, 5,255 of 21,870) had the lowest representations of women compared with men (p <0.001 for all). Cardiology and particularly the subspecialty of interventional cardiology were clear outliers as the internal medicine specialties with the lowest representation of women at practicing specialist and trainee levels. In conclusion, this study is the largest international study of women in internal medicine specialties. It found that cardiology, gastroenterology, and respiratory/critical care specialties have the most substantial underrepresentation of women. These data are a global call to action to establish more successful strategies to provide a diverse and representative cardiology workforce.}

To investigate the historical process of the foundation of oral medicine (stomatology) and oral pathology international societies/associations around the globe, their geographical distribution and what is their contribution to the prevention, diagnosis, and management of oral diseases.
Study design
This review was conducted in accordance with the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group guidance and the reporting follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).
Results
The search strategy was applied to 5 databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS)) and grey literature (Google Scholar, Open Grey and ProQuest). Additional sources, such as organizations' websites, were also retrieved for assessment.
Conclusions
The birth and growth of oral medicine and oral pathology are still unclear due to the paucity of well-documented historical evidence. Despite pioneer associations were founded in the first half of the 20th century, most of them were only created in the 2000s. These societies are currently heterogeneously distributed in America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania.}

Professionalized training courses have started up and bio-medical doctors and nurses are the largest group of trainees enrolled in various programs. They are also the largest group of service providers cum trainers in the formal and private healthcare system. Based on a qualitative study approach, this study conducted face-to-face interviews with a questionnaire among trainees and practitioner cum trainers at the Ateneo de Manila University, the SMIC Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the St. Luke Medical Center- Quezon City, and the St. Luke Medical Center-Global City. This study finds that biomedical doctors and nurses from various ethnic groups have switched to practice acupuncture not only because of their fascination with Chinese medicine but also to respond to the market demand. Their entry is driven by a range of factors including, but not limited to: financial incentives, the limitations of biomedicine and the advantages of acupuncture, family tradition, and the idea of holism that is attached to Chinese medicine. The advantages to becoming an acupuncturist appear to be professional, economic and personal despite the challenges regarding the social and political circumstances. This paper concludes that biomedical professionals are in control of Chinese medicine specialties, which are being professionalized in the Philippines, and are making the industry a private multicultural and urban middle-class phenomenon, thus fulfilling the demand created by the market economy.}

Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) are an important source to discover new anti-infectious drugs. Neuraminidases (NAs) not only play a key role on human health, but also are promising targets for anti-infectious drugs. Arnebia euchroma which is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine with the effect of cooling blood and detoxifying showed potential inhibitory activities on both bacterial NA and virus NA, suggesting that the material basis of A. euchroma deserves in-depth study.
Aim of the study
To investigate the anti-infectious constituents of A. euchroma based on NA inhibition.
Material and methods
A HPLC-DAD system incorporated an auto-sampler was used for micro-fractionation. A nanoliter liquid handler and a high sensitive multimode plate reader system were used for high throughput NA inhibition screening. Thus a high-resolution NA inhibition profiling platform was constructed. The structures of potential active components in A. euchroma obtained by the high-resolution bioassay profiling were identified by DAD and MS in parallel. Then, a target and rapid isolation of NAIs from A. euchroma was achieved under the guidance of the spectrum-effect relationship obtained above. Finally, the isolated compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods and their bioactivities were validated by in vitro assay and molecular docking.
Results
16 potential active ingredients in A. euchroma were isolated and identified, including a new mero-monoterpenoid. The in vitro bioassay results revealed that 12 out of the 16 isolated compounds showed potent inhibitory activities on bacterial NA (IC50s = 1–6 μM) and five of them exhibited potent anti-microbial activities on methicillin-resistant Staphylococccus aureus (MRSA) with MICs in the range of 0.5–4 μg/mL. Furthermore, some isolated compounds showed equal or even better inhibitory activities on oseltamivir resistant viral NA than oseltamivir sensitive NA. The mechanism study in silicon revealed that these natural compounds possessed absolutely different binding modes on the bacterial and viral NAs.
Conclusions
Our study gave a clear spectrum-effect relationship of A. euchroma, providing a scientific evidence for future study of the multi-components synergistic effect of TCMs.}

The samples were extracted by methanol, and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chromatographic separation was achieved on stationary phase Supelco R100–10 C18 ODS (5 µm × 250 × 4.6 mm) using methanol:water (60:40 v/v) as mobile phase (pH was adjusted to 4.5 with ortho-phosphoric acid) at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min with a detection wavelength of 242 nm. The developed procedure was successfully applied to spiked plasma and herbal medicines samples. The LODs were 0.2, 0.02, 0.02, 0.06, 0.144 µg/ml, while LOQ were 0.6, 0.06, 0.07, 0.192 and 0.438 µg/ml for testosterone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone and betamethasone, respectively. The developed method was validated according to ICH guidelines. The regression coefficients of the analytes were 0.999 for standard solutions while for spiked plasma samples these were from 0.998 to 0.999. The proposed method is the first one for the simultaneous evaluation of the mentioned steroids. The method is simple, sensitive, and inexpensive that can be used for the studied steroids in dosage forms and body fluids.}

Importantly, five TCM formulas/Chinese patent drugs/herbs/ingredients with the highest Jaccard similarity scores to the submitted drugs are offered in ETCM v2.0, which may be of significance to identify prescriptions/herbs/ingredients with similar clinical efficacy, to summarize the rules of prescription use, and to find alternative drugs for endangered Chinese medicinal materials. Moreover, ETCM v2.0 provides an enhanced JavaScript-based network visualization tool for creating, modifying and exploring multi-scale biological networks. ETCM v2.0 may be a major data warehouse for the quality marker identification of TCMs, the TCM-derived drug discovery and repurposing, and the pharmacological mechanism investigation of TCMs against various human diseases.}

One of the difficulties of analysing the relationship between attitudes to CAM and attitudes towards vaccines rests in the complexity of both. Which form of CAM endorsement is associated with what type of reticence towards vaccines? While the literature on the relationship between CAM and attitudes towards vaccines is growing, this question has not yet been explored. In this study we present the results of a survey conducted in July 2021 among a representative sample of the French mainland adult population (n = 3087). Using cluster analysis, we identified five profiles of CAM attitudes and found that even among the most pro-CAM group, very few respondents disagreed with the idea that CAM should only be used as a complement to conventional medicine. We then compared these CAM attitudes to vaccine attitudes. Attitudes to CAM had a distinct impact as well as a combined effect on attitudes to different vaccines and vaccines in general. However, we also found a) that attitudes to CAM provide a very limited explanation of vaccine hesitancy and b) that, among the hesitant, pro-CAM attitudes are often combined with other traits associated with vaccine hesitancy such as distrust of health agencies, radical political preferences and low income. Indeed, we found that both CAM endorsement and vaccine hesitancy are more prevalent among the socially disadvantaged. Drawing on these results, we argue that, to better understand the relationship between CAM and vaccine hesitancy, it is necessary to look at how both can reflect lack of access and recourse to mainstream medicine and distrust of public institutions.}

There are growing number of pathway programs, with an early assurance of admission, that target undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in medicine (URiM) to enable their competitiveness for and matriculation to medical school, including the Penn Access Summer Scholars (PASS) program. The psychological and emotional experiences of students in these programs, however, have not been previously described.
Methods
Students from the summer 2021 cohort of the PASS program were interviewed using a structured set of questions that explored four specific areas: (i) the application process; (ii) the benefits and value of being in the PASS program; (iii) the emotional and psychological challenges and stresses of being in the PASS program; (iv) feelings and emotions about not taking the MCAT or having to interview at multiple schools. The transcribed, de-identified interviews were then subjected to a qualitative analysis.
Results
Students in PASS reported that the program was valuable to them in that it reduced the stress of the pre-medical process; relieved worry and anxiety surrounding the MCAT; enabled development of supportive relationships and provided meaningful exposures to the medical profession and biomedical research. Despite this, students reported feelings of imposterism, guilt, and fear of disappointing, along with varying degrees of regret over not taking the MCAT and not interviewing at more than one medical school.
Conclusions
URiM and other marginalized students participating in early assurance admissions programs likely enter medical school with a range of positive and negative emotions as a result of their participation in these programs. These data can be used to inform the development of programing and other initiatives that further support the transition and success of these students in medical school.}

Innovative Medicines Canada has said that companies are delaying the introduction of new drugs into Canada in anticipation of changes in how the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board determines prices for patented medicine. This study investigates whether this claim is accurate.
Methods
Delays in seeking approval for and marketing of new drugs were examined using linear regression analysis and comparing the time between approvals by Health Canada and approvals of the same drugs by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Linear regression was also used to examine changes in the percent of drugs approved by the FDA and also approved by Health Canada and whether fewer drugs approved by Health Canada were being marketed. Approvals in Australia served as a control.
Results
There was no change in the difference in approval times between Health Canada and the FDA (p = 0.7073). Time between approval of new drugs and when they were marketed increased (p = 0.0002). Health Canada approved a smaller percent of drugs approved by the FDA (p = 0.0019) but the same trend was found in Australia. Fewer drugs approved in Canada were marketed (p = 0.0288).
Conclusion
There is mixed evidence about whether drug companies are delaying or simply not introducing new drugs into Canada.}

Although limitedly explored, White blood cell (WBC) scan might have a role in case of acute pancreatitis, especially for the imaging of pancreatic leukocyte infiltration and the prediction of pancreatic necrosis. Scientific literature on 18F-FDG-PET/CT in HB acute disease mainly consists of case reports or case series, describing incidental findings in oncological PET/CT scans. In patients with obstructive jaundice, PET/CT has been proposed to disclose and characterize occult tumoral etiology. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the various NM approaches in HB acute settings, particularly with respect to the emerging new technologies (eg, PET/MRI) and radiopharmaceuticals.}

abstract = {This review outlines the historical perspective, status, and future challenges of oral medicine (stomatology) in Brazil based on the records of the Brazilian Society of Stomatology and Oral Pathology (SOBEP) and the Brazilian Federal Dental Council as well as expert evidence input from academic leaders from 3 different generations of Brazilian oral medicine specialists. The beginning of oral medicine in Brazil dates to 1969, followed by the organization of SOBEP in 1974; however, official recognition as an independent specialty was achieved more recently within the Brazilian Federal Dental Council in 1992. After a 50-year maturation period of oral medicine in Brazil in terms of specialty crystallization across dentistry, medicine, and research, it is now time to follow the historical trends of the specialty internationally and establish a standard curriculum at a post-graduate level that will lead to uniformity of training for oral medicine in Brazil.}

abstract = {Background
The first COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Thailand began in April 2020, with healthcare workers receiving two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac). However, the emergence of the delta and omicron variants raised concerns about vaccine effectiveness. The Thai Ministry of Public Health provided the first booster dose (third dose) and second booster dose (fourth dose) of the mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) for healthcare workers. This study investigated the immunity and adverse reactions elicited by a heterologous second booster dose of BNT162b2 after a two-dose CoronaVac vaccination for COVID-19 in healthcare workers of the Faculty of Medicine, Naresuan University.
Methods
IgG titres against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein were measured four and 24 weeks after the second booster dose of BNT162b2 in the study participants. Adverse reactions were recorded during the first three days, four weeks and 24 weeks after the second booster dose of BNT162b2.
Results
IgG against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein was positive (>10 U/ml) in 246 of 247 participants (99.6 %) at both four and 24 weeks after the second booster dose of BNT162b2. The median specific IgG titres at four and 24 weeks after the second booster dose of BNT162b2 were 299 U/ml (min: 2, max: 29,161) and 104 U/ml (min: 1, max: 17,920), respectively. The median IgG level declined significantly 24 weeks after the second booster dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Of the 247 participants, 179 (72.5 %) experienced adverse reactions in the first three days after the second booster dose of BNT162b2. Myalgia, fever, headache, injection site pain and fatigue were the most common adverse reactions.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated that a heterologous second booster dose of BNT162b2 after two doses of CoronaVac induced elevated IgG against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein and caused minor adverse reactions in healthcare workers of the Faculty of Medicine, Naresuan University. This study was registered as Thailand Clinical Trials No. TCTR20221112001.}

Optimization of injectability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, and controlled drug release are also features of such scaffolds. The 3D shape of the scaffold can control cell interaction and improve cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Exosomes (EXOs) are nanovesicles that can regulate osteoblast activity and proliferation using a complex composition of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids in their vesicles. Due to their excellent biocompatibility and efficient cellular internalization, EXOs have enormous potential as desirable drug/gene delivery vectors in the field of regenerative medicine. They can cross the biological barrier with minimal immunogenicity and side effects. Scaffolds that contain EXOs have been studied extensively in both basic and preclinical settings for the regeneration and repair of both hard (bone, cartilage) and soft (skin, heart, liver, kidney) tissue. Cell motility, proliferation, phenotype, and maturation can all be controlled by EXOs. The angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of EXOs significantly influence tissue healing. The current study focused on the use of EXO-loaded scaffolds in hard tissue regeneration.}

abstract = {Objectives
While early abortion is well within the scope of family medicine, it is not routinely taught in family medicine residency programs (FMRPs). We surveyed FMRP directors nationally to learn more about variations in reproductive health training.
Methods
Our survey questions were part of a larger online survey conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA), fielded to directors of all known US FMRPs in Fall 2022. Analysis examined descriptive statistics and included chi-square tests to assess whether differences among programs and program directors were significantly related to the abortion training available. Binary logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis.
Results
The overall response rate was 42% (286/678). Of programs in the sample, 19% offered routine training and 58% offered elective training in medication abortion, and 10% and 52% offered elective and routine training in procedural abortion, respectively. In the multivariate model, lower state abortion restrictiveness levels, larger program size, non-Catholic affiliation, and belief of the program director about abortion training were significantly associated with routine abortion training. Fifty-three programs (30% of those with any abortion training) allowed abortion provision in the continuity clinic or other family medicine setting.
Conclusions
Among responding FMRPs, 19% offered at least one type of routine abortion training. While training availability has increased since similar research was conducted in 2011, most training is elective, and is still grossly inadequate to prepare family physicians to meet their patients’ full reproductive health needs, especially in the face of the current crisis in abortion access in the US.}

abstract = {Background
Acupuncture treatments frequently use manipulation techniques. The therapeutic advantages of acupuncture differ depending on the acupuncture manipulation. The purpose of this article was to compare manipulation techniques in traditional East Asian medicine (TEAM) and Western medical acupuncture (WMA).
Methods
Manipulation techniques in TEAM and WMA were compared according to purpose, modulating parameters, and indications. The practical understanding of manipulation in terms of acupuncture stimulation intensity was also explored. The TEAM manipulation techniques of twirling and lifting and thrusting are discussed in terms of the objectives of tonification and sedation.
Results
The main therapeutic effect of WMA is mediated through activation of the nervous system, which is achieved with adequate intensity of needling. The TEAM tonification and sedation techniques were designed to produce mild or intense stimulation, respectively, to elicit varying degrees of deqi sensation.
Conclusions
Further research is needed to clarify the differences between the TEAM and WMA practices, and to determine whether different needling manipulations affect treatment outcomes.}

keywords = {Education, Emergency medicine, Residency training, Climate change},
abstract = {Background
Climate change affects hospital operations and the conditions and rates at which people seek treatment. Emergency physicians are relied upon to treat climate-related conditions and meet surges in demand. Educators have called for integrated education on climate change to better prepare physicians. However, the attitudes of United States (US) emergency medicine (EM) residency educators on climate change in the curriculum remains unknown.
Methods
An initial pilot survey was developed and validated to assess US EM program directors’ attitudes towards the inclusion of sustainability and climate change in resident education. Likert scales were analyzed as a psychometric response to specific domains of residency directors’ attitudes towards climate change and sustainability importance and their inclusion in EM residency training. Concordance of Likert scores for questions on sustainability versus climate change were compared via Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Scores were compared across demographics, geographic location, political affiliation and self-reported knowledge of sustainability and climate change with one-way ANOVA analyses.
Results
Seventy-five survey responses were received, with greatest representation from the Northeast and Great Plains/Midwest. Most participant's self-identified political leanings were liberal (43%). Respondents indicated that most programs do not include climate change education (90.3%). The median level of agreement with “climate change is an important issue for EM physicians” on the 9-point Likert scale was 6 (IQR= 1, 8) and for sustainability was 7 (IQR = 6, 9). The median level of agreement for “climate change should be included in EM curriculum” was 3 (IQR = 1, 6) and for sustainability was 6 (IQR = 5, 8). Responses were statistically different across political leanings and gender.
Conclusion
While most program directors sampled believe that climate change and sustainability are important to EM, agreement with the importance of the inclusion of climate change in EM curricula was lower. Currently, climate change is not discussed in the majority of EM training programs across the United States. While low response rates limited generalizability, hypotheses were generated including potential differences in receptivity by educator age and gender.}

Scientists from around the world are working to develop an alternative solution to the problem of drug resistance by exploring complementary and alternative medicines that may be obtained from natural sources. Hence, the review aims to comprehensively report the information on the natural treatments and therapy used to manage DFU. All of the information described in the current study was gathered from electronic scientific resources, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Springer Link. Findings from the current review revealed the pre-clinical and clinical utility of 18 medicinal plants, 1 isolated compound, 7 polyherbal formulations including herbal creams, a few micronutrients including vitamins and minerals, insect products such as propolis, honey and, Maggot debridement therapy for the treatment and management of DFU. Natural therapies possess better efficacy, low cost, and shorter duration of treatment when compared with the conventional treatments; hence, all information made available about them is crucial to alter the direction of treatment. Furthermore, the data presented in this review are up to date on the potential efficacy of natural complementary medicines for alleviating DFU problems in in vitro and in vivo tests, as well as clinical studies.}

The recommendations by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine are as follows: (1) we suggest that fetal paralytic agents be considered in the setting of intrauterine transfusion, if needed, for the purpose of decreasing fetal movement (GRADE 2C); (2) although the fetus is unable to experience pain at the gestational age when procedures are typically performed, we suggest that opioid analgesia should be administered to the fetus during invasive fetal surgical procedures to attenuate acute autonomic responses that may be deleterious, avoid long-term consequences of nociception and physiological stress on the fetus, and decrease fetal movement to enable the safe execution of procedures (GRADE 2C); and (3) due to maternal risk and a lack of evidence supporting benefit to the fetus, we recommend against the administration of fetal analgesia at the time of pregnancy termination (GRADE 1C).}

This article is an attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of theriac in Unani literature, as well as to elaborate on the potential mode of actions.
Methods
Selected authoritative and comprehensive textbooks of Unani medicine and leading scientific websites (MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, and PubMed Central) were explored for information regarding the theriac in Unani classical literature, and its potential usefulness in the present era. No time duration was specified for the search as certain drugs are now relatively obsolete. The keywords used for the search were ‘theriac’, ‘health’, ‘bioactive constituents’, ‘infection’, and ‘antidote’, etc., accompanied by names of drugs.
Results
Pharmacological researches on theriac ingredients have revealed the presence of several bioactive compounds, having anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antipyretic, antivenin, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, cytotoxic, etc. activities.‎ An interesting step in theriac preparation is the process of maturation. It is scientifically proven that during maturation, the drugs undergo biotransformation through fermentation. Besides, certain drugs like Saffron, Celery, and Fennel, etc. increase bioavailability of other drugs. Overall, the Theriac formulations are a complex mixture of health-preservative, protective, therapeutic and restorative drugs.
Conclusions
The theriac formulations contain a thoughtful mixture of ingredients, which have health-protective as well as restorative effects. It is known that most toxins as well as biological disease-causing agents damage the vital organs and processes which lead to complications and death. Hence, the theriac formulations can provide the much-needed protection to these organs, and also maintain the physiological processes, and gives the body the necessary time and strength to recover from these adverse effects.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the multimorbidity burden of clinical trial participants and assess its association with treatment response.
Methods
We conducted a reanalysis of patient level data. There were 29,954 participants from 8 clinical trials containing 11 comparisons between an intervention and control condition. Patients were classified by Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score. The primary outcomes were the primary study endpoints as originally specified for each trial. A Cox model that included the CCI score groups, the randomized group, and their interaction, was used to compare the primary outcome between randomized groups. The interaction term between randomized group and comorbidity index allowed the treatment effect to differ by level of comorbidity index and comprised the primary effect of interest. Hazard ratios and risk differences were reported for all comparisons.
Results
The mean CCI scores of trial populations ranged from 2.1 to 3.9 points, and the percentage of patients with scores ≥5 from 3% to 39%. Tests of interaction terms in models yielded P values ≤ .10 for 4/11 comparisons and ≤ .05 for 2/11 comparisons. In 3 additional comparisons, potentially important treatment variation on an absolute scale was observed despite interaction tests with P values > .10 on the relative scale.
Conclusions
These trials were mainly composed of patient populations with CCI scores ≤4. Despite this, biologically plausible treatment interactions were commonly suggested. These results are hypothesis generating; confirmation of results would require larger studies or studies targeted specifically toward patients with higher levels of multimorbidity.}

abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from all cells in the body, forming an important intercellular communication network that contributes to health and disease. The contents of EVs are cell source-specific, inducing distinct signaling responses in recipient cells. The specificity of EVs and their accumulation in fluid spaces that are accessible for liquid biopsies make them highly attractive as potential biomarkers and therapies for disease. The duality of EVs as favorable (therapeutic) or unfavorable (pathological) messengers is context dependent and remains to be fully determined in homeostasis and various disease states. This review describes the use of EVs as biomarkers, drug delivery vehicles, and regenerative therapeutics, highlighting examples involving viral infections, cancer, and neurological diseases. There is growing interest to provide personalized therapy based on individual patient and disease characteristics. Increasing evidence suggests that EV biomarkers and therapeutic approaches are ideal for personalized medicine due to the diversity and multifunctionality of EVs.}

However, there are many challenges in assessing and managing HF in elderly patients, who often have coexisting multimorbidity, frailty, and malnutrition. Therefore, it is often difficult to solve these problems with Western medicine alone, and a holistic approach, including Kampo medicine, can be helpful. In particular, managing volume control and frailty by adding Kampo formulas may help improve health-related quality of life and substantially impact prognosis in HF. This review article summarizes the role of Kampo medicine for older patients with HF and frailty.}

They also continued to investigate the (three) stages of sleep and paid attention to different breathing patterns, in addition to pulse, during each stage. Finally, they also applied the pneumatic paradigm in new ways to understand the broader impact of certain medical conditions on sleep.}

Several key differences exist in the clinical guidelines between the 2 organizations. With regard to the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine considers any elevation in bile acids above the upper limit of normal in the setting of maternal pruritus diagnostic of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, whereas the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists requires a pregnancy-specific elevated bile acid level of ≥19 mmol/L for diagnosis. Regarding the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends ursodeoxycholic acid as the first-line treatment of maternal symptoms. In contrast, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists specifically recommends against the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy because of a lack of evidence regarding both maternal and fetal benefit. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends fetal surveillance at a gestational age when abnormal fetal testing would result in delivery being performed, whereas the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists does not recommend any fetal testing beyond fetal kick count assessment. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends delivery at 36 to 39 weeks’ gestation for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy with bile acids <100 mmol/L and delivery at 36 weeks for bile acid levels >100 mmol/L. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends serial assessment of bile acids with delivery timing stratified between 35- and 40-weeks’ gestation according to bile acid levels.}

Although basic and clinical research including placebo-controlled double-blind trials is attempting to clarify their effectiveness and mechanisms of action, such studies are seriously limited due to the multi-targeted, multi-component “long-tail” properties of Kampo medicines, which are fundamentally different from modern western therapeutics. However, recent progress in high-throughput analytical technology, coupled with an exponential increase in biomedical information on various levels from molecular biology to clinical “big” data, is enabling us to commence a multidisciplinary and comprehensive investigation of Kampo medicines based on multi-omics, bio-informatics, and systems biology. In addition to deriving an inclusive understanding of the benefits and mechanisms of Kampo medicines, “KAMPOmics” may lead to the development of new principles to control and treat diseases in a systems-oriented manner. Furthermore, elucidation of “sho” and “mibyo” – classical concepts of Kampo, which loosely approximate to the notions of “precise medicine” and “pre-symptomatic aberration”, respectively – may contribute to the development of patient-oriented medicine, an area attracting enormous growth and interest in contemporary medicine.}
