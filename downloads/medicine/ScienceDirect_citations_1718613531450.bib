abstract = {Objectives
As well as associated cardiovascular diseases (CVD) like heart attacks, stroke, or others, arterial hypertension shows rising incidence throughout the last decades. The risk of developing an elevated blood pressure is mostly based on environmental and behavioral factors. Therefore, guidelines usually base a first-line therapy on lifestyle modifications. Complementary medicine (CM) offers a wide range of therapies to support such and CM utilization is common among CVD. We sought to analyze CM utilization among participants particularly suffering from arterial hypertension and aimed to distinguish utilization rates of different therapy approaches and predicting factors on this part of health behavior.
Design and setting
This cross-sectional analysis was based on data of the 2017 National Health Interview survey (NHIS, n = 26,742; response rate 80,7%), performed among the US population.
Main outcome measures and results
Within the last 12 months, 22.7% of participants reported to suffer from arterial hypertension and they were less likely to have used CM (26.8% with versus 32.5% without hypertension). Consulting a homeopath or using mind-body-medicine was more common among participants without the diagnosis, while equal proportions had consulted a chiropractor, a naturopath, a practitioner of traditional medicine, or a practitioner of chelation therapy. Regarding mind-body medicine (MBM), individuals with hypertension most often used spiritual meditation (10.6%), yoga (5.7%), mindfulness meditation (3.2%), progressive relaxation (3.1%), mantra meditation (2.4%), guided imagery (1.9%), tai chi (1.5%), and qi gong (0.4%). CM use in individuals with hypertension was associated with female sex, higher education, and/or living in the Western or Midwest USA.
Conclusion
Participants with arterial hypertension were less likely to utilize CM therapies than those without. Regarding prevention and therapy of the disease, especially MBM therapies show promising results but further research and better information for the general population is needed.}

Gene deliveries to cell spheroids are via viral vectors or non-viral vectors. Some new technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 also have been used in genetically modified methods to deliver exogenous gene to the host chromosome. It has been shown that genetically modified cell spheroids had the potential to differentiate into bone, cartilage, vascular, nerve, cardiomyocytes, skin, and skeletal muscle as well as organs like the liver to replace the diseased organ in the animal and pre-clinical trials. This article reviews the recent articles about genetically modified spheroid cells and explains the fabrication, applications, development timeline, limitations, and future directions of genetically modified cell spheroid.}

abstract = {Objective
To develop a novel diagnostic modality to identify and diagnose stroke in daily life scenarios for improving the therapeutic effects and prognoses of patients.
Methods
In this study, 16 stroke patients and 24 age-matched healthy participants as controls were recruited for comparative analysis. Leveraging a portable eye-tracking device and integrating traditional Chinese medicine theory with modern color psychology principles, we recorded the eye movement signals and calculated eye movement features. Meanwhile, the stroke recognition models based on eye movement features were further trained by using random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting classifier (GBC), XGBoost, and CatBoost.
Results
The stroke group and the healthy group showed significant differences in some eye movement features (P < .05). The models trained based on eye movement characteristics had good performances in recognizing stroke individuals, with accuracies ranging from 77.40% to 88.45%. Under the red stimulus, the eye movement model trained by RF became the best machine learning model with a recall of 84.65%, a precision of 86.48%, a F1 score of 85.47%. Among the six algorithms, RF and CatBoost performed better in classification.
Conclusion
This study pioneers the application of traditional Chinese medicine's five-color stimuli to visual observation tasks. On the basis of the combined design, the eye-movement models can accurately identify stroke, and the developed high-performance models may be used in daily life scenarios.}

Concurrently, the range of medical immunosuppressive agents has increased, making it safer for reproductive-aged individuals who have received transplants to attempt and continue a pregnancy. In this Consult, we review the general considerations and contemporary approach to medical and obstetrical management of pregnant solid organ transplant recipients, discuss the perinatal outcomes and incidence of graft rejection specific to the most common types of organ transplants, and provide management recommendations based on the available evidence. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend that all solid organ transplant recipients capable of pregnancy be offered prepregnancy counseling as part of the pretransplant evaluation and before any posttransplant pregnancy (Best Practice); (2) we recommend deferring pregnancy for at least 1 year (except for lung transplant recipients in which case a 2-year deferral is recommended) following solid organ transplant or any episode of acute cellular rejection (GRADE 1B); (3) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients have stable allograft function and optimal control of chronic medical comorbidities before attempting pregnancy (GRADE 1B); (4) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients of reproductive age use highly effective contraception when on mycophenolate or other immunosuppressive agents with known teratogenic risk (GRADE 1A); (5) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients contemplating pregnancy transition to an appropriate immunosuppressive regimen before attempting pregnancy to establish stable medication dosing and allograft function (GRADE 1C); (6) we recommend close monitoring of serum drug levels during pregnancy and the postpartum period to guide immunosuppressive therapy dosing (GRADE 1C); (7) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy receive all indicated vaccinations before and during pregnancy (GRADE 1C); (8) given the risk of fetal and neonatal sequelae secondary to cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy, we suggest that solid organ transplant recipients ideally complete any indicated antiviral prophylaxis or treatment before pursuing pregnancy (GRADE 2B); (9) we recommend daily low-dose aspirin prophylaxis to reduce the risk for preeclampsia in pregnant solid organ transplant recipients and to reduce the risk for renal allograft failure in renal transplant recipients (GRADE 1C); (10) as for all pregnant people, we recommend that pregnant solid organ transplant recipients have access to mental health specialists and receive screening for depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period (Best Practice); (11) because of the increased incidence of fetal growth restriction and common coexisting medical morbidities, we recommend serial assessment of fetal growth every 4 to 6 weeks throughout gestation after the anatomic survey (GRADE 1C); (12) we suggest antenatal surveillance from 32 weeks of gestation unless other fetal or maternal factors are identified in which case initiation of surveillance at an earlier gestational age is indicated (GRADE 2C); (13) we recommend that renal function be assessed before pregnancy or in early pregnancy in all solid organ transplant recipients (kidney and non-kidney) (GRADE 1C); (14) we suggest individualized delivery timing for pregnant solid organ transplant recipients and to consider delivery at between 37+0/7 and 39+6/7 weeks of gestation; in the absence of other indications, we suggest delivery by 39+6/7 weeks gestation for pregnant solid organ transplant recipients (GRADE 2B); (15) given that a trial of labor is associated with a high success rate and lower neonatal morbidity without increasing maternal morbidity or compromising graft survival, we recommend that cesarean delivery be reserved for medical obstetrical indications in solid organ transplant recipients (GRADE 1C); (16) we recommend that blood pressure targets in pregnant renal transplant recipients with chronic hypertension follow guidelines for nonpregnant recipients with a target blood pressure of ≤130/80 mm Hg (GRADE 1C); (17) we recommend monthly urine cultures to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria with treatment if positive to protect the graft in pregnant renal transplant recipients (GRADE 1C); (18) we recommend that pregnancies in pancreas-kidney transplant recipients be managed in a similar way as those of renal transplant recipients alone (GRADE 1C); (19) we recommend characterizing the underlying condition that led to liver transplantation and assessing baseline renal function in pregnant liver transplant recipients. (GRADE 1C); (20) because of the cardiovascular demand of pregnancy and the unique physiological implications of cardiac transplantation, we recommend that pregnant heart transplant recipients receive multidisciplinary care with cardiology, cardiac and/or obstetrical anesthesiology, and maternal-fetal medicine specialists (Best Practice); and (21) we recommend careful delivery planning to minimize hemodynamic stress (including considering operative vaginal delivery to minimize Valsalva) and suggest continuous intrapartum or intraoperative electrocardiographic monitoring for heart transplant recipients (GRADE 1C).}

In Africa, herbalism supplements allopathic medicine's efforts to ensure Universal Health Coverage attainment. This review was conducted to identify and to summarise current literature on methodological approaches used for quality control of herbal medicines in Africa, to evaluate the gaps associated with existing strategies within context of best practices, and make recommendations for future improvements.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles were screened and assessed for eligibility.
Results
118 articles were included into the study. There was a high preference for impurity profiling tests (77%) indicating the prioritization for tests that guarantee safety despite the limited analytical resources available. Other classes of tests reported included identification tests (29%), physicochemical tests (18%), and content assays (12%). Although standard methods exist in preparing samples for impurity tests, different techniques were observed in different studies, and this could lead to differences in analytical outcomes. Content assays focused on single marker assessments, which may be inadequate to comprehensively assess the quality of products.
Conclusion
This review provides knowledge of existing strengths and challenges for herbal medicine quality assessments in Africa. For future it is recommended to implement more studies on contaminants (e.g. mycotoxins) and pharmaceutical adulterants. The use of chemometrics to develop analytical methods should be promoted. Also, stakeholders in the medicine quality industry in Africa need to effectively collaborate to establish a well co-ordinated and harmonized system to provide a sustainable framework for the GACP and GMP guided production and quality assurance of herbal medicines.}

B. altitudinis could grow and produce PHB when using enzymatically hydrolysed TCMR in a 5-L fermenter. After 20 h of fermentation, the maximum concentration of PHB was 11.2 g/L, and the highest cell dry weight (CDW) was 15.4 g/L, with 72.7 % of the PHB fraction in CDW. Moreover, this strain could utilize enzymatic hydrolysates from various herbal formulas to produce high levels of PHB. This novel approach aims to accumulate PHB from TCMR hydrolysates, offering an effective and environmentally friendly method to reduce production costs and achieve mass production.}

abstract = {Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) is a crucial developmental milestone in early embryogenesis, marking the transition from maternal to embryonic control of development. This process, which varies in timing across species, involves the activation of the embryonic genome, paving the way for subsequent cell differentiation and organismal development. Recent advances in genomics and reproductive medicine have highlighted the potential of ZGA in the realm of genetic screening, providing a window into the genetic integrity of the developing embryo at its earliest stages. The intersection of ZGA and genetic screening primarily emerges in the context of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). These techniques, often employed during assisted reproductive technologies, aim to detect potential genetic abnormalities or chromosomal imbalances before embryo implantation. Given that ZGA represents the onset of embryonic gene expression, understanding its intricacies can significantly enhance the accuracy and predictive power of these screening processes. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput genomic techniques, detailed mapping of the transcriptomic changes during ZGA has become feasible. Such advancements have deepened our insights into the dynamics of early embryonic development and the onset of genetic disorders. As our knowledge in this realm expands, it promises to revolutionize our capabilities in detecting, understanding, and potentially rectifying genetic anomalies at the earliest stages of human life, thereby optimizing reproductive outcomes.}

abstract = {Tropical medicine is normally said to date from the late nineteenth century, being particularly associated with the work of Patrick Manson. Like other pioneers of the discipline, Manson broke with previous ideas about diseases in the tropics which stressed the role of climate in their production. The new scientific discipline of tropical medicine was based on the discovery that most diseases in the tropics were caused by microbial pathogens, some of which were transmitted by arthropod vectors. Despite this, and the fact that Manson and others recognized that most so-called tropical diseases were not confined to the tropics, the term ‘tropical’ was retained. This chapter explains why that was so, looking back to ‘tropical medicine’ before Manson and afterwards at the development of a new discipline, created in order to assist colonial development. The chapter examines how tropical medicine changed from being exclusively about protecting imperialists and their investments to a discipline that was increasingly owned by the peoples of tropical countries.}

abstract = {Summary
Given the paucity of high-certainty evidence, and differences in opinion on the use of nuclear medicine for hematological malignancies, we embarked on a consensus process involving key experts in this area. We aimed to assess consensus within a panel of experts on issues related to patient eligibility, imaging techniques, staging and response assessment, follow-up, and treatment decision-making, and to provide interim guidance by our expert consensus. We used a three-stage consensus process. First, we systematically reviewed and appraised the quality of existing evidence. Second, we generated a list of 153 statements based on the literature review to be agreed or disagreed with, with an additional statement added after the first round. Third, the 154 statements were scored by a panel of 26 experts purposively sampled from authors of published research on haematological tumours on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree) Likert scale in a two-round electronic Delphi review. The RAND and University of California Los Angeles appropriateness method was used for analysis. Between one and 14 systematic reviews were identified on each topic. All were rated as low to moderate quality. After two rounds of voting, there was consensus on 139 (90%) of 154 of the statements. There was consensus on most statements concerning the use of PET in non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma. In multiple myeloma, more studies are required to define the optimal sequence for treatment assessment. Furthermore, nuclear medicine physicians and haematologists are awaiting consistent literature to introduce volumetric parameters, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and radiomics into routine practice.}

Wanfang databases, CBM, VIP, CNKI, PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMbase were searched for trials based on randomization and control for use of acupuncture in combination with CHM for functional constipation published from the inception of the database to Dec. 2019. We used the risk of bias of Cochrane Collaboration for literature quality assessment, extracted trial data in duplicate, and then assessed the risk of bias. The data were discussed by adopting Review Manager 5.3 program. A total of 22 RCTs with 2574 cases were retrieved. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture with CHM could improve the clinical effectiveness (OR6.10, 95% CI 4.72–7.87, P ​< ​0.00001); heterogeneity was not identified (Chi2 ​= ​32.84, P ​= ​0.43, I2 ​= ​2%), and the difference was statistically significant. Second-level outcomes (e.g., defecation interval time (P ​< ​0.00001), Bristol Stool Scale (P ​= ​0.002), defecation difficulty (P ​= ​0.01) and accompanying symptoms (P ​< ​0.00001)) in the treatment groups were significantly different after the acupuncture with CHM compared with control groups, whereas defecation symptoms were not significantly different (P ​= ​0.06). The use of acupuncture with CHM can significantly improve the clinical efficacy of functional constipation, ameliorate Bristol Stool Scale, defecation difficulty, defecation symptoms, and accompanying symptoms, as well as shorten the defecation interval time, with better safety.}

Obesity is a complex and heterogeneous condition that leads to various metabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, for some, treatment options to date for obesity are insufficient, with many people not reaching sustained weight loss or having improvements in metabolic health. In this Review, we discuss advances in the genetics of obesity from the past decade—with emphasis on developments from the past 5 years—with a focus on metabolic consequences, and their potential implications for precision management of the disease. We also provide an overview of the potential role of genetics in guiding weight loss strategies. Finally, we propose a vision for the future of precision obesity management that includes developing an obesity-centred multidisease management algorithm that targets both obesity and its comorbidities. However, further collaborative efforts and research are necessary to fully realise its potential and improve metabolic health outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Autopsy has benefited the practice of medicine for centuries; however, its use to advance the practice of oral health care is relatively limited. In the era of precision oral medicine, the research autopsy is poised to play an important role in understanding oral–systemic health, including infectious disease, autoimmunity, craniofacial genetics, and cancer.
Types of Studies Reviewed
The authors reviewed relevant articles that used medical and dental research autopsies to summarize the advantages of minimally invasive autopsies of dental, oral, and craniofacial tissues and to outline practices for supporting research autopsies of the oral and craniofacial complex.
Results
The authors provide a historical summary of research autopsy in dentistry and provide a perspective on the value of autopsies for high-resolution multiomic studies to benefit precision oral medicine. As the promise of high-resolution multiomics is being realized, there is a need to integrate the oral and craniofacial complex into the practice of autopsy in medicine. Furthermore, the collaboration of autopsy centers with researchers will accelerate the understanding of dental, oral, and craniofacial tissues as part of the whole body.
Conclusions
Autopsies must integrate oral and craniofacial tissues as part of biobanking procedures. As new technologies allow for high-resolution, multimodal phenotyping of human samples, using optimized sampling procedures will allow for unprecedented understanding of common and rare dental, oral, and craniofacial diseases in the future.
Practical Implications
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the oral cavity as a site for viral infection and transmission potential; this was only discovered via clinical autopsies. The realization of the integrated autopsy’s value in full body health initiatives will benefit patients across the globe.}

abstract = {Introduction
Guidelines may play an important role in the process of adopting a planetary health perspective in clinical medicine. Current issues relating to the integration of planetary health aspects in guidelines were discussed during a workshop at the German Network for Evidence-Based Medicine conference in 2023.
Methods
In a multidisciplinary workshop, 25 persons with an interest in guideline development selected important planetary health dimensions that could be promptly included in guidelines. Group discussions addressed the challenges of integrating planetary health aspects in guidelines and feasible solutions.
Results
Participants recommended to first integrate the dimensions Environmental impacts, Prevention & co-benefits and Choosing wisely and provided corresponding rationales. Updating evidence to decision frameworks and including relevant climate outcomes (e.g., CO2 equivalents) in clinical trials were regarded as crucial. Pragmatic steps to integrate planetary health aspects such as an adapted guideline layout and prioritization of recommendations were proposed.
Discussion
Changes in the guideline development processes are necessary to incorporate the planetary health perspective into guidelines. Capacity building for guideline developers and modifications to frameworks are important next steps. Public discussion and cooperation between guideline developing bodies are therefore essential to move beyond the results of this workshop.
Conclusion
The aforementioned workshop underpins the strong interest to integrate planetary health aspects into guideline frameworks to eventually promote planetary health in clinical medicine.
Zusammenfassung
Einleitung
Leitlinien können dabei helfen, die Planetary-Health-Perspektive in der klinischen Medizin zu integrieren. Um Leitlinien dahingehend weiterzuentwickeln, wurden auf der Konferenz des Deutschen Netzwerks Evidenzbasierte Medizin 2023 aktuelle Fragen zur Aufnahme von Planetary Health in Leitlinien diskutiert.
Methoden
In einem multidisziplinären Workshop bestimmten 25 an der Leitlinienentwicklung interessierte Personen wichtige Planetary-Health-Dimensionen, die zeitnah in Leitlinien aufgenommen werden könnten. In Gruppendiskussionen wurden die komplexen Herausforderungen bei der Integration von Planetary Health in Leitlinien erörtert und mögliche Lösungen diskutiert.
Ergebnisse
Die Teilnehmer empfahlen, zunächst die Dimensionen Umweltauswirkungen, Prävention und Co-Benefits sowie Vermeidung von Überversorgung in Leitlinien aufzunehmen, und lieferten entsprechende Begründungen. Die Überarbeitung von Leitlinien-Regelwerken und der Einbezug relevanter klimabezogener Endpunkte in klinische Studien (z.B. CO2-Äquivalente) wurden als wichtige Voraussetzungen genannt. Es wurden pragmatische Schritte zur Integration von Planetary Health, wie z. B. ein angepasstes Leitlinienlayout und eine Priorisierung der Empfehlungen, vorgeschlagen.
Diskussion
Eine Anpassung der Prozesse bei der Leitlinienentwicklung ist notwendig, um Planetary Health in Leitlinien einzubringen. Der Aufbau entsprechender Kompetenzen bei Leitlinienentwickler*innen und Änderungen der Leitlinien-Regelwerke sind wichtige nächste Schritte. Eine breite Diskussion und die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den verschiedenenan der Leitlinienentwicklung beteiligten Organisationen ist daher unerlässlich, um die Aufnahme der Planetary-Health-Perspektive in Leitlinien voranzubringen.
Schlussfolgerung
Dieser Workshop unterstreicht das starke Interesse an der Integration von Planetary Health in Leitlinien mit dem Ziel, die klinische Medizin stärker an Planetary Health auszurichten.}

abstract = {Outcomes
1. Describe the impact of storytelling in the context of palliative care and evaluate whether it has particular utility in non-Western, resource-variable contexts. 2. Discuss how stigma, including spiritual stigma, plays a major role in patient narratives and its impact on the valuing and seeking of palliative care in Kenya.
Key Message
This project investigated the utility of storytelling and narrative medicine among palliative care patients and providers in Kenya. Do patients share stories about their illness? If so, to whom? If not, what barriers do they face? How can we better hear stories of palliative patients, especially those from underserved communities?
Importance
Narrative medicine supports that storytelling is an effective tool for training clinicians in empathy while also allowing patients to make meaning of suffering and gain agency.1–4 However, narrative medicine has largely been established in the West, and the translatability of narrative medicine to non-Western settings is relatively unknown.5
Objective(s)
This hypothesis-generating project aimed to understand 1) patient and provider attitudes in Kenya towards sharing personal stories in a medical context, 2) imagined benefits or barriers to storytelling, and 3) how Kenyan culture/spirituality impacts a patient's willingness to share their story.
Scientific Methods Utilized
Semi-structured interviews were conducted in English and Swahili with patients and providers recruited from a rural, outpatient palliative care clinic in Kenya. Interviews were transcribed, translated, and analysed following grounded theory of qualitative analysis.6
Results
9 patients (56% female, median age 56) and 5 providers (80% female, median age 32) completed interviews, with 11 done in English and 3 in Swahili. Both patients and providers supported sharing stories as a means to receive/provide comprehensive medical care. Patients reflected on storytelling as a medium to manifest healing through positivity or spirituality. Barriers to patient storytelling included stigmas surrounding palliative care and cancer and desire for privacy. Providers further identified stigma, financial burdens, and gendered expectations as potential barriers. Lastly, interviews revealed how belief in divine healing carried its own stigma as palliative patients contended with not being healed by God.
Conclusion(s)
Patients and providers perceived benefit in patients sharing stories of their illness experience within medical contexts. However, stigma, spiritual concerns, and financial strains may limit willingness to share freely.
Impact
This work highlights how pervasive stigma surrounding cancer and palliative care in Kenya may impact patient storytelling and subsequent health-seeking behaviors. We may consider future interventions utilizing patient narratives to reduce stigma, increase uptake of care, and improve patient experience.}

In this paper, an innovative framework for Federated Learning is proposed that allows performing machine learning and effectively tackling the issue of data privacy while taking a step towards security during communication. Unlike the standard federated approaches where models should travel on the communication networks and would be subject to possible cyberattacks, the models proposed by our framework do not need to travel, thus moving in the direction of security improvement. Another very appealing feature is that it can be used with any machine learning algorithm provided that, during the learning phase, the model updating does not depend on the input data. To show its effectiveness, the learning process is here accomplished by an Evolutionary Algorithm, namely Grammatical Evolution, thus also obtaining explicit knowledge that can be provided to the domain experts to justify the decisions made. As a test case, glucose values prediction for a number of patients with type 1 diabetes is considered and is tackled as a classification problem, the goal being to predict for any future value a possible range. Finally, a comparison of the performance of the proposed framework is performed against that of a non-Federated Learning approach.}

abstract = {Molecular analysis of blood groups is important in transfusion medicine, allowing the prediction of red blood cell (RBC) antigens. Many blood banks use single nucleotide variant (SNV) based methods for blood group analysis. While this is a well-established approach, it is limited to the polymorphisms included in genotyping panels. Thus, variants that alter antigenic expression may be ignored, resulting in incorrect prediction of phenotypes. The popularization of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to its application in transfusion medicine, including for RBC antigens determination. The present review/meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the applicability of the NGS for the prediction of RBC antigens. A systematic review was conducted following a comprehensive literature search in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Studies were selected based on predefined criteria and evaluated using Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The characteristics and results of the studies were extracted and meta-analysis was performed to verify the agreement between results from standard molecular methods and NGS. Kell (rs8176058), Duffy (rs2814778, rs12078), or Kidd (rs1085396) alleles were selected as a model for comparisons. Additionally, results are presented for other blood group systems. Of the 864 eligible studies identified, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were selected for meta-analysis. The pooled concordance proportion for NGS compared to other methods ranged from 0.982 to 0.994. The sequencing depth coverage was identified as crucial parameters for the reliability of the results. Some studies reported difficulty in analyzing more complex systems, such as Rh and MNS, requiring the adoption of specific strategies. NGS is a technology capable of predicting blood group phenotypes and has many strengths such as the possibility of simultaneously analyzing hundred individuals and gene regions, and the ability to provide comprehensive genetic analysis, which is useful in the description of new alleles and a better understanding of the genetic basis of blood groups. The implementation of NGS in the routine of blood banks depends on several factors such as cost reduction, the availability of widely validated panels, the establishment of clear quality parameters and access to bioinformatics analysis tools that are easy to access and operate.}

The utilization of certain forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is prevalent among adults in the United States. While researchers have extensively studied the factors influencing CAM use in Western countries, significant barriers to its adoption remain. This paper draws attention to the obstacles faced by individuals in their journey to using CAM.
Methods
Qualitative interviews were conducted with 21 patients who had turned to CAM for managing a chronic illness/condition. These in-depth, face-to-face interviews occurred in Miami, USA, during 2014–15. The sampling, data collection, and analysis processes of this study adhered to the principles outlined in Charmaz’s constructivist grounded theory approach.
Results
From the data, three central barriers to CAM utilization in the US emerged: 1) Financial barriers: A significant portion of CAM treatments is not covered by insurance, making them cost-prohibitive for many. 2) Skepticism and discouragement: Both conventional medical practitioners and a segment of the public exhibited a noticeable trend towards discouraging CAM use. 3) Evaluation challenges: Patients expressed difficulty in assessing the efficacy and benefits of various CAM treatments compared to their costs.
Discussion
Despite the widespread interest in and use of CAM in the US, numerous barriers hinder its broader integration into mainstream healthcare. These obstacles not only restrict healthcare choices for the general public but also appear to favor a select demographic, potentially based on income and availability of information.}

abstract = {Background
Chinese medicine (CM) has become a popular interventional treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, limited knowledge about general characteristics and long-term clinical outcomes hampers the development of CM for RA.
Purpose
The main objectives of the China Rheumatoid Arthritis Registry of Patients with Chinese Medicine (CERTAIN) were to describe the population of RA patients receiving CM treatment in multiple centers in China using different variables and compare these findings with internationally reported data.
Study design
The CERTAIN is a prospective, multicenter, observational disease registry.
Methods
Adult RA patients who fulfilled the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/ European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for RA and received CM treatment were recruited into the CERTAIN by rheumatologists from 145 hospitals across 30 provinces in China. Data on demographics, disease characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and adverse events, with a 2-year follow-up, were collected and documented using a predefined protocol.
Results
In the 2 years since the study began in September 2019, 11,764 patients have been enrolled (enrolment is ongoing), and 13.10% of participants have completed the 6-month follow-up. We present the baseline characteristics of the first 11,764 enrollees.
Conclusions
The CERTAIN is the first nationwide registry to document comprehensive data on CM treatment in patients with RA. The development of the CERTAIN resource is a significant step forward for Chinese RA patients, herbal medicine users, and research communities and will deepen our understanding of CM for RA.
Registration
The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05219214).}

abstract = {Introduction
High altitude cognitive dysfunction (HACD) is a type of cognitive impairment that is associated with exposure to high-altitude environments. This condition is characterized by deficits in attention, memory, learning, executive function, and psychomotor speed. Hypobaric hypoxia, a key characteristic of high-altitude settings, is a significant contributing factor to HACD. However, despite significant research efforts, the precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HACD remain largely unknown, and effective treatment options are currently lacking. Notably, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), an established medical paradigm recognized globally, has a distinctive treatment approach based on systematic theory and practical expertise that could aid in the prevention and management of HACD. Here, we focus on the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HACD, and summarize potential treatment schemes based on TCM and modern therapy.
Method
A literature review was carried out using several databases, including the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed.
Results
The pathogenesis of HACD involves various molecular mechanisms, including an impaired compensatory response, mitochondrial injury, energy metabolism disorder, calcium overload, neuroexcitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, amyloid β and tau accumulation, and the disruption of the microbiome-gut-brain axis caused by hypobaric hypoxia. In this review, we summarize that TCM can alleviate HACD by regulating energy metabolism, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, anti-calcium overload, anti-neuroexcitotoxicity, anti-apoptosis, anti-amyloidosis, etc.
Conclusion
TCM has broad prospects for treating HACD. The combination of TCM and modern therapy may improve the efficacy, and reduce the side effects of some chemical drugs.}

abstract = {Chinese herbal medicine is receiving more and more attention at home and abroad as a traditional Chinese clinical medicine. To make herbal medicines can be preserved for a long time, they are usually fumigated with sulfur. However, after the medicinal materials have been fumigated with sulfur, SO2 residues will remain, which, when exposed to water, will create sulfites and bisulfites. Excessive sulfites can cause a variety of severe ailments and diminish the quality and effectiveness of therapeutic plants. Therefore, developing an effective SO32−/HSO3− detection method is important. This study chose coumarin derivatives as fluorescent acceptors and pyridinium acrylonitrile structures as fluorescent donors to create a ratiometric fluorescent probe CPA using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. The probe CPA exhibited a fluorescence transition from red to green under excitation at 405 nm with an interval of 149 nm, a reaction time of less than 1 min, a low detection limit of 86 nM, and the probe CPA has good specific recognition of SO32− and is resistant to interference. In addition, CPA has low in vitro cytotoxicity and can successfully detect endogenous sulfites in living cells.}

The influence of the undecomposed sample matrix (mainly sugar and alcohol) on the HG process of As was examined in detail. Under optimal conditions found, simplified sample preparation procedures for the determination of As traces were proposed. The suitable sensitivity, the limit of detection of As < 0.1 ng g−1, the precision within 0.31–7.4 % (as RSD), and the adequate trueness (94.9–113 % as confirmed by the recovery test) were achieved. Using the species-selective HG conditions and the developed direct analysis method, the speciation of As in arsenic drops without any prior chromatographic separation of As(III) and As(V) was carried out. The applicability of the developed strategies was demonstrated by the determination of As in 13 homeopathic products available on the Polish market.}

Genomic medicine is argued by our interviewees to be exceptional by virtue of novel scientific knowledge it offers and the resultant effects on clinical practice; ordinary in that it is just another way of understanding the body that leads straightforwardly to the evolution of healthcare; and an ethical obligation because it provides comprehensive insight and care that should be accessible to all people. Despite desires to make genomic medicine diverse, inclusive, and accessible – envisioning it working as a matter of social justice – we argue that there are structural constraints that impede this genetic imaginary from becoming a reality. We argue that genomic medicine must be actively shaped in ways that foster social justice so as not to perpetuate current and historical disparities in medicine.}

abstract = {Context
Medical cannabis is increasingly considered for palliation of pain, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, and other symptoms.
Objectives
We aimed to determine whether training in hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) adequately prepares fellows to counsel patients about medical cannabis.
Methods
A previously validated questionnaire was adapted for HPM fellows. Domains included fellows’ practices recommending cannabis and their knowledge of its effectiveness and risks compared with standard treatments. U.S. HPM fellowships were sent surveys in 2022 and 2023.
Results
Forty six programs participated, 123 fellows responded (response rate of 42%) including 69% female; 55% White, and 28% Asian. Of respondents, 65% reported receiving formal training regarding medical cannabis; 57% reported discussing medical cannabis with over five patients; 23% recommended medical cannabis to more than five patients in the preceding year. Only 19%, however, felt sufficiently informed to issue cannabis-related recommendations. HPM fellows with prior training were not more likely to feel sufficiently informed to discuss cannabis (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.82–1.66) or to recommend cannabis to patients (RR: 2.05, 95% CI: 0.89–4.71). Fellows rate cannabis as equally or more effective than conventional treatments for the following symptoms: anorexia/cachexia (63%), nausea/vomiting (43%), pain (25%), and neuropathic pain (21%).
Conclusion
Most HPM fellows report formal training in the use of medical cannabis. Over half of trainees reported discussing medical cannabis with patients, but few considered themselves sufficiently informed to make cannabis-related clinical recommendations. These results suggest both a need for expanded high-quality evidence for medical cannabis in palliative care and for improved formal education for HPM fellows.}

The patient initially presented with a sore throat, severe muscle aches, productive cough and fever. On the worsening of symptoms, remdesivir was administered. However, as the symptoms continued to worsen and a cytokine release syndrome was suspected, oxygen was provided through a high-flow nasal cannula (50 L/min) and therapeutic plasma exchange was performed to prevent worsening of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. On the same day, a course of traditional Chinese medicine was introduced in consultation with the infectious house staff. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved; the levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimers reduced, and the patient was weaned to a simple oxygen mask and eventually to room air. This is the first reported case of the integration of these treatments. Together, they prevented the patient from requiring intubation, played a role in cytokine management, and also improved the clinical symptoms, including productive purulent sputum, cough, frequent stool passage and intermittent fever, with no adverse effects. As a result, the patient was discharged within two weeks of the integration of these treatments. Therefore, the integration of therapeutic plasma exchange and traditional Chinese medicine is an effective therapy for patients with severe COVID-19.}

abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been successfully used to treat asthmatic conditions for centuries. Nevertheless, the current hotspots and research frontiers on TCM for asthma have not been systematically investigated on the basis of bibliometric analysis. In this study, a scientometric analysis (1991-2021) was carried out on 3081 journal articles obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database to explore the basic characteristics, research hotspots, and frontiers of TCM in asthma research. The results revealed the following: (1) Research on TCM in asthma has received widespread attention since the beginning of the 21st century; perhaps 2009 was an important turning point. TCM in asthma research shows a trend of interdisciplinary development. (2) Well-known universities/institutions in China, the United States, and South Korea have conducted the main body of current TCM research in asthma. JingCheng Dong (Fudan University, China) and XiuMin Li (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, USA) are the top 2 leading authors in this field. However, there is still a lack of international cooperation in the field of TCM in asthma research, and the influence of researchers in China and South Korea still needs improvement. (3) The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology ranks first in the research field on the influence of TCM in asthma. (4) Hotspots and frontiers of TCM in asthma are provided according to the timeline analyses of the research. In the former, complementary medicine, alternative treatment, allergic rhinitis, airway remodeling, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet, and eosinophilic esophagitis are in the exploratory stage. In the latter, pharmacology, essential oil, gut microbiota, and oxidative stress were investigated from 2006 until late 2021 as period B, which contradicts period A (1991-2005). Moreover, limitations of this bibliometric analysis and the study of TCM research in asthma still exist, which are sufficiently important to warrant further investigations. Finally, we propose the significant importance of the real quintessence and characteristics of TCM in clinical and future research.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Sa-Tri-Lhung-Klod (ST) remedy is a Thai traditional remedy used in obstetrics and gynecology to reduce inflammation and nourish the body post-partum. In Thai traditional medicine (TTM), there is a theory of formulating drugs based on the four elements and the tastes of herbs for use in treating diseases.
Aims of study
To determine relationships between taste theory and pharmacological properties for the anti-inflammatory effect of ST remedy and its chemical constituent components. To evaluate anti-inflammatory activity and also investigate the HPLC fingerprint of ST extracts.
Materials and methods
ST remedy was extracted by maceration in 95% ethanol (STE) and decoction in distilled water (STW). ST extracts were evaluated for anti-inflammatory activity by nitric oxide inhibitory assay in RAW264.7 cells, carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, and prostaglandin E2 inhibitory assay in inflamed rat paw tissue. In addition, the chemical constituent fingerprints of ST extracts were examined using HPLC.
Results
STE contained seven main chemical compounds, and STW demonstrated only one identifiable chemical compound. The STE and STW displayed potent NO inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 20.59 ± 0.03 and 52.93 ± 0.90 μg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the STE and STW (at doses of 100 - 400 mg/kg) promoted significant inhibition of inflammation in carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats (20.81 - 38.25%). Additionally, the STE (200 - 400 mg/kg) and STW (100 - 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced PGE2 levels in inflamed rat paw tissue.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that the spicy, astringent, sweet, and fragrant taste of the ST remedy used to treat post-partum inflammation encompass constituents with potent anti-inflammatory activity. STE and STW possess anti-inflammatory properties and effectively inhibit the production of NO and PGE2. Results confirm the use of the ST remedy for treating inflammatory diseases in the post-partum period according to TTM knowledge.}

1. Participants will be able to identify how a quality approach can be successfully used to improve access to palliative medicine for liver transplant candidates. 2. Participants will be able to define methods which can be employed to improve collaboration between teams and alleviate quality gaps among unique patient populations.
Key Message
Palliative Medicine is an underutilized resource for patients and families undergoing liver transplant evaluation, but if integrated has the potential to improve the experience and overall well-being for this population. Our quality project helped to increase referrals at a large US transplant center. We will continue this work, and hope to help define pathways for other programs as well.
Introduction/Context
Patients denied liver transplant (LT) do not receive adequate support for the difficult transition from expecting a lifesaving procedure, to navigating end-stage disease and end-of-life care (1). Palliative Medicine (PM) offers multidisciplinary care for these patients, but is underutilized.
Objectives
Our improvement measure was to increase PM referrals among LT candidates by 100%, from 10 annually in 2021, to 20 in 2022, in a large US transplant center. Sample size included 100% of patients with completed appointments in Transplant Hepatology and PM.
Methods
Our team used a fishbone diagram to brainstorm contributing quality gaps. Root causes identified included: knowledge deficit among LT staff about PM, patient/family perception that “palliative” meant “giving up,” and limited collaboration between LT and PM departments. We then used an impact/effort grid to prioritize opportunities. Selected interventions included designing educational videos for both the pre-LT class and LT staff, updating pre-LT evaluation templates to support conversations about PM, and emphasizing collaboration among teams’ social workers.
Results
After testing and implementation, improvement measure data demonstrated that completed PM appointments for LT patients increased by 100% to 20 in 2022, consistent with the project aim.
Conclusion
Palliative Medicine is an underutilized resource for candidates denied liver transplant in a large US center, consistent with data reported from other LT programs. A quality project led to increased utilization of PM for patients and families. Studies are ongoing to further improve access and provide data demonstrating the benefit of PM in this population. This is a critical healthcare disparity that we hope to continue to address at our institution, and help provide pathways for others.

abstract = {[Abstract]
[Objective]
To construct a Nomogram model for the prediction of essential hypertension (EH) risks with the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome elements principles in conjunction with cutting-edge biochemical detection technologies.
[Methods]
A case-control study was conducted, involving 301 patients with essential hypertension in the hypertensive group and 314 without in the control group. Comprehensive data, including the information on the four TCM diagnoses, general data, and blood biochemical indicators of participants in both groups, were collected separately for analysis. The differentiation principles of syndrome elements were used to discern the location and nature of hypertension. One-way analysis was carried out to screen for potential risk factors of the disease. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to identify factors that contribute significantly to the model, and eliminate possible collinearity problems. At last, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to both screen and quantify independent risk factors essential for the prediction model. The “rms” package in the R Studio was used to construct the Nomogram model, creating line segments of varying lengths based on the contribution of each risk factor to aid in the prediction of risks of hypertension. For internal model validation, the Bootstrap program package was utilized to perform 1000 repetitions of sampling and generate calibration curves.
[Results]
The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors of EH included age, heart rate (HR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), uric acid (UA) levels, family medical history, sleep patterns (early awakening and light sleep), water intake, and psychological traits (depression and anger). Additionally, TCM syndrome elements such as phlegm, Yin deficiency, and Yang hyperactivity contributed to the risk of EH onset as well. TCM syndrome elements liver, spleen, and kidney were also considered the risk factors of EH. Next, the Nomogram model was constructed using the aforementioned 14 risk predictors, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.868 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 0.840 to 0.895. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were found to be 80.7% and 85.0%, respectively. Internal validation confirmed the model’s robust predictive performance, with a consistency index (C-index) of 0.879, underscoring the model’s strong predictive ability.
[Conclusion]
By integrating TCM syndrome elements, the Nomogram model has realized the objective, qualitative, and quantitative selection of early warning factors for developing EH, resulting in the creation of a more comprehensive and precise prediction model for EH risks.}

abstract = {Background
An increasing number of women suffer from perimenopausal syndrome (PMS) and the global burden of this disease has been steadily rising. Acupoint application therapy and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) are widely used as effective methods for treating PMS, but the efficacy was inconsistent and the evidence should be summarized by quantitively analysis.
Objective
The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the acupoint application combined with the CHM for the treatment of PMS.
Methods
We searched eight databases from their inception to August 2022 to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on acupoint application combined with CHM for the treatment of PMS were included in this study. To assess the clinical efficacy and safety, meta-analysis was used to quantitively synthesize the effect estimates. Subgroup analysis, publication bias assessment and sensitivity analysis were also performed. We further assessed whether the included studies had reported on the purity and potency of the CHM used in their trials.
Results
A total of 8 RCTs with 560 participants were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, of which none of them included a description of an independent testing of purity or potency of the CHM product used. There were significant differences between the acupoint application combined with CHM and CHM alone in terms of Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI) score (MD = –2.91, 95%CI: –3.91 to –1.91), total effective rate (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.11–1.34), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Interview (PSQI) score (MD = –2.86, 95% CI: –3.61 to –2.10) and reduction in the serum level of luteinizing hormone (LH) (MD = –2.52, 95% CI: –4.70 to –0.34), whereas there were no differences between the two groups regarding lowering serum level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (MD = –1.66, 95% CI: –3.98–0.67) and elevating serum level of oestradiol (E2) (MD = 2.41, 95% CI: –0.70–5.52). For the comparation between the acupoint application combined with CHM and western medicine (WM), the KMI score (MD = –6.80, 95%CI: –7.95 to –5.65) was substantially different, while the PSQI score (MD = –0.60, 95% CI: –1.88–0.68) was not substantially different. The total effective rate in the combined group (91.7%) was higher than the western medicine group (83.49%).
Conclusion
Acupoint application combined with CHM may enhance the efficacy and safety of patients with PMS. However, due to the lack of description of an independent testing of purity or potency of the CHM product used in the trials, as well as blinding of participants and investigators, these results should be interpreted with caution.}

The research identifies three distinct forms of “other” patient participation: the “other” patient as an illness-free individual providing a contrasting case, the “other” patient as a lay witness to the patient's clinical manifestations, and the “other” patient as a recovered fellow patient demonstrating treatment effectiveness. The findings of this study contribute to existing research on patient resistance and triadic medical interactions, offering insights into the dynamics and implications of third-party involvement in medical consultations.}

Here we systemically reviewed the recent advances in analytical methods. A critical evaluation of the strength and weaknesses of these methods was provided, together with possible solutions to the difficulties. Mass spectrometry with or without robust chromatographic separation was increasingly employed. And scientists have made significant progress in simplifying polysaccharide quantification by depolymerizing it into oligosaccharides. This oligosaccharides-based strategy is promising for qualitative and quantitative analysis of polysaccharides. And continuous efforts are still needed to develop a standardized quality control method that is specific, accurate, repeatable, and applicable for analyzing individual components in natural medicine formulas.}

Yet, most pathologists and laboratory professionals remain unfamiliar with such tools and are unprepared for their inevitable integration. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present an overview of key elements within this emerging data science discipline. First, we will cover general, well-established concepts within ML, such as data type concepts, data preprocessing methods, and ML study design. We will describe common supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and their associated common machine learning terms (provided within a comprehensive glossary of terms that are discussed within this review). Overall, this review will offer a broad overview of the key concepts and algorithms in machine learning, with a focus on pathology and laboratory medicine. The objective is to provide an updated useful reference for those new to this field or those who require a refresher.}

abstract = {Background
The physical and physiological changes of shifting into older ages may affect nutritional conditions and lead to malnutrition.
Objectives
This study aimed to assess the possible relationship between eating habits recommended by Persian medicine (PM) and older adults' nutritional status.
Methods
A total of 1259 older adults were included in this study. Data were collected using a three-section questionnaire measuring socio-demographic characteristics, nutritional status according to the short form of the complete Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF), and nutritional habits (NH) consisting of 31 questions based on PM recommendations.
Results
The mean scores of the subscales of "eating habits" was significantly lower (p = 0.014) and "time of meals" was significantly higher (p = 0.001), in the well-nourished compared to the malnourished group. Furthermore, while a positive correlation was observed between the MNA-SF score and the subscales of "time of meals" (p˂0.001) and "eating and sleeping" (p = 0.033), the subscale of "eating habits" showed a negative correlation (p = 0.019).
Conclusions
Lifestyle modifications including eating habits and meal timing based on PM recommendations may improve nutritional status in older adults.}

This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) provides clinicians an overview of Artificial Intelligence, focused on the management of patients with obesity.
Methods
The perspectives of the authors were augmented by scientific support from published citations and integrated with information derived from search engines (i.e., Chrome by Google, Inc) and chatbots (i.e., Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer or Chat GPT).
Results
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the technologic acquisition of knowledge and skill by a nonhuman device, that after being initially programmed, has varying degrees of operations autonomous from direct human control, and that performs adaptive output tasks based upon data input learnings. AI has applications regarding medical research, medical practice, and applications relevant to the management of patients with obesity. Chatbots may be useful to obesity medicine clinicians as a source of clinical/scientific information, helpful in writings and publications, as well as beneficial in drafting office or institutional Policies and Procedures and Standard Operating Procedures. AI may facilitate interactive programming related to analyses of body composition imaging, behavior coaching, personal nutritional intervention & physical activity recommendations, predictive modeling to identify patients at risk for obesity-related complications, and aid clinicians in precision medicine. AI can enhance educational programming, such as personalized learning, virtual reality, and intelligent tutoring systems. AI may help augment in-person office operations and telemedicine (e.g., scheduling and remote monitoring of patients). Finally, AI may help identify patterns in datasets related to a medical practice or institution that may be used to assess population health and value-based care delivery (i.e., analytics related to electronic health records).
Conclusions
AI is contributing to both an evolution and revolution in medical care, including the management of patients with obesity. Challenges of Artificial Intelligence include ethical and legal concerns (e.g., privacy and security), accuracy and reliability, and the potential perpetuation of pervasive systemic biases.}

To evaluate the usefulness of positron emission tomography (PET) coupled with computed tomography (CT) in the diagnostic workup for inflammatory syndrome of undetermined origin (IUO) and to determine the diagnostic delay in an internal medicine department.
Patients and methods
We retrospectively studied a cohort of patients for whom a PET/CT scan had been prescribed in an indication of IUO in an internal medicine department (Amiens University Medical Center, Amiens, France) between October 2004 and April 2017. The patients were grouped according to the PET/CT findings: very useful (enabling an immediate diagnosis), useful, not useful, and misleading.
Results
We analyzed 144 patients. The median (interquartile range) age was 67.7 years (55.8-75.8 years). The final diagnosis was an infectious disease in 19 patients (13.2%), cancer in 23 (16%), inflammatory disease in 48 (33%), and miscellaneous diseases in 12 (8.3%). No diagnosis was made in 29.2% of the cases; half of the remaining had a spontaneously favorable outcome. Fever was observed in 63 patients (43%). Positron emission tomography coupled with CT was determined to be very useful in 19 patients (13.2%), useful in 37 (25.7%), not useful in 63 (43.7%), and misleading in 25 (17.4%). The median diagnostic delay (ie, the time interval between the first admission and a confirmed diagnosis) was significantly shorter in the useful (71 days [38-170 days]) and very useful (55 days [13-79 days]) groups than that in the not useful group (175 days [51-390 days]; P<.001). The median time interval between the PET/CT scan and the diagnosis was twice as long in the not useful group than that in the pooled misleading, useful, or very useful groups (P=.03). In a univariate analysis, the poor overall condition (P=.007) and the absence of fever (P=.005) were predictive of usefulness of PET/CT.
Conclusion
Positron emission tomography coupled with CT seems to be useful in the diagnosis of IUO and might shorten the diagnostic delay.}

Counseling plays a key role in promoting health behaviors, providing evidence-based information, and supporting patients with cancer during and after treatment. This study aimed to evaluate an interprofessional counseling service on Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) for patients being treated at Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCCs) in Southern Germany.
Methods
Patients participating in the CCC-Integrativ study received three CIH counseling sessions within three months in addition to their conventional cancer treatment. Medical and nursing staff participated in a study-specific blended learning training program before conducting the counseling. As part of the process evaluation, 30 audio-recorded counseling sessions were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by conducting a content analysis using MAXQDA 2020.
Results
Throughout the counseling, patients were conceded to address various health issues, which mainly revolved around symptom management interlaced with the areas of nutrition, exercise, and relaxation. The interprofessional teams conducted the counseling in a structured and patient-oriented manner. They worked together to motivate the patients to apply procedures from the CIH field independently, even if patients sometimes experienced difficulties in implementation.
Conclusions
Interprofessional collaboration improved healthcare quality, as patients received comprehensive and evidence-based advice on their supportive needs and lifestyle issues. Both professions could equally contribute their areas of knowledge and expertise and apply them to the benefit of the patients.
Practice Implications
Providing an integrative counseling service and adequate training on interpersonal communication and CIH for healthcare professionals will improve patient-centered care.}

abstract = {Aim
This study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of externally applied Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on diabetic foot.
Methods
We searched the China Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang Database, PubMed and Web of Science from inception to July 31, 2022, to find all randomized control trials (RCTs) related to externally applied TCMs in diabetic foot treatment. Information about the total effective rate, healing rate, and healing time were extracted. In addition, the relative risk (RR)/odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
Results
Finally, a total of 34 RCTs including 3758 patients were included in this meta-analysis. There were 5 articles that reported hydropathic compress with astrogalin, 14 articles that reported MEBO burn cream, 9 articles that reported compound cortex phellodendri liquid and 6 articles that reported Shengji Yuhong ointment. Compared with the basic treatment, the externally applied TCM (astrogalin, MEBO burn cream, compound cortex phellodendri liquid and Shengji Yuhong ointment) combined with basic treatment improved the total effective rate (RR = 1.31 [1.20, 1.42], P < 0.0001) and healing rate (RR = 1.84 [1.56, 2.17], P < 0.0001) and shortened the healing time (SMD = − 2.51 [− 3.39, − 1.63], P < 0.0001).
Conclusion
Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that common TCM applied externally could significantly improve the clinical efficacy comparing to the basic treatment.}

An azocalixarene-based sensor array was constructed to evaluate batch-to-batch consistency of Qufeng Zhitong Capsule (QZC). The molecular recognitions between azocalixarenes and the contents of QZC are transduced through the fluorescence signal output of the QZC itself or the applied indicator. Data simulations show that differences in composition and concentration between products can lead to altered fluorescence signals. Based on the constructed eight-element sensor array, a standard fluorescent fingerprint presented in a radar chart, was established by analyzing a large number of qualified samples, enabling the differentiation of qualified and unqualified QZC samples. The supramolecular fluorescence sensing method has the advantages of easy construction and fast response, which may provide a reference method and basis for establishing a new mode of quality evaluation of QZC and even other TCM.}

abstract = {Summary
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations (E20ins) are the third most frequent mutations observed in non-small cell lung cancer, accounting for approximately 1–10% of all EGFR mutations. In the era of precision medicine and targeted therapies, consistent naming of genetic alterations is crucial to avoid confusion and errors. However, the annotation of EGFR E20ins mutations has been inconsistent, leading to confusion in the scientific literature and product documentation. In this study, our primary objective was to investigate the usage of different annotation related to EGFR E20ins in independent studies. Additionally, we assessed the distribution of EGFR E20ins mutations and estimated the detection coverage expected from each available EGFR E20ins detection assay. A total of 1,418 EGFR E20ins mutations were collected from six studies (FoundationInsights, Geneseeq Technology Inc, mobocertinib phase I/II trial, poziotinib phase II trial, sunvozertinib phase I trial, and Samsung Medical Center) and reorganised according to Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature. Our analysis revealed that the majority of EGFR E20ins mutations requiring correction were ‘insertion’ or ‘deletion-insertion’, which should be appropriately designated as ‘duplication’. Additionally, duplicated variants were reported using different annotations in each study, and furthermore, even identical variant sequences were annotated differently within the same study. In all six studies, p.A767_V769dup and p.S768_D770dup were the most frequently observed EGFR E20ins. The Oncomine Dx Target Test showed the highest patient coverage at 77.2%, followed by the Droplex EGFR Mutation Test v2 with a patient coverage of 70.5% for EGFR E20ins patients. To ensure comprehensive coverage in real-world settings, it is essential to standardise the annotations for each variant, for example using the HGVS nomenclature. The accurate classification and analysis of drug responsiveness in EGFR E20ins necessitate consideration of the nomenclature, particularly with respect to the locations where the actual mutations occur.}

The popularity of complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia and Parkinson's disease (PD), is increasing. This study retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of a university-affiliated medical center in Korea, administering both Western medicine (WM) and Korean medicine (KM).
Methods
Eighty-eight inpatients with dementia and/or PD and Parkinsonism (PD&P) referred from neurology to KM departments between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2021, were retrospectively reviewed.
Results
The included patients were mostly elderly (93.18%) and female (65.91%). The proportion of participants with PD&P was the highest at 67.05%, and the most common complaints warranting referrals were movement disorders (40.91%) and musculoskeletal pain (34.09%). However, cognitive impairment was a common reason for referral for dementia (30.43%) but not for PD&P (6.78%). There were relatively few referrals for neuropsychiatric symptoms under both conditions. Patients received a median of 5.5 KM sessions over 13 days. Most KM treatments were non-pharmacological, and manual acupuncture was the most frequently used treatment (98.86%). The median KM medical cost was 245548.38 KRW (17564.06 KRW per session), and the main factor that increased the burden of medical expenses was the use of uninsured oral herbal medicine.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the current status of WM and KM collaboration among patients with neurodegenerative diseases referred to KM departments in a real-world clinical setting. Based on the characteristics and KM treatment status identified, collaboration between WM and KM to treat patients with neurodegenerative diseases could be further improved.}

Studies have shown that use of medicines with sedative or anticholinergic properties is associated with a decline in physical function; however, the effects have not been quantified, and it is not known how and which specific physical movements are affected. This prospective study quantified the impact of a change in sedative or anticholinergic load over time on 24-hour activity composition.
Methods
This study used data collected from a randomised trial assessing an ongoing pharmacist service in residential aged care. The 24-hour activity composition of sleep, sedentary behaviour, light-intensity physical activity, and moderate to vigorous physical activity was derived from 24-hour accelerometry bands. Mixed effect linear models were used to regress the multivariate outcome of 24-hour activity composition on medication load at baseline and at 12 months. A fixed effect interaction between trial stage and medication load was included to test for differing sedative or anticholinergic load effects at the two trial stages.
Results
Data for 183 and 85 participants were available at baseline and 12 months respectively. There was a statistically significant interaction between medication load and time point on the multivariate outcome of 24-hour activity composition (sedative F = 7.2, p < 0.001 and anticholinergic F = 3.2, p = 0.02). A sedative load increase from 2 to 4 over the 12-month period was associated with an average increase in daily sedentary behaviour by an estimated 24 min.
Conclusion
As sedative or anticholinergic load increased, there was an increase in sedentary time. Our findings suggest wearable accelerometry bands are a possible tool for monitoring the effects on physical function of sedative and anticholinergic medicines.
Trial registration
The ReMInDAR trial was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Trials Registry ACTRN12618000766213.}

abstract = {Unraveling the detailed mechanism of Chinese medicine in curing diseases is of vital importance for the development of such long-standing traditional medicine. Here, we investigated the exposed form in vivo and bioactivity of Chinese medicine from an aspect of supramolecular chemistry. We demonstrated that the genipin (GP), an aglycone of geniposide (GE) transformed by β-glucosidase, can react with methylamine (MA), a harmful metabolite in the gut, to produce gardenia blue in vivo, which leads to a significant decrease of MA. The gardenia blue is supramolecular assemblies (SA), which can alleviate the interference with intestinal bacteria. Moreover, the formation mechanism of SA was revealed, in which genimethylamine reacted from GP and MA, was covalently polymerized into dimers and then non-covalently self-assembled into the SA. This study provides evidence that the supramolecular pigments can be formed in vivo during the metabolism of Chinese medicine through simultaneously covalent and non-covalent assembly, which may play key roles in their pharmacological activity.}

abstract = {Purpose
To describe the sources of bloodstream infections (BSIs) in internal-medicine patients, on admission and during hospitalization, and to determine the proportion of BSIs in which no secondary cause could be defined (i.e., primary-BSI).
Methods
We analyzed all BSIs at the internal-medicine wards of the two campuses of the Hadassah Hebrew-University Medical Center, during 2017–2018. We defined the BSI source of each event (secondary, Central-line associated BSI (CLABSI) or primary non-CLABSI) and compared BSIs present on admission (POA) to hospital acquired (HA).
Results
There were 595 patient-unique BSI events, 316 (53.1%) POA-BSI and 279 (46.9%) HA-BSI. Overall, 309 (51.9%) were secondary, 194 (32.6%) primary non-CLABSI and 92 (15.5%) CLABSI. Primary non-CLABSI in the POA-BSI group was 20.6% vs. 46.2% in the HA-BSI group (p = 0.001). The length of hospital stay (LOS) of the HA-BSI group was longer than in the POA-BSI group (mean LOS, 19 days vs. 13.6 days, p = 0.01) and mortality rate was higher (48.7% vs. 19%, p = 0.001). Staphylococcus aureus was more common in primary non-CLABSI than in CLABSI and secondary BSI (29.5%, 12.8% and 16.2%, respectively).
Conclusions
The proportion of primary non-CLABSI among HA-BSI events is very high (46.2%). The absence of any plausible source for these BSIs, and the fact that in our hospital more than 90% of patients in medicine wards have peripheral lines, suggests that these may be a possible source for primary non-CLABSIs. Measures to prevent peripheral-line associated BSI (PLABSI), like those implemented successfully for the prevention of CLABSI, should be considered.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death globally. The effect of Chinese medicine (CM) on mortality during acute exacerbation of COPD is unclear. We evaluated the real-world effectiveness of add-on personalized CM in hospitalized COPD patients with acute exacerbation.
Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study with new-user design. All electronic medical records of hospitalized adult COPD patients (n = 4781) between July 2011 and November 2019 were extracted. Personalized CM exposure was defined as receiving CM that were prescribed, and not in a fixed form and dose at baseline. A 1:1 matching control cohort was generated from the same source and matched by propensity score. Primary endpoint was mortality. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) adjusting the same set of covariates (most prevalent with significant inter-group difference) used in propensity score calculation. Secondary endpoints included the change in hematology and biochemistry, and the association between the use of difference CMs and treatment effect. The prescription pattern was also assessed and the putative targets of the CMs on COPD was analyzed with network pharmacology approach.
Results
4325 (90.5%) patients were included in the analysis. The mean total hospital stay was 16.7 ± 11.8 days. In the matched cohort, the absolute risk reduction by add-on personalized CM was 5.2% (3.9% vs 9.1%). The adjusted HR of mortality was 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03 to 0.60, p = 0.008). The result remained robust in the sensitivity analyses. The change in hematology and biochemistry were comparable between groups. Among the top 10 most used CMs, Poria (Fu-ling), Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (Chen-pi) and Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gan-cao) were associated with significant hazard reduction in mortality. The putative targets of the CM used in this cohort on COPD were related to Jak-STAT, Toll-like receptor, and TNF signaling pathway which shares similar mechanism with a range of immunological disorders and infectious diseases.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that add-on personalized Chinese medicine was associated with significant mortality reduction in hospitalized COPD patients with acute exacerbation in real-world setting with minimal adverse effect on liver and renal function. Further randomized trials are warranted.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for preventing acute mountain sickness (AMS).
Methods
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which evalueded the effect of TCM for preventing AMS, compared with a placebo, no treatment or acetazolamide. The literature was searched in 6 major databases. RevMan 5.4 software was used for the meta-analysis. The relative risk for discrete variables and the mean difference for continuous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to express the effect size. The risk of bias in the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk assessment tool 2.0 (RoB 2.0), and the evidence certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment and the Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Results
Twenty RCTs involving 3015 participants and 16 TCM patent drugs were included. The overall risk of bias in the majority of studies (15/20) was of some concerns. In terms of the AMS incidence, Rhodiola rosea (R. rosea, Hong Jing Tian) and Ginkgo biloba (G. biloba, Yin Xing Ye) were equivalent to the placebo/no treatment [RR (95% CI): 0.66 (0.43–1.01), 0.82 (0.63–1.06), respectively]. The AMS incidence in the G. biloba group was higher than that in the acetazolamide group [RR (95% CI): 2.92 (1.69–5.06)]. In terms of improving the AMS symptom score on days 1 and 3 in the plateau, R. rosea and G. biloba were superior to the placebo or no treatment [MD (95% CI): -0.98 (-1.71, -0.25), -2.05 (-3.14, -0.95), respectively]. The other 14 Chinese patent medicines were evaluated in a single trial, and the majority of the results were negative. The subgroup analysis showed that the effect of R. rosea was related to the intervention time, way of ascending, and altitude.
Conclusion
R. rosea and G. biloba were effective in improving AMS symptoms but had no effect in reducing the AMS incidence. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of other TCM patent drugs to prevent AMS. More randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to evaluate and screen effective Chinese patent medicines for AMS prevention.}
