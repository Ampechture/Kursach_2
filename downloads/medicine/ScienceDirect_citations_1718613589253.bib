abstract = {Background
The use of palliative care for critically ill hospitalized patients has expanded. However, it is still underutilized in surgical specialties. Postsurgical patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation have increased mortality and costs of care; outcomes from adding palliative care services to this population have been poorly investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of palliative medicine consultation on readmission rates and hospitalization costs in postsurgical patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.
Methods
The Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for adults (> 18 years) between the years 2010 and 2014 who underwent a major operation (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [HCUP] data element ORPROC = 1), required mechanical ventilation for ≥ 96 consecutive hours (ICD-9-CM V46.1), and survived until discharge. Among these, patients who received a palliative medicine consultation during hospitalization were identified using the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code V66.7.
Results
Of 53,450 included patients, 3.4% received a palliative care consultation. Compared to patients who did not receive a palliative care consultation, patients who did receive a consultation had a lower readmission rate (14.8% vs. 24.8%, p < 0.001) and lower average cost of hospitalization during the initial admission ($109,007 vs. $124,218, p < 0.001), findings that persisted after multivariable logistic regression.
Conclusion
Utilization of palliative care in surgical patients remains low. Palliative care consultation in postsurgical patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation was associated with lower cost and rate of readmission. Further work is needed to integrate palliative care services with surgical care.}

Fish industry, climate change, bioinvasions, and pollution are the most reported threats to seabird populations. The aim of this review is to address those threats and discuss the health issues that impact seabirds in Brazil through the lens of conservation medicine. In total, 93 records were selected, regarding the previously mentioned threats, as well as the interaction between seabirds and etiologic agents and chemical compounds. The most studied species was the Spheniscus magellanicus and most of the records were published in the last 10 years, which indicates that although the health status of this group is still poorly addressed in Brazil, the studies have been increasing and created a background for the development of new research on this topic. This manuscript also highlights the urgency in performing transdisciplinary studies to better understand the health risks for seabirds and human populations associated with marine ecosystems.}

(G. rigescens) samples. Under the optimal conditions, the enhancement factor (EF), limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ) and precision were 33, 0.11 μg L−1, 0.37 μg L−1 and 1.3%, respectively. This method was applied to the analysis of G. rigescens samples, and the outcomes were in good agreement with the results determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A mice model of immune liver injury induced by concanavalin A (ConA) was established, and the liver protection of G. rigescens and gentiopicroside (GPS) on it and the effects of various dosages of Pb exposure on its liver protection were studied. Pb at a dosage of 5 mg kg−1 had little effect on the liver protection of G. rigescens and GPS, while 25, 125 mg kg−1 dosages of Pb could significantly attenuate the liver protection of both. In addition, it aggravated the necrosis of hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration, and these effects were dose-dependent.}

abstract = {Akebia stem has long been used extensively as a rare Chinese herbal medicine. The three most significant Akebia medicinal species are Akebia quinata (Thunb.) Decne. (A. quinata), Akebia trifoliata (Thunb.) Koidz. (A. trifoliata), and Akebia trifoliata (Thunb.) Koidz. var. Australis (Diels) Rehd. (A. trifoliata. var). They have significant therapeutic effects and are widely used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Only a few studies compared their chemical differences and antioxidant activities. To better demonstrate each species' characteristics and antioxidant properties, the ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap/MS)-based metabolomics was applied to investigate the chemome diversity of three Akebia species. Their antioxidant activities were evaluated by DPPH and ABTS assays. In total, 65 different metabolites were identified, including 5 phenolic acids, 2 phenylpropanoids, 4 lignan glycosides, and 54 triterpenoid saponins. The different aglycone types of triterpenoid saponins were found to be the component differences between the three Akebia species. The chemical composition of A. trifoliata and A. trifoliata. var is similar. The 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-ethyl-O-β-d-glucopyranoside has been found only in A. quinata. In contrast, the triterpenoid saponins akemisaponin B, akemisaponin D, oleanolic-acid-3-O-arabinopyranosyl-28-O-glucopyranosyl-glucopyranosyl-rhamnopyranosyl-arabinopyranosyl, akemisaponin C and saponin Pj1 have been found A. trifoliata and A. trifoliata. var. As a result, these six compounds can be considered marker compounds that distinguish three Akebia species. The antioxidant activities results indicated that the antioxidants of three Akebia species were the same in different antioxidative test systems. A. trifoliata (IC50: 2.28–6.97 mg·mL−1) and A. trifoliata. var (IC50: 2.09–6.87 mg·mL−1) showed 2–3 times higher antioxidant activity than A. quinata (IC50: 5.56–11.21 mg·mL−1). This study reveals the antioxidant activity differences of three Akebia species, laying a foundation for further development and utilization. This type of study can lead to the identification of a compound that, with further work and more extensive studies, has the potential to be used as a biomarker, in this case to distinguish different medicinal species.}

These diseases often demands a long-term pharmacotherapy, drug and treatment monitoring and regular follow-ups. However, the treatment regimen may be hindered as both patient-compliance and medication adherence are imperative factors for optimum therapeutic effect, and any aberrations associated with the latter may beget a change in the dosing, leading to dose-related adverse effects. However, the utilization of 3D printed personalized medicines may be a panacea for these problems, significantly reducing the need for dosing errors, treatment monitoring and regular follow-ups with healthcare providers. This article aims to extrapolate the utility of various additive manufacturing and 3D printed medicines for the management of chronic diseases, recent advancements and observations in the latter, and the impediments that need to be addressed before launching these medicines in the commercial markets.}

Thus, a genetic response to explain Cd transportation and resistance was necessary and critical for dealing with remediation. In this study, L. Chuanxiong was stressed by 0.13 (T0), 5 (T5) and 10 (T10) mg/kg Cd with comparative transcriptome analysis. Cd stored in L. Chuanxiong roots was c. 15 times higher than in aboveground plant parts. Zinc-regulated transporters (ZRT) and ABC-binding cassette transporters (ABC) genes were the major Cd-carriers in L. Chuanxiong cell wall. Moreover, the higher the Cd level, the more significantly up-regulated expression of ZRT and ABC. Metallothioneins (MTs) and Glutathione (GSH) genes were involved in Cd-binding inside L. Chuanxiong cells. Furthermore, Cd adsorption induced the genes related to cell antioxidant activities such as peroxidase, heat shock proteins and peptide methiomine sulfoxide reductase to deal with reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, and the expression of those genes increased as Cd level increased. Biosynthesis of the activate ingredients ferulic acid in L. Chuanxiong was greatly influenced by Cd stress, presenting as the first key enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) significantly down-regulated. These novel findings provide a theoretical basis for Cd-control in medicinal plants.}

The ever-increasing population has, however, dramatically increased the burden on our arable land to meet nutritional demand. Concomitantly, and in part due to poor nutrition, we are faced with massive increases in chronic diseases, meaning the need for medicine has also increased. Here, we look back on research in these areas, surveying the polyphenols as a case study for health-conferring metabolites. We conclude that the tools that will allow us to breed more nutritious crops are all at hand. We stress that collaboration between plant and medical research needs to be intensified in order to improve our understanding of the bioactivities. In doing so, we attempt to draw a roadmap for the use of plants for mid-21st Century human health.}

abstract = {Genotypic divergence is a term adapted from population genetics and intimately linked to evolution. We use divergence here to emphasize the differences that set individuals apart in any cohort. The history of genetics is filled with descriptions of genotypic differences, but causal inference of interindividual biological variation has been scarce. We suggest that the practice of precision medicine requires a divergent approach, an approach dependent on the causal interpretation of previous convergent (and preliminary) knowledge in the field. This knowledge has relied on convergent descriptive syndromology (lumping), which has overemphasized a reductionistic gene determinism on the quest of seeking associations without causal understanding. Regulatory variants with small effect and somatic mutations are some of the modifying factors that lead to incomplete penetrance and intrafamilial variable expressivity often observed in apparently monogenic clinical disorders. A truly divergent approach to precision medicine requires splitting, that is, the consideration of different layers of genetic phenomena that interact causally in a nonlinear fashion. This chapter reviews convergences and divergences in genetics and genomics, aiming to discuss what can be causally understood to approximate the as-yet utopian lands of Precision Medicine for patients with neurodegenerative disorders.}

abstract = {Background & Aim
At the forefront of therapeutic delivery is an array of vectors and targeting methods that hold immense promise for precision medicine in cell and gene therapies. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated RNA and circular RNA (circRNA) that each possess distinct and inherent properties, empowering researchers with tools to navigate the intricate challenges of specificity and efficacy in cell and gene therapy applications. Here we present a comprehensive RNA synthesis and characterization workflow.
Methods, Results & Conclusion
Starting with Sanger validation of the template DNA to verify sequence, de novo synthesis of mRNA and circRNA, including CAP1 and complex polyA regions, highly accurate research-grade RNA in both linear and circular forms is created. This optimized synthetic workflow eliminates current limitations in quality, scalability, and speed of in vitro transcription (IVT), maximizing potential for success of RNAs in downstream applications. RNA is purified by LiCl precipitation, and a non-denaturing gel is used is then applied to verify RNA size and quality with an RNaseR tolerance test. Following IVT, confirmation of an intact full-length mRNA including exact length of the polyA tail is critical to ensure appropriate RNA stability and translation. Using a novel approach, full-length manufactured RNA molecules are sequenced using PacBio long-read technology. This approach involves 3’ adapter ligation and template switching during reverse transcription to keep the full length polyA tail intact. Following amplification and adapter ligation, the final library is then sequenced using PacBio Single-Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) long-read sequencing technology. This method allows for full-length sequencing of products up to and beyond 10kb without limitations or bias due to repetitive sequence or C/G content. Crucially, this new method preserved the entire length of the polyA tail enabling sensitive and specific counting of the polyA tail length. In addition to sequence fidelity, this NGS approach offers read-depth sufficient to identify and confirm overall sample purity, including intermediate and alternative products present within the sample. This full end-to-end workflow can be effectively used to accelerate mRNA therapeutic development.}

Forms of knowledge that differ from dominant ‘Western’ knowledge are either not recognized and valued as equal, or are misused for land reoccupation and knowledge appropriation that further settler colonialism. Drawing on the conceptual framing of epistemic justice, biopiracy and biocolonialism we introduce the concept of bioepistemicide and analyse possible implications of the rising bioeconomy agenda for Indigenous peoples in the Brazilian Amazon. While many argue the value of Indigenous knowledges in the context of bioeconomy, it remains unclear how issues concerning epistemic plurality and epistemic injustices will be addressed. Among the most seriously questioned issues are intellectual property rights and ownership. Focusing on the Indigenous medicine Kambo, the secretion of a tropical frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor), we explore if and how bioeconomy governance and initiatives in Brazil address the epistemic injustices that may arise in Amazonian Indigenous territories. We take the perspective that epistemic plurality and conflicts may trigger the transformations needed to tackle epistemic injustices. Based on our case study, we argue that bioeconomy can only challenge epistemic hierarchies if it steps outside of colonial settler rationality and sovereignty regarding the very ideas of nature and ‘traditional knowledge’ which in the first place enable new forms of colonialism, like biocolonialism. We conclude with suggestions on how to embrace epistemic pluralism and strengthen the role and positionality of Indigenous knowledges in the implementation of bioeconomy in the Amazon.}

abstract = {Natural substances are increasingly being used as cancer treatments. Scutellarin, as a flavonoid, recently has been identified in a Chinese herbal extract called Erigeron breviscapus (Vant.). Scutellarin is being researched for its potential benefits due to the discovery that it possesses a variety of biological effects, such as neuroprotective, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral properties. In addition to these biological functions, scutellarin has also been found to have anti-tumor properties. The underlying mechanisms of scutellarin's anticancer activity involve its ability to inhibit various signaling pathways, such as Jak/STAT, ERK/AMPK, and Wnt/β-catenin. Additionally, scutellarin activates intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, which causes the death of tumor cells, interrupts the cell cycle, and promotes its arrest. By limiting metastasis, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and other tumorigenic processes, scutellarin also reduces the aggressiveness of tumors. Despite its promising anticancer activity, scutellarin faces several challenges in its clinical development, including poor solubility, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, it has been suggested that certain modifications can enhance the pharmacogenetic capabilities of scutellarin to decrease its limited water solubility. In conclusion, scutellarin represents a potential candidate for cancer treatment and further studies are needed to explore its clinical utility and optimize its therapeutic potential.}

abstract = {Obesity is a chronic and complex disease that can negatively impact health, functioning and quality of life. In the past decade, obesity prevalence's largest growth occurred in older adults, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. By the year 2030, an estimated 50% of the population over 65 is likely to be obese. Until recently, little attention has been given to obesity as a chronic disease, and those living with obesity encounter challenges accessing high quality medical care. Despite growing evidence for bariatric and obesity medicine, these treatments remain inaccessible for most patients. Obesity medicine is a newer and growing field, yet research that is focused on older adults with obesity lags behind. This symposium will focus on three areas related to obesity and older adults. Dr. Gentry will discuss weight stigma, often encountered by patients with obesity in the healthcare setting, and its impact on emotional and physical health. Cases and group discussion will be used to explore potential weight bias amongst participants and discuss strategies to mitigate this bias in working with older adults. Dr. Beito will review the complex connections between obesity and frailty syndrome in older adults. This session will engage the audience with case examples focusing on evidence-based treatment recommendations to help those individuals experiencing both obesity and frailty syndrome. Dr. Boyle will review the evaluation of patients with concerns about obesity, focusing on the potential role of psychiatrists and other mental health providers. Non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic tools will be discussed so psychiatrists and mental health providers can consider options to implement in one's own practice or to refer patients for weight management services. Ultimately, the goal is to raise awareness of this complex problem and provide clinically helpful information to improve care for older patients with obesity. This symposium is sponsored by the AAGP's IDEA committee.}

Study Design
The professional sends the case report, clinical images, and complementary exams of patients, if appropriate, remotely by smartphone, via Whatsapp® (https://www.whatsapp.com/?lang=pt_br).
Results
Since the beginning of the program, over a 14-month period, dentistry professionals from 40 municipalities received dental advice, and 207 teleconsultations and 76 face-to-face consultations were carried out; 24 cases were hypothesized as malignant lesions, and had their medical treatment conducted and followed up by a multidisciplinary team, when appropriate. Another 52 cases were consulted in our Oral Diagnosis Service.
Conclusion
Our Teleconsultation program in Oral Medicine, which began as an experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, represents an important tool to streamline the flow of diagnoses of new suspected cases of oral cancer for the Oncology services in the North Macro-region of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which causes irreversible central vision loss among the elderly population. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), including formulas, acupuncture and herbs, has been used in the treatment of AMD for thousands of years and is currently used by many AMD patients around the world.
Aim of the review
A comprehensive, in-depth literature review examining the use of TCM in the treatment of AMD has yet to be compiled. This review will improve current knowledge relating to the use of TCM and will open new avenues of exploration in developing new drugs for the treatment of AMD.
Methods
A literature search of the PubMed database, Web of Science, Google Scholar and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed using relevant terms and keywords related to TCM in the treatment of AMD. Related books, PhD and master's theses were also researched.
Results
The TCM-based interpretation of AMD has been used to establish a theoretical foundation for understanding the effect of TCM formulas and acupuncture on AMD. The possible mechanism of action of common Chinese herbs has also been discussed in detail.
Conclusion
TCM is a promising treatment option of AMD patients. However, lack of rigorous scientific evidence has limited the impact and uptake of TCM therapy. Future research should focus on improving understanding of the mechanism of action and bioactive components of TCM therapies.}

abstract = {Background
A growing literature demonstrates the value of the proactive consultation-liaison psychiatry model for health care systems through reductions in hospital length of stay. Few studies include financial outcomes.
Objective
We evaluated the return on investment of a 1-year proactive consultation-liaison psychiatry pilot in a hospital medicine unit.
Methods
We used a pre-post method with an active comparison of three hospital medicine units with regular psychiatric consultation on demand. We staffed the pilot unit with one full-time psychiatrist who focused on early case finding, close communication with unit staff, frequent follow-up visits, and proactive discharge planning. We assessed the 1-year change in mean length of stay for all patients receiving psychiatric consultation, from which we estimated the direct contribution margin from bed-backfills and the program's return on investment.
Results
On the pilot unit, the percent of discharges that received psychiatric consultation increased from 7.34% to 13.79%, and the length of stay for patients who consulted declined by a mean of 1.82 days (P < 0.05), as compared to an increase of 0.15 days (P > 0.05) on the usual-care units. The pilot unit reduction in length of stay saved 451.71 days in total, allowing for 73.81 bed-backfills, a direct contribution margin of $419,343 (95% confidence interval, $50,754 to $787,933), a net direct contribution margin of $298,245 (-$70,344 to $666,835), and an return on investment of 132% (−31% to 295%).
Conclusion
This study strengthens existing evidence for the relative cost-effectiveness of proactive consultation-liaison psychiatry for hospital medicine compared with usual psychiatric consultation on demand.}

abstract = {Outcomes
1. Identify strategies to engage residents in participating in and documenting advance care planning (ACP) discussions on an inpatient medicine service. 2. Identify contributing factors to disparities in ACP documentation among Latinx patients and interventions to address such factors.
Background
Advance care planning (ACP) promotes goal-concordant care and improves patient experience for patients with serious illness. A University of California San Francisco (UCSF) quality improvement initiative identified a disparity in ACP documentation rates between Latinx patients and all hospitalized medicine patients (median relative disparity ratio of 0.8 for Latinx to all patients) from May 2020 to April 2021, which persisted regardless of primary language.
Project goals
The 2021–2022 UCSF internal medicine resident quality improvement project goal was to increase ACP documentation rates for admitted Latinx patients and increase the relative disparity ratio to a target range of 0.9–1.2 for Latinx patients compared to non-Latinx patients, while maintaining overall ACP documentation rates at 50% or higher for the target population of admitted medicine patients with age ≥ 75 years or with advanced illness on the resident teaching service.
Project plan and interventions
To improve awareness of disparities in ACP documentation, we enacted a communication campaign that included posters, announcements, and biweekly performance feedback to inpatient medicine teams. To guide trainees in initiating ACP with Latinx patients, we conducted a literature review and created resources summarizing best practices for culturally sensitive goals-of-care discussions. We assessed our interventions by conducting interviews with residents, monitoring communication outreach, and assessing biweekly team performance.
Results
We reached our goals with a relative disparity ratio of 1.0 (Latinx 59%, n=87/148 and non-Latinx 59%, n=867/1480) and overall ACP documentation rate of 59% between July 2021 and June 2022.
Discussion and next steps
Planned next steps include prioritizing interventions to continue going forward and evaluating whether increased ACP documentation rates have resulted in a change in documentation quality through chart reviews. Sustainably improving rates of ACP documentation on a teaching service with constant team turnover requires frequent visible reminders and tips on incorporating ACP conversations and documentation into daily workflow.}

Yet, economic evaluation data, if available, are scarce and the availability of such data is even more limited for medium- and low-income countries, especially those with poor proliferation of genomics and genetic testing services. As such, there is wide variation in the clinical application of personalized medicine between low- and high-income countries. In this chapter, we review economic evaluation studies conducted in medium- and low-income countries around the world, especially those with poor proliferation of genomics and genetic testing services. Using high-income European countries as a model of clinical application, we find that economic evaluation studies in pharmacogenomics are still in their infancy for the majority of the medium- and low-income countries European countries. The examples presented suggest that economic evaluation studies will need to be adapted and replicated in every country for policymakers to be fully informed prior to the implementation of a pharmacogenomic-guided medical intervention. Given this, generic economic models are required that allow key variables, such as allele frequency and test and treatment costs, to vary by country. Such models are also discussed herein.}

A total of 42 samples were collected from all government veterinary clinics and private veterinary pharmacies in Gondar zones by mystery shoppers from October, 2020 to January, 2021. All samples were visually and physically inspected for proper labeling and packaging. Samples were evaluated based on Pharmacopoeias and manufacturers' methods for identification, assay, dosage uniformity, dissolution, disintegration, hardness, and friability tests. All samples passed the visual inspection criteria outlined in the joint WHO/FIP/USP checklist. In general, 80.95% (34/42) of the products examined were substandard failing one or more quality test parameters, including all albendazole (30/30) and fenbendazole (4/4) samples. However, all of the ivermectin samples (8/8) passed the quality test parameters investigated in this work. The study had indicated that low quality veterinary albendazole and fenbendazole products are incredibly common in the study sites. The most crucial quality features investigated as failure were friability and disintegration. Thus, regulations and enforcements that guarantee quality of veterinary anthelminthic medications should be strictly in place in the study area and in the country.}

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to prevent and treat viral epidemics and plagues for over 2,500 years. In the guidelines on fighting against COVID-19, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has recommended certain TCM formulas, namely Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG), Lianhua Qingwen granule (LHQWG), Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD), Xuanfei Baidu granule (XFBD), Xuebijing injection (XBJ), and Huashi Baidu granule (HSBD) for treating COVID-19 infected individuals. Among these six TCM formulas, JHQGG and LHQWG effectively treated mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 infections. XFBD therapy is recommended for mild COVID-19 infections, while XBJ and HSBD effectively treat severe COVID-19 infections. The internationalization of TCM faces many challenges due to the absence of a clinical efficacy evaluation system, insufficient research evidence, and a lack of customer trust across the globe. Therefore, evidence-based research is crucial in battling this infectious disease. This review summarizes SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the history of TCM used to treat various viral epidemics, with a focus on six TCM formulas. Based on the evidence, we also discuss the composition of various TCM formulas, their underlying therapeutic mechanisms, and their role in curing COVID-19 infections. In addition, we evaluated the roles of six TCM formulas in the treatment and prevention of other influenza diseases, such as influenza A (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Furthermore, we highlighted the efficacy and side effects of single prescriptions used in TCM formulas.}

abstract = {Purpose
To assess dose levels in routine nuclear medicine (NUC) procedures in Austria as a prior to a legislative update of the National Diagnostic Reference Levels (NDRL).
Method
As part of a nationwide survey of common NUC-examinations between June 2019 and November 2019, data sets were collected from 33 Austrian hospitals with NUC equipment. All hospitals were asked to report the NUC imaging devices in use (model, type, year of manufacture, detector material, collimators), the standard protocol parameters for selected examinations (standard activity, collimator, average acquisition time, reconstruction type, use of time-of-flight) and to report data from 10 representative examinations (e.g. injected activity, weight), incl. the most common NUC-examinations for planar imaging/SPECT and PET. Median/mean values for injected activity were calculated and compared to current Austrian and international NDRL. A Pearson correlation coefficient was computed comparing different variables.
Results
In total, all 33 hospitals (100% response rate) reported data for this study for 60 SPECT devices, 21 PET/CT devices and 23 scintigraphy devices. Fixed activity values for scintigraphy/SPECT and PET were employed by about 90% and 56% of the hospitals, respectively. The most widely performed examinations for scintigraphy/SPECT are bone imaging, thyroid imaging, renal imaging (with MAG3/EC) and lung perfusion imaging (in 88% of the hospitals) and F-18 FDG-PET studies for oncology indications (in 100% of the hospitals). Significant correlations were found for patient weight and injected activity (scintigraphy/SPECT), use of iterative reconstruction and injected activity (PET) as well as size of field-of-view and injected activity (PET).
Conclusions
The reported injected activity levels were comparable to those in other countries. However, for procedures for which NDRL exist, deviations in injected activities of >20% compared to the NDRL were found. These deviations are assumed to result mainly from advances in technology but also from deviations between NDRL and prescribed activities as given in the information leaflets of the radiopharmaceuticals.}

It also explores what approaches the industry could adopt to make the incorporation of gender-specific medicine viable, financially and strategically. Finally, it emphasizes the importance that gender-specific pharmaceuticals would have in global health care.}

Publications in this area can include articles that are hypothesis driven with a scientific methodology ranging from randomized controlled trials to pre- and postintervention work. Publications can also include work that would not be strictly defined as research. These would include descriptions of interventions at institutional levels, quality improvement efforts, and theoretical modelling for process improvement.

abstract = {Hair regenerative medicine is a promising approach to treat hair loss. The replication of in vivo tissue configurations and microenvironments, such as hair follicle germs, has been studied to prepare tissue grafts for hair regenerative medicine. However, such approaches should be scalable, because a single patient with alopecia requires thousands of tissue grafts. In this paper, we propose an approach for the scalable and automated preparation of highly hair-inductive tissue grafts using a bioprinter. Two collagen droplets (2 µL each) containing mesenchymal and epithelial cells were placed adjacent to each other to fabricate hair-follicle-germ-like grafts. During three days of culture, the pairs of microgel beads were spontaneously contracted by cell traction forces, whereas the two cell types remained separated, where the densities of the cells and collagen were enriched more than 10 times. This approach allowed us to fabricate submillimeter objects printed with millimeter-order accuracy, facilitating scalable and automated tissue graft preparation. Because of mesenchymal–epithelial interactions, hair microgels (HMGs, i.e., collagen- and cell-enriched microgels) efficiently regenerate hair follicles and shafts when transplanted into the back skin of mice. However, the generated hair shafts mostly remain under the skin. Therefore, we printed microgel beads onto surgical suture guides arrayed on a stage. The microgel beads were contracted along with the suture guides in culture prior to transplantation. The guide-inserted HMGs significantly improved hair-shaft sprouting through the skin, owing to the control of the orientation of the HMGs transplanted into the skin. This approach is a promising strategy to advance hair regenerative medicine.
Statement of significance
This study proposes an approach for the scalable and automated preparation of highly hair-inductive grafts using a bioprinter. Two collagen droplets containing mesenchymal and epithelial cells were placed adjacently. Cell traction forces caused the pairs of microgel beads to spontaneously contract in culture. Because of mesenchymal–epithelial interactions, hair microgels (HMGs) efficiently regenerated hair follicles on the back skin of mice. However, the generated hair shafts remained mostly beneath the skin. Therefore, we printed microgel beads onto surgical suture guides arrayed on a stage. The guide-inserted HMGs significantly improved hair-shaft sprouting through the skin owing to the control of the orientation of the HMGs in the skin. This approach represents a promising strategy for advancing hair regenerative medicine.}

abstract = {Objectives
Gender disparities continue to exist in emergency medicine (EM) despite increasing percentages of women in medical school and residencies. Prior studies in other male dominated industries have shown using masculine or feminine-coded language in job advertisements affects the proportion of male versus female applicants who choose to apply for those jobs. The goal of this study was to determine if gender-coding exists in EM job advertisements, and to see if there were differences between academic vs. non-academic jobs or administrative vs. non-administrative jobs.
Methods
This was a cross sectional study of EM jobs advertised in the United States on 13 academic and non-academic medical job databases from September 2020–February 2021. Using a gender decoder program based on prior research by Gaucher et al. on gendered wording in job advertisements, we analyzed each job to determine if the job advertisement was overall highly masculine, masculine, highly feminine, feminine, or neutral. Each job was categorized as academic, non-academic, administrative, or non-administrative. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis.
Results
Seventy-four EM job advertisements were posted during the study period. Forty-four (59.4%) of these coded out as masculine or strongly masculine, 18 (24.3%) coded out as feminine or strongly feminine, and 12 (16.2%) were neutral. Only one job advertisement contained no gender-coded words. There were no differences in the gender-coding of academic, non-academic, or administrative jobs.
Conclusion
Job advertisements for EM physicians tend to contain more masculine-coded language. Almost all job advertisements for emergency medicine physicians in this study contained at least one gender-coded word. Further studies could explore whether changing the language of job advertisements in EM has an impact on the proportion of women who choose to apply to EM jobs.}

abstract = {Objective
To develop new diagnostic criteria for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) that are appropriate for use across the lifespan and in sports, civilian trauma, and military settings.
Design
Rapid evidence reviews on 12 clinical questions and Delphi method for expert consensus.
Participants
The Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Brain Injury Special Interest Group convened a Working Group of 17 members and an external interdisciplinary expert panel of 32 clinician-scientists. Public stakeholder feedback was analyzed from 68 individuals and 23 organizations.
Results
The first 2 Delphi votes asked the expert panel to rate their agreement with both the diagnostic criteria for mild TBI and the supporting evidence statements. In the first round, 10 of 12 evidence statements reached consensus agreement. Revised evidence statements underwent a second round of expert panel voting, where consensus was achieved for all. For the diagnostic criteria, the final agreement rate, after the third vote, was 90.7%. Public stakeholder feedback was incorporated into the diagnostic criteria revision prior to the third expert panel vote. A terminology question was added to the third round of Delphi voting, where 30 of 32 (93.8%) expert panel members agreed that ‘the diagnostic label ‘concussion’ may be used interchangeably with ‘mild TBI’ when neuroimaging is normal or not clinically indicated.’
Conclusions
New diagnostic criteria for mild TBI were developed through an evidence review and expert consensus process. Having unified diagnostic criteria for mild TBI can improve the quality and consistency of mild TBI research and clinical care.}

Breakthroughs in stem cell research (SCR) and regenerative medicine (RM) have attracted significant public attention worldwide. Simultaneously, scientific communities and science policies have tried to establish appropriate governance of SCR and RM. In this context, effective communication between scientific communities and the public is regarded as a key factor. However, the diversity of public attitudes and interests has not been sufficiently examined, especially the differences across countries.
Methods
We conducted an international comparison of public attitudes toward SCR and RM. We circulated an internet questionnaire among people in six countries: Japan, South Korea, the United States, the UK, Germany, and France. We collected 100 valid responses from each country, and a total of 600 responses were obtained.
Results
Our key findings are the diversity of interests in RM, which can be expressed as user pragmatism, governance and handling of RM, risk, and benefit, and scientific interests. The priority of interests varied across the six countries, and the variations may be influenced by the political, social, cultural, and media contexts of SCR and RM in each country.
Conclusion
The implications can contribute to a deeper understanding of the diversity of public attitudes, and bring about an appropriate examination of a wide range of ethical and social concerns of SCR and RM in global contexts.}

To that end, however, we need fully understand mechanisms of disease that will drive the design of novel therapies and innovative approaches. For rare diseases (RDs) which individually affect low numbers of people (< 1:2000), but together, affect 300 million (∼10% of the world population) the constraints are greater. This is because: 1) there is limited knowledge on RD physiopathology; 2) the low number of patients strongly limits clinical trials; 3) there is low commercial interest by pharma; 4) when specific drugs reach the market, their high cost precludes their reaching all those who need them. Several possibilities that can help mitigate these barriers are discussed here, including orphan drug designation, drug repurposing, break-down into theratypes (as currently in place for Cystic Fibrosis), or novel precision-medicine-based approaches.}

This may explain the lack of serious consideration or remedial action by medical associations and governments in negotiations, or tariff and compensation processes. Our study employs 2016 Canadian Census data linked to Canada Revenue Agency taxation records. Rather than focusing on gross billings, we model physician net earnings (after overhead expenses and controlling for hours/weeks of work) including dividends from corporations. Using OLS, and unconditional quantile regression to document the gap across the earnings distribution, we observe that Canadian female physicians, on average, earn 9.3% less than their male counterparts. The average adjusted gap is slightly smaller for family physicians (8.5%) than other specialists (10.2%). Beyond averages, at the top of the income distribution the gap is double that at the median for both family physicians and other specialists. The gap also varies across provinces, from 6.6% in Quebec to 19.8% in Manitoba. Although our results yield somewhat smaller estimates than those from studies using billings/self-reported income, the magnitudes remain appreciable. The findings substantiate the claim that the gender pay gap in Canadian medicine is pervasive.}

abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. Most patients are already in the mid to advanced stages during the consultation and the survival rate is less than 23 % with a poor prognosis. Therefore, effective dialectical diagnosis of advanced cancer can guide individualized treatment to improve survival. Phospholipids are the building blocks of cell membranes and abnormal phospholipid metabolism is associated with plentiful diseases. Most studies of disease markers use blood as a sample. However, urine covers extensive metabolites that are produced during the body's metabolic processes. Therefore, the study of markers in urine can be used as a complement to improve the diagnosis rate of marker diseases. Moreover, urine is characterized by high water content, high polarity, and high inorganic salt, therefore the detection of phospholipids in urine is challenging. In this study, an original Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-titanium dioxide (TiO2) composite film for sample pre-treatment coupled with the LC-MS/MS method for the determination of phospholipids in the urine with high selectivity and low matrix effects was prepared and developed. The extraction process was scientifically optimized by the single-factor test. After systematic validation, the established method was successfully applied to the accurate determination of phospholipid substances in the urine of lung cancer patients and healthy subjects. In conclusion, the developed method has great potential for the development of lipid enrichment analysis in urine and can be used as a beneficial tool for cancer diagnosis and Chinese medicine syndrome typing.}

Increases in the potency of marijuana have coincided with increases in the rates of misuse, particularly among youth. At the same time, a profit-driven marijuana industry has emerged to supply these products and attempt to convince the general public of their benefits. Marijuana is not safe or risk-free; the unintended side effects of use should not be ignored by users or public health professionals.}

abstract = {Overexpression of SNCA has been implicated in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, particularly Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While PD and DLB share some clinical and pathological similarities, each disease presents distinct characteristics, including the primary affected brain region and neuronal type. We aimed to develop neuronal-type-specific SNCA-targeted epigenome therapies for synucleinopathies. The system is based on an all-in-one lentiviral vector comprised of CRISPR-dSaCas9 and guide RNA (gRNA) targeted at SNCA intron 1 fused with a synthetic repressor molecule of Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)/ methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCp2) transcription repression domain (TRD). To achieve neuronal-type specificity for dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, the system was driven by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoters, respectively. Delivering the system into human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons from a patient with the SNCA triplication resulted in efficient and neuronal-type-specific downregulation of SNCA-mRNA and protein. Furthermore, the reduction in SNCA levels by the gRNA-dSaCas9-repressor system rescued disease-related cellular phenotypes including Ser129-phophorylated α-synuclein, neuronal viability, and mitochondrial dysfunction. We established a novel neuronal-type-specific SNCA-targeted epigenome therapy and provided in vitro proof of concept using human-based disease models. Our results support the therapeutic potential of our system for PD and DLB and provide the foundation for further preclinical studies in animal models toward investigational new drug (IND) enablement and clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background
This “Anti-Obesity Medications and Investigational Agents: An Obesity Medicine Association Clinical Practice Statement 2022” is intended to provide clinicians an overview of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anti-obesity medications and investigational anti-obesity agents in development.
Methods
The scientific information for this Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is based upon published scientific citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by the Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
This CPS describes pharmacokinetic principles applicable to those with obesity, and discusses the efficacy and safety of anti-obesity medications [e.g., phentermine, semaglutide, liraglutide, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, and orlistat, as well as non-systemic superabsorbent oral hydrogel particles (which is technically classified as a medical device)]. Other medications discussed include setmelanotide, metreleptin, and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. Data regarding the use of combination anti-obesity pharmacotherapy, as well as use of anti-obesity pharmacotherapy after bariatric surgery are limited; however, published data support such approaches. Finally, this CPS discusses investigational anti-obesity medications, with an emphasis on the mechanisms of action and summary of available clinical trial data regarding tirzepatide.
Conclusion
This “Anti-Obesity Medications and Investigational Agents: An Obesity Medicine Association Clinical Practice Statement 2022” is one of a series of OMA CPSs designed to assist clinicians in the care of patients with pre-obesity/obesity.}

Here, Chinese medicine residue, FeSO4.7 H2O, FeCl3.6 H2O and Al(NO3)3 were used as raw materials to create an novel Al-loaded magnetic Chinese medicine residue-derived biochar (Al/Fe3O4/CMRB) adsorbent for effective fluoride adsorption. Al/Fe3O4/CMRB was characterized and used to conduct fluoride adsorption. In the pH range of 4–11, the fluoride adsorption reduced from 37.38 mg/g to 15.84 mg/g. The pseudo-second-order equation and Freundlich equation was the ideal model to describe the adsorption. The thermodynamic study confirmed the spontaneous and exothermic nature of fluoride adsorption by Al/Fe3O4/CMRB. Chloridion, nitrate, and sulfate had no influence on fluoride adsorption when a single anion and all three anions were present. phosphate created a more significant reduction of fluoride adsorption with rising concentrations, whether or not the other three anions were present. Al/Fe3O4/CMRB was an potential composite for aqueous fluoride removal. In addition, Al/Fe3O4/CMRB showed high separation efficiency in a contactless magnetic field, which demonstrated its potential use for large-scale applications in real samples.}

Because of the rising prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, the bacteriophage is now receiving interest again, with it application in skin infection or acne treatment. Moreover, bacteriophages also express their efficacy in wound healing or skin regeneration. Thanks to the development of bioengineering technology, phage display, which is a technique using bacteriophage as a tool, has recently been applied in many biotechnological and medical fields, especially in regenerative medicines. Bacteriophages can be used as nanomaterials, delivery vectors, growth factor alternatives, or in several bacteriophage display-derived therapeutics and stem cell technology. Although bacteriophage is no doubt to be a potential and effective alternative in modern medicine, there are still controversial evidence about the antibacterial efficacy as well as the affinity to expected targets of bacteriophage. Future mission is to optimize the specificity, stability, affinity and biodistribution of phage-derived substances. In this chapter, we focused on introducing several mechanisms and applications of bacteriophage and analyzing its future potential in regenerative medicines as well as cosmetics via previous research’s results.}

Non-compliance of medicines can cause economic losses and compromise the patient's health. In this work, the risks of false compliance/non-compliance decisions for parenteral antibiotics (cephalothin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) were evaluated on the basis of analytical results, measurement uncertainties and specification limits. Physicochemical and biological quality assays were performed according to pharmacopeial procedures. Measurement uncertainties were determined using the bottom-up approach or the probability of false-positive/false-negative results. The risks of false compliance/non-compliance decisions were estimated using the frequentist approach and Monte Carlo simulations. Guard-bands were determined through a validated spreadsheet for calculating univariate and multivariate acceptance limits. All risk values (particular risks and total risk, consumer's or producer's risk) were below the maximum permissible risk value. The univariate and multivariate guard-bands defined more restrictive specification values, reducing the risks of false compliance/non-compliance decisions. One antibiotic presented unsatisfactory results regarding the drug content and was classified as out of specification product. The application of risk management tools in the pharmaceutical area contributes to improving the quality and safety of products and supports decision-making.}

abstract = {Bronchiectasis is a highly complex entity that can be very challenging to investigate and manage. Patients are diverse in their aetiology, symptoms, risk of complications and outcomes. “Endotypes”- subtypes of disease with distinct biological mechanisms, has been proposed as a means of better managing bronchiectasis. This review discusses the emerging field of endotyping in bronchiectasis. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for randomized controlled trials (RCT), observational studies, systematic reviews and meta-analysis published from inception until October 2022, using the terms: “bronchiectasis”, “endotypes”, “biomarkers”, “microbiome” and “inflammation”. Exclusion criteria included commentaries and non-English language articles as well as case reports. Duplicate articles between databases were initially identified and appropriately excluded. Studies identified suggest that it is possible to classify bronchiectasis patients into multiple endotypes deriving from their co-morbidities or underlying causes to complex infective or inflammatory endotypes. Specific biomarkers closely related to a particular endotype might be used to determine response to treatment and prognosis. The most clearly defined examples of endotypes in bronchiectasis are the underlying causes such as immunodeficiency or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis where the underlying causes are clearly related to a specific treatment. The heterogeneity of bronchiectasis extends, however, far beyond aetiology and it is now possible to identify subtypes of disease based on inflammatory mechanisms such airway neutrophil extracellular traps and eosinophilia. In future biomarkers of host response and infection, including the microbiome may be useful to guide treatments and to increase the success of randomized trials. Advances in the understanding the inflammatory pathways, microbiome, and genetics in bronchiectasis are key to move towards a personalized medicine in bronchiectasis.}

Intensive care medicine (ICM) has the particularity of being a multidisciplinary specialty and its literature reflects this multidisciplinarity. However, the proportion of each field in this literature and its trend dynamics are not known. The objective of this study was to analyze the ICM literature, extract latent topics and search for the presence of research trends.
Material and methods
Abstracts of original articles from the top ICM journals, from their inception until December 31st, 2019, were included. This corpus was fed into a structural topic modeling algorithm to extract latent semantic topics. The temporal distribution was then analyzed and the presence of trends was searched by Mann-Kendall trends tests.
Results
Finally, 49,276 articles from 10 journals were included. After topic modeling analysis and experts' feedback, 124 research topics were selected and labeled. Topics were categorized into 19 categories, the most represented being respiratory, fundamental and neurological research. Increasing trends were observed for research on mechanical ventilation and decreasing trends for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Conclusions
This study reviewed all articles from major ICM journals in a comprehensive way. It provides a better understanding of ICM research landscape by analyzing the temporal evolution of latent research topics in the ICM literature.}
