abstract = {Ethnic pharmacological relevance
The causes of depression are complex. Many factors are involved in its pathogenesis, including the individual's biological and social environment. Although numerous studies have reported that the gut microbiota plays a significant role in depression, drugs that regulate the gut microbiota to treat depression have not yet been comprehensively reviewed. At the same time, more and more attention has been paid to the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in improving depression by regulating gut microbiota. In ancient times, fecal microbiota transplantation was recorded in TCM for the treatment of severe diseases. There are also records in Chinese ancient books about the use of TCM to adjust gut microbiota to treat diseases, which has opened up a unique research field in TCM. Therefore, this article focuses on the pharmacological effects, targets, and mechanisms of TCM in improving depression by mediating the influence of gut microbiota.
Aim of this review
To summarize the role the gut microbiota plays in depression, highlight potential regulatory targets, and elucidate the anti-depression mechanisms of TCMs through regulation of the gut microbiota.
Methods
A systematic review of 256 clinical trials and pharmaceutical studies published until June 2022 was conducted in eight electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, SciFinder, Research Gate, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Scopus, and China Knowledge Infrastructure), according to the implemented PRISMA criteria, using the search terms “traditional Chinese medicine,” “depression,” and “gut microbiota.”
Results
Numerous studies reported the effects of different gut bacteria on depression and that antidepressants work through the gut microbiota. TCM preparations based on compound Chinese medicine, the Chinese Materia Medica, and major bioactive components exerted antidepressant-like effects by improving levels of neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, kynurenine, and cytokines via regulation of the gut microbiota.
Conclusion
This review summarized the anti-depression effects of TCM on the gut microbiota, providing evidence that TCMs are safe and effective in the treatment of depression and may provide a new therapeutic approach.}

Moreover, a cutoff point is a crucial step in ensuring a minimal risk of clinical misclassification. Therefore complying with such statutory requirements is an essential part of obligatory good laboratory and clinical practices. In this concise report, we propose a novel methodology for establishing cutoff points for all samples exhibiting detectable levels of the measured parameter, even those from the disease-free group. Based on target specificity and sensitivity levels of 100 % and 95 %, a value of 1209 A is identified as the "best cutoff". In fact, the ROC decision matrixes play a crucial role in determining optimal cutoff points. The most effective discriminators are those that meet specified accuracy criteria. The selection process is influenced by finding the right clinical sensitivity/specificity trade-off.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Insomnia is a common form of sleep disorder. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds have definite curative effects and a low incidence of adverse reactions, which is recognized to be an effective intervention means for the treatment of insomnia.
Aim of the study
Based on mining the clinical research data of treating insomnia of yin deficiency syndrome (IYDS) with TCM compounds systematically, the study is to analyze the research hotspots and development trends in this field, explore the medication rule, evaluate the quality of research, so as to provide reference and direction for clinical application and scientific research in this field.
Materials and methods
The relevant literature was retrieved and managed by evidence-based medicine strategy and EndNote software respectively. The bibliometric method was used to mine and analyze data characteristics. The VOSviewer software was used to make visual knowledge maps, the IBM SPSS Modeler software was used for association rule analysis of herbs, and the Cochrane tool and MINORS scale were used for quality analysis of literature.
Results
(1) A total of 184 related studies were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. (2) The research popularity showed a dynamic upward trend and the research hotspot showed a trend of migration and refinement, etc. (3) The commonly used herbs in this field were Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H.F.Chow, etc; the commonly used TCM prescriptions were Huanglian Ejiao Decoction, etc; the commonly used dosage forms were traditional decoction, etc; the commonly used combinations of herbs included Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H.F.Chow-Poria cocos（Schw.）Wolf, etc. (4) The rate of the studies containing ethical review numbers and clear inclusion standards did not reach 50%, and the risk bias of methodological was high. However, a separate analysis of data showed that the specification of study design was on the rise obviously in recent years, and Meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis could confirm the effectiveness and stability of clinical efficacy which was the key indicator in treating IYDS with TCM prescriptions. There were significant differences among administration protocols of different clinical studies of the same name TCM compounds. However, the scientific significance of each unique dosing regimen were expected to be elaborated or discussed.
Conclusion
The clinical research number of TCM compounds treating IYDS was in a dynamic upward trend, and the outcome indicators tended to be diversified and detailed. The dosage forms mainly included decoction, supplemented by Chinese patent medicine. The design of clinical studies in this field was not standardized enough, but the key indicators were scientific and stable. We expected that later studies could pay more attention to improving the standardization of trial design, reducing the risk bias in the process of methodological design, conducting high-quality standardized multicenter, large-sample randomized controlled clinical trials to provide scientific evidence with high evidentiary strength, establishing the recognized administration protocols for the same name TCM prescriptions or clarifying the targeting of different protocols, and promoting the application and popularity of TCM compounds in treating IYDS.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), integrating patient preferences into decision-making process, has been widely used in the multimodality therapy of lung cancer. This study aimed to estimate patient preferences for treatment and shared decision-making (SDM) modes concerning inpatient TCM treatment of lung cancer in Shanghai in order to provide a basis for clinical decision-making process on TCM therapy for lung cancer.
Methods
This study was conducted among patients (n = 347) from nine tertiary hospitals in Shanghai by discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey and Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-patient version (SDM-Q-9) survey. The DCE was developed with the inclusion of the most relevant attributes at appropriate levels for the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The empirical data analyses of patients were performed using mixed logit models. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted.
Results
In total, 347 respondents completed the questionnaire. All attributes’ coefficients were statistically significant for patients’ preferences. Patients showed strong preferences for increasing disease control rate, relieving nausea and vomiting, reducing the risk of side effects, and were concerned about monthly out-of-pocket costs. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with a lower SDM-Q-9 score and those who were satisfied with medical services emphasized more importance of higher disease control rate. Furthermore, most of the patients (90.20%) self-reported a high willingness to use SDM during the decision-making process.
Conclusion
In Shanghai, patients mainly preferred SDM and considered disease control rate as the most essential attribute in the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The study findings could underscore the importance of considering patients’ preferences and promote SDM.}

Now, after many years of research and coincidental findings, it is believed that this relationship, termed “Nutrigenomics,” is certainly a factor of major importance in various conditions. In this review article, we discuss nutrigenomics, starting with basics definitions and enzymatic functions and ending with its palpable association with cancer. Now, diet is basically what we eat on a daily basis. Everything that enters through our alimentary tract ends up broken down to minute molecules and amino acids. These molecules interact with our microbiome and genome in discreet ways. For instance, we demonstrate how proper intake of probiotics enhances beneficial bacteria and may alleviate IBS and prevent colorectal cancer on the long term. We also show how a diet rich in folic acid is essential for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) function, which lowers risk of colorectal cancer. Also, we discuss how certain diets were associated with development of certain cancers. For example, red and processed meat are highly associated with colorectal and prostate cancer, salty diets with stomach cancer, and obesity with breast cancer. The modification of these diets significantly lowered the risk and improved prognosis of these cancers among many others. We also examined how micronutrients had a role in cancer prevention, as vitamin A and C exert anti-carcinogenic effects through their function as antioxidants. In addition, we show how folic acid prevent DNA mutations by enhancing protein methylation processes. Finally, after a systematic review of myriad articles on the etiology and prevention of cancer, we think that diet should be a crucial feature in cancer prevention and treatment programs. In the future, healthy diets and micronutrients may even be able to successively alter the liability to genetic mutations that result in cancer. It also will play a role in boosting treatment and improving prognosis of diagnosed cancers.}

abstract = {Introduction
Publication and peer review are fundamental to career advancement in science and academic medicine. Studies demonstrate that women are underrepresented in science publishing. We evaluated the gender distribution of contributors to Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (WEM) from 2010 through 2019.
Methods
We extracted author data from ScienceDirect, reviewer data from the WEM Editorial Manager database, and editorial board data from journal records. Gender (female and male) was classified using automated probability-based assessment with Genderize.io software.
Results
A total of 2297 unique authors were published over the 10-y span, generating 3613 authorships, of which gender was classified for 96% (n=3480). Women represented 26% (n=572) of all authors, which breaks down to 22% of all, 19% of first, 28% of second, and 18% of last authorships. Women represented 20% of peer reviewers (508/2517), 20% of reviewers-in-training (19/72), and 16% of editorial board members (7/45). The proportion of female authors, first authors, and reviewers increased over time. Women received fewer invitations per reviewer than men (mean 2.1 [95% CI 2.0-2.3] vs 2.4 [95% CI 2.3-2.5]; P=0.004), accepted reviews at similar rates (mean 73 vs 71%; P=0.214), and returned reviews 1.4 d later (mean 10.4 [CI 9.5-11.3] vs 9.0 d [95% CI 8.5-9.6]; P=0.005).
Conclusions
While female representation increased over the study period, women comprise a minority of WEM authors, peer reviewers, and editorial board members. Gender equity could be improved by identifying and eliminating barriers to participation, addressing any potential bias in review processes, implementing strategies to increase female-authored submissions, and increasing mentorship and training.}

The MGCx-T electrodes are prepared by KOH activation and carbonization with MG (momordica grosvenori shell). The influence of KOH addition amount and carbonization temperature on the properties of the prepared materials were studied. Resulting that MGC3–800 has good electrical conductivity, high specific surface area (1141 m2 g−1) and abundant pore structure. The maximum specific capacity reaches 228.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte. In the gelatin/ZnSO4 electrolyte, the specific capacity reaches a maximum of 186.1 mAh g−1. Additionally, it exhibits an energy density of 167.5 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 6300 W kg−1. Furthermore, exceptional cycling stability is observed with a capacity retention rate of 92.6 % after 10,000 cycles. Hence, the realization of an industry-effective strategy that not only utilizes biomass waste, but also produces high-performance zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor electrodes has been achieved.}

abstract = {Background
The incidence of HIV among adolescents remains high, and adolescents are known to participate in sexual behaviors that increase their risk for HIV, such as unprotected sex and sex with multiple partners. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be effective at preventing HIV when taken daily and is approved by the FDA for use in adolescents. Efforts to screen patients in adult emergency departments and connect them with PrEP services have been validated. We surveyed pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) providers to determine their knowledge of PrEP, prescribing practices, willingness to prescribe, and barriers to a screening protocol in the pediatric emergency department (PED).
Methods
We administered a survey to a multidisciplinary group of PEM providers to measure knowledge, use, willingness, and implementation barriers to PrEP as well as elements needed for a successful referral system.
Results
A total of 87 responses were included for analysis. While 79.1% of all providers had heard of PrEP, only 14.8% of prescribing providers had ever discussed PrEP with a patient, and none had ever prescribed PrEP. Overall, 76.3% of all providers were knowledgeable about PrEP based on answers to true/false questions, with prescribing providers significantly more likely to be knowledgeable compared to nurses (p = 0.005). Knowledgeable providers had higher willingness scores to refer for PrEP compared to providers who were not knowledgeable. Ninety-two percent of providers felt a PrEP referral process from the PED would be feasible. Creation of an eligibility algorithm and educational materials were the most common efforts providers preferred to make them more likely to refer for PrEP. The most notable barriers perceived by providers included patient noncompliance with therapy (20.9%), acceptance of PrEP discussion among patients and parents (19.8%), and cost of therapy (15.1%).
Conclusion
PEM providers are knowledgeable about PrEP but have little experience with discussing or prescribing PrEP. Their willingness to refer for PrEP and anticipated feasibility of a PrEP referral system is encouraging. These results support the need for future educational efforts among PEM providers and creation of referral systems for PrEP services from the PED.}

abstract = {Liquid biopsy, specifically the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offers a non-invasive approach for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis and management. However, its implementation in the clinical setting is difficult due to challenges such as low ctDNA yield and difficulty in understanding the mutation signals from background noise. This review highlights the crucial role of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these limitations and in improving discoveries in the field of liquid biopsy for HCC care. Combining AI with liquid biopsy data can offer a promising future for the discovery of novel biomarkers and an AI-powered clinical decision support system (CDSS) can turn liquid biopsy into an important tool for personalized management of HCC. Despite the current challenges, the integration of AI shows promise to significantly improve patient outcomes and revolutionize the field of oncology.}

Effective drugs for atrial fibrillation (AF) are lacking, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This study demonstrates that network proximity analysis of differentially expressed genes from atrial tissue to drug targets can help prioritize repurposed drugs for AF. Using enrichment analysis of drug-gene signatures and functional testing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived atrial-like cardiomyocytes, we identify metformin as a top repurposed drug candidate for AF. Using the active compactor, a new design analysis of large-scale longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data, we determine that metformin use is significantly associated with a reduced risk of AF (odds ratio = 0.48, 95%, confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.64, p < 0.001) compared with standard treatments for diabetes. This study utilizes network medicine methodologies to identify repurposed drugs for AF treatment and identifies metformin as a candidate drug.}

Recently, Professor Chunxue Bai and colleagues have proposed a definition of the Metaverse in Medicine as the medical Internet of Things (MIoT) facilitated using AR and/or VR glasses.
Methods
A multi-disciplinary panel of doctors and IT experts from Asia, the United States, and Europe analyzed published articles regarding expert consensus on the Medical Internet of Things, with reference to study results in the field of metaverse technology.
Findings
It is feasible to implement the three basic functions of the MIoT, namely, comprehensive perception, reliable transmission, and intelligent processing, by applying a metaverse platform, which is composed of AR and VR glasses and the MIoT system, and integrated with the technologies of holographic construction, holographic emulation, virtuality-reality integration, and virtuality-reality interconnection. In other words, through interactions between virtual and real cloud experts and terminal doctors, we will be able to carry out medical education, science popularization, consultation, graded diagnosis and treatment, clinical research, and even comprehensive healthcare in the metaverse. The interaction between virtual and real cloud experts and terminal users (including terminal doctors, patients, and even their family members) could also facilitate different medical services, such as disease prevention, healthcare, physical examination, diagnosis and treatment of diseases, rehabilitation, management of chronic diseases, in-home care, first aid, outpatient attendance, consultation, etc. In addition, it is noteworthy that security is a prerequisite for the Metaverse in Medicine, and a reliable security system is the foundation to ensure the normal operation of such a platform.
Conclusion
The application of a Cloud Plus Terminal platform could enable interaction between virtual and real cloud experts and terminal doctors, in order to realize medical education, science popularization, consultation, graded diagnosis and treatment, clinical research, and even comprehensive healthcare in the metaverse.}

abstract = {Background
Atypical EGFR mutations occur in 10%-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations and their sensitivity to classical epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is highly heterogeneous. Patients harboring one group of uncommon, recurrent EGFR mutations (G719X, S768I, L861Q) respond to EGFR-TKI. Exon 20 insertions are mostly insensitive to EGFR-TKI but display sensitivity to exon 20 inhibitors. Clinical outcome data of patients with very rare point and compound mutations upon systemic treatments are still sparse to date.
Patients and methods
In this retrospective, multicenter study of the national Network Genomic Medicine (nNGM) in Germany, 856 NSCLC cases with atypical EGFR mutations including co-occurring mutations were reported from 12 centers. Clinical follow-up data after treatment with different EGFR-TKIs, chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors were available from 260 patients. Response to treatment was analyzed in three major groups: (i) uncommon mutations (G719X, S7681, L861Q and combinations), (ii) exon 20 insertions and (iii) very rare EGFR mutations (very rare single point mutations, compound mutations, exon 18 deletions, exon 19 insertions).
Results
Our study comprises the largest thus far reported real-world cohort of very rare EGFR single point and compound mutations treated with different systemic treatments. We validated higher efficacy of EGFR-TKI in comparison to chemotherapy in group 1 (uncommon), while most exon 20 insertions (group 2) were not EGFR-TKI responsive. In addition, we found TKI sensitivity of very rare point mutations (group 3) and of complex EGFR mutations containing exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations independent of the combination partner. Notably, treatment responses in group 3 (very rare) were highly heterogeneous. Co-occurring TP53 mutations exerted a non-significant trend for a detrimental effect on outcome in EGFR-TKI-treated patients in groups 2 and 3 but not in group 1.
Conclusions
Based on our findings, we propose a novel nNGM classification of atypical EGFR mutations.}

abstract = {Objective
: To observe the treatment effect and immune regulation of aerosol inhalation of Chinese herbal medicine on elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).
Methods
: A total of 84 elderly patients with AECOPD, who were admitted to the Department of Geriatrics in Hangzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from March 2019 to December 2020, were randomly divided into an observation group(OG 42cases) and a control group (CG 42cases). In the OG, the patients were treated with routine western medicine. While in the OG, on the basis of common western medicine treatment, the aerosol inhalation of Chinese herbal medicine was added. The changes in lung function indexes(FEV1%, FVC,TLC) and blood gas analysis indexes(PaO2, PaCO2) were compared between two groups. Proinflammatory cytokines helper T cell 1(Th1 cell) secreted in serum (TNF-α,IL-12,TNf-γ) and anti-inflammatory cytokines helper T cell 2(Th2 cell)secreted in serum (IL-4,IL-6,IL-10) were also compared between groups. We also compared the incidence of fever, cough and asthma between the two groups during the study.
Results
: During the experiment, the lung function indexes (FEV1%,FVC) in the OG were higher than those in the CG, and the differences were of statistical significance(P < 0.01). The serum concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in the OG was lower than that in the CG, and the difference was statistically significant(P < 0.01). Meanwhile, the serum concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines was significantly higher in the OG(P < 0.01). The incidence of fever and the cough scores in the OG were lower than those in the CG(P < 0.05).
Conclusion
: Aerosol inhalation of Chinese herbal medicine perhaps takes part in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines and improves lung function of elderly patients with AECOPD. It may be a potential clinical treatment for the elderly patients with AECOPD.}

abstract = {Background
Siddha Medicine system is one among the oldest traditional systems of medicines in India and has its entire literature in the Tamil language in the form of poems (padal in tamil). Even if the siddha poems are available in public domain, they are not known to other parts of the world because, researchers of other languages are not able to understand the contents of these poems and there exists a language barrier. Hence there is a need to develop a system to extract structured information from these texts to facilitate searching, comparing, analysis and implementing.
Objective
This study aimed at creating a comprehensive digital database system that systematically stores information from classical Siddha poems and to develop a web portal to facilitate information retrieval for comparative and logical analysis of Siddha content.
Methods
We developed an expert system for siddha (eSS) that can collect, annotate classical siddha text, and visualizes the pattern in siddha medical prescriptions (Siddha Formulations) that can be useful for exploration in this system using modern techniques like machine learning and artificial learning. eSS has the following three aspects: (1) extracting data from Siddha classical text (2) defining the annotation method and (3) visualizing the patterns in the medical prescriptions based on multiple factors mentioned in the Siddha system of medicine. The data from three books were extracted, annotated and integrated into the developed eSS database. The annotations were used for analyzing the pattern in the drug prescriptions as a pilot work.
Results
Overall, 110 medicinal preparations from 2 Siddhars (Agathiyar and Theran) were extracted and annotated. The generated annotations were indexed into the data repository created in eSS. The system can compare and visualize individual and multiple prescriptions to generate a hypothesis for siddha practitioners and researchers.
Conclusions
We propose an eSS framework using standard siddha terminologies created by WHO to have a standard expert system for siddha. This proof-of-concept work demonstrated that the database can effectively process and visualize data from siddha formulations which can help students, researchers from siddha and other various fields to expand their research in herbal medicines.}

Nevertheless, the following issues remain in clinical practice: (1) The Cloud Experts are not available to dedicate themselves to popular science education, or to give professional lectures, at all times and in all settings. (2) The Cloud Experts are not available to provide guidance for the Terminal Doctors on diagnosis and treatment at all times and in all settings. (3) In clinical trials, the main researchers are not available to monitor the research or guide the team at all times and in all settings. (4) Due to the lack of real-time quality control at all times and in all settings, non-standard diagnosis and treatment, with the features of a handicraft workshop, still exist to a considerable degree. The real cause lies in the limitations of the Internet technology itself, which cannot facilitate communication at all times and in all settings between the Cloud Experts and the Terminal Doctors involved in graded diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the MIoT-based digital platforms need to be further improved, especially concerning the communication and interactions between humans and computers, and the integration and linkage between the virtual and real worlds.

Yet, most algorithms deployed in the healthcare context do not consider these aspects and do not account for bias detection. Missing these dimensions in algorithms used in medicine is a huge point of concern, as neglecting these aspects will inevitably produce far from optimal results and generate errors that may lead to misdiagnosis and potential discrimination. This paper explores how current algorithmic-based systems may reinforce gender biases and affect marginalized communities in healthcare-related applications. To do so, we bring together notions and reflections from computer science, queer media studies, and legal insights to better understand the magnitude of failing to consider gender and sex difference in the use of algorithms for medical purposes. Our goal is to illustrate the potential impact that algorithmic bias may have on inadvertent discriminatory, safety, and privacy-related concerns for patients in increasingly automated medicine. This is necessary because by rushing the deployment of AI technologies that do not account for diversity, we risk having an even more unsafe and inadequate healthcare delivery. By promoting the account for privacy, safety, diversity, and inclusion in algorithmic developments with health-related outcomes, we ultimately aim to inform the Artificial Intelligence (AI) global governance landscape and practice on the importance of integrating gender and sex considerations in the development of algorithms to avoid exacerbating existing or new prejudices.}

abstract = {Background
A French intersociety consensus on behalf the Société Française de Médecine Vasculaire and the Société de Chirurgie Vasculaire et Endovasculaire was proposed in 2021 for the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (LEAD). Recent studies have been published and an update of this consensus about the management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and hypertriglyceridemia was required.
Methods
A steering committee of 12 vascular physicians and surgeons defined questions of interest about LDLc and hypertriglyceridemia management. A French expert panel voted the proposals. Consensus was considered to have been achieved if more than 80% of the responses corresponded to either “Agreement” or “Disagreement”.
Results
Among the 56 experts who were asked to participate, 46 (82%) accepted. After the first round of the Delphi procedure, the 4 proposals reached consensus. The following suggestions and recommendations were approved: 1. For LEAD patients treated by the highest tolerated statin dose ± ezetimibe and who have an LDLc ≥0.70 g/L, we recommend adding a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor. 2. For LEAD patients treated by statin and who have elevated triglyceride level between ≥150 mg/dL and ≤500 mg/dL, we suggest adding Icosapent Ethyl. 3. Before adding Icosapent Ethyl in LEAD patients treated with statin, we suggest looking for symptoms that may suggest atrial fibrillation. 4. For LEAD patients treated by Icosapent Ethyl and who have symptoms that suggest atrial fibrillation, we recommend performing an electrocardiogram.
Conclusions

abstract = {Background
The Stock Visibility System (SVS) is a mobile application and web-based management tool used at public primary health care (PHC) facilities in South Africa to capture and monitor medicines availability, providing visibility at national level. Medicine stock-outs are prevalent despite the implementation of SVS, compromising patient care. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the use of the SVS at PHC level to provide future guidance.
Method
A cross-sectional study using a structured self-administered questionnaire among 206 HCPs at 21 randomly selected PHC facilities located in a health district in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Closed-ended questions were used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge on the SVS and practices on its use. A Likert scale was used to determine attitudes towards the SVS. Cronbach's alpha (α) was used to assess the internal consistency of the questionnaire and independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test statistical difference in the mean scores for KAP and socio-demographic variables. Association between knowledge and practices, and attitude and practices was determined using odds ratios (OR) and Chi-square.
Results
The majority (99.5%) of HCPs had previous training on SVS. Nearly two thirds (62.1%; 128/206) generally had good knowledge about the SVS and 76.7% (158/206) had positive attitudes towards the SVS while only 17.0% had a good practice score. There was no statistically significant association between KAP of HCPs on the use of the SVS, and sociodemographic variables (HCP qualification, age and sex). There was a significant association between the knowledge and practice scores (aOR: 5.44; 95% CI: 1.92–15.4; p = 0.001). Although positive attitudes, was associated with good practices, it was not statistically significant (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.46–3.22; p = 0.702).
Conclusions
HCPs in this district had poor practices when using SVS despite good knowledge and positive attitudes towards SVS and the higher the HCPs knowledge of SVS, the more desirable the practices on SVS. This underscores the need for continuous training of HCPs to ensure a constant and efficient supply of medicines to meet the health needs of the population.}

The gastric mucosa often undergoes many years of precancerous lesions of gastric cancer (PLGC) stages before progressing to gastric malignancy. Unfortunately, there are no effective Western drugs for patients with PLGC. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been proven effective in treating PLGC. Classical TCM formulas and chemical components isolated from some Chinese herbal medicines have been administered to treat PLGC, and the main advantage is their comprehensive intervention with multiple approaches and multiple targets. In this review, we focus on recent studies using TCM treatment for PLGC, including clinical observations and experimental research, with a focus on targets and mechanisms of drugs. This review provides some ideas and a theoretical basis for applying TCM to treat PLGC and prevent GC.}

Gastrointestinal ailments are some of the common conditions treated in homeopathy; yet only a few trials have explored the effects of individualized homeopathic medicines (IHMs) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Objective
To explore the efficacy of IHMs in treatment of IBS.
Design
Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting
Outpatient departments of Mahesh Bhattacharyya Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital, India.
Patients
Sixty patients suffering from IBS; randomized to receive either IHMs (n = 30) or identical-looking placebo (n = 30).
Interventions
IHMs or placebo in the mutual context of concomitant care in terms of dietary advice, yoga, meditation and exercises.
Main outcome measures
Primary – IBS quality of life (IBS-QOL) questionnaire; secondary –IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and EQ-5D-5L scores; all measured at baseline and every month, up to 3 months.
Results
Group differences and effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated on intention-to-treat (ITT) sample. Groups were comparable at baseline. Recruitment, retention and attrition rates were 64.5%, 91.7% and 8.3% respectively. Group differences in IBS-QOL total scores, IBS-SSS, EQ-5D-5L scores favored IHMs against placebo overall and at all the time points (all P < 0.001). Pulsatilla nigricans (n = 4, 6.7%) and Thuja occidentalis (n = 4, 6.7%) were the most frequently prescribed medicines. Barring some minor events unrelated to interventions, no harms or serious adverse events were recorded in either of the groups. Thus, IHMs acted significantly better than placebos in the treatment of IBS. Independent replications are warranted. [Trial registration: CTRI/2019/10/021632]}

abstract = {Background
Jingyin granules (JY), one patented Chinese herbal formula, have been advised for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. As of now, the safety and effectiveness of JY in treating COVID-19 patients were still to be evaluated.
Purpose
To investigate the safety and clinical effectiveness of JY in treating mild COVID-19 patients.
Study design
We carried out a prospective cohort study, as the highly infectious COVID-19 omicron variant ranged in Shanghai (ClinicalTrial.gov registration number: ChiCTR2200058692).
Methods
Participants infected with COVID-19, who were diagnosed as mild cases, were assigned to receive either JY (JY group) or traditional Chinese medicine placebo (placebo group) orally for 7 days. The primary clinical indicators were the RNA negative conversion rate (NCR) and the incidence of severe cases. The secondary clinical indicators were the negative conversion time (NCT), inpatient length of stay (ILOS), and the disappearance rates of clinical symptoms.
Results
Nine hundred participants were recruited in this clinical trial study, and 830 patients met the eligibility criteria. Seven hundred and ninety-one patients, accomplished the following-up assessment, including 423 cases of JY group and 368 cases of placebo group. NCR in JY group at 7-day posttreatment was considerably greater compared with placebo group (89.8% [380/423] vs 82.6% [304/368], P = 0.003). None of the patients with mild COVID-19 developed into severe cases. The median NCT of SARS-CoV-2 and ILOS in JY group were lesser than that in placebo group (4.0 [3.0,6.0]vs 5.0 [4.0,7.0] days, P < 0.001; 6.0 [4.0, 8.0] vs 7.0 [5.0, 9.0] days, P < 0.001). In both groups, the obvious improvement in clinical symptoms was observed, but the difference was not significant. In the subgroup of age ≤ 60 years, JY promoted SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative conversion (HR=1.242; 95% CI: 1.069-1.444, P < 0.001). No patients in both groups were reported as the case of serious adverse event.
Conclusion
JY maybe the potential medicine for treating mild COVID-19 patients, which had beneficial effects on increasing NCR, and shortening NCT and ILOS.}

abstract = {How ‘the patient’ is imagined has implications for ethical decision-making in clinical practice. Patients are predominantly conceived in an individualised manner as autonomous and independent decision-makers. Fields such as genomic medicine highlight the inadequacies of this conceptualisation as patients are likely to have family members who may be directly affected by the outcome of tests in others. Indeed, professional guidance has increasingly taken a view that genetic information should, at times, be regarded as of relevance to families, rather than individuals. What remains absent from discussions is an understanding of how those living through/with genomic testing articulate, construct, and represent patienthood, and what such understandings might mean for practice, particularly ethical decision-making. Employing the notion of ‘linked lives’ from lifecourse theory, this article presents findings from a UK-based qualitative longitudinal study following the experiences of those affected by the process and outcomes of genomic testing. The article argues that there is a discord between lived experiences and individualised notions of ‘the patient’ common in conventional bioethics, with participants predominantly locating their own decision-making within the matrix of linked lives in which they are embedded. In the quest to gain ‘answers’, many took an intra or intergenerational view, connecting their own experiences to those of past generations through familial narratives around probable explanations, and/or hopes and expectations for the health of imagined future generations. The article argues that a re-imagining of ‘the patient’, that reflects the complex and shifting nature of patienthood, will be imperative as genomic medicine is mainstreamed.}

abstract = {Background
The use of herbal medicine and alternative medicine is reported to be in up to 50% of prescriptions for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in Europe, along with an increased global interest for holistic medicinal approaches. This study aimed to systematically review the published evidence investigating the use of herbal medicines as a treatment for BPH in clinical trials based on PRISMA guidelines.
Methods
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, and Scopus databases, including English language clinical trials (Jadad score of ≥ 4) that investigated herbal medicine as a sole intervention, reporting at least one of the following outcomes: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUASI); Maximum Urinary Flow Rate (Qmax); Post-void residual volume (PRV); Prostate volume (PV); Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA); Quality of Life (QoL) Scores.
Results
Following article screening, 28 articles were included. The most frequently studied herbs in isolation or in combination were Serenoa repens (54%), Urtica dioica (14%), Cucurbita pepo (14%), lycopene (14%), Pygeum africanum (14%) and Linum usitatissimum (7%). These herbal-based formulations mostly improved the symptoms associated with BPH (IPSS/AUASI, Qmax, PSA, QoL scores, PRV and PV). This review further discusses these herbs and the outcomes, with a focus on the potential mechanisms of action.
Conclusions
There are limited high quality clinical trials investigating herbal medicine on BPH, where S. repens is significantly more represented than other popular herbs for BPH, such as C. pepo, U. dioica, P. africanum, and lycopene. Although the included studies broadly found positive positive results for standardised outcomes for LUTS and urinary flow, there was great variability in the study designs requires caution in interpretation. As these herbs are supported by in vivo and in vitro studies on potential mechanisms of actions, comparison of efficacy of mono-herbal and poly-herbal approaches, standardized extracts based on identification of active constituents, as well as dosage and long-term safety studies are warrented.}

While there is no single “gold standard” diagnostic test for PJI, recent collaborative efforts by Orthopaedic and Infectious Disease Societies have developed algorithms for diagnosing PJI. However, the efficacy of individual tests as well as diagnostic thresholds are controversial. We review the recommended thresholds for commonly used screening tests as well as tissue histopathology and confirmatory tests to diagnose periprosthetic infection. We also update lesser-known laboratory tests, and we briefly summarize rapidly evolving molecular tests to diagnose periprosthetic infection. Pathologists hold a critical role in assisting with PJI diagnosis, maintaining laboratory test quality and interpreting test results.

The Mesobuthus martensii scorpions, called as “Quanxie”, are known Chinese medicinal material base on the “Combat poison with poison” strategy for more than one thousand years, and still widely used to treat various diseases according to the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China nowadays.
Aim of study
The study aims to investigate the similarity of scorpion neurotoxins at the protein level between the juvenile and adult Mesobuthus martensii scorpions as Chinese medicine materials.
Materials and methods
The second-, third- and fourth-instar, and adult Mesobuthus martensii scorpions were collected for the characterization of neurotoxin expression through multiple strategic proteomics, including undigested scorpion venom, endopeptidase-digested, and undigested scorpion telson extract for the sample analysis.
Results
Based on the known 107 scorpion neurotoxins from the genomic and transcriptomic analysis of adult Mesobuthus martensii scorpions, the multiple strategic proteomics first revealed that neurotoxins exhibited more stability in telson extract than secreted venom. In the reported transcripts of scorpion neurotoxins, approximately 53%, 56%, 66% and 78% of neurotoxins were detected through undigested scorpion venom, the endopeptidase Arg-C-, Lys-C-digested telson extract, and undigested telson extract strategies, respectively. Nearly 79% of scorpion neurotoxins detected in third-instar Mesobuthus martensii scorpions represent the largest number of scorpion neurotoxins from proteomic analysis to date. Moreover, a total of 84% of scorpion neurotoxins were successfully identified at the protein level, and similar neurotoxin expression profiles in second-, third- and fourth-instar, and adult Mesobuthus martensii scorpions were first revealed by the multiple strategic proteomics.
Conclusion
These findings for the first time demonstrate the similar neurotoxin expression profiles between the juvenile and adult Mesobuthus martensii scorpions as Chinese medicinal material, which would serve as a paradigm for further toxin analysis from different venomous animals.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Previous studies have revealed that a high-fat diet (HFD) promotes the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) in close association with disturbances in the intestinal flora and metabolic disorders. Xianglian pill (XLP) is a well-established traditional prescription with unique advantages in controlling intestinal flora imbalance and inflammation. However, its therapeutic effects on HFD-related CRC remain largely unknown.
Aim of the study
The primary objective of this research was to investigate the anticancer mechanism of XLP in countering HFD-related CRC.
Materials and methods
The protective effect of XLP was evaluated using azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced CRC model of mice exposed to a HFD. The degree of colorectal carcinogenesis, including body weight, colon length, and histopathology, was measured in mice treated with XLP and untreated mice. The effect of XLP on gut microbiota and its metabolites was detected using 16S rDNA and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, a “pseudo-sterile” mouse model was constructed using antibiotics (Abx) to verify whether the gut microbiota and metabolites play a role in the pathogenesis of CRC.
Results
XLP inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in a dose-dependent fashion. Our findings also highlighted that XLP protected the integrity of the intestinal barrier by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, as well as the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, XLP inhibited the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Notably, the XLP treatment increased the proportion of probiotics (particularly Akkermansia) and significantly reduced fecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a microbiota-derived metabolite of bile acids (BA) closely related to Muribaculaceae. Furthermore, after Abx treatment, XLP showed no clear antitumor effects on CRC. Simultaneously, DCA-supplemented feedings promoted colorectal tumorigenesis and provoked obvious colonic inflammation, M1 macrophage infiltration, and colonic injury. In vitro, the results of RAW-264.7 macrophages and normal intestinal epithelial cells treated with DCA corroborated our in vivo findings, demonstrating consistent patterns in inflammatory responses and intestinal barrier protein expression.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that XLP inhibits colorectal cancer associated with HFD via inactivating TLR4/MyD88 by remodeling gut microbiota composition and BA metabolism.}

Although medication plays an important role in improving the symptoms of depression, approximately one third of people with depression do not significantly benefit from medication and experience various adverse reactions. Recently, increasing evidence has shown that gut microbes play an important role in the occurrence and development of depression. There have been illuminating studies previously conducted on the relationship between antidepressant chemicals, traditional Chinese medicine, and the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA). Therefore, in this review, we summarize the role of the MGBA in the occurrence and development of depression, especially the important role of the MGBA in the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Modulation of the MGBA is proposed to enhance the efficacy of antidepressant drugs and reduce their side effects and disease recurrence, so as to provide a new method for the treatment of depression.}

Results indicate that TCM doctors actively initiate small talks in online scenarios to acquire holistic information for diagnosis and boost patients’ face for rapport management, both of which further contribute to patient-centeredness in Chinese OMC. Importantly, TCM doctors attach great importance to small talk, while patients perceive it with insufficient attention. To some extent, this study contributes to existing knowledge of small talk by examining its informative and interpersonal functions under the online circumstance of TCM in Oriental scenarios.}

Residence time distribution test with tap water in the clean PABR was carried out at a certain hydraulic residence time of 48 h in experiments and in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, both of which were in good agreement for the ‘every second’ (switching period T = 48 h), the ‘clockwise sequential’ (T = 96 h), and the ‘no switching’ (T = ∞) operation pattern. The CFD model output visualized the hydrodynamic-mass transport, which heavily influenced by operation pattern, successfully inside a PABR. The PABRs run in those three operation patterns were subjected to three successive step changes in average organic loading rate at about 1, 2, 4 and 6 kg COD m−3 d−1 for 12, 24, 24 and 6 d, respectively. Pollutants in the TCM wastewater had the longest time to be digested and degraded within PABR run in the ‘every second’ operation pattern, resulting in a most stable performance among the three. Performance of PABR was consistent with the variation in MWD of soluble organic compounds no matter what the operation pattern was. High- MW species (93–130 kDa) broke down into simpler intermediate- MW solutes (7–56 kDa) by the metabolism of anaerobic flocs sludge mostly in the compartment which contributed most to the total COD removal of PABR. Then, intermediate- MW solutes were mineralized step by step into low- MW solutes (100 Da) and biogas in the follow-up compartments in the sequence of flow pattern.}

Nanoparticles capable of mimicking natural tissues represent a major technological advancement in regenerative medicine. In this pilot study, the development of a new nanohybrid composed of titanate nanoribbons to mimic the extracellular matrix is reported. During the first phase, nanoribbons were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment. Subsequently, titanate nanoribbons were functionalized by heterobifunctional polyethylene-glycol (PEG) to graft type I collagen on their surface. Biological properties of this new nanobiohybrid such as cytotoxicity to cardiac cells and platelet aggregation ability were evaluated. The so-formed nanobiohybrid permits cellular adhesion and proliferation favoring fine cardiac tissue healing and regeneration.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Tyrosinase, the key rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, is one of the main targets for skin senescence and some pigmented skin diseases, such as albinism and melanoma. Tyrosinase inhibitors are capable of reducing melanin generation and deposition in the skin through blocking the reaction chain of formation. Thus, it has been used for anti-melanoma and showed the potential to be developed into novel skin whitening and spot removing products. With the trend of back-to-nature, natural tyrosinase inhibitors are receiving more and more attention. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) as the promising source of novel chemotypes and pharmacophores, are huge treasures for the discovery of natural tyrosinase inhibitors characterized with green, safe, and highly efficient. Aim of this review: This review aims to provide a systematic overview of natural tyrosinase inhibitors and a detailed summary of the types of TCMs from which they originate. In addition, this paper also highlights the screening methods developed for exploring tyrosinase inhibitors in recent years, compares the advantages and disadvantages of various methods under the guidance of different screening principles, and predicts their applications in the future.
Materials and methods
Relevant literature have been obtained using the keywords “tyrosinase inhibitors”, “traditional Chinese medicines”, “whitening”, and “screening” in scientific databases, such as “PubMed”, “SciFinder”, “Web of Science”, “Elsevier”, “China Knowledge Resource Integrated databases”. Information was also collected from Chinese pharmacopoeia, Chinese herbal classics books, “Google Scholar”, “Baidu Scholar”, and other literature sources, etc.
Results
An overview about the tyrosinase inhibitors derived from TCMs since 2002 has been compiled via the above-mentioned sources. Up to now, 186 components, mainly belonging to flavonoids, lignans, terpenoids, Diels-Alder adducts, simple phenylpropanoids and stilbenes, from 61 kinds of TCMs have been reported to possess tyrosinase inhibitory activity, among which flavonoids are mainly focused on. Furthermore, on the basis of bioactive detection strategies, the screening methods for tyrosinase inhibitors have been classified into bioaffinity-based, intrinsic enzymatic-based, and computer-aided drug design (CADD). Precisely because screening approaches are essential for rapid identification of tyrosinase inhibitors from TCMs, the principles, advantages and disadvantages, and specific applications of each method are presented along with a comparison of applicability.
Conclusions
The summary of TCMs-derived inhibitors gives a clue on the discovery of candidates with the property to whiten the skin. Meanwhile, the outlook of developed screening methods provides technical references for the efficient exploration of safer and more effective tyrosinase inhibitors from TCMs.}

In view of the increasing intake of herbal remedies over the years, we highlight Africa's tropical and subtropical PA-containing plants commonly used in herbal preparations, and summarize their ethnomedicinal uses, contamination pathways and potential health risks. PA-containing plants and their honey-derived products were ascertained through searching peer-reviewed electronic databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from 2001 to 2023. Overall, 37 PA-containing plants were found to be used in herbal medicinal preparations in Africa, of which 25 belong to Asteraceae, Fabaceae (10), and Boraginaceae (2) plant families. Furthermore, three major paths of PA-contamination of herbal medicines were identified while PAs from the genera Chromolaena, Ageratum, Eupatorium, Crotalaria, Eupatorium, Echium, and Senecio were frequently detected in honey used in herbal preparations. It was also revealed that the adoption of the guidelines for Good Agriculture and Collection Practice could significantly reduce the risk of exposure to PAs. This review will be useful in facilitating the identification of PA-containing plants in the field so that they are not used in herbal preparations, whereas there is a need to minimize their health risks by monitoring and setting acceptable limits for PAs in herbal and food products.}

Due to the unique characteristics, such as the dynamic lot size of single batch, independent process of single batch, and the complex correlation in batch scheduling, the complexity of batch scheduling optimization of traditional Chinese medicine extraction workshop is much higher than that of general batch scheduling problems. In the real world production, the traditional Chinese medicine extraction workshop is also in a state of low efficiency. In order to solve the above problems, a new bionic algorithm, Simulated Population Growth Blocked Algorithm (SPGBA) is proposed by simulating the ecological balance mechanism, which also has the features of “dynamic”, “independent” and “complex correlation”. Firstly, the mathematical model of batch scheduling problem of traditional Chinese medicine extraction workshop is established; secondly, the bionic mechanism, principle and process of SPGBA are described in detail, and its Markov convergence is proved; thirdly, the effectiveness of SPGBA as a meta heuristic algorithm is verified by benchmarking comparative experiments; finally, SPGBA is used to solve the batch scheduling problem of real world extraction workshop, and a satisfactory solution is obtained.}

Magnetic resonance images reveal physiological anatomical information of patients, and nuclear medicine images accurately show tissue lesion information. Through medical image fusion algorithms, these fusion images containing both tissue lesion information and physiological anatomical information are obtained to provide sufficient information for clinical medical technologies. However, most existing fusion algorithms are based on mathematical transform domains, and these fusion results have the weaknesses of blurred edges, color distortion and detail loss. To address these problems, a multiscale dense residual attention network (MDRANet) is proposed and applied to magnetic resonance and nuclear medicine image fusion. MDRANet combines multiscale dense network and multiscale residual attention network to extract and enhance deep features. Moreover, four different loss functions are used to optimize MDRANet and improve the fusion quality. The experimental results show that the fusion results of our proposed algorithm have richer details and better objective metrics compared with the reference algorithms.}

The etiology behind the lack of applicants is multifaceted and involves greater systemic barriers, specifically, educational and social barriers. The lack of representation of black males in medicine also has downstream implications for the health of the African American/black community. African Americans exhibit some of the lowest levels of trust in the healthcare system, have less access to care than their non-minority peers, and have, comparatively, poorer healthcare outcomes than other populations in the US. Research has demonstrated that patient-provider race concordance improves communication, outcomes, culturally competent care, and satisfaction with care. The greater the gap between these two populations, the harder it becomes to improve healthcare outcomes, maintain a medically ready fighting force in the US military, and improve trust in the healthcare system. This article provides an analysis of the multifactorial barriers black male applicants face applying, matriculating, and graduating medical school and how decreased representation may affect healthcare delivery. Furthermore, this review explores next steps and potential implementations at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences to address the above deficiencies.}

abstract = {Semi-solid extrusion (SSE) 3D printing has great potential to be integrated in a clinical setting, with the use of pre-filled and disposable pharma-ink syringes meeting regulatory good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements. Uniformity of mass testing is a critical quality attribute and is carried out by weighing a specific amount of dosage units in a single batch and finding the average mass to evaluate any deviations. However, this test for small batches of 3D printed medicines may require weighing the entire manufactured batch. To overcome this limitation, an in-line analytical balance was implemented inside a GMP pharmaceutical 3D printer, with a specialised software-controlled weighing system for the automated mass uniformity testing of the entire printed batch. Three different dose batches (n = 28) of hydrocortisone pharma-ink were 3D printed and subjected to in-line mass uniformity testing. The developed software was capable of registering the weights of all individual printlets and accurately detecting any deviations within the accepted limits. Only one printlet was outside the accepted weight range, a result of the first print often being imperfect due to the semi-solid nature of the pharma-ink. The weight results were compared against an external analytical balance, and no significant differences were found. This study is the first to integrate an analytical balance inside a pharmaceutical printer, automating the dosage form mass uniformity testing which can save time, labour, and resources, whilst improving the quality control testing of 3D printed pharmaceuticals.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Studies of gender inequities in academic medicine suggest the negative impact of men's networking practices, but little is known about how they shape faculty experiences.
Methods
In this qualitative study, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 52 women and 52 men academic medicine faculty members at 16 institutions across the US in 2019. Interviews explored participants’ experiences and perceptions of gender inequities in academic medicine, including perceptions of men's networking practices. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were analyzed using a mixture of deductively and inductively generated codes.
Findings
Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts identified different dominant themes: (1) Women were often excluded from networking activities dominated by men, (2) Both women and men referred to men's networking practices in academic medicine, and believed they conferred benefits to members and excluded non-members from such benefits, (3) Participation in such networking activities yielded professional advantages, (4) Women made efforts to counteract their exclusion yet identified limits of those efforts.
Interpretation
The data suggests that gender inequities in academic medicine might be associated with professional interactions that occur outside of the scope of professional work practices and in formal work sites. Additional research is needed to better understand practices such as informal networking activities and their impact in order to promote gender equity.

Dysmenorrhoea is a common gynaecological problem that affects many women during their reproductive years. The objectives of this study were to describe the different treatments used for primary dysmenorrhoea (PD) among medical students at Taibah University, and to investigate the link between pain severity and daily life activities in relation to the type of dysmenorrhoea treatment.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 301 female medical students through an 18-item self-administered electronic questionnaire to screen for students with PD. The questionnaire included sociodemographic characteristics, details of self-management methods (types and adverse events), daily life domains affected by pain, and the Visual Analogue Scale score for the pain (wherein a score ≥7 indicated severe pain). Chi-square test, a multivariate regression model, and correlation analysis were used for data analysis.
Results
The prevalence of PD among respondents was 71.8%. Medications were used by more than half of the respondents (51.9%), and were mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (53.5%) and paracetamol (47.5%). Among the participants, 14.1% used herbal medicines, cinnamon (55.7%), chamomile (40.7%), and ginger (33.3%). Other pain relief modalities were used by 34% of participants. Most students with a history of PD (80.6%) reported effects on their daily activities, mainly mood disturbance. Students using medications were more likely to have severe pain (72.7%) and an affect on daily activities (92.9%) than those using herbal medicines (44.4% and 88.9%, respectively) and other treatments (47.7% and 70.8%, respectively) (p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Medications were more commonly used than herbal medicines and other relief methods. Effects of PD on daily life activities were observed among most students treated with medications. We recommend health promotion programmes to increase the awareness regarding different pain relief methods.}

Articles had to fulfill the inclusion criteria of randomised or non-randomised studies assessing the impact of POCUS on the diagnosis, management, length of hospital stay or mortality of patients admitted to the internal medicine ward. Six studies were included involving a total of 1836 patients. The influence of POCUS on the diagnosis was reported as a change in the main diagnosis or the addition of a relevant diagnosis in up to 18% and 24% of the cases, respectively. Impact on the management plan was reported in 37% to 52.1% of the participants. Three studies documented the impact of POCUS on the length of stay. Two of them reported no difference between groups, and the other reported a significant reduction of 1 d of the hospital stay. In conclusion, POCUS appears to have positive effects on the clinical decision-making process with impacts on optimal patient management and possible reduction in the hospital length of stay.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Inflammation plays a critical role during benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) development. Danzhi qing'e (DZQE) decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been widely used for estrogen and androgen-related diseases. However, its effect on inflammation-related BPH remains unclear.
Aim of the study
To investigate the effect of DZQE on inhibition of inflammation-related BPH, and further identify the possible mechanism involved.
Methods and materials
Experimental autoimmune prostatitis (EAP)-induced BPH was established and then 2.7 g/kg of DZQE was administrated orally for 4 weeks. The prostate sizes, weights and prostate index (PI) values were recorded. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) was performed for pathological analyses. Macrophage infiltrate was evaluated by Immunohistochemical (IHC). The inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by Rt-PCR and ELISA methods. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was examined by Western blot. The expression differences of mRNA expressions between EAP-induced and oestrogen/testosterone (E2/T)-induced BPH was investigated by RNA sequencing analyses. In vitro, human prostatic epithelial BPH-1 cells were stimulated with the conditioned medium from monocyte THP-1-derived M2 macrophages (M2CM), followed by treatment of Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), Bakuchiol (Ba), ERK1/2 antagonist PD98059 or ERK1/2 agonist C6-Ceramide. The ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation were then detected by Western blotting and CCK8 assay.
Results
DZQE significantly inhibited the prostate enlargement and decreased PI value in EAP rats. Pathological analysis showed that DZQE alleviated prostate acinar epithelial cell proliferation by decreasing and reduction of CD68+ and CD206+ macrophage infiltration in the prostate. The levels of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, MCP-1, TGF-β, and IgG in EAP rats’ prostate or serum were significantly suppressed by DZQE as well. Moreover, mRNA sequencing data showed that the expressions of inflammation-related genes were elevated in EAP-induced BPH but not in E2/T-induced BPH. ERK1/2-related genes expression has been found in both E2/T and EAP-induced BPH. ERK1/2 is one of the core signal pathways involved in EAP-induced BPH, which was activated in EAP group but inactivated in DZQE group. In vitro, two active components of DZQE Tan IIA and Ba inhibited M2CM-induced BPH-1 cell proliferation, similarly to ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 did. Meanwhile, Tan IIA and Ba inhibited M2CM-induced ERK1/2 signal activation in BPH-1 cells. When re-activated the ERK1/2 by its activator C6-Ceramide, the inhibitory effects of Tan IIA and Ba on BPH-1 cell proliferation were blocked.
Conclusion
DZQE suppressed inflammation-associated BPH via regulation of ERK1/2 signal by Tan IIA and Ba.}

Using UHPLC-Q Exactive Orbitrap HRMS, a total of 58 components in SSD including flavonoids, organic acids, terpenoids, coumarin, and alkaloids were identified or tentatively characterized by authentic reference standards and accurate masses and characteristic fragment ions. The proportion of flavonoids and organic acids were the most in SSD. Subsequently, 7 characteristic components in SSD were quantified by a newly established UHPLC-DAD method that was validated in terms of linearity and ranges, LOD and LOQ, precision, repeatability, stability, and accuracy. Finally, the method was successfully used for the quality evaluation of 8 batches of SSD collected from 5 production areas in China. ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test are used to evaluate the differences in component content in SSD from different production areas. There are significant differences in the content of SSD from different regions (P < 0.05), which may be related to the climate, altitude, and other natural environments of the regions. This work laid a valuable foundation for further development and comprehensive quality control of SSD.}

AI holds the potential to revolutionize how emergency physicians (EPs) make clinical decisions, but AI's complexity often surpasses EPs' capacity to provide patients with informed consent regarding its use. This article underscores the crucial need to address the ethical pitfalls of AI in EM. Patient autonomy necessitates that EPs engage in conversations with patients about whether to use AI in their evaluation and treatment. As clinical AI integration expands, this discussion should become an integral part of the informed consent process, aligning with ethical and legal requirements. The rapid availability of AI programs, fueled by vast electronic health record (EHR) datasets, has led to increased pressure on hospitals and clinicians to embrace clinical AI without comprehensive system evaluation. However, the evolving landscape of AI technology outpaces our ability to anticipate its impact on medical practice and patient care. The central question arises: Are EPs equipped with the necessary knowledge to offer well-informed consent regarding clinical AI? Collaborative efforts between EPs, bioethicists, AI researchers, and healthcare administrators are essential for the development and implementation of optimal AI practices in EM. To facilitate informed consent about AI, EPs should understand at least seven key areas: (1) how AI systems operate; (2) whether AI systems are understandable and trustworthy; (3) the limitations of and errors AI systems make; (4) how disagreements between the EP and AI are resolved; (5) whether the patient's personally identifiable information (PII) and the AI computer systems will be secure; (6) if the AI system functions reliably (has been validated); and (7) if the AI program exhibits bias.

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced explosive growth in oncology and related specialties in recent years. The improved expertise in data capture, the increased capacity for data aggregation and analytic power, along with decreasing costs of genome sequencing and related biologic “omics”, set the foundation and need for novel tools that can meaningfully process these data from multiple sources and of varying types. These advances provide value across biomedical discovery, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention, in a multimodal fashion. However, while big data and AI tools have already revolutionized many fields, medicine has partially lagged due to its complexity and multi-dimensionality, leading to technical challenges in developing and validating solutions that generalize to diverse populations. Indeed, inner biases and miseducation of algorithms, in view of their implementation in daily clinical practice, are increasingly relevant concerns; critically, it is possible for AI to mirror the unconscious biases of the humans who generated these algorithms. Therefore, to avoid worsening existing health disparities, it is critical to employ a thoughtful, transparent, and inclusive approach that involves addressing bias in algorithm design and implementation along the cancer care continuum. In this review, a broad landscape of major applications of AI in cancer care is provided, with a focus on cancer research and precision medicine. Major challenges posed by the implementation of AI in the clinical setting will be discussed. Potentially feasible solutions for mitigating bias are provided, in the light of promoting cancer health equity.}

abstract = {Herbal traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) are an increasingly popular alternative therapy globally. Due to the complex chemical composition of herbal products, and with research showing that consumers from Western countries are more likely to take multiple herbal products at one time, the lack of understanding of the potential side effects of herbal TCM may pose a significant risk to health and wellbeing. This may be particularly so now that herbal preparations are being promoted for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 symptoms, often in association with Western medicines such as paracetamol. Of interest are the potential adverse effects of herbal TCMs on the kidney. Many factors can lead to the development of renal injury including intrinsic toxicity, plant misidentification, adulteration, contamination, and of increasing importance, interactions with conventional drugs and other herbs. This review evaluates and summarizes some of the key aspects of TCM-induced nephrotoxicity and the current scope of herb-drug and herb-herb interaction that may cause adverse effects.}

abstract = {Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) has gained attention as a simple, fast, and non-exhaustive extraction technique, as its unique features enable its use for the extraction of many classes of drugs from biological matrices. This sample-preparation approach consolidates sampling and sample preparation into a single step, in addition to providing analyte preconcentration and sample clean-up. These features have helped SPME become an integral part of several analytical protocols for monitoring drug concentrations in human matrices in clinical, toxicological, and forensic medicine studies. Over the years, researchers have continued to develop the SPME technique, resulting in the introduction of novel sorbents and geometries, which have resulted in improved extraction efficiencies. This review summarizes developments and applications of SPME published between 2016 and 2022, specifically in relation to the analysis of central nervous system drugs, drugs used to treat cardiovascular disorders and bacterial infections, and drugs used in immunosuppressive and anticancer therapies.}
