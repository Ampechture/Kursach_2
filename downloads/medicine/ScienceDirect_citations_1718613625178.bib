A single 10-min exposure of donor myoblast cultures to 1.5 mT amplitude PEMFs produced a conditioned media (pCM) capable of enhancing the myogenesis of recipient cultures to a similar degree as direct magnetic exposure. Downwardly-directed magnetic fields produced greater secretome responses than upwardly-directed fields in adherent and fluid-suspended myoblasts. The suspension paradigm allowed for the rapid concentrating of secreted factors, particularly of extracellular vesicles. The brief conditioning of basal media from magnetically-stimulated myoblasts was capable of conferring myoblast survival to a greater degree than basal media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (5%). Downward-directed magnetic fields, applied directly to cells or in the form of pCM, upregulated the protein expression of TRPC channels, markers for cell cycle progression and myogenesis. Direct magnetic exposure produced mild oxidative stress, whereas pCM provision did not, providing a survival advantage on recipient cells. Streptomycin, a TRP channel antagonist, precluded the production of a myogenic pCM. We present a methodology employing a brief and non-invasive PEMF-exposure paradigm to effectively stimulate secretome production and release for commercial or clinical exploitation.}

The psychedelics were then being used as a therapeutic drug in clinical settings and researched as a potential antipersonnel agent by the U.S. government. Then, using psychedelics became a rite of passage for the emerging countercultural movement. After adverse reactions and negative publicity, states began to criminalize these drugs, beginning in 1966. The federal government eventually moved these drugs to Schedule 1 classification, shutting down research almost entirely.}

abstract = {Introduction
The SARS-Cov2 pandemic boosted the use of telemedicine. The aim of our study was to evaluate patient and physician perceptions regarding the use of the different modalities of telemedicine for various health problems.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Geneva Switzerland in 2021. Patients in waiting rooms of both medical centres and emergency services were invited to answer an online questionnaire, while physicians working in private and public settings were asked to answer a similar questionnaire by email. The questionnaire focused on digital literacy, acceptability, preferences, as well as barriers and facilitators concerning of telemedicine.
Findings
570 patients and 543 physicians participated. After face-to-face consultations, most patients preferred the telephone to other modalities for health issues such as simple medical advice (65%), discussion of clinical parameters (61%), acute or chronic problems (55% and 60%), and psychological support (57%).They valued emails for communication of blood tests (56%) and renewal of medication (49%). Half of patients considered video to be acceptable for psychological support. A large majority of physicians considered the phone to be an acceptable modality for all the issues mentioned above (85% to 94%). Emails and videos were considered to be acceptable for follow-up of patients with chronic diseases (53% and 54%) and provision of simple advice (51% and 48%). 65% of physicians would use video for psychological support. Patients’ mains reasons for using telemedicine were lack of traveling (72%) and saving time (56%). Disadvantages were lack of physical examination (60%), technical problems (43%), and unsuitability (43%). Physicians feared the potential negative impact of telemedicine on the therapeutic relationship and insisted on the need for a facilitated access.
Conclusion
The use of telemedicine has increased since the pandemic but both doctors and patients continue to prefer face-to-face consultations. Telephone remains more acceptable than video in most medical situations.}

abstract = {Introduction
Academic medical centers render physician-led, team-based care for individuals admitted with acute decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ADHF). These teams are responsible for implementing guideline-directed medical therapies such as Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitors (ARNi) prior to discharge. However, adoption of ARNI into clinical practice has been historically slow. Baseline data at our institution revealed only 28.4% of eligible patients received a prescription for ARNi at the time of discharge. Objective: To improve clinical use of ARNi prior to discharge in patients with ADHF through a direct educational intervention among Internal Medicine (IM) residents across 3 hospitals of an urban, academic center.
Methods
Standardized face-to-face meetings were conducted by a quality improvement team of 4 IM residents. Meetings were conducted biweekly on the hospital units, lasted 15-20 minutes and used 3 learning strategies: visual, auditory, and reading. Common barriers to prescribing ARNi during hospitalization were reviewed and a visual algorithm providing evidence-based resources and management pearls for navigating ARNi in patients with renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia was created (Figure 1). Given the social complexity of the underserved area, financial details including insurance coverage and financial aid were discussed. Electronic health data was used to identify eligible patients and review medication list at the time of discharge.
Results
A total of 32 educational sessions were provided to 16 house staff-led teams between January and March of 2022. At the end of the educational meeting series, there were 43 patients discharged after hospitalization for ADHF and eligible for ARNi prescription; mean age was 69.1 years (±15.2) and 69% were male, 25.6% were discharged on ARNi and 45.5% were on >50% of the target dose. Compared to baseline, ARNi utilization was not improved.
Conclusion
A short series of educational meetings did not increase the rate of ARNi prescribing prior to discharge among eligible patients hospitalized for ADHF. Future quality improvement initiatives may incorporate peer to peer education but should include additional interventions.}

abstract = {Research Objectives
To investigate the influence of alterations to an outpatient PM&R workspace on the patient experience.
Design
A small sample of patients who had received a PM&R visit participated in a 40-minute focus group meeting. A 3-year retrospective chart review identified the patient perspective after a consultation in the room.
Setting
This study was conducted in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation setting.
Participants
A convenient self-selected sample of 3 patients participated in the focus group and 327 (50.3% female) patients met the criteria for the chart review.
Interventions
Psychologically informed decisions based on expert opinion were used to design an examination room, with consideration of the lighting, floor quality, color, size and markings, furniture/desk design, and clinical applications of technology, including (1) touchscreen display monitors to interact with patients (2) a remote control video camera with the capacity to send images to the EMR (3) Movement Sensor Technology that quantifies objective performance metrics and (4) a Connected Health mobile device application that enables the clinician to monitor and prescribe treatment plans to the patient at home. The consultations were conducted by an exercise physiologist with training in motivational interviewing.
Main Outcome Measures
A focus group moderator gathered feedback about the room and evaluated responses to a 4-minute role-playing video demonstration that integrated the technologies into a patient-centered consultation with a standardized patient. The 10-item CARE Measure used a 1-5 Likert scale to anonymously assess clinician-patient relational empathy.
Results
An analysis of the focus group transcription identified that all participants preferred the remodeled room compared with a traditional examination room. There was a consensus that the room was wellness oriented. Participants unanimously agreed that the technology facilitated useful feedback to patients and strengthened the clinician-patient relationship. CARE Measures scores identified overall mean of 49.06 (SD=0.3) out of a maximum of 50.
Conclusions
It appears that a psychologically informed room design has the potential to enhance the patient experience and improve the quality of care.

Herein, β-CD was modified by acryloyl chloride and further copolymerized with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and acrylic acid (AA) to obtain PNIPAM-co-β-CD-AC. The results showed that the critical phase transition temperature of PNIPAM/β-CD-AC could be controlled at 19 °C, and the fast sol–gel phase transition was realized in 2–10 s. The hydrophobic drug carried in this hydrogel can constantly be released for more than 6 days at pH values (pH 5.5–8), and the duration may match the recovery of the wound. As a dressing hydrogel, its rapid gel formation and inversion as well as shear-thinning behavior prevent secondary wound damage. The β-CD-based hydrogel also has good biocompatibility and antioxidant properties, which provide a good potential choice for wound dressings, especially for exposed wounds in winter.}

abstract = {Radiation dosimetric biomarkers have found applications beyond radiation protection area and now are actively introduced into clinical practice. Cytogenetic assays appeared to be a valuable tool for individualized quantifying radiation effects in patients, with high capability for assessing genotoxicity of various medical exposure modalities and providing meaningful radiation dose estimates for prognoses of radiation-related cancer risk. This review summarized current data on the use of biological dosimetry methods in patients undergoing various medical irradiations to low doses. The highlighted topics include basic aspects of biological dosimetry and its limitations in the range of low radiation doses, and main patterns of in vivo induction of radiation biomarkers in clinical exposure scenarios, occurring in X-ray diagnostics, computed tomography, interventional radiology, low dose radiotherapy, and nuclear medicine (internally administered 131I and other radiopharmaceuticals). Additionally, several specific issues, examined by biodosimetry techniques, are analysed, such as contrast media effect, radiation response in pediatric patients, impact of magnetic resonance imaging, evaluation of radioprotectors, detection of patients’ abnormal intrinsic radiosensitivity and dose estimation in persons involved in medical radiation incidents. A prognosis of possible directions for further improvements in this area includes the automation of cytogenetic analysis, introduction of molecular biodosimeters and development of multiparametric biodosimetry platforms. A potential approach to the advanced biodosimetry of internal exposure and/or low dose external irradiation is suggested; this can be a multiparametric platform based on the combination of the γ-H2AX foci, dicentric, and translocation assays, each applied in the optimum postexposure time range, with the amalgamation of the dose estimates. The study revealed the necessity of further research, which might clarify medical radiation safety concerns for patients via using stringent biodosimetry methodology.}

abstract = {Bacterial and fungal skin infections are common both in humans and animals, especially in companion animals such as cats and dogs. Use of systemic antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of skin infections has resulted in increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in both animals and humans. Under “One Health” approach, one of the strategies to overcome AMR is topical delivery of combined antimicrobials, which allows enhanced efficacy at lower amounts of antimicrobials. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (S. pseudintermedius), Malassezia pachydermatis (M. pachydermatis) and Microsporum canis (M. canis) related skin infections are very common in cats and dogs, and this also poses a risk for humans who come into contact with the infected animals. Chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and miconazole nitrate (MN) are amongst the commonly used antimicrobials used for topical treatment of such dermal infections. In this study, we aimed to develop a safe bioadhesive system for delivery of combination of CHX and MN for topical treatment of skin infections providing higher antimicrobial efficacy than that of the currently available formulations. For this purpose, gel formulations were prepared using a bioadhesive biopolymer, chitosan which itself exerts antimicrobial activity as well as anti-inflammatory and penetration enhancing properties. Tris-EDTA was also incorporated into the formulations to increase the antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, CHX loaded chitosan nanoparticles were also prepared and incorporated into the gels in combination with MN. The formulations were investigated in regard to their applicability, spreadability and safety properties as well as their drug release profiles, and he antimicrobial activity of the formulations was shown against S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. pseudintermedius, M. pachydermatis and M. canis. Gels with a suitable viscosity, adhesion and spreadability properties for topical application on the skin, which would provide frequency of application was obtained without showing any cytotoxicity. Different release profiles were obtained for CHX and MN. Due to its low solubility, MN release was found to be low, whilst with CHX, release was found to be higher and rapid when incorporated as a solution, but sustained release was obtained when incorporated into chitosan nanoparticles. It was found that both MN and CHX accumulated on the surface of the membrane. By this means, a prolonged release on the site of application would be provided resulting in enhanced antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activities against all the pathogens tested were found to be significantly increased with the combination MN and CHX, when compared to the drugs alone, and this activity was further enhanced in presence of Tris-EDTA. Moreover, gels incorporated with CHX loaded chitosan nanoparticles were found to enhance the antimicrobial activity further. We have shown that the developed chitosan-based formulation with combined antimicrobials is a promising local delivery system for treatment of skin infections against wide range of microorganisms and can be safely used both in veterinary and human medicine.}

The European Task Force on Patient Evaluations of General Practice's (EUROPEP) internationally-validated questionnaire measures patients' satisfaction with their primary care physicians. A study published in 1999 showed positive evaluations of primary care among patients across Europe and included 1603 Israeli patients. Major changes have taken place during the past 20 years, in Israel's society, in the healthcare system, and particularly in primary care clinics.
Objectives
The study aims to reevaluate patients' satisfaction with their primary care physicians and care clinics in Israel and compares the results to the 1999 survey.
Methods
A survey based on the EUROPEP questionnaire was conducted among 1617 people. Data collection was carried out by an internet panel for the Hebrew speaking population and by a phone questionnaire for the Arabic speaking population.
Results
The study's results show a significant reduction in satisfaction. Notably, patients' satisfaction with physicians' support relating to emotional problems and physicians' explanations about referrals and workup plans have dramatically deteriorated.
Conclusions
The decrease in patients' satisfaction with primary care physicians and clinics found in the current study is concerning and requires recognition and further exploration.
Practice implications
The results may be used as a baseline for future assessments of trends in patients' satisfaction.}

According to it, clinical manifestations are defined and explained by a given pathology, that is, by the burden and distribution of selected proteins aggregated into insoluble amyloids. There are two logical consequences from this model: (1) a measurement of the disease-defining pathology represents a biomarker of that disease in everyone affected, and (2) the targeted elimination of that pathology should end that disease. But success in disease modification guided by this model has remained elusive. New technologies to probe living biology have been used to validate rather than question the clinicopathologic model, despite three important observations: (1) a disease-defining pathology in isolation (without other pathologies) is an exceptional autopsy finding; (2) many genetic and molecular pathways converge on the same pathology; (3) the presence of pathology without neurological disease is more common than expected by chance. We here discuss the rationale for abandoning the clinicopathologic model, review the competing biological model of neurodegeneration, and propose developmental pathways for biomarker development and disease-modifying efforts. Further, in justifying future disease-modifying trials testing putative neuroprotective molecules, a key inclusion criterion must be the deployment of a bioassay of the mechanism corrected by the therapy of interest. No improvements in trial design or execution can overcome the fundamental deficit created by testing experimental therapies in clinically defined recipients unselected for their biologically suitability. Biological subtyping is the key developmental milestone needed to launch precision medicine for patients living with neurodegenerative disorders.}

The combination of proteomics with other omics platforms (the omics pipeline), in particular proteogenomics, is giving important insights to the molecular changes leading to disease, covering the spectrum from genotype to phenotype and identifying potential biomarkers for disease detection, surveillance and monitoring, and revealing potential new drug targets. Discovery-based finding are now being translated to clinical application, supporting the rollout of precision/personalised medicine. This perspective has focused on twelve areas of importance that have fuelled the field.

abstract = {Background
Lifestyle medicine (LM) is gaining increasing attention as a treatment option for anxiety, but the current state of evidence has not yet been systematically examined.
Methods
Six electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to February 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of multicomponent LM interventions on anxiety symptoms with either care-as-usual, waitlist, no intervention, or attention control group on anxiety symptoms were identified.
Results
A total of 53 RCTs with 18,894 participants were included for qualitative synthesis, in which 45 RCTs with data available were included for meta-analysis. Multicomponent LM intervention was significantly more effective than the control groups in reducing anxiety symptoms at immediate posttreatment (d = 0.19, p < .001) and at short-term follow-up (d = 0.29, p < .001). However, no significant difference at medium-term was found (p = .14), whereas more studies are needed to study the long-term effects. The subgroup analyses suggested that baseline anxiety symptoms was a significant moderator, suggesting that those with moderate level of baseline anxiety symptoms appeared to have greater improvements (d = 0.66, p < .05).
Limitations
Minimal anxiety symptoms at baseline contributed to the floor effect and influenced the degree of improvement. The included RCTs had a high risk of bias in general with potential publication bias detected.
Conclusion
The findings of this meta-analysis provided support for the positive effects of multicomponent LM interventions for anxiety symptoms. Future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of multicimponent LM and the optimal baseline anxiety severity.}

These problems represent two “sides of the same coin,” and neither can be addressed independently of the other without untenable losses of both equity and precision. Thus, to move toward precise, continuous predictors of gender/sex-related differences, rather than one which is noisy and dichotomous, we must target investigations toward specific gender/sex-related variables or processes, while controlling for others. Drawing on ideas from precision medicine and intersectional feminist scholarship, I will argue that major improvements to clinical practice are already possible, and propose steps toward a gender/sex-omics approach.}

Increased arterial stiffness and adverse central pulsatile hemodynamics can be the cause and consequence of hypertension and its complications. In this chapter, we attempt to introduce the utility of arterial stiffness and central pulsatile hemodynamic indices for individualizing approaches in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. We will discuss available evidence regarding how arterial stiffness and central pulsatile hemodynamics relate to hypertension phenotypes and how measuring these mechanical biomarkers may personalize antihypertensive therapy. Several phenotypes, such as isolated systolic hypertension, isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated central hypertension, isolated brachial hypertension, white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, isolated nocturnal hypertension, and exaggerated blood pressure variability, are covered in this chapter. Characterizing individual-specific vascular properties as biomechanical markers in the detection, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of hypertension is at its infancy stage, but the ideal personalized medicine could finally be achieved by the relentless efforts toward this “holy grail.”}

Introduction
The “lost penis syndrome” (LPS) is a term often used in non-clinical settings to describe the subjective perception of the loss of cutaneous and proprioceptive feelings of the male organ during vaginal penetration. Although deserving clinical attention, this syndrome did not receive any consideration in the medical literature. Notwithstanding, it represents a relatively unexceptional condition among patients in sexual medicine clinics, and it is often reported together with other sexual dysfunctions, especially delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, male anorgasmia and inability to maintain a full erection.
Objectives
To draft a new conceptual characterization of the LPS, defined as a lack of penile somesthetic sensations during sexual penetration due to various causes and leading to several sexual consequences in both partners.
Methods
Based on an extensive literature review and physiological assumptions, the mechanisms contributing to friction during penovaginal intercourse, and their correlation to LPS, have been explored, as well as other nonanatomical factors possibly contributing to the loss of penile sensations.
Results
Efficient penile erection and sensitivity, optimal vaginal lubrication and trophism contribute to penovaginal friction. Whenever one of these processes does not occur, loss of penile sensation defined as LPS can occur. Sociocultural, psychopathological and age-related (ie, couplepause) factors are also implicated in the etiology. Four types of LPS emerged from the literature review: anatomical and/or functional, behavioral, psychopathological and iatrogenic. According to the subtype, a wide variety of treatments can be employed, including PDE5i, testosterone replacement therapy and vaginal cosmetic surgery, as well as targeted therapy for concomitant sexual comorbidity.
Conclusion
We held up the mirror on LPS as a clinically existing multifactorial entity and provided medical features and hypotheses contributing to or causing the occurrence of LPS. In the light of a sociocultural and scientific perspective, we proposed a description and categorization of this syndrome hypothesizing its usefulness in daily clinical practice.

abstract = {Background
Mailuo Shutong Pills (MLST) have displayed pharmacological activity against thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). However, the active ingredients and therapeutic mechanism of MLST against TAO remained to be further clarified.
Purpose
The aim of this study was to explore the active components of MLST and their synergistic mechanism against TAO by integrating pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacometabolomics (PM).
Methods
TAO model rats were established by sodium laurate solution. Firstly, the efficacy of MLST was evaluated by gangrene score, blood flow velocity, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Secondly, PK research was conducted on bioavailable components to characterize their dynamic behaviors under TAO. Thirdly, multiple plasma and urine metabolic biomarkers for sodium laurate-induced TAO rats were found by untargeted metabolomics, and then variations in TAO-altered metabolites following MLST treatment were analyzed utilizing multivariate and bioinformatic analysis. Additionally, metabolic pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst. Finally, the dynamic link between absorbed MLST-compounds and TAO-associated endogenous metabolites was established by correlation analysis.
Results
MLST significantly alleviated gangrene symptoms by improving the infiltration of inflammatory cells and blood supply in TAO rats. Significant differences in metabolic profiles were found in 17 differential metabolites in plasma and 24 in urine between Sham and TAO rats. The 10 bioavailable MLST-compounds, such as chlorogenic acid and paeoniflorin, showed positive or negative correlations with various TAO-altered metabolites related to glutamate metabolism, histidine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and so on.
Conclusion
This study originally investigated the dynamic interaction between MLST and the biosystem, providing unique insight for disclosing the active components of MLST and their synergistic mechanisms against TAO, which also shed light on new therapeutic targets for TAO and treatment.}

abstract = {During the last decades relevant advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of uterine fibroids (UFs) and their formation from smooth muscle cells by the stimulation of hormonal and genetic pathways. Although 50–75% of UFs are considered to be non-clinically relevant when non-asymptomatic, the main clinical symptoms and signs of UFs are abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), pelvic pain and/or bulk symptoms and reproductive failure. The first diagnostic tool recommended is transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), usually providing a clear and straightforward diagnosis. In order to standardize the description of TVUS findings and to facilitate guidelines to provide clearer and targeted recommendations, different UF reporting systems are being used, such as the Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment criteria, the FIGO Classification and the STEPW/Lasmar Classification. In specific cases other complementary imaging techniques may be required. Depending on the presentation of symptoms, their severity, and the clinical context of each patient, different options may be proposed and individualized. Since many UFs are asymptomatic, in these cases no medical or surgical intervention would be necessary. In symptomatic UFs physicians should individualize the treatment considering other factors beyond the UF type or morphology. Tranexamic acid, levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, selective progesterone receptor modulators, oral contraceptives, GnRH antagonist +/− addback therapy and surgical procedures, are among the different therapeutic options that clinicians should discuss with the patient. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of UFs intrinsic stem cells may directly affect the response to targeted treatments, making a variable response to treatments plausible for each UF.}

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe global public health issue because it is an irreversible neurodegeneration of the brain that impairs personality, cognition, memory, and other functions before it ultimately results in death from total brain failure. At least 50 million people are thought to be affected by dementias like Alzheimer's worldwide. That is greater than Colombia's population, according to the UN. If innovations are not made, rates may reach 152 million by 2050. AD currently lacks clear diagnosis methods and efficient treatments. Additionally, the diagnostic techniques that are now on the market are insufficient for an early AD screening to begin preventative measures. Recently, new approaches to address some of the issues associated with AD have been guaranteed by the developing science of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology, which includes its potential for a better understanding of the early diagnoses of AD, AD root cause molecular mechanisms, and effective treatment, refers to the techniques of designing and manufacturing nano size (1–100nm) structures through controlled positional and/or self-assembly of atoms and molecules. Drugs, vaccinations, or regenerative proteins offer “real” opportunities for improving illness outcomes, but they are constrained by the blood-brain barrier, which frequently restricts their ability to enter the brain. Here, we will focus on how polymer science and nanotechnology might address these issues and perhaps enhance the accuracy of diagnostic procedures. In this chapter, we'll talk about several recently proposed uses of nanotechnology in medicine, such as the analysis of quantum dots, localized surface plasmon resonance sensors, and nanomechanical cantilever arrays for the early diagnosis of AD.}

To determine dentists’ awareness and/or adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) guidelines for preventing infective endocarditis (IE) in patients with high-risk heart conditions.
Study Design
A systematic literature review was performed on MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Proquest, Embase, Dentistry, and Oral Sciences Source databases, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta–Analyses checklist. Nationwide studies based on questionnaires, surveys, and interviews completed by dentists and published since 2007 were included.
Results
From 2907 articles screened, 28 studies were selected (across 20 countries). The quality of included studies was poor due to a lack of standard evaluation tools, low response rates, and lack of questionnaire validity and/or reliability. Approximately 75% of surveyed dentists reported being knowledgeable about AP guidelines, but only ∼25% complied. Reported compliance with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines was 4 times higher than with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommendations. Some of the highest adherence rates were reported for other national AP guidelines. Significant geographic differences were observed in the estimated adherence to AHA guidelines and the percentage of dentists who reported seeking advice from physicians and/or cardiologists.
Conclusion
Rates of compliance and/or adherence were substantially different from rates of knowledge and/or awareness, including relevant geographic dissimilarities. Compliance/adherence was higher for AHA than NICE.}

abstract = {Introduction
There are few data in the Spanish population about the causes of death in patients admitted to Internal Medicine departments for heart failure (HF). Their study according to left ventricular ejection fraction (reduced: rEF, mid-range: mEF, and preserved: pEF) could improve the knowledge of patients and their prognosis.
Methods
Prospective multicentre cohort study of 4144 patients admitted with HF to Internal Medicine departments. Their clinical characteristics, mortality rate and causes were classified according to pEF (≥50%), mEF (40%–49%) and rEF (<40%). Patients were followed-up for a median of one year.
Results
There were 1198 deaths (29%). The cause of death was cardiovascular (CV) in 833 patients (69.5%), mainly HF (50%) and sudden cardiac death (SCD, 7.5%). Non-cardiovascular (Non-CV) causes were responsible for 365 deaths (30.5%). The most common Non-CV causes were infections (13%). The most frequent and early cause in all groups was HF. Patients with pEF, compared to the other groups, had lower risk of SCD and higher risk of infections (P < .05). The causes of death in patients with mrEF were closer to those with pEF.
Conclusions
The causes of death in patients with HF were different depending on EF strata. Patients with mEF and pEF, due to their high comorbidity and higher frequency of NoCV death, would require comprehensive management by Internal Medicine.
Resumen
Introducción
Los datos disponibles de las causas de muerte en pacientes ingresados por Insuficiencia Cardíaca (IC) en Servicios de Medicina Interna y en población española según Fracción de eyección (FE) reducida (FER), preservada (FEP) e intermedia (FEI) son escasos. Su estudio puede mejorar el conocimiento de estos pacientes y su pronóstico.
Métodos
Estudio de cohortes multicéntrico y prospectivo de 4144 pacientes que ingresaron por IC en unidades de Medicina Interna. Se registraron sus características clínicas, tasa de fallecimientos y sus causas agrupados según FEP (≥ 50%), FEI (40%–49%) y FER (<40%) durante una mediana de seguimiento de un año.
Resultados
Se registraron 1198 fallecimientos (29%), de los que 833 fallecieron por causas cardiovasculares (CV) (69,5%), fundamentalmente por IC (50%) y por muerte súbita (MS) (7,5%); y 365 por causas no cardiovasculares (NoCV) (30,5%), principalmente por infecciones (13%). La causa más frecuente y temprana en todos los grupos fue la IC. Los pacientes con FEP tenían menor tasa de MS y mayor de infecciones (P < ,05). Las causas de muerte en FEI fueron más parecidas a las de FEP.
Conclusiones
Las causas de muerte en pacientes con IC fueron diferentes dependiendo del tipo de FE. Los pacientes con FEI y FEP, por su elevada comorbilidad y mayor frecuencia de muerte NoCV, son los que más se beneficiarían de un manejo integral por parte de Medicina Interna.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Although therapeutic hypothermia is currently considered an effective treatment for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), neonatal HIE is a disease requiring multiple therapeutic measures. Related Chinese herbal injections (CHIs) have been carried out in Chinese local hospitals for several years, and the outcomes all seem to show positive results. At the same time, other Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) methods have also shown vigorous vitality.
Aim of the study
This study constructed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to investigate the efficacy of CHIs including Shenmai Injection (SMI), Compound musk injection (SXI), Ligustrazine injection (CXI), Compound danshen injection (DSI), Astragalus injection (HQI), Ginkgo biloba extract injection (YXI), and Puerarin injection (GGI) combined with traditional symptomatic treatment (TST) and TST alone in HIE.
Methods
A literature review was conducted in several databases from inception to 9 February 2023. The quality of the included studies was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were analyzed by STATA 17.0 and R 4.2.2 software. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probability values were applied to rank the examined treatments. Bayesian network meta-analysis was designed to access the effectiveness of different CHIs.
Results
A total of 46 eligible randomized controlled trials involving 3,448 patients and 7 CHIs were included. The results of the NMA showed that SMI, SXI, CXI, DSI, HQI, YXI, and GGI combined with TST significantly improved treatment performance compared to TST alone. SMI + TST had obvious superiorities in the clinical effective rate and the original reflection recovery time. SXI + TST was the most advantageous in the Cure rate and the Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA). CXI + TST was shown to reduce the incidence of sequelae best. All articles reported that there were no obvious adverse drug reactions/adverse drug events (ADRs/ADEs).
Conclusion
This NMA showed that using CHIs in combination with TST improved treatment performance and could be beneficial for patients with HIE compared to using TST alone. Thereinto, SXI + TST showed a preferable improvement in patients with HIE when unified considering the clinical effective rate and other outcomes. As for safety, more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis.}

However, clinical trials on BNCT for patients with brain tumors are on-going. To improve the therapeutic efficacy of BNCT for brain tumors, we developed a boron delivery system that involves the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in contrast to the conventional method that involves intravenous (IV) administration. This study aimed to investigate the time-concentration profile of boron in the CSF as well as the uptake rate of boron by the brain cells after administering L-p‑boronophenylalanine (BPA) into the lateral ventricle of normal rats. Brain cell uptake rates were compared between the CSF-based and IV administration methods. The CSF-based and IV administration methods achieved comparable brain cell uptake levels; however, the former method involved lower BPA doses than the latter method. These findings suggest that the CSF method may reduce the economic and physical burdens associated with this treatment in brain tumor patients. Future studies should validate these findings in rat models of brain tumors.}

abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method of brain stimulation, which enables to electrically stimulate neurons of the human cerebral cortex by electromagnetic induction. When applied through repeated stimulation protocols, rTMS is able to produce long-lasting modulations of cortical excitability. These long-term effects have been ascribed to neuroplastic changes affecting the synaptic properties, raising great interest in the use of rTMS as therapeutic intervention in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. There is currently a growing interest in the application of rTMS in the addiction medicine. The rationale is grounded on the possibility of restoring the normal functioning of the meso-cortico-limbic dopamine pathway, which may be directly accessed targeting rTMS to the superficial frontal nodes of the network. Therapeutic effects should be driven by excitability modulations of both the local stimulated sites and of the connected subcortical areas, where rTMS effects spread along cortico-subcortical projections. Compelling evidence from preclinical studies and from single sessions of rTMS in healthy subjects support this theoretic reasoning. Despite promising, results of the clinical studies are still not conclusive to endorse rTMS as an effective intervention to reduce craving or substance consumption. Remarkably, the role played by patients' expectations about treatment's efficacy has never been taken into account. This issue assumes a strong importance when testing treatments for addiction, because the neural mechanisms generating expectations rely on the same fronto-striatal pathways impaired in addicted patients. To conclude, rTMS treatments may represent a concrete chance to develop innovative treatment options in addiction medicine beyond available conventional therapies. Nevertheless, future research should aim at elucidating all the factors that contribute to rTMS response and their interaction, in order to design rTMS interventions with stronger and more persistent effects.}

The availability of more durable and better prosthetics and new drug delivery systems are of great scientific interest and give hope for cancer treatment and minimally invasive treatments for heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases. Electrospinning is a well-established process capable of producing ultra-fine biofibers over the thickness and porosity of nanofiber meshes. The diameter of polymer shrinks from micrometers (10–100µm) to nanometers (10–100nm) with large surface area. Interconnectivity of biofibers is well suited for nutrient transport, cell migration, communication, and efficient cellular responses for developing artificial organs. Stem cells are considered cell-based tissue engineering approaches, of which bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells are frequently utilized for the advancement of new tissue engineering strategies. The cells are combined with nanotechnology and applied for the regeneration of various tissue systems such as bone, cartilage, nerves, cardiac muscles, and skin. Advances in biotechnological, especially biomedical nanotechnology, applications of polymer nanofibers from the perspective to commercialized stages, collaborative interdisciplinary researches involving surgeons, material scientists, biologist, physiologists, clinicians, and engineers are required to develop functionalized artificial organs in regenerative medicine to benefit people.}

Meanwhile, as an important component of medicine system across the world, traditional medicine (TM) originates from knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different traditional cultures. Yet whether current theory and method system of HTA is applicable for TM is necessary to be explored and investigated. In principle, the general steps and methods of HTA could be basically applicable to TM, except for the PICO structuring, cost measurement, and supportive clinical evidence and information collection in economic evaluation. Therefore, these three challenging problems need to be focused and addressed in future HTA for TM.}

Originally identified as bone marrow growth factors capable of acting on hemopoietic progenitor cells to induce their proliferation and differentiation into mature blood cells, these cytokines are also recognized as key mediators of inflammation and the pathobiology of diverse immunologic diseases. This increased understanding of the functional repertoire of IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF has led to an explosion of interest in modulating their functions for clinical management. Key to the successful clinical translation of this knowledge is the recognition that these cytokines act by engaging distinct dimeric receptors and that they share a common signaling subunit called β-common or βc. The structural determination of how IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF interact with their receptors and linking this to their differential biological functions on effector cells has unveiled new paradigms of cell signaling. This knowledge has paved the way for novel mAbs and other molecules as selective or pan inhibitors for use in different clinical settings.}

Thus, this investigation aimed to compare Brazilian Unified Healthcare System–oriented OM clinical care in Brazil before and during the pandemic so far.
Study Design
The data were extracted from the public database of the Ministry of Health of Brazil and a descriptive analysis was performed of the mean number of clinical consultations in OM comparing the prepandemic period with the pandemic period.
Results
The data showed the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in OM clinical consultation. Brazilian general average deficit on OM clinical consultations in the pandemic period was −65.59%, representing more than 21,000 clinical consultations.
Conclusions
Quick and safe actions are needed to regularize or at least minimize both the critical immediate risks as well as the possible long-term negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on oral diseases.}

abstract = {Outcomes: 1. Report and discuss differences in hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) fellows’ reported willingness to discuss versus provide recommendations regarding use of medical cannabis 2. Integrate evidence for medical cannabis into evaluating the options for managing patient symptoms
Purpose
Medical cannabis is increasingly considered for palliation of pain, neuropathy, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, and other symptoms. We aimed to determine whether training in hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) adequately prepares fellows to counsel patients about medical cannabis.
Methods
A previously validated questionnaire was adapted for HPM fellows. Domains included fellows’ practices regarding cannabis recommendations in treating serious illness and their knowledge of its effectiveness and risks as compared with standard treatments. From February through June 2022, 167 U.S. HPM fellowship programs were sent a survey to distribute to fellows.
Results
Forty-four programs from 19 states participated; of the 142 trainees across these programs, 58 responded (response rate of 41%). Participants included 72% female; 59% White, 22% Asian, and 4% Hispanic. Of respondents, 83% reported receiving formal training regarding medical cannabis; 66% reported discussing medical cannabis with more than five patients in the preceding year; 29% recommended medical cannabis to more than five patients in the preceding year. Only 20%, however, felt sufficiently informed to issue cannabis-related clinical recommendations. HPM fellows who reported prior training in medical cannabis were more likely to feel sufficiently informed to discuss cannabis recommendations (risk ratio: 10.07; 95% CI, 1.46 to 78.4) and to recommend medical cannabis to patients (risk ratio: 2.57; 95% CI, 1.04 to 6.37). Fellows rate cannabis as equally or more effective than conventional treatments for the following symptoms: anorexia/cachexia (60%), nausea/vomiting (45%), pain (25%), and neuropathic pain (19%).
Conclusion
Most HPM fellows report formal training in the use of medical cannabis. Over half of trainees reported discussing medical cannabis with patients, but few considered themselves sufficiently informed to make cannabis-related clinical recommendations. These results suggest both a need for expanded high-quality evidence for medical cannabis in palliative care and for improved formal education for HPM fellows.}

The continual development of potent immunosuppressive regimens has led to a decreased incidence of acute rejection and improvement of short-term kidney allograft survival. In contrast to acute rejection, glomerular diseases of the kidney allograft are being encountered more frequently and are emerging as leading causes of late kidney allograft failure. Although data on the pathogeneses of glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft are sparse, cumulative evidence suggests that post-transplant glomerular diseases may be the result of inherited predispositions and immunologic triggers. Although studying immunologic signals and performing genome-wide association studies are ideal approaches to tackle glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft, such studies are challenging because of the lack of adequately powered cohorts. In this review, we focus on the most commonly encountered recurrent and de novo glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft. We address the important advances made in understanding the immunopathology and genetic susceptibility of glomerular diseases in the native kidney and how to benefit from such knowledge to further our knowledge of post-transplant glomerular diseases. Defining genomic and immune predictors for glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft would support novel donor-recipient matching strategies and development of targeted therapies to ultimately improve long-term kidney allograft survival.}

Anal stenosis is narrowing of anal canal that may result from true anatomic stricture or functional stenosis. Anal stenosis from irritant chemical application for hemorrhoid is rare and tends to be more severe. There is scarcity of data in the literature regarding anal stenosis secondary to traditional medicine application for the treatment of hemorrhoid. This case report can create awareness to promote health education and health advancement, especially in areas with wide spread use of traditional medicine. In addition, it can motivate general surgeons to prepare themselves to handle such cases in the absence of colorectal surgeons.
Presentation of the case
A 75 years old male farmer presented with worsening of difficulty of passing feces and flatus and intermittent abdominal distention of 3 months. The patient has history of application of irritant chemical by traditional healer for treatment of hemorrhoid. Physical examination led to diagnosis of severe anal stenosis. Bilateral house advancement flap anoplasty done by a general surgeon with excellent result.
Discussion
The commonest cause of anal stenosis is hemorrhoidectomy. Other causes include other anorectal surgeries, anorectal diseases, and radiotherapy. Diagnosis of anal stenosis is by physical examination. Treatment is conservative for mild cases and advancement flap anoplasty for moderate to severe cases.
Conclusion
Health education and health advancement can create awareness, hence preventing people from having wrong treatments. House advancement flap anoplasty is a good option for the treatment of anal stenosis in resource limited setup, as it is easy to do and has good outcome.}

abstract = {The discovery of bacterial enzymes with specificity for IgG antibodies has led to breakthroughs in several autoantibody-mediated diseases. Two such enzymes, IdeS and EndoS, degrade IgG by different mechanisms, and have separately shown promise in numerous animal models of autoimmune diseases. Recently, imlifidase (the international nonproprietary name for IdeS) has advanced to clinical trials, where it has performed remarkably well in desensitizing patients to enable kidney transplantation, and in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Conversely, it performed poorly in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. This review summarizes the development of antibody-degrading enzymes, with a discussion of key clinical studies involving imlifidase. The future of the field is also discussed, including the use of these enzymes in other diseases, and the potential for re-dosing.}

abstract = {Objective
To describe the characteristics and short-term prognostic factors of patients with prolonged stay in internal medicine.
Material and methods
Retrospective case series study including patients admitted to an Internal Medicine service of a university hospital with lengths of stay greater than 30 days during 5 years. Information was obtained from the Minimum Basic Data Set. Outcome variables were a very long length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and adverse outcomes in the first 30 days after discharge.
Results
Out of 11,948 patients, 335 (2.8%) cases had a prolonged stay. The total length of stay was 15,271 days (15% of the total length of stay of the service). The mean age was 74.5 (±13.9) years, 180 (53.7%) were male. The median length of stay was 39 (RIC 34-49) days. Intensive Care Unit admission (OR = 2.5; 95%CI 1.4-4.7; p = 0.003) and receiving a geriatric assessment (OR = 0.3; 95%CI 0.8-0.9; p = 0.042) were independent factors with an effect on very long length of stay. Having an admission in the previous year was an independent factor for an adverse outcome 30 days after discharge (OR = 2.2; 95%CI 1.0-4.8).
Conclusions
The percentage of patients with prolonged length of stay is less than 3%, but they have a high impact on the activity of an internal medicine service. There are factors associated with a very long length of stay and with the presence of an early adverse outcome after discharge.

abstract = {Microneedle (MN) patches are composed of micron-sized needles organised in arrays and attached to the backing of a patch. The most common type is the transdermal patch, designed to uniformly penetrate the stratum corneum to reach the dermis of the skin. Recent advances in 3D printing technology have allowed the development of reproducible, efficient methods to create microneedles on a large scale, which had previously been a factor in the limited clinical uptake. In comparison to conventional drug delivery methods, MN patches have been shown to significantly reduce pain and scar generation while maintaining effective and reliable delivery of vaccines, immunotherapies, and slow-release drug therapies. The MN design has also been investigated as an alternative to conventional tissue biopsy, with positive results. Synchronous delivery of medications while monitoring biomarkers in dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) is also a promising clinical development with wide-reaching benefits. MNs are diverse in design and material composition, and with developments in fabrication technology, transdermal drug delivery has been applied to many clinical fields, including chronic illnesses such as arthritis or diabetes, cancer, immunotherapies, epidemic disease prevention and ocular treatments. While the majority of MN patch applications are still in the pre-clinical testing phase in animal models, further translation of this technology to the clinic could aid in medication and vaccine compliance, improve treatment access in rural and remote communities, improve targeted therapy applications and provide financial cost savings to the public health sector. This review evaluates the designs and applications of current transdermal MN patches for drug delivery, biomarker monitoring and diagnostic biopsies compared to conventional needle-based methods.}

The CMR combustion underwent water loss (<150 °C) and the decomposition of the main organic components (150–560 °C). The CMR combustion performed better in the air than 8-2/CO2-O2 atmosphere experimentally, as was also evidenced by the joint optimization based on artificial neural network. The rising oxygen fraction of the three oxy-fuel atmospheres improved the oxy-fuel combustion performance by 76.7%. The air atmosphere led to a higher activation energy at the start (275.15 kJ/mol) and end (520.91 kJ/mol) of the main reaction, while the oxy-fuel atmosphere resulted in a higher activation energy of 400.22 kJ/mol with the conversion degree of 0.7. Its reaction mechanism followed the sequence type (Fn) and changed from F3 to F2 in the 8-2/CO2-O2 atmosphere and from F2.4 to F2.5 in the air atmosphere and flue gas functional groups included CO2, H2O, C=O, and C-(O)H. The oxy-fuel atmosphere was more prone to slagging than the air atmosphere. The ash in the oxy-fuel atmosphere was easily formed calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxyphosphate.}

Several lines of evidence suggest a possible role of risperidone via the antagonistic effect of Dopamine D2 and 5HT-receptor in different neurological diseases like cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia, neuroinflammation, Huntington's disease, and sleep cycle management. Therefore, the pharmacological interactions of risperidone in all these diseases were investigated. Some reports on the use of risperidone in the treatment of dopaminergic psychosis have been slightly conflicting. However, more research is needed to evaluate the role of risperidone in the treatment of these neurological diseases.}

Timely personalized medicine is an unmet, critical need in multiple sclerosis (MS). A major barrier to providing individualized care is the lack of information on which interventions are most appropriate for whom. In this viewpoint, we submit a rationale and three-step roadmap to personalized integrative medicine. This multidisciplinary team approach requires that we (1) comprehensively assess whole health at diagnosis, (2) appropriately integrate data within electronic health record systems and leverage machine learning to analyze big data, and (3) design, test, and deliver multimodal interventions. Using a whole-person approach to assessment and intervention, we will be better informed to provide personalized care at the level of the individual.}

abstract = {Politically authorized reports on personalized and precision medicine stress an urgent need for finer-grained disease categories and faster taxonomic revision, through integration of genomic and phenotypic data. Developing a data-driven taxonomy is, however, not as simple as it sounds. It is often assumed that an integrated data infrastructure is relatively easy to implement in countries that already have highly centralized and digitalized health care systems. Our analysis of initiatives associated with the Danish National Genome Center, recently launched to bring Denmark to the forefront of personalized medicine, tells a different story. Through a “meta-taxonomy” of taxonomic revisions, we discuss what a genomics-based disease taxonomy entails, epistemically as well as organizationally. Whereas policy reports promote a vision of seamless data integration and standardization, we highlight how the envisioned strategy imposes significant changes on the organization of health care systems. Our analysis shows how persistent tensions in medicine between variation and standardization, and between change and continuity, remain obstacles for the production as well as the evaluation of genomics-based taxonomies of difference. We identify inherent conflicts between the ideal of dynamic revision and existing regulatory functions of disease categories in, for example, the organization and management of health care systems. Moreover, we raise concerns about shifts in the regulatory regime of evidence standards, where clinical care increasingly becomes a vehicle for biomedical research.}
