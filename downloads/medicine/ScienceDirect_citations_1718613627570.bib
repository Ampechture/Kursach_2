abstract = {Targeted drug delivery systems have been developed to improve regenerative treatment and deliver a specific amount of a drug to a dysfunctional region of the body over a long duration of time. This aids in regulating the optimal tissue and plasma drug concentration in the body, preventing any drug-induced harm to healthy tissue. Boron nitride is an emerging carrier that is currently being exploited and its desired carrier features of being nonimmunogenic, biocompatible, nontoxic, biodegradable, and incapable of being recognized by the host’s defensive mechanisms make it ideal in targeted drug delivery. Due to their unique features, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanoparticles are highly suitable for the administration of chemotherapeutics in cancer treatment, as well as in biomedical sciences as nano-transducers and nanocarriers. These inorganic materials have been recognized for their conductivity equivalent to metals, as well as the robustness and simplicity of manufacturing. Furthermore, these materials can deliver drugs across a wide range and in a variety of concentrations. h-BN and its prospective in various targeted drug delivery systems and therapeutic domains have been discussed in this chapter. Current research and development in their functional and structural characteristics, and synthesis, as well as future approaches for clinical applications, have been presented and addressed.}

In this study, Clostridium butyricum was used as a fermentation strain, while a mixture of licorice root, Astragalus membranaceus and Acanthopanax senticosus was used as a substrate for solid-state fermentation. The fermented product (F-CHM) was mixed with basic feed at levels of 0 (NC), 5% (S-5%), 10% (S-10%) and 20% (S-20%) to feed largemouth bass for 56-day. The results showed that no significant effect of F-CHM was observed on weight gain, but the resistance to A.hydrophila infection was improved. The activity of alkaline phosphatase and lysozyme in plasma was increased with F-CHM addition, and the content of malondialdehyde was significantly decreased. In the spleen, a higher expression of the inflammatory factor TGF-β and apoptosis related genes (Caspase-3 and p53) was detected after the addition of F-CHM. With the addition of F-CHM, the midgut villus height of largemouth bass was significantly increased, and the expression of the intestinal barrier related genes, ZO-1 and Claudin-4 was upregulated. Furthermore, the concentration of short-chain fatty acids was increased in the S-20% F-CHM addition group. Sequencing results showed that the intestinal flora abundance and diversity were dramatically increased in the S-10% group. In addition, the development of harmful bacteria was restrained, and the colonization of beneficial flora was increased. Collectively, dietary F-CHM can be applied as a largemouth bass feed supplement to enhance fish immunity, regulate the intestinal flora and improve the ability of the host to protect against pathogenic bacteria.}

Subsequently, compressive strength tests and simulated body fluid (SBF) soaking experiments were performed to assess the mechanical and biological properties of the scaffold. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for analyzing the scaffolds. The findings indicated that an increase in the amount of dicalcium phosphate decreased the porosity of the scaffold from 76% to 64%, raised the compressive strength from 2.48 MPa to 4.8 MPa, and lowered the dissolution rate from 39% to 24%. These changes led to an improvement in the scaffold's chemical bonding and stability. According to micromechanical models, the optimal scaffold composition was found to be 10 wt% of dicalcium phosphate in a polyvinyl alcohol mixture with constant drug content. Moreover, an increase in the dicalcium phosphate content led to an elevation in the drug release percentage due to the reduction in porosity and an increase in the drug release rate. The data were analyzed by using various kinetic models through diagrams generated by a UV device.}

abstract = {Objective
We have previously conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized control trials investigating the antipsychotic effect of immunomodulating drugs in individuals with psychotic disorders which showed an overall improvement of psychopathology; however, investigations are lacking on individuals with elevated baseline inflammatory biomarkers, who might have a larger beneficial effect of immunomodulating drugs compared to those without increased inflammation.
Method
Multiple databases were searched up until January 2022. Only double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were included. All authors were contacted in regards of sharing individual-level participant data including psychopathology at baseline and end-of-treatment and at least one type of biomarker at baseline. The primary outcome is whether anti-inflammatory add-on treatment results in a greater decrease in psychopathology in those with higher levels of any inflammatory biomarker, compared to those with lower levels. Secondary outcomes include an analysis of each of the individual inflammatory biomarkers one by one, whether the efficacy of anti-inflammatory add-ons is greater in those with higher levels hereof, and an investigation of whether anti-inflammatory add-on treatment decreases levels of these inflammatory biomarkers over time. We will preserve the clustering of patients within studies and thus analyse the data in a two-step approach. Firstly, we will estimate a standardised mean difference (SMD) for each individual study. Secondly, the data from each individual study will be synthesized using the random-effects model and fixed-effect model meta-analyses.
Results
Will be presented at the conference
Conclusions
The Results will provide useful knowledge for future work towards biomarker-based personalized medicine in psychiatry.}

abstract = {Introduction
The SARS-Cov2 pandemic boosted the use of telemedicine. The aim of our study was to evaluate patient and physician perceptions regarding the use of the different modalities of telemedicine for various health problems.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Geneva Switzerland in 2021. Patients in waiting rooms of both medical centres and emergency services were invited to answer an online questionnaire, while physicians working in private and public settings were asked to answer a similar questionnaire by email. The questionnaire focused on digital literacy, acceptability, preferences, as well as barriers and facilitators concerning of telemedicine.
Findings
570 patients and 543 physicians participated. After face-to-face consultations, most patients preferred the telephone to other modalities for health issues such as simple medical advice (65%), discussion of clinical parameters (61%), acute or chronic problems (55% and 60%), and psychological support (57%).They valued emails for communication of blood tests (56%) and renewal of medication (49%). Half of patients considered video to be acceptable for psychological support. A large majority of physicians considered the phone to be an acceptable modality for all the issues mentioned above (85% to 94%). Emails and videos were considered to be acceptable for follow-up of patients with chronic diseases (53% and 54%) and provision of simple advice (51% and 48%). 65% of physicians would use video for psychological support. Patients’ mains reasons for using telemedicine were lack of traveling (72%) and saving time (56%). Disadvantages were lack of physical examination (60%), technical problems (43%), and unsuitability (43%). Physicians feared the potential negative impact of telemedicine on the therapeutic relationship and insisted on the need for a facilitated access.
Conclusion
The use of telemedicine has increased since the pandemic but both doctors and patients continue to prefer face-to-face consultations. Telephone remains more acceptable than video in most medical situations.}

abstract = {Head and neck cancers are a heterogeneous group of highly aggressive tumors and collectively represent the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Current multimodal treatment concepts combine surgery, chemotherapy, irradiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapeutics. Recent scientific advancements have enabled a more precise molecular characterization of HNSCC and revealed novel therapeutic targets and prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Notably, HNSCC is characterized by complex relations between stromal, epithelial, and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME consists of different subsets of immune cells that infiltrate the tumors and interact with the tumor cells or with each other. Understanding multiple pivotal factors in HNSCC tumorigenesis and tumor progression may help define novel targets and develop more effective therapies for patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the molecular biology of HNSCC and their effects on clinical oncology; it is meant for a broad readership in the head and neck cancers field.}

Then the PL-CD@Fe3O4 nanoparticles were studied of the characterization and the selective separation performance for natural medicine (scutellarin). The experimental results showed that PL-CD@Fe3O4 nanoparticles were successfully prepared with a particle size of about 30 nm and a saturation magnetization of 40 emu/g. When the nanoparticles were in the environment of pH = 7, the stability was the best, the adsorption capacity was the strongest, and the number of recyclable times was the most. Langmuir model deduced that the maximum adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles was 76.3 mg/g. In addition, the experimental results of using nanoparticles to separate SCU in the crude extract showed that the purity of SCU could be increased from 72.2% to 93.5% after repeated cyclic separation three times. Two dimensional NMR analysis showed that the selective separation of SCU by PL-CD@Fe3O4 was mainly caused by the host–guest interaction between cyclodextrin and SCU. In conclusion, the PL-CD@Fe3O4 nanoparticles are a very promising material for the extraction and separation of other similar natural drugs.}

In bone tissue engineering, hydroxyapatite (HA) plays a major role in bone graft applications. This study deals with a facile method for synthesizing HA hexagonal nanorods from seashells by a solid-state hydrothermal transition process. The synthesized HA nanorods (∼2.29 nm) were reinforced with carbon nanotube and chitosan on graphene oxide sheets with polymeric support by in-situ synthetic approach. Among the synthesized nanocomposites viz., hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide (HA-GO), hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide-chitosan (HA-GO-CS), hydroxyapatite-graphene oxide-chitosan-carbon nanotube-polylactic acid (HA-GO–CS–CNT-PLA). Among them, the HA-GO–CS–CNT-PLA composite exhibits micro and macro porosity (∼200 to 600 μm), higher mechanical strength, (Hardness ∼90.5 ± 1.33 MPa; Tensile strength 25.62 MPa), and maximum cell viability in MG63 osteoblast-like cells (80%). The self-assembled hybrid-nanocomposite of HA-GO–CS–CNT-PLA is a promising material for bone filler application and could efficiently utilize seashell waste through the green process.}

To predict, monitor, and assess the effect of RM therapies, complex, real-time characterization of the host environment in terms of biomechanical, biophysical, and biochemical cues is required. This chapter describes the advances in magnetic materials that are currently being tested as RM monitoring platforms. Implantable and magnetoelastic sensors, as well as the design of micro- and nanoscale wireless devices, will be presented, as will tissue engineering applications for bone, orthopedic implants, blood vessels, pancreatic islets, and skin. We will discuss the use of magnetic nanomaterials as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic particle imaging, as well as imagistic surveys of cell populations in various cell and gene therapy applications.}

abstract = {Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass during the blastocyst stage of in utero development and can differentiate into all of the cell types found in the body including lung epithelial, cardiomyocytes, and neural cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be reprogrammed from terminally differentiated somatic cells and exhibit similar properties to ESCs without the ethical dilemmas. The use of iPSCs has allowed for enormous progress in developmental biology, understanding the pathophysiology and etiology of diseases, drug discovery and toxicology screening, and cell-based engraftment protocols that employ “autografts.” Because they are derived from a patient, they can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, biomarker discovery, and drug targets, specifically tailored to that individual, hence the roots of “personalized or precision medicine.” These specialized and personalized in vitro culture systems can be used in multiple ways to create a database of a person's molecular (genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic) and functional (phenotypic) makeup. In short, patient-specific therapeutic strategies, enabled by the use of hiPSCs and their derivatives may optimize therapeutic efficacy, minimize adverse effects, diminish individual and societal costs, and save lives.}

The non-metallic coupling method could achieve the same efficiency as the metal activation and meanwhile release environmental stress. In this study, the original biochar (BC) was prepared through using Chinese medicinal residue of Acanthopanax senticosus as the precursor. Compared with other biochar, the pore size structure was higher and toxicity risk was lower. The ultrasonic (US)/Acanthopanax senticosus biochar (ASBC)/persulfate oxidation system was established for Atrazine (ATZ). Results showed that 45KHz in middle and low frequency band cooperated with ASBC600 to degrade nearly 70 % of ATZ within 50 min, and US promoted the formation of SO4− and OH. Meanwhile, the synergy index of US and ASBC was calculated to be 1.18, which showed positive synergistic effect. Finally, the potential toxicity was examined by using Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and luminescent bacteria. This study provides a promising way for the activation of persulfate, which is expected to bring a new idea for the win-win situation of pollutant degradation and solid waste resource utilization.}

abstract = {Background
The 2017 update of the ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline for heart failure (HF) management recommends replacing ACEIs or ARBs with an ARNi (class I recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) in chronic, symptomatic, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III HFrEF to further reduce morbidity and mortality, provided there are no contraindications. Surprisingly, only 10% of 2.29 million eligible patients use ARNi. There are limited data on the perception of ARNi among Internal Medicine (IM) Residency Program trainees, who provide a majority of hospital care in academic centers in the US. Objective: We sought to identify among IM Residency Program trainees the barriers and opportunities to clinical implementation of ARNi after acute heart failure decompensation as part of transitional care prescribing.
Methods
Two IM Residency Programs across 3 campuses at an urban, academic medical center were identified. An online, anonymous, 8-question survey using a Likert scale was created and distributed via e-mail. Survey questions included frequency in initiating or titrating ARNi prior to discharge as well as comfort level in prescribing in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Questions on barriers to prescribing, such as hypotension and hyperkalemia, as well as knowledge of patient resources were also included. Finally, quality improvement opportunities and interventions were also listed. The survey was administered over a 2-week period in January 2022.
Results
The survey was administered to 150 trainees and the response rate was 26.7%. Among respondents 62% stated that ARNi was initiated sometimes and 42% reported they were comfortable initiating ARNI during hospitalization. Conversely, 78% were slightly to not at all comfortable prescribing ARNi for patients with CKD. Perceived barriers to prescribing ARNi included cost to patient (87%), renal dysfunction (59%), hypotension (43%) and hyperkalemia (38%) and 82% were not at all familiar with patient resources such as the co-pay assistance program. To improve ARNi uptake, 58% of respondents suggested a consult to pharmacy and 47% thought a note in the electronic health record from would yield similar results.
Conclusion
Among IM trainees, CKD largely drives the low clinical implementation of ARNi in transitional care prescribing after acute HF exacerbation. Multidisciplinary initiatives with nephrology and pharmacy represent opportunities to improve provider adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy.}

abstract = {Objectives
To realize precision medicine, clinicians need to apply a growing number of diagnostic tests. Each test result relies on specific domain expertise; however, integration across a variety of diagnostics poses unique challenges-including financial sustainability of the consultation service. Recent 2022 billing code updates emphasize the value of consultations. Here, we present the design and implementation of a clinical pathology consultation workflow.
Methods
The core design team consisted of 3 board-certified molecular-genetic pathologists, 1 board-certified genetic counselor, and 1 high-complexity medical technologist. Additional team members included billing operations, electronic medical record (EMR) support staff, compliance, departmental, hospital, and network leadership. The team focused on a modular, EMR-based design with laboratory information management system integration, and compliant documentation and billing practices.
Results
The 7-month design process consisted of weekly 30-90 min meetings of the core team supplemented by various meetings with additional team members (estimated total effort ∼170h or ∼10% of a full-time position). The workflow consisted of 7 modules: (1) physician order, (2) triaging module, (3) e-reply no bill, (4) written documentation (limited, without billing), (5) written EMR documentation (comprehensive, with effort-based billing), (6) denial/appeal module, (7) direct patient question module. Since go-live in early 2022, we managed 22 consultations (n=6 comprehensive; n=16 billing-related questions) from 3 network sites.
Conclusions
Realizing a precision medicine consultation workflow required significant effort from an interdisciplinary team. The workflow accounted for various administrative and compliance-related aspects and future work will focus on reimbursement, utilization, provider adoption, and optimization of workflows.}

Certain medical fields have incorporated this deluge of information into patient care while others are lagging behind. Neurology has been slow to adopt the new methods to use the large amount of information, but it is rapidly learning from other fields. Cancer diagnosis and treatment has been at the forefront of this revolution; not only have there been an extensive number of genes associated with different cancers discovered, but this information has been used to formulate treatment plans. Other fields such as radiology and dermatology are using computer-aided imaging to diagnose illness by analysis of radiographs and to automate diagnoses of skin cancers. The concepts behind the use of machine learning in diagnosis originated from early work in the field of “cybernetics,” which is a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems – their structures, constraints, and possibilities. Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as “the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.” From the early work on control theory by Wiener and others has slowly evolved the modern concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. There are various definitions of AI or machine learning. The term is used to describe computers that perform cognitive functions that we associate with the human mind; these “thinking machines” can beat experts in chess and the Chinese game of Go. In medicine, there are capable of analyzing large amounts of data to arrive at a diagnosis through pattern recognition. Antibiotic drugs have been designed by AI in ways that were unavailable to humans, pointing to the future of molecular discovery in medicine.}

Despite high use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for alopecia areata (AA), efficacy and safety remain unclear.
Objective
To identify all CAM therapies studied for treatment of AA. Outcomes of interest included disease course and psychologic well-being.
Methods
PubMed and Embase were searched to identify English articles containing original data investigating CAM in individuals with AA from 1950-2018. Quality was assessed with Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine criteria.
Results
Of 1015 initial citations, 16 articles met inclusion criteria: 5 randomized controlled trials, 5 prospective controlled cohorts, 4 prospective noncontrolled cohorts, 1 retrospective cohort, and 1 case series. CAM therapies with best evidence and efficacy for hair growth in AA include essential oil aromatherapy, topical garlic, and oral glucosides of peony with compound glycyrrhizin. Hypnosis and mindfulness psychotherapy represent low-quality evidence for improvement of psychologic and quality of life outcomes. Adverse events were rare and mild for all therapies evaluated.
Limitations
Inconsistent or poorly reported study methodology and nonstandardized outcomes limit the conclusions that can be made from these studies.
Conclusions
This work serves to inform physician treatment of patients with AA seeking CAM while encouraging further investigation into these therapies to address some of the therapeutic challenges of AA.}

Nevertheless, senescence-regulatory factors associated with OA still need to be identified. Furthermore, few diagnostic- and prognostic-validated biochemical markers (biomarkers) are currently used in clinics to evaluate OA patients. In the future, alongside imaging and clinical examination, detecting senescence-regulatory biomarkers in patient fluids could become a prospective method for disease: diagnosis, monitoring, progression and prognosis following treatment. This review summarizes a group of circulating OA biomarkers recently linked to senescence onset. Remarkably, these factors identified in proteomics, metabolomic and microRNA studies could also have deleterious or protective roles in osteoarticular tissue homeostasis. In addition, we discuss their potentially innovative modulation in combination with senotherapeutic approaches, for long-lasting OA treatment.}

Herein, an efficient antifouling electrochemical sensor was constructed based on mesoporous silica film (MSF) coating modified graphene oxide/glass carbon electrode (GO/GCE). MSF coating was directly grown on GO/GCE by electroassisted self-assembly (EASA) method within a few seconds and GO was reduced to electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ErGO) simultaneously. Owing to the electrocatalytic activity of ErGO and electrostatic pre-enrichment of MSF toward imidacloprid (IMI), the as-obtained MSF/ErGO/GCE exhibits excellent response to IMI in two wide concentration ranges (1.0 μg mL-1 50 μg mL-1 50 μg mL-1–400 μg mL-1) with a low limit of detection of 0.3 μg mL-1(1.1 bvM)Furthermore, the antifouling electrochemical sensor possesses the capability of direct determination IMI in untreated carthamus tinctorius (a Traditional Chinese medicine, TCM).}

A fundamental aspect of PM is medical imaging which can be used for purposes such as differential diagnosis, adjustment to the specific patient features, disease screening, and preventive intervention based on the response of imaging biomarkers. Treatment decisions can be taken based on imaging abnormalities in live tissue, detect changes of the biochemical and physiological nature using structural visualization and molecular imaging. Treatment decisions can also be taken using precise biopsies and track drug delivery using nanotechnology. Combination of MRI and nanotechnology, known as theranostics, has advanced patient stratification in cancer research, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, neurological disease, and infectious diseases. These recent applications show that MRI has the potential to be developed in many applications to follow the fate of drug delivery and diagnosis at the individualized levels.}

In this situation, User authentication, fortifies the legitimate patients, doctors, medical helper staffs, etc. Not only that, but it also allows them to access the remote medical servers to serve medical services. Robust and Efficient user authentication plays a vital role here. Many researchers proposed different techniques, but all of them have different limitations like computational expenses, huge memory usage, excessive communication overhead, etc. In this article, a very lightweight authentication approach of remote user is demonstrated in IoT based smart healthcare environment. This approach optimizes the use of one-way hash function, exclusive-or operation and extended One-Time-Password which make the authentication approach lighter and effective. The security strength of the recommended protocol is elaborated with the help of informal and formal security analysis. Well known BAN logic and Real-Or-Random (ROR) model are used in to check the correctness of the protocol and ensure the security of the established session key. In addition to that, AVISPA (automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications) and ProVerif software simulation tools are utilized which parade, the proposed protocol is safe and secure against many attacks like Man-In-The-Middle attack and Replay attack, Ephemeral secret leakage attack, Known-session-specific-temporary-information attack, Impersonation attack, etc. and maintain the secrecy of the session key. Furthermore, the recommended protocol is compared with the existing/recently published protocols to exhibit better performance.}

Adnexal masses are the most common finding and vary in imaging characteristics. They are mainly unilateral, cystic masses with a low risk of malignancy that are treated conservatively. The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis scoring models may be helpful in differentiating benign from malignant masses. For those masses >5 cm, follow-up is recommended, and resection could be considered to avoid risk of torsion, rupture and hemorrhage, which may compromise pregnancy outcome. Uterine masses such as fibroids are commonly diagnosed early in the first trimester and should be followed up during pregnancy to evaluate any changes. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line test for the diagnosis of such incidentalomas; however, magnetic resonance ultrasound may have a useful role in excluding malignancy potential. As a result of their low frequency and the lack of good evidence, there are no specific guidelines on the management of incidentalomas detected at obstetric scans. Their management should follow the related general guidelines for ovarian, cervical and uterine masses, with individualized management depending on the pregnancy status.}

abstract = {Background
Mailuo Shutong Pills (MLST) have displayed pharmacological activity against thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). However, the active ingredients and therapeutic mechanism of MLST against TAO remained to be further clarified.
Purpose
The aim of this study was to explore the active components of MLST and their synergistic mechanism against TAO by integrating pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacometabolomics (PM).
Methods
TAO model rats were established by sodium laurate solution. Firstly, the efficacy of MLST was evaluated by gangrene score, blood flow velocity, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Secondly, PK research was conducted on bioavailable components to characterize their dynamic behaviors under TAO. Thirdly, multiple plasma and urine metabolic biomarkers for sodium laurate-induced TAO rats were found by untargeted metabolomics, and then variations in TAO-altered metabolites following MLST treatment were analyzed utilizing multivariate and bioinformatic analysis. Additionally, metabolic pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst. Finally, the dynamic link between absorbed MLST-compounds and TAO-associated endogenous metabolites was established by correlation analysis.
Results
MLST significantly alleviated gangrene symptoms by improving the infiltration of inflammatory cells and blood supply in TAO rats. Significant differences in metabolic profiles were found in 17 differential metabolites in plasma and 24 in urine between Sham and TAO rats. The 10 bioavailable MLST-compounds, such as chlorogenic acid and paeoniflorin, showed positive or negative correlations with various TAO-altered metabolites related to glutamate metabolism, histidine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and so on.
Conclusion
This study originally investigated the dynamic interaction between MLST and the biosystem, providing unique insight for disclosing the active components of MLST and their synergistic mechanisms against TAO, which also shed light on new therapeutic targets for TAO and treatment.}

abstract = {The commonest vaginal infection seen in the Gynecological OPDs in reproductive age is bacterial vaginosis (BV) that causes abnormal vaginal discharge and if not treated, it is allied to severe problems or complications. It is a polymicrobial syndrome categorized by normal vaginal florareplacement that leads to a significant absence or reduction of normal “hydrogen peroxide” producing lactobacillus species and an upsurge in anaerobic bacteria (Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and Mycoplasma hominis). The incidence of BV varies from 4% to 61% from asymptomatic to symptomatic women who visits sexually transmitted disease clinics. Its prevalence among reproductive-aged women globally ranges from 23% to 29% in different regions such as 24% in East Asia, 23% in Europe and Central Asia and it varies from 17.8% to 63.7% in India. The risk factors are age, marital status, race and ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, excessive perineal hygiene, sexual behavior, contraceptive methods, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, stress, HIV, and dietary factor. The clinical features are abnormal vaginal discharge, which is malodorous, and occasionally leads to irritation that impacts activity in society and also affect sexual life. The diagnosis of BV includes Nugent score system (NSS), Amsel's criteria, Spiegel's criteria, anaerobic culture, Hays/Ison system, Schmidt's scoring system, gas–liquid chromatography, sialidase activity, and DNA probes for Gardnerella vaginalis. Metronidazole is the first line for the management of BV. The positive effect of herbal medicines such as Zataria multiflora, Nigella sativa, Hypericum perforatum vaginal gel 3%, Myrtus communis L. or Berberis vulgaris along with metronidazole, Hypercum perforatum, Calendula officinalis, Saugella lavanda, garlic, pepper vaginal gel, P. ferulacea, B. vulgaris, and Allium sativum are reported. Therefore, herbal medicine is considered probable to combat bacterial vaginosis. Further, phase III and post-marketing trials in large sample sizes are recommended to prove the efficacy of herbal medicines.}

Compared to the mono-pyrolysis of TDS, its co-pyrolysis performance with CMR (the comprehensive performance index (CPI)) significantly improved by 33.9% in the N2 atmosphere and 33.2% in the CO2 atmosphere. The impregnation catalyzed the co-pyrolysis at 370°C, reduced its activation energy by 77.3 kJ/mol in the N2 atmosphere and 134.6 kJ/mol in the CO2 atmosphere, and enriched the degree of coke gasification by 44.25% in the CO2 atmosphere. The impregnation increased the decomposition rate of the co-pyrolysis by weakening the bond energy of fatty side chains and bridge bonds, its catalytic and secondary products, and its bio-oil yield by 66.19%. Its bio-oils mainly contained olefins, aromatic structural substances, and alcohols. The immersion of K2CO3 improved the aromaticity of the co-pyrolytic biochars and reduced the contact between K and Si which made it convenient for Mg to react with SiO2 to form magnesium-silicate. The co-pyrolytic biochar surfaces mainly included -OH, -CH2, C=C, and Si-O-Si. The main phases in the co-pyrolytic ash included Ca5(PO4)3(OH), Al2O3, and magnesium-silicate.}

abstract = {Introduction
APRNs treat and diagnose diseases, counsel the public about health problems, manage chronic diseases, and participate in continuing education. In the cardiovascular field, PAD, one of the manifestations of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, is archetypal in combining multiple cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus smoking). Patients with PAD should benefit from APRN care, but to date there is little published on the place of APRN in vascular medicine worldwide, and none in France.
Objective
As the status of APRN in France has only been enacted by law in 2018, we aim to investigate physicians and nurses working with patients suffering from PAD, to gather their opinions and draw the cooperation outlines these practitioners could have with an APRN.
Method
Multicentre exploratory qualitative study by semi-directive interview conducted until data saturation and thematic analysis carried out with healthcare practitioners taking care of patients with PAD: 10 physicians working either in private practice setting or hospital setting or both, and 8 nurses in a vascular unit for hospitalized patients.
Results
Three main themes emerged from responders’ verbatims: a specific organization of vascular medicine with its inherent challenges, particularly regarding patients with PAD (specific psychosocial profile of patients, lack of therapeutic education, time, knowledge of non-specialist physicians, tedious follow-up outside hospitals, complex care trajectory, and lack of medical-surgical collaboration). Second, a role for APRN, particularly in consultation as part of patient follow-up, with expected benefits for the patient and the care team. The expected benefits include a smoother care pathway and increased capacity for cardiovascular education and prevention, especially during consultations (Fig. 1). Third, there are certain pitfalls that need to be clarified to integrate these new practitioners into the vascular teams already in place. In particular, the need to inform the vascular medicine teams about this new profession, and the indispensable presence of the conditions necessary for the development of a relationship of trust.
Conclusion
APRN could be the missing link in a vascular team by creating a continuum in the care of patients with PAD, ensuring clinical assessment, nursing supervision, adverse event screening, and renewing drug prescriptions with the necessary adjustments, while ensuring an essential part of therapeutic education personalized to each PAD patient.}

abstract = {Cryptogenic infarctions are infarctions without a defined cause, despite a complete work-up. They differ from infarctions of undetermined causes, which may involve overlapping causes or an incomplete investigation. It is also different from uncommon heritable and non-heritable causes. The term embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) proposed in 2014 is defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources. The major advantage of this definition compared to cryptogenic definition is the proposition of a specific work-up. In a general population, frequent potential sources of embolism in patients with ESUS have been suggested since a long time and include: patent foramen ovale (PFO), covert atrial fibrillation (AF), complex aortic arch atheroma, large vessel atheroma with stenosis<50%, carotid web, atrial cardiomyopathy, thrombophilia associated with cancer. It took almost 30 years to show, in patients under 60 with a cryptogenic stroke and a PFO, that PFO occlusion was superior to medical treatment alone for recurrent stroke. PFO under 60 is therefore no longer a cryptogenic cause of infarction. The concept of cryptogenic stroke and its refinement in ESUS have been fruitful for the identification of PFO associated as a cause. Covert AF can be detected by different techniques but its risk significance for recurrent stroke might be different from the simple electrocardiographic detection of AF. With the development of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs), randomized studies in patients with ESUS, were run for stroke prevention but no difference was observed between patients treated by DOA compared to aspirin. These studies showed however the heterogeneity of ESUS patients. Further ESUS classification should be considered as a tool to identify homogeneous groups. We propose to further split the ESUS group into different subgroups: ESU-PFO>60-year-old, ESUS-ATH with stenosis<50%, ESUS-AF (covert AF & atrial cardiomyopathy), ESUS-cancer and others. Precision medicine is the ability to make targeted healthcare decisions based on the specific risks of individual patients. One preliminary stage is therefore to identify homogeneous groups suitable in the future for new therapeutic trials and, at the end, for new specific treatments.}

This study examines the association between objectively assessed daily step count and depressive symptoms over a 24-week follow- up period in outpatients receiving treatment for moderate-to-severe depression. Methods: Participants were US Veterans with MDD enrolled in the Precision Medicine in Mental Health Care study (PRIME Care), a pragmatic, multi-site, randomized, controlled trial that examines the utility of genetic testing in the context of pharmacotherapy for MDD. Participants were a subset (N = 66) enrolled in actigraphy (using GT9X ActiGraph) monitoring component of the trial. Daily steps were examined as a predictor of depressive symptoms over 4-, 8-, 12-, 18-, and 24-weeks. Results: On average, participants took 3,460 (±1,768) steps per day. In generalized linear mixed models, an increase in 1,000 steps per day was associated with a 0.6-point decrease in depressive symptom severity at the subsequent follow-up assessment. Limitations: Activity monitoring was observational and causal inferences cannot be made between daily steps and subsequent depressive symptom severity. Results may not generalize to non-treatment-seeking populations. Conclusions: Study findings provide an initial metric for persons with clinically significant MDD, of whom most do not get sufficient daily activity. The findings can inform future trials aimed at determining how much daily activity is needed to improve symptoms in individuals with MDD.}

Apart from the obvious use of crude plant preparations or plant extracts, plant-based natural product research has become a common tool in drug development. Plant material for research is often sourced either directly from the wild, or form a wide variety of venders and providers, most commonly over the Internet. The quality of the source material is often highly variable, and it has been our experience that much of the available material lacks all, or at least careful, documentation, identification and vouchering. Many well-respected researchers in phytomedicine are deficient in plant taxonomy and might be convinced that the correct scientific name and vouchering of plant material sourced does not really matter, if only a consistent vernacular name is provided. In this chapter we explore the necessity of correct scientific identification of material in herbal medicine, point to common errors in the process, and suggest ways to avoid potentially disastrous mistakes. Most taxonomic errors are simply caused by orthographic mistakes, by citing synonyms instead of the correct scientific name, wrong or missing author citations, mistakes in family classification, and simple extrapolation from a common vernacular name to a possible scientific identification. Most of these problems can easily be avoided by using open access online databases. The identification of vouchering material should however always be done, or at least confirmed, by specialists. Taxonomy remains a crucial tool for the validation and safety of herbal medicine.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Thirty-five herbal formulations used in this current work are utilized as anti-cariogenic agents in Thai traditional medicine. Acidogenic properties play a crucial role in the initiation of dental caries caused by Streptococcus mutans, and a quorum sensing (QS) system is an associated virulence factor in dental caries.
Aim of the study
The current work aimed to determine the anti-acidogenic effect of these polyherbal formulas against S. mutans and explore their anti-QS activity using Chromobacterium violaceum as a biosensor.
Materials and methods
Ethanol and water extracts from the formulas were evaluated for their anti-acidogenic effects using glycolytic pH drop assays. Qualification and quantification of anti-QS activity indicated by the level of violacein production in C. violaceum were performed using paper disc-diffusion and flask incubation assays, respectively.
Results
Among the extracts tested, THF-DC 02 and THF-DC 04 significantly inhibited the acidogenesis of S. mutans in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the cell viability. THF-DC 20 and THF-DC 29 sharply reduced the violacein production of C. violaceum, indicating the promising anti-QS activity of these extracts.
Conclusion
The findings of the present study, preliminarily propose that the polyherbal formulas THF-DC 02, THF-DC 04, THF-DC 20, and THF-DC 29 produce promising anti-acidogenic or anti-QS activities. The anti-acidogenic effect of THF-DC 04 may possibly act by interrupting streptococcal membrane enzymes via its herbal components: Alpinia galanga (L.) Willd., Albizia myriophylla Benth., Avicennia marina subsp. eucalyptifolia (Valeton) J.Everett and Ocimum tenuiflorum L. The anti-QS activity of THF-DC 20 and THF-DC 29 could be due to their herbal ingredients, including Piper betle L., Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb., Terminalia chebula Retz., and Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L.M.Perry.}

Yet, attaining those rights and goals implies acknowledging that not everyone has the same opportunities and outcomes in health. This has been well explored by the literature on social determinants of health, which points to differences in health status and outcomes as affected by socioeconomic factors, such as socioeconomic status, geographical location, and education. Sex and gender are the key factors, and current scientific literature has already reported specific ways in which they affect health status and experiences with the health system, in terms of negatively influencing access, diagnosis, and treatment. When various socioeconomic factors coincide, as it happens in women from ethnic minorities living in poverty, then outcomes are even worse. Likewise, gender myths, stereotypes, and false assumptions have a negative impact on girls’ and adult women's health. Algorithms employed and applied to precision medicine must take all this knowledge about various socioeconomic circumstances, inequalities in health, age, sex, and gender differences specific to some diseases, to overcome the so-called sex and gender blindness of medical research and practice, allowing precision medicine to be inclusive of all patient groups, including women.}

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use has been well-documented among cancer patients, with increasing public awareness of non-traditional treatments in the era of COVID-19. However, the temporal trends in usage at the patient level have not been well defined. We sought to characterize trends in what CAM interventions patients used before, during and after cancer treatment.
Materials/Methods
An NCI-designated cancer center and a comprehensive cancer center prospectively enrolled adult cancer patients onto a cross-sectional survey assessing CAM use between 2020 and 2021. The survey evaluated perceptions and use of CAM, including vitamins/minerals, herbal supplements and alternative medicines, diets, and mind/body therapies. Types of CAM utilized were self-reported by use before, during and after primary cancer treatment. Differences in utilization were analyzed with two-proportion z-tests.
Results
Among 749 patients enrolled, 578 (77%) reported using CAM. Among CAM users, the most popular interventions used at some point included multivitamins (60%), vitamin D (58%), prayer (48%), vitamin C (35%), massage (33%), meditation (28%), fish oil (24%), probiotics (21%), turmeric (20%), CBD products (19%), chiropractic manipulation (17%), marijuana (16%) and vegetarian diet (12%). Vitamin use nearly universally declined over the before → during → after period, for example multivitamin (52% → 39% → 31%, p<0.01), vitamin D (37% → 42% → 30%, p<0.01), and calcium (21% → 24% → 15%), p<0.01). No vitamin consumption increased after treatment compared to before. Multiple herbal supplements increased during treatment but stayed higher than pre-treatment levels, including CBD (5.4% → 13% → 8.2%, p<0.01), marijuana (6.0% → 12% → 7.9%, p<0.01) and turmeric (9.1% → 13% → 9.3%). Many specialized diets were adopted during treatment but were not continued afterward, including vegetarian (5.4% → 8.3% → 5.5%), vegan (2.2% → 5.2% → 2.2%), ketogenic (3.3% → 4.3% → 2.6%), alkaline (1.2% → 3.6% → 1.9%) and raw food (0.9% → 1.4% → 0.3%). Mind/body intervention use also nearly universally decreased over the before to after period, such as chiropractic manipulation (16% → 7.4% → 5.9%, p<0.01), yoga (12% → 12% → 9.2%) or pilates (34.2% → 2.2% → 1.6%). Some increased during treatment but decreased after, like acupuncture (8.0% → 12% → 5.9%, p<0.01) or meditation (18% → 23% → 15%, p<0.01), with the largest decrease being in prayer (43% → 44% → 32%, p<0.01).
Conclusion
Although CAM use is known to be common, the patterns of use before, during and after treatment have not been well-defined. Herbal supplements were the most likely to continue to be used after cancer treatment. General health maintenance, wellness and mind/body interventions largely decreased below pre-treatment levels after treatment, regardless of utilization during treatment.}

This study evaluates the assessment protocol that allows the correlation between the development of mesothelioma to a specific exposure, with particular focus on investigations with Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy.
Methods
This retrospective study includes 80 subjects who died from mesothelioma in the period 2001–2019. A judicial autopsy was performed for each case to confirm cause of death and correlate the disease with specific asbestos exposure. In 28 cases investigations were carried out to determine the pulmonary load of the asbestos fibres and corpuscles in the lung tissue through microscopic investigations, in order to confirm the suspicion of occupational exposure.
Results
Our data agree with the scientific literature reported, but it is interesting to underline how the present study uses a different systematic approach than others, which are mainly based on epidemiological and environmental studies without considering the lung content of fibres and corpuscles.
Conclusion
It would be desirable that the use of the microscopic analysis was introduced in the evaluation protocol: it should always be carried out if the suspicion of asbestos-related disease is raised and not only as a possible integration to the less expensive anamnestic evaluation, even more so if the work or personal history should be suggestive of exposure to asbestos fibres.}

RLS is defined by an urge to move the legs at rest that increases in the evening and at night, and is frequently associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Symptoms frequency, age at RLS onset, severity, familial history and consequences of RLS vary widely between patients. A genetic susceptibility, iron deficiency, dopamine deregulation, and possible hypo-adenosinergic state may play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS. Polysomnographic recordings found often periodic leg movements during sleep and wakefulness in patients with RLS. RLS can be classified as primary or comorbid with major diseases: iron deficiency, renal, neurological, rheumatological and lung diseases. First-line treatments are low-dose dopamine agonists, and alpha-2-delta ligands depending on the clinical context, and second/third line opiates for pharmacoresistant forms of RLS. Augmentation syndrome is a serious complication of dopamine agonists and should be prevented by using the recommended low dose. Despite an increase in knowledge, RLS is still underdiagnosed, poorly recognized, resulting in substantial individual health burden and socioeconomic coast, and education is urgently needed to increase awareness of this disabling disorder.}

abstract = {Objectives: Referral to palliative medicine (PM) has been shown to improve quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and improve survival. Few data exist about palliative medicine approaches in the minority gynecologic oncology (GYO) patients. Our objective was to assess differences in palliative medicine referrals and end-of-life interventions by race and ethnicity in a diverse population of GYO patients. If such differences exist, they may inform subsequent interventions for care optimization and elimination of structural barriers. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients receiving gynecologic oncology care at a tertiary referral center between 2017 and 2019 was conducted. Patients had either metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis or recurrence. Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively abstracted. Analysis was done with Chi-square (or Fisher’s exact) and t-tests. Tests were two-sided with significance set at a p-value of <.05. Results: A total of 186 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 58 years (±12.971). Underrepresented minorities accounted for 47.3% of the cohort. English was identified as the primary language for 69.9% of the patients with Spanish reported in 24.2%. Over 90% of patients had insurance coverage. Ovarian cancer (37.6%) and uterine cancer (32.8%) were the most common sites of origin. The majority of patients (75%) had an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. Referral to PM at any point during the study time frame occurred in 82 (44.2%) patients; 31% of patients were referred <90 days prior to death. Symptom management was the most common indication for referral (73.1%). Higher medication use for symptom control (pain, nausea, etc.) was more common among those referred. ED visits and hospitalizations were also higher among those referred to PM, with over 50% having ≥4 visits through their entire cancer care. Lastly, 30% of the patients expired during the study period without a PM referral. Black patients were noted to have a higher appetite stimulant use compared to White patients (19 [41%] vs 34 [24%], respectively [p=0.027]). Black patients were also noted to have a higher number of ED visits, with 26.1% having seven or more, compared with 10.7% for White (p=0.035). Lastly, chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life was also higher among Black patients compared to White (7 [15.2%] vs 6 [4.3%], respectively [p=0.049]). Conclusions: Despite the known benefits of palliative care, over 50% of patients in this gynecologic oncology cohort with advanced or recurrent malignancy were not referred. Race was associated with variation in interventions near end-of-life. Further research is needed to better identify priorities for interventions, especially as they relate to the care of patients from underrepresented minority groups.}

The mechanism of action of molnupiravir, a novel antiviral drug, was analyzed from the point of view of its tautomerism by means of quantum-mechanical calculations. It was established that although the uracil-like tautomer Mu (3 kcal/mol in the water environment) is the most thermodynamically stable, in fact, it is the cytosine-like tautomer Mc that plays the main role. There are several reasons, as follows: (1) A large part of Mu exists as a more stable but inactive form Mu-m that is unable to pair with adenine. (2) The phosphorylated form of Mc is only 1 kcal/mol less stable than Mu in the water environment and thus is readily available for building into the RNA strand, where the Mu/Mc energy gap increases and the probability of Mc → Mu interconversion leading to C → U mutation is high. (3) The guanine-Mc complex has similar stability to guanine-cytosine, but the adenine-Mu complex has lower stability than adenine-uracil. Additionally, the guanine-Mc complex has a suboptimal distorted geometry that further facilitates the mutations. (4) The activation barrier for proton transfer leading to Mu-m interconversion into a cytosine-like tautomer is higher than for Mu, which makes the uracil-like form even less available. These facts confirm an intriguing experimental observation that molnupiravir competes mainly with cytosine and not uracil.}

In this review, the orally active Toxin complex proteins, or Tcs, are described as unique syringe-like delivery systems, with a well described receptor, Visgun or Vsg. The Photorhabdus Virulence Cassettes or PVCs are unique phage-like delivery systems, that have recently been re-engineered to deliver their toxic cargoes into specific cell types for use in medicine. The Makes Caterpillars Floppy, or Mcf-like, toxins are large multi-domain toxins whose structure and function is now finally becoming clear, with Mcf-like domains being found in a range of agriculturally and medically important bacteria. Therefore, what began as a simple search for orally active toxins to use as alternatives to those from Bacillus thuringiensis, has now become a field relevant to both medicine and agriculture with applications ranging from targeted protein delivery into cancer cells, to biological control in the rhizosphere.}

1. Understand the limitations, benefits, and vulnerabilities of a Monday-Friday staffing model in a continuous care (24/7/365) patient care environment such as the hospital and possible alternatives 2. Consider alternative ways to address gaps in your current consultation service coverage model
Background
Literature is sparse regarding actual work schedules for full-time equivalent (FTE) clinicians (physicians and advanced practice providers [APPs]) who staff inpatient palliative medicine consultation services, yet most programs use either a pure Monday-Friday coverage model or Monday-Friday-plus (weekend or holiday add-ons, by using existing staff to work extra or adding part-time staff). This presents the dilemma of either significantly limiting service access (to a 24/7/365 patient care operation) or stretching staff to extra work hours, which causes burnout and compassion fatigue. Because these services are relatively new to health systems, a best practice has yet to be identified.
Aim Statement
A “7 On/7 Off” palliative medicine coverage model can provide coverage (in the right setting and with the right personnel) in a sustainable manner that can increase patient satisfaction and referrals, smooth workloads, and decrease burnout.
Methods
The inpatient palliative medicine consultation service at a 500-bed level 1 trauma university medical center was reorganized on a trial basis for 30 months from “standard model” Monday-Friday-plus coverage to a hybrid 7 On/7 Off model, with 2.0 FTE physicians performing 7/7 and remainder of the interdisciplinary team (APPs and a 0.2 FTE physician) continuing with the “standard model.”
Results
Satisfaction among inpatient palliative consultation team members was increased 87% (including both 7/7 and “standard model”), 75% with hospital administration, and 82% with referral sources based on survey data from 3 surveys taken. Improvements in patient and family access, referral source access, workload, paid time off scheduling, and burnout all contributed to improved satisfaction scores.
Conclusions and Implications
Using a 7 On/7 Off model for a 24/7/365 healthcare operation can be useful and sustainable alternative to the most common staffing operation practices for hospital-based palliative medicine consultation.}

An assortment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs), provide an ideal source for tissue engineering applications due to the absence of ethical concerns, their high availability, and the increasing number of methods for their isolation and expansion. ASCs and BMSCs possess the same multipotency, but substituting adipose tissue for bone marrow, as a source of stem cells for regenerative medicine, is greatly advantageous. ASCs are simple to procure via a method that is less invasive compared to BMSCs. In addition, the percentage of cells from adipose tissue with multipotency is high, mass culture is simple, and the cells function in a manner that is similar, and often better, than BMSCs. Thus human ASCs hold great potential in the field of regenerative medicine. In this chapter, we examine the utilization of ASCs for cartilage tissue engineering, to combat fibrosis/scarring, to improve fat grafting techniques, and further explore utilizing the ASC secretome as a cell-free modality for tissue engineering. Altogether, the regenerative potential of ASCs for tissue engineering is clear, and ultimately, further studies on these topics will provide innovative mechanisms for alleviating some of the limitations that are currently faced in the tissue engineering arena.}

The continual development of potent immunosuppressive regimens has led to a decreased incidence of acute rejection and improvement of short-term kidney allograft survival. In contrast to acute rejection, glomerular diseases of the kidney allograft are being encountered more frequently and are emerging as leading causes of late kidney allograft failure. Although data on the pathogeneses of glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft are sparse, cumulative evidence suggests that post-transplant glomerular diseases may be the result of inherited predispositions and immunologic triggers. Although studying immunologic signals and performing genome-wide association studies are ideal approaches to tackle glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft, such studies are challenging because of the lack of adequately powered cohorts. In this review, we focus on the most commonly encountered recurrent and de novo glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft. We address the important advances made in understanding the immunopathology and genetic susceptibility of glomerular diseases in the native kidney and how to benefit from such knowledge to further our knowledge of post-transplant glomerular diseases. Defining genomic and immune predictors for glomerular diseases in the kidney allograft would support novel donor-recipient matching strategies and development of targeted therapies to ultimately improve long-term kidney allograft survival.}

Covering: 77 A.D. up to 2020 Norditerpenoid alkaloids (NDA), typically N-ethylpiperidine containing C19 or C18 natural product diterpenes, are hexacycles with several contiguous often oxygenated stereocentres. As a function of their structural complexity, they display important pharmacological activities. The processed plants are used as important folk drugs and four NDAs have now been clinically approved. Many metabolism studies on Aconitum alkaloids have been reported as the understanding of their biotransformation in living systems and in cell-free systems is important for the development of these alkaloids as drugs. This Highlight sets out the missing links in NDA biosynthesis, their biological applications, SAR, toxicity, metabolism, and analytical studies.}

Outline key resources and best practices in high-fidelity SBME planning and implementation, including case development, prebrief and debrief activities, standardized patient preparation, and faculty development. Development of expertise requires deliberate practice, which necessitates observation, high-level formative feedback, and repetition. Hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) fellowships aim, in one short year, to increase fellow expertise in caring for seriously ill patients. HPM fellows hail from various specialty backgrounds, contributing to diverse learning needs; early identification of individual needs is imperative to optimize learning. Simulation-based medical education (SBME) can be used as both a teaching and formative assessment method in navigating complex, urgent clinical situations. Our HPM fellowship clinical case simulation curriculum aims to inform fellows’ learning needs and individualized learning plans; provide ongoing formative feedback at fellows’ zones of proximal development in common, high-stakes HPM scenarios (acute cancer pain crisis and imminent end-of-life care); and allow for deliberate practice with escalation of case complexity throughout fellowship. To incorporate best practices for SBME curricular development, we created a prebrief process, checklist of desired learner actions, and a debrief framework. Summaries of interprofessional educator formative feedback and fellow self-assessments are cultivated to develop short-term learning goals for fellows’ individualized learning plans (ILPs). Cases are repeated mid-year with adjustment in challenge to build on foundational skills, again culminating in updated ILPs. We developed late-year, sequential simulations of the same cases at future points (refractory cancer pain and withdrawal of respiratory support) to extend learning. Fellows report that simulations promote perceptions of a safe learning environment and that ILPs are particularly helpful to crystallize learning goals and steps early in the fellowship. Checklists of observable skills, formative feedback summaries, and fellow self-assessments reveal consistent improvement in fellows’ development, which supports competency in related milestones. This curriculum also provides an opportunity to develop interprofessional HPM educator teaching skills. Expansion of SMBE in HPM education can be used to identify and meet the spectrum of fellows’ individual learning needs.}

abstract = {Background
Medication use is the main therapeutic intervention in people with intellectual disabilities (PWID). The limited evidence available in the literature suggests that pharmacists can make positive interventions in relation to the quality of the medication use process, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals, carers and PWID. The public health role of the pharmacist is yet to be clearly defined, broadly recognized and sufficiently promoted by public health agencies, pharmacy educators or other health care professionals.
Objective
Baseline audit of medication and public health communications provided by a pharmacist in a residential centre for PWID in Ireland.
Methods
Collation of pharmacy electronic and paper based information communication records. Survey of carers – electronic and paper based.
Findings
Pharmacist’s communication about health/ medicines is perceived important by carers. Proactive information is communicated without a query in advance for the benefit of staff and residents. “I value pharmacist’s interest in making information available to all those who are interested”.
Discussion
The pharmacist communicates information using finite resources (one pharmacy staff member) to support maximisation of outcomes and minimisation of medication risks and health risks. Impact of pharmacist’s interventions in this setting cannot be accurately measured. With the right communication, health systems can reduce the likelihood of certain conditions or improve the quality of life for PWID who already have these conditions. Specialist pharmacists can engage PWID and their carers with targeted communication. All types of health care provider should consider how to include pharmacy staffing into the overall skill mix for their service. Pharmacists have a role in optimising medication use, promoting health for PWID, preventing and delaying disease, and ensuring continuity of care. The pharmacist's role has expanded beyond the traditional product-oriented functions of dispensing. Pharmacists must learn how to communicate with PWID and their carers.}

abstract = {Targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to malignant tumor sites is an effective strategy to improve the treatment outcomes for tumor precise therapy. Herein, based on the abnormal tumor metabolism (glutamine addiction), a nanosystem of glutamine-decorated nanoparticles was fabricated to achieve efficient tumor delivery. Considering the high toxicity and side effect by chemotherapy with high doses, a chemotherapeutic sensitizer tetrandrine was used in combination with doxorubicin to achieve a synergistic effect in tumor treatment. The targeted nanosystems of glutamine-decorated nanoparticles (GDTNPs) were loaded with doxorubicin and tetrandrine simultaneously. Effective tumor accumulation of GDTNPs in vitro and in vivo was achieved due to glutamine addiction and the extraordinary inter-organ glutamine metabolism. The data revealed that tetrandrine enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin to hepatic carcinoma cells by blocking cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and arresting cell cycle, demonstrating the synergism of doxorubicin and tetrandrine. With KM mice bearing murine hepatic tumor (H22) as model, GDTNPs demonstrated the optimum tumor inhibition efficacy with no notable systemic toxicity. Therefore, it could be propose that the co-delivery of doxorubicin and tetrandrine by the glutamine-decorated nanoparticles is a promising strategy for the effective chemotherapy of hepatic carcinoma with enhanced efficacy and reduced cytotoxicity.}
