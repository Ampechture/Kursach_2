abstract = {Introduction
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a commensal in the nasopharynx, can cause invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs). To prevent the aggravation of IPDs, it is important to enhance host immune defense against S. pneumoniae. Hochuekkito (HET) is expected to have an immunostimulatory effect against infections.
Methods
HET was administrated by gavage to adult BALB/cA mice before and after intranasal inoculation of S. pneumoniae. We evaluated the effect of HET on pneumococcal nasal colonization and subsequent development of lethal pneumococcal infections.
Results
No effect on nasal colonization was observed, but HET significantly reduced bacterial count in the blood, decreased the incidence of bacteremia, and improved survival. HET also reduced nasal tissue damage 3 days after intranasal infection. Neutrophils from HET-treated mice showed significantly higher bactericidal activity against S. pneumoniae in the presence of the serum from the HET group compared with from the control group.
Conclusions
The non-specific immunostimulatory effect of HET is suggested by this study to be effective in preventing the progression in IPDs and provided insights into novel strategy in the post-pneumococcal vaccine era.}

Literature on the perceptions and experiences of postgraduate trainees and trainers regarding online methods of learning is scarce. We aimed to assess the perceptions and experiences of family medicine trainees and trainers regarding online learning during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Qassim, KSA.
Methods
This was a mixed-method study involving trainees and trainers at the Family Medicine Academy, Qassim. Quantitative data were collected using structured questionnaires from 36 trainees and 26 trainers. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with trainees (n = 4) and trainers (n = 3). Descriptive analysis was performed on the quantitative data, while thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data.
Results
Among the trainees, 39% perceived online learning to be less effective than traditional classroom learning. Moreover, 61% and 64% of the respondents were concerned about the motivation and quality of online learning, respectively. Lack of direct contact with other students was the most commonly perceived concern among 80% of trainees. Among the trainers, the majority were either dissatisfied or neutral about participation and interaction, speakers’ and students’ motivation, the quality of online learning, and the online teaching experience. Qualitative data showed that online methods provide the advantages of learning from other institutions and flexibility, as well as a viable alternative during crises. However, there were issues with interaction, participation, and trainers’ online teaching skills.
Conclusion
Online learning has provided an opportunity to continue training during the COVID-19 crisis. However, there are widespread concerns regarding its effectiveness among trainees and trainers. There is a need to train trainers in online teaching and adopt interactive methods to increase trainees’ interaction, motivation, and participation.}

The increasingly mature toolbox with glycomic and glycoproteomic strategies is applied for the development of biopharmaceuticals and the discovery and clinical evaluation of glycobiomarkers in various disease fields. Notwithstanding the contributions of glycoscience in identifying new drug targets, the current report is focused on the biomarker modality that is of interest for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. To this end, it is noted that the identification of biomarkers has received more attention than the corresponding quantification. Most analytical methods are very efficient in detecting large numbers of analytes, but developments to accurately quantify these have so far been limited. In this perspective, a parallel is made with earlier proposed tiers for protein quantification using mass spectrometry. Moreover, the foreseen reporting of multimarker readouts is discussed to describe an individual’s health or disease state and their role in clinical decision-making. The potential of longitudinal sampling and monitoring of glycomic features for diagnosis and treatment monitoring is emphasized. Finally, different strategies that address the quantification of a multimarker panel are discussed.}

abstract = {Background
Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used as adjuvant treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) for years. Astragalus membranaceus (A. membranaceus, Huangqi [A]), Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Danggui [S]), Rheum palmatum L. (Dahuang [R]), and Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen [D]) are considered as potentially renoprotective CHMs. However, there is limited evidence on whether ASRD use affects outcomes and causes hyperkalemia in patients with stage 4 and stage 5 advanced CKD.
Purpose
To investigate between ASRD use (vs. nonuse) and risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), death, and hyperkalemia in patients with advanced CKD.
Study Design
Retrospective nationwide cohort study using claims data from the Taiwan's 2005 Longitudinal Generation Tracking Database in 2000–2016.
Methods
A total of 24,572 patients with advanced CKD were identified and 15,729 eligible patients were enrolled in the propensity score matching, with 1,401 incident ASRD users (8.9%) and 14,328 nonusers (91.1%). Finally, 1,076 ASRD users and 4,304 matched nonusers were subjected to analysis. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratios for ESRD and death and Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratio of hyperkalemia. The additive effect of one to four ASRD and the pooling effect of individual ASRD on risks of ESRD and death were also addressed.
Results
In a total follow-up of 15,740 person-years, 2,703 patients (50.2%) developed ESRD and 499 (9.3%) died before progression to ESRD. As compared with nonusers, ASRD users were associated with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.91) for ESRD and 0.78 (0.30–0.93) for death, as well as adjusted incidence rate ratios of 0.54 (0.48–0.60) for inpatient hyperkalemia and 0.44 (0.42–0.46) for total hyperkalemia. The renal and survival benefits of ASRD use were consistent across almost patient subgroups on multivariate stratified analyses. Using all four ASRD provided the lowest risks of ESRD (0.30; 0.71–0.52) and death (0.32; 0.17–0.63). Individual use of ASRD also demonstrated comparable renal and survival benefits.
Conclusion
ASRD use was associated with lower risks of ESRD and death among advanced CKD patients. This benefit did not increase hyperkalemia risk.}

Unfortunately, uncontrolled cell division and growth is a hallmark of cancer, leading to the formation of tumors. The Human Eg5 protein, also known as the mitotic kinesin Eg5, plays a vital role in the regulation of cell division and its dysfunction has been linked to cancer development. This study aimed to identify new inhibitors of the Human Eg5 protein. Over 2000 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds were screened through a combination of virtual and structure-based screening methods. The top five compounds (Compounds 1–5) showed improved binding affinity to Human Eg5 compared to the standard drug Monastrol, as demonstrated by docking and MMGBSA scores, as well as interactions with key amino acids GLY 116 and GLY 118. The potential absorption and bioactivity of these compounds were also predicted through ADMET properties and a QSAR model, respectively, and showed improved results compared to the standard. Further quantum mechanics docking confirmed the better binding affinity of the lead compound, Compound 1. Our findings highlight Compound 1–5 as promising hits for inhibiting Human Eg5 and the need for experimental validation of their potential in treating cancer.}

Occupational doses, in terms of Hp (10) (deep dose), Hp (0.07) (skin dose) and ambient dose were monstered using calibrated thermos-luminescent dosimeters (TLDs) to ensure occupational doses exposures for the ultrasonographers over 1 year at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The overall mean of Hp(10), Hp(0.07) for an annual occupational dose of 0.4 mSv and ambient dose (mSv) were (M) in ultrasound room, Hp(10) of 1.7 mSv and Hp(0.07) of 1.72 mSv in the Hot Lab, and Hp(10) of 0.4 mSv and Hp(0.07) of 0.02 mSv in the Stress Room. Occupational exposure was below the annual dose limits (20.0 mSv) for all practitioners, as well the extremities dose was below the annual dose limits of 500 mSv. In conclusion, since staff exposure which highly depends on radioisotope characteristics and protection measures can vary significantly for different personnel, continuous serial careful assessment of working conditions is recommended to ensure occupational doses exposures remain below annual limits.}

All 3 systems have been used, in isolation, to recommend specific treatment modalities.

Ferroptosis, a distinct form of cell death characterized by lipid peroxide accumulation, has gained prominence since its recognition in 2012. Recent studies have unveiled an intriguing connection between p53 and ferroptosis, with implications for cancer therapy. Recent research underscores p53 as a novel target for cancer therapy, influencing key metabolic processes in ferroptosis. Notably, p53 represses the expression of the cystine-glutamate antiporter SLC7A11, supporting p53-mediated tumor growth suppression. Furthermore, under metabolic stress, p53 mitigates ferroptosis sensitivity, aiding cancer cells in coping and delaying cell death. This dynamic interplay between p53 and ferroptosis has far-reaching implications for various diseases, particularly cancer. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ferroptosis in cancer cells, elucidating p53's role in regulating ferroptosis, and explores the potential of targeting p53 to induce ferroptosis for cancer therapy. Understanding this complex relationship between p53 and ferroptosis offers a promising avenue for developing innovative cancer treatments.}

abstract = {For several decades, radiation detection has been implemented using mainly silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). However, group II-VI compound semiconductors such as cadmium telluride (CdTe), cadmium sulfide (CdS), cadmium selenide (CdSe), zinc selenide (ZnSe), zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc sulfide (ZnS), and zinc telluride (ZnTe) have been recently investigated extensively as alternative radiation detectors. Different studies have explored these semiconductors for radiation detection in diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, and non-medical fields such as astronomy. This article aims at demonstrating that II-VI semiconductors are potential and alternative medical radiation detectors, based on the current studies. II-VI semiconductor dosimetry mechanisms and compliance to desirable dosimetry characteristics (e.g., linearity of detector signals to the radiation doses, precision, radiation hardness, and sensitivity not depending on beam energy, dose, dose rate, and irradiation angle) are presented and discussed. Additionally, the performances of II-VI-based detectors applied for dosimetry in mainly diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, and nuclear medicine are evaluated. Eventually, the dose, dose rate, and energy ranges applicable to the II-VI-based detectors herein are recapitulated. II-VI semiconductors are promising radiation detectors because they comply to the preferred dosimetric metrics as per the current literature. Nevertheless, there is still need for more research to further (a) characterize II-VI semiconductors for medical radiation dosimetry, and (b) compare II-VI semiconductor detectors to conventional detectors. Additionally, more II-VI semiconductor detectors should be commercialized to increase the availability of these detectors on the medical dosimetry market.}

abstract = {Treating lesions and tissue disorders in the body through tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has been extensively studied since the last few decades. There have been several advances both involving technologies and therapies to address the challenges in the clinics. Scaffolds are one of the components in tissue engineering that can provide temporary support to cells and modulate tissue regeneration. Thus the engineering of scaffolds has been a hot topic of research. The performance of the scaffold in the body depends on many factors including the parameters related to the scaffold and the parameters related to other components of the regenerative strategy, that is cells and stimulating factors. While there is also a lot of research has been recently published on conventionally produced scaffolds, the three-dimensional–(bio)printed scaffolds constitute a large space as the state-of-the-art. In this chapter, the relevant works on the engineering and production of scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are overviewed. We believe that the current challenges and limitations of the current scaffolds will be addressed in the near future, and it would be possible to treat the patients with a success that was not possible before.}

abstract = {A carbon–carbon linkage is created when a methyl group is implanted on dUMP, thus resulting in the formation of dTMP by thymidylate synthase. The methyl group is deleted by aromatase when androgens are converted to estrogens. The methyl group is rearranged with the help of vitamin B12 in the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) serves as the universal methyl donor involved in the biosynthesis of adrenaline and creatine(phosphate). It also interferes with the 5′-mRNA capping and the degradation of catecholamines (i.e. adrenaline, noradrenaline). Cholesterol could be viewed as a conglomeration of methyl groups. Finally, as part of valine, two methyl functions participate in the origin of one of the most frequent hereditary diseases on earth, sickle cell anemia.}

FDG PET/CT provides unique information to stratify risk before therapy and is very effective for defining treatment response, during but also after therapy. The prognostic strength of PET response led this imaging procedure to contribute to a new definition of complete responder patients beside those with minimal residual disease who are at higher risk of disease relapse.}

abstract = {Neurological disorders have always been difficult clinical management problems. With the ever-increasing longevity of mankind, neurological disorders are increasing rapidly. In spite of the advances and successes of medical sciences, neurological disorders have not gained effective solutions yet. On the other hand, neurological disorders have been clinical problems ever since human history starts. How ancient people deal with neurological disorders might offer practical wisdom in the effort of tackling such problems. Searching through ancient traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) classics, many medicinal herbs have been used in combinations for the clinical presentations of headache, epilepsy, forgetfulness, and insanities. Some of these herbs have been studied in the laboratory to reveal their biological and pharmacological activities. This review starts with a general exploration on the medicinal herbs reported in TCM classics as being effective in dealing with neurological problems, so that readers could get a sense of the richness of past experience. Five of the frequently used TCM herbs are selected as examples of their neurological indications. They are Gastrodia elongate, Ligustricum chuanxiong, Salviae miltiorrhizae, Astragalus membranaceus, and Curcuma longa. Three specific clinical conditions, viz. traumatic brain injury, stroke rehabilitation, and dementia, are chosen to illustrate how TCM herbs are studied in the laboratory and clinically in our institute. Both laboratory and clinical studies are involved for stroke and dementia, while brain injury studies are confirmed to laboratory explorations. Throughout these years, pharmacognosists, pharmacologists, and biochemists are anticipating more and more scientific evidences on the efficacies of medicinal herbs, to be gained through modern pharmacological research approaches in areas known to have difficulties in treatment, such as neurological problems. Increasing interests and commitments are expected.}

Faced with the infrared spectroscopic dataset with 568 samples and 3448 wavelengths (features) to identify the origins of Chinese medicinal materials, this paper proposed a novel embedded multiclassification algorithm, ITabNet, derived from the framework of TabNet. Firstly, a refined data pre-processing (DP) mechanism was designed to efficiently find the best adaptive one among 50 DP methods with the help of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Following this, an innovative focal loss function was designed and joined with a cross-validation experiment strategy to mitigate the impact of sample imbalance on algorithm. Detailed investigations on ITabNet were conducted, including comparisons of ITabNet with SVM for the conditions of DP and Non-DP, GPU and CPU computer settings, as well as ITabNet against XGBT (Extreme Gradient Boosting). The numerical results demonstrate that ITabNet can significantly improve the effectiveness of prediction. The best accuracy score is 1.0000, and the best Area Under the Curve (AUC) score is 1.0000. Suggestions on how to use models effectively were given. Furthermore, ITabNet shows the potential to apply the analysis of medicinal efficacy and chemical composition of medicinal materials. The paper also provides ideas for multi-classification modeling data with small sample size and high-dimensional feature.}

abstract = {Objective
To estimate the probability of clinical or multiple pregnancy during ovulation induction (OI)/ovarian stimulation (OS).
Design
Secondary analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials (combined).
Setting
Multicenter.
Patients
A total of 750 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and 900 women with unexplained infertility.
Interventions
Ovulation induction/OS with either timed intercourse (polycystic ovary syndrome) or intrauterine insemination.
Main Outcome Measures
Clinical and multiple pregnancy rates/cycle, cumulative pregnancy rates. Age, body mass index, parity, diagnosis, medication, markers of ovarian reserve, and ovarian response were considered in multivariable regression models for clinical, multiple, and cumulative pregnancy rates. Receiver operating characteristic curves were created for clinical and multiple pregnancy rates.
Results
Younger patient and partner age, treatment type, lower body mass index, and medication dose were all associated with clinical pregnancy. Variables associated with multiple pregnancy included the abovementioned variables (except age), in addition to diagnosis, parity, higher antral follicle count, antimüllerian hormone levels, and ovarian response. Gonadotropin use was associated with multiple pregnancy, with progressively increasing odds ratios (cycles 1–4). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated the model’s predictive power to be fair for clinical pregnancy (areas under the curve [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 0.78 [0.75–0.81] for cycle 1 and 0.70 [0.64–0.75] for cycle 4) and good-to-excellent for multiple pregnancy (areas under the curve [95% CI]: 0.78 [0.72–0.84] for cycle 1 and 0.86 [0.78–0.93] for cycle 4). Partner age, lower medication dose, parity, antimüllerian hormone levels, and diagnosis were associated with cumulative pregnancy rates.
Conclusions
Using the majority of the factors known to predict the outcome of OI/OS cycles, we constructed an easy-to-use formula that may predict individualized chances of clinical and multiple pregnancy for commonly used fertility treatments (https://pregnancyprediction.medicine.yale.edu/CalDirect.html).

Intervenciones
Inducción de la ovulación/EO con relaciones programadas (síndrome de ovario poliquístico) o con inseminación intrauterina.
Resultado principal medible
Tasa de embarazo clínico y múltiple por ciclo, tasa acumulada de embarazo. Edad, índice de masa corporal, paridad, diagnóstico, medicación, marcadores de reserva ovárica y respuesta ovárica fueron considerados en modelos de regresión multivariable para tasas de embarazo clínico, múltiple y acumulada. Se crearon curvas de características operadas por el receptor para tasas de embarazo clínico y múltiple.
Resultados
Paciente jóven y edad de su pareja, tipo de tratamiento, menor índice masa corporal, y dosis de la medicación se asociaron con embarazo clínico. Las variables asociadas con embarazo múltiple incluyeron las variables anteriormente mencionadas (excepto la edad), además del diagnóstico, paridad, conteo mayor de folículos antrales, niveles de la hormona antimulleriana, y la respuesta ovárica. El uso de gonadotropinas se asoció con embarazo múltiple, con una razón de probabilidad incrementada progresivamente (ciclos 1-4). Las curvas de características operadas por el receptor indicaron que el poder predictivo del modelo era favorable para embarazo clínico (áreas bajo la curva [95% de intervalo de confianza {CI}]: 0.78 [0.75-0.81] para el ciclo 1 y 0.70 [0.64-0.75] para el ciclo 4) y de bueno-a-excelente para embarazo múltiple (áreas bajo la curva [95% CI]: 0.78 [0.72-0.84] para el ciclo 1 y 0.86 [0.78-0.93] para el ciclo 4. La edad de la pareja, menor dosis de medicación, paridad, niveles de hormona antimulleriana, y el diagnóstico se asociaron con las tasas acumuladas de embarazo.
Conclusiones
Usando la mayoría de los factores conocidos para predecir el resultado de los ciclos de IO/EO, elaboramos una fórmula fácil de usar que puede predecir las oportunidades individuales para embarazo clínico y múltiple en los tratamientos de fertilidad comunmente utilizados.

A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA) was applied to the time series until the end of 2019 at country level and used for the prediction of the ADHD medication consumption in 2020 and 2021. The deviations from the actual to the forecasted sales, which simulate the development without the emergence of COVID-19, yield estimates for the pandemic's impact. In 36 of the 47 countries and regions, the actual sales in 2020 were lower than predicted, with an average relative drop of 6.2% in defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day at country-level. In 2021, most countries recorded actually higher ADHD medication use than predicted at the end of 2019. On average, the consumption increased per country by 1.60%. The deviations strongly correlate with the stringency of anti-pandemic government policies. The findings suggest that the pandemic led to a substantially lower consumption of ADHD medication in 2020. However, in 2021 the pandemic had an accelerating effect as the increasing consumption trends are more pronounced than before the pandemic.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
In French Polynesia, many pathologies common or endemic to the territory cause diarrhea. This is the case for rotavirus gastroenteritis, salmonella food poisoning, ingestion of water contaminated by bacteria, and ciguatera. To treat these ailments, the population may employ traditional medicine for cultural reasons, geographical isolation, and poor health coverage. Polynesian remedies are often used without medical consultation and there is no data on their benefit-risk balance. A few ethnobotanical studies have been carried out in order to identify the traditional remedies used for various ailments, but few studies have focused on gastrointestinal pathologies. In this context, an ethnobotanical survey was carried out to identify treatments used for diarrhea and ciguatera, inventory the plants used, better understand the local representation of these remedies, and provide efficacy and safety data on these uses.
Materials and methods
From February to April 2021, a semi-structured survey was conducted on six islands in French Polynesia, including one island in the Windward Islands archipelago (Tahiti), three islands in the Marquesas archipelago (Hiva Oa, Nuku Hiva, Tahuata), and two islands in the Leeward Islands archipelago (Raiatea, Tahaa). A total of 133 people was interviewed including 34 specialists (of which 29 experts in herbalism).
Results
These people mentioned the use of 27 plants for the treatment of diarrhea, and 24 for the treatment of ciguatera. Citrus aurantiifolia, Psidium guajava and Cordyline fruticosa were the three most cited plant species used for treating diarrhea, while Cocos nucifera, Punica granatum and Barringtonia asiatica were the most cited for ciguatera. A large majority of plants are widespread and introduced plants, which is congruent with the history of Polynesian people. While some plants are well known for similar uses (e.g. Psidium guajava for diarrhea, Heliotropium arboreum for ciguatera), others are less well known and may present toxicity risks (e.g. Barringtonia asiatica for ciguatera).
Conclusion
Traditional Polynesian medicine is an integral part of the local culture so important to be preserved and valued. However, more pharmacological and toxicological studies are still needed to determine the benefit-risk balance of some of these remedies and to allow their official integration into the Polynesian health system.}

abstract = {Background
A. europaeum is a well mentioned Unani herb, belonging to Aristolochiaceae family and indigenous to the Eastern and Southern Europe. A. europaeum has traditionally been utilised in Unani medicine to treat respiratory ailments, gastrointestinal disorders, neurological diseases, hepatic chaos, genitourinary disorders, snake poisoning, vector-borne infections, and epidemic prophylaxis. This review aims to compile the previous and present available information concerning about the ethno-botanical aspects, phyto-chemical constituents, isolated metabolites, and pharmacological profiling of this herb correlating the principles of Unani doctrine, thereby may offer series of valuable data for researchers and pharmaceuticals to develop novel therapeutic ways. ‏
Material and methods
A detailed literature review has been conducted on A. europaeum in various electronic databases, including Pub Med, Web of Science, Wiley, Science Direct, Elsevier, Google Scholar, ACS publications, Springer Link etc. Furthermore, books (Unani ancient classical books) were consulted in Urdu, Arabic, Persian and English to collate the particulars.
Results
The present literature survey incorrigibly illustrated the usage of A. europaeum as a prophylactic drug in several diseases such as chicken pox, plague, and viral fevers, including COVID-19 and therapeutically, aid in managing bronchitis, epilepsy, hepatitis, ascites, amenorrhoea, paralysis, sciatica, lumbago, and urolithiasis. It has been well documented its usage in the form of powder, decoction, syrup, extract, and oil as a single drug or in compound formulations with the amalgamation of other herbs. Phyto-chemical analysis from various sections of the plant revealed the presence of varied chemical constituents for example essential oils (with four chemotypes), flavonoids, phenolic compounds, organic acids, vitamins, terpenes and sesquiterpenes. It has also been evaluated through in vitro, in vivo, in silico, preclinical and clinical trial models for the diverse pharmacological activities named as antibacterial, anti-diabetic and anti-proliferative activities etc. Still, only sporadic herb studies have been published so far.
Conclusion
The current paper highlights botany, ethno pharmacology, phyto-chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology in depth. Preliminary pharmacological studies on different extracts and fractions of A. europaeum support the claim of Unani scholars that it is useful in the treatment of various diseases. However, immediate efforts must be made to determine its mechanism of action, efficacy, dosage, and safety in combating various pathological states. The study will undoubtedly serve as the basis for future research to further demonstrate the ethno medicinal and therapeutic potential for health-care product improvement.}

abstract = {Context
Physicians who specialize in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) care for patients facing a serious, life-limiting illness. Palliative care is underutilized in patients with PAH, and little is known about how best to provide palliative care to this patient population.
Objectives
Using a qualitative approach, assess physicians’ perspectives on barriers and facilitators to the use of palliative care in PAH.
Methods
Participants were board-certified pulmonologists and cardiologists recruited from the Pulmonary Hypertension Association's list of physician specialists and academic center websites. We performed one-on-one semi-structured interviews that were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
Results
Twelve physicians participated in the study, with a median age of 48.5 years and 20.5 years of clinical experience caring for patients with PAH. We identified the following themes and associated barriers and facilitators to effective implementation of palliative care for patients with PAH: a tailored approach to the individual patient; a PAH-specialist-led culture of care; effective collaboration with palliative care clinicians; and limitations imposed by health systems.
Conclusion
PAH physicians are open to palliative care for their patients and are willing to partner with palliative care clinicians to implement this effectively and in the right setting. Areas for targeted improvement in enhancing palliative care for patients with PAH exist, especially enhancing collaboration between PAH physicians and palliative care specialists and navigating barriers in health systems.}

abstract = {Objectives
Amidst conflicting expectations about the benefits of personalized medicine (PM) and the potentially high implementation costs, we reviewed the available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PM relative to non-PM.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review of economic evaluations of PM and extracted data, including incremental quality-adjusted life-years (ΔQALYs) and incremental costs (Δcosts). ΔQALYs and Δcosts were combined with estimates of national cost-effectiveness thresholds to calculate incremental net monetary benefit (ΔNMB). Regression analyses were performed with these variables as dependent variables and PM intervention characteristics as independent variables. Random intercepts were used to cluster studies according to country.
Results
Of 4774 studies reviewed, 128 were selected, providing cost-effectiveness data for 279 PM interventions. Most studies were set in the United States (48%) and the United Kingdom (16%) and adopted a healthcare perspective (82%). Cancer treatments (60%) and pharmaceutical interventions (72%) occurred frequently. Prognostic tests (19%) and tests to identify (non)responders (37%) were least and most common, respectively. Industry sponsorship occurred in 32%. Median ΔQALYs, Δcosts, and ΔNMB per individual were 0.03, Int$575, and Int$18, respectively. We found large heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness. Regression analysis showed that gene therapies were associated with higher ΔQALYs than other interventions. PM interventions for neoplasms brought higher ΔNMB than PM interventions for other conditions. Nonetheless, average ΔNMB in the ‘neoplasm' group was found to be negative.
Conclusions
PM brings improvements in health but often at a high cost, resulting in 0 to negative ΔNMB on average. Pricing policies may be needed to reduce the costs of interventions with negative ΔNMB.}

Advances in the reproducibility and accessibility of surgical techniques are increasing the number of corneal transplants, thereby causing a global deficit of donor corneas and leaving 12.7 million patients with addressable visual impairment. Approaches to regenerate the corneal endothelium offer a solution to the current tissue scarcity and a treatment to those in need. Methods for generating corneal endothelial cells into numbers that could address the current tissue shortage and the possible strategies used to deliver them have now become a therapeutic reality with clinical trials taking place in Japan, Singapore and Mexico. Nevertheless, there is still a long way before such therapies are approved by regulatory bodies and become clinical practice. Moreover, acellular corneal endothelial graft equivalents and certain drugs could provide a treatment option for specific disease conditions without the need of donor tissue or cells. Finally, with the emergence of gene modulation therapies to treat corneal endothelial disease, it would be possible to treat presymptomatic patients or those presenting early symptoms, drastically reducing the need for donor tissue. It is necessary to understand the most recent developments in this rapidly evolving field to know which conditions could be treated with which approach. This article provides an overview of the current and developing regenerative medicine therapies to treat corneal endothelial disease and provides the necessary guidance and understanding towards the treatment of corneal endothelial disease.}

Drug normalization is now available as a stand-alone service (https://normalize.cancervariants.org/therapy/). Leveraging our platform's ability to find relationships between disease-critical genes and available therapeutics, DGIdb has been used in clinical interpretation pipelines to find drugs for specific diseases with an emphasis on regulatory approval status. DGIdb now uses annotations from Drugs@FDA to provide more accurate approval descriptors as well as references to active ANDA and NDA applications, when available. Lastly, to enhance the annotation potential for DGIdb in precision medicine pipelines, we have updated our druggable gene category sources with an additional curated list of 2,217 genes. Used alone or in combination with existing categories such as the heavily-utilized 'clinically actionable' category, this additional source will give precision medicine and interpretation pipelines the power to find concise, actionable annotations for specific diseases including pediatric cancers and epilepsy.

The radiation workers in nuclear medicine are involved with unsealed radioactive source. The measurement of eye lens dose using dosimeter could lead to significant error and uncertainties. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the eye lens dose of the radiation workers in nuclear medicine using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.
Methods
In this work, MC simulations were performed using MCNP5. The measured Hp(3) using NanoDotTM in cylindrical phantom with 60Co and 137Cs standard sources were conducted to validate MCNP code. Additionally, the simulated air kerma rate constants have been validated using commonly used radionuclides including 18F, 99mTc and 131I. Then, the validated MCNP code was used to estimate the eye lens at distance of 10 to 50 cm from eye level of PIMAL phantom.
Results
The percentage error of experimental and simulation results were less than the acceptance limit of 10% for code validation. Then, the clinical source geometries were simulated e.g., 3 mL solution in the 5-mL syringe for 18F, 1 mL solution in the 3-mL syringe for 99mTc and the capsule in the 10-mL vial for 131I. The eye lens doses were increased when the energy of emitted photon increased. Subsequently, 18F provided highest eye lens dose followed by 131I and 99mTc. At 10 cm, the eye lens dose rates were 20.55,7.90 and 2.33 μSv/MBq/hr for 18F, 131I and 99mTc respectively. The eye lens dose rates were decreased when the distance increased as expected. At 50 cm, the eye lens dose rates were dramatically dropped to 1.16, 0.46 and 0.14 μSv/MBq/hr for 18F, 131I and 99mTc respectively.
Conclusion
The eye lens dose rates from commonly source geometries and distances were simulated in this work. The values could be used as a caution limit to ensure that no individual is committed to unacceptable risk due to radiation exposure.}

The discovery of artemisinin not only based on valuable experiential wisdom of traditional medicine, but also relied on excellent synergy among all units. In this study, we reviewed the story of how artemisinin was discovered in China, summarized key factors for new drug development from traditional medicines under limited resources, and raised suggestions to utilize traditional medicines in low- and middle-income countries.

abstract = {Background
High-quality healthcare decisions need to balance input from science and clinical practice. When two sources of evidence — such as scientific and practice-derived evidence — are compared, integrated, or need to stand-in for one another, they need to be comparable on similar dimensions. Since 1891, Swedish physicians have been operating under a legal requirement to base their healthcare decisions on science and “proven experience” (approximately clinical expertise), and today all healthcare personnel in Sweden fall under this legal requirement.
Objectives
We investigated the dynamics between these two kinds of evidence with respect to importance, systematicity, and certainty by studying Swedish healthcare professionals.
Design
Survey to professionals; document studies of political discourse.
Method
In this study, a survey was sent to simple random samples of Swedish professionals in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, dentistry, and dental hygiene, asking about the roles of science and proven experience in medical decision making. Outcome measures were how important, certain, and systematic science and proven experience are for successful medical decision making.
Participants
The sampling frame was each profession's most recent occupational registry accessed by the Swedish federal statistical agency. 3500 surveys were distributed. 1626 surveys were returned. 26 participants were removed prior to analysis (exclusion criteria: more than one profession indicated, missing certificate, and mistake in stratum). The final sample consisted of 295 physicians, 300 nurses, 365 occupational therapists, 339 dentists, and 301 hygienists. 162 responses in questions used as variables in the analyses were either uninterpretable or empty; those were replaced with the modal response for a given participant's profession on a given question.
Results
In the study, proven experience's perceived importance for clinical decision making is positively correlated with its certainty and systematicity, and an increased certainty and systematicity is positively correlated with a diminished difference in importance between science and proven experience for almost all professions surveyed in this study.
Conclusions
Proven experience has an evidentiary role in clinical decision making, and this role depends in part on its certainty and systematicity. Notably, this makes the EBM-based perspective that practice-derived knowledge is primarily of implementation value less plausible.}

abstract = {During embryogenesis, the first pancreatic cells arise from a region located in the posterior foregut. Different signals are important to induce the formation of both the ventral and dorsal buds of the pancreas, along with the differentiation of all kinds of pancreatic cells. Other factors are also important to maintain a proliferative pool of pancreatic progenitor cells within the embryonic ductal epithelium. After organogenesis, new beta cells can also be originated by expansion or neogenesis. Different stem cell populations have been described in the pancreas: ductal and acinar cells, nestin-positive cells, hepatocyte growth factor receptor-positive cells, c-Kit-positive cells, and DCAMKL-1-positive cells. Transdifferentiation or dedifferentiation followed by differentiation is also described as being present in the pancreas. Thus, other pancreatic cells that do not belong to the endocrine lineage are possible sources of new beta cells. Extra-pancreatic tissue may also be modified to express insulin, including the hepatic tissue, bone marrow, and monocytes. In addition, stem cells from several sources have been subjected to differentiation protocols, expecting to achieve insulin-producing cells with and without genetic manipulation.}

We present two machine learning approaches for drug repurposing. While we have developed them for COVID-19, they are disease-agnostic. The two methodologies are complementary, targeting SARS-CoV-2 and host factors, respectively. Our first approach consists of a matrix factorization algorithm to rank broad-spectrum antivirals. Our second approach, based on network medicine, uses graph kernels to rank drugs according to the perturbation they induce on a subnetwork of the human interactome that is crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication. Our experiments show that our top predicted broad-spectrum antivirals include drugs indicated for compassionate use in COVID-19 patients; and that the ranking obtained by our kernel-based approach aligns with experimental data. Finally, we present the COVID-19 repositioning explorer (CoREx), an interactive online tool to explore the interplay between drugs and SARS-CoV-2 host proteins in the context of biological networks, protein function, drug clinical use, and Connectivity Map.

Honey is one of the most popular functional foods, speculated to be in use since the advent of human civilization. Its health-protective activity is endorsed by many religions and traditional medicines. In Unani medicine, honey is prescribed for many health conditions as wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, etc. In the present era, honey is gaining popularity over sugar for its myriad health benefits and low glycemic index. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive account of the biological activities and potential therapeutic uses of honey, with scientific evidence.
Methodology
In this paper, we have provided a comprehensive overview of historical uses, types, physical characteristics, bioactive constituents and pharmacological activities of honey. The information was gathered from Classical Unani textbooks and leading scientific databases. There is a plethora of information regarding various therapeutic activities of honey, and it is daunting to draw practical conclusions. Hence, in this paper, we have tried to summarize those aspects which are most relevant to clinical application.
Observations and conclusions
Many important bioactive constituents are identified in different honey types, e.g. phenolics, proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, organic acids, etc., which exert important biological activities like anti-microbial, wound healing, immunomodulatory, anti-toxin, antioxidant, and many others. Honey has the potential to alleviate many lifestyle disorders, mitigate the adverse effects of drugs and toxins, and also provide healthy nutrition. Although conclusive clinical evidence is not available, yet honey may potentially be a safer alternative to sucrose for diabetic patients.}

Background
Several therapies have been used or proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their effectiveness and safety have not been properly evaluated. The purpose of this document is to provide recommendations to support decisions about the drug treatment of outpatients with COVID-19 in Brazil.
Methods
A panel consisting of experts from different clinical fields, representatives of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and methodologists (37 members in total) was responsible for preparing these guidelines. A rapid guideline development method was used, based on the adoption and/or adaptation of recommendations from existing international guidelines combined with additional structured searches for primary studies and new recommendations whenever necessary (GRADE-ADOLOPMENT). The rating of quality of evidence and the drafting of recommendations followed the GRADE method.
Results
Ten technologies were evaluated, and 10 recommendations were prepared. Recommendations were made against the use of anticoagulants, azithromycin, budesonide, colchicine, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, and convalescent plasma. It was not possible to make a recommendation regarding the use of monoclonal antibodies in outpatients, as their benefit is uncertain and their cost is high, with limitations of availability and implementation.
Conclusion
To date, few therapies have demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of outpatients with COVID-19. Recommendations are restricted to what should not be used, in order to provide the best treatment according to the principles of evidence-based medicine and to promote resource savings by aboiding ineffective treatments.}

IPNVs are divided into seven genotypes, and all IPNV isolates that have been reported in China belong to genogroups I and V. Because of restrictions on imported vaccines, China has no commercial vaccine against IPNV; Therefore, more effective antiviral drugs and vaccines are needed. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat endemic and pandemic diseases and is reported effective against viral infections. We screened a TCM library containing 1483 compounds and found that bufalin exhibited anti-IPNV activity. Bufalin inhibits infections from IPNV genogroups I and V by inhibiting viral internalization and RNA replication rather than viral attachment. In vivo results showed that bufalin significantly inhibited viral loads in IPNV-targeted tissues in rainbow trout. Mechanistic research showed that bufalin's antiviral effects occurred via Na+/K+-ATPase. Our results indicate that bufalin inhibits IPNV infections both in vitro and in vivo and may be a promising drug for treating IPNV infections.}

Refrigeration is one of the most effectively used methods for the maintenance of proper temperature. Proper control and maintenance of medicine and food temperature are very important while delivering perishable foods and lifesaving medicine to the consumer. The implementation of IoT can be of help in such a process. This chapter mainly emphasizes the review of the application of IoT in the control and maintenance of the quality of critical commodities in the field of food and medical supply chain management.

While the interest in finding medical solutions for the worldwide antibiotics crisis is rising, the legal possibility of simplified authorization of herbal veterinary medicinal products is dwindling. An important basis for both the preservation and development of knowledge in veterinary herbal medicine are pharmacological and clinical studies on the performance of herbal remedies, based on historical written sources on the treatment of farm animals with medicinal plants, as well as current ethnoveterinary research. Nevertheless, there is only limited systematic ethnoveterinary research in Europe, with the exceptions of the Mediterranean region, Switzerland and Austria. We conducted a survey on the ethnoveterinary knowledge of farmers in Bavaria, and analyzed two regional historical textbooks.
Aim of the study
We documented the local veterinary knowledge about livestock in Bavaria based upon local historical textbooks and upon ethnoveterinary interviews to discover opportunities for the future development of European veterinary herbal medicine.
Material and methods
In 2018/2019 we conducted 77 semi-structured interviews with 101 farmers from different types of farms. Detailed information about homemade herbal remedies (plant species, plant part, manufacturing process, source of knowledge) and the corresponding use reports (target animal species, category of use, route of administration, dosage, source of knowledge, frequency of use, last time of use and farmers’ satisfaction) were collected. To compare our data with the literature, the use reports of two local historical textbooks were analyzed and compared with the data from the interviews.
Results
716 homemade remedy reports (HRs) for altogether 884 use reports (URs) were documented in this study. We picked the 363 HRs that consisted of a single plant species with or without other natural products (HSHRs) for a deeper analysis. These HSHRs were prepared from 108 plant species that belonged to 57 botanical families. The most URs were documented for the families of: Asteraceae, Linaceae and Urticaceae. Calendula officinalis L. (Asteraceae), Linum usitatissimum L. (Linaceae) and Urtica dioica L. (Urticaceae) were the most often documented single species. A total of 448 URs were gathered for the 363 HSHRs. The largest number of URs was for treatments of gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic dysfunctions, followed by skin alterations and sores. For nearly half of the URs the source of knowledge was family and friends. For 80 URs the source of knowledge was different from that of the corresponding HSHRs. For 68% of the URs farmers mentioned at least one use during the last 5 years. Half of the plant species that were mentioned in the historical literature were also mentioned in URs by the interviewees.
Conclusion
In Bavaria, medicinal plants are actively used by farmers to treat their livestock with a high level of satisfaction. The knowledge is not passed on from generation to generation in a purely static way, but is dynamically developed by the users in almost one fifth of the URs. Ethnoveterinary research combined with data from regional historical textbooks may facilitate pharmacological and clinical studies in veterinary medicine, and the discussion about a simplified registration for traditional herbal veterinary medicinal products.}

The leaching experiments showed that the leaching rates of Cu, Cd and Pb from biochar were 0–0.41%, 0–3.03% and 0.09–0.86% respectively, while the leaching rates of CMR were as high as 18.85, 10.98 and 2.52%, indicating that the pyrolysis process could improve the fixation effect of HMs in biomass to a greater extent and reduce the leaching toxicity of HMs. Compared with the traditional pyrolysis method, the solar pyrolysis had the same effect on the enrichment and stabilization of heavy metals in CMRs, which means that it is possible to realize the resource treatment of CMR through a renewable green energy (solar energy).}

Integrative medical approaches such as acupuncture, massage, laser therapy, and music therapy provide clinically meaningful benefits for hospitalized patients. In order to improve outcomes, physical modalities such as these warrant consideration for early inclusion into treatment plans for veterinary critical care patients. On the other hand, the effects of herbal remedies are less predictable, given the wide variation in contents and quality. Unlike approved medications, their pharmacologic and safety profiles are typically unavailable for veterinary patients. In addition, inadequate regulatory enforcement allows product sales without demonstration of product purity and full disclosure of the types and quantities of contents. These factors impose hurdles for plant-based prescribing in veterinary medicine.}

abstract = {Outcome
1. Describe a model for incorporating a virtual simulation-based mastery learning curriculum on breaking bad news into resident education.
Introduction
Breaking bad news (BBN) is an essential skill for emergency medicine (EM) physicians. Competency-based simulation education is commonly used for procedural skills training but is uncommon in EM communication skills training. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and impact of a multisite virtual simulation-based mastery learning (vSBML) BBN training program for EM interns.
Methods
EM interns at three academic medical centers participated in the training during scheduled didactics. After a virtual pretest encounter with a standardized patient (SP), learners received focused feedback using a previously published BBN assessment tool. All interns then participated in a 3-hour virtual workshop with deliberate practice using small-group roleplay with SPs. Participants completed a virtual posttest after the workshop. Participants who did not meet a predetermined minimum passing standard (MPS) at initial posttest received additional virtual deliberate practice until they met the MPS on a repeat posttest. Pre- and posttest scores on the assessment tool were compared to evaluate the impact of the training program.
Results
31 interns were eligible for the study and 28 (90%) completed all components. Although 64% of interns reported prior formal training in BBN, 89% did not meet the MPS at pretest. Checklist performance significantly improved from a mean of 56% (SD=20%) to 92% (SD= 6%; p<0.001) of items observed. There was statistically significant improvement in all scaled items assessing quality of communication. All interns achieved the MPS at posttest. Ninety-three percent of participants agreed/strongly agreed that they enjoyed the workshop and would recommend it to colleagues.
Conclusion
A multisite vSBML training program for EM interns was feasible and brought all learners to mastery in the core EM communication skill of BBN. Multisite vSBML represents a model whereby EM training programs can deliver and ensure competency in communication skills for all trainees.}

Biomechanical environments play a predominant role from cells to tissues and organs. These environments are also effective in the process of bone repair. Mechanical signals control biological activity at the site of injury. These signals regulate the formation, differentiation and proliferation of different cells. They are also responsible for the formation of connective tissue and the stabilization of damaged bone. Mechanical signals are applied to cells through external or internal factors. In this review, we first introduce and review the effective and active forces in determining the fate of stem cells such as Shear Stress, Tension, Elasticity, Stiffness, etc. Then we analyze the evidence from experimental studies and clinical observations about the effect of mechanobiology on bone repair or targeted differentiation of stem cells.

abstract = {Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (AM) is an important plant of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and its status can be comparable with ginseng in China. The efficacy and quality of AM are closely related to the place of origin. Hence, we proposed a simple and fast strategy to classify AM from different geographical origins by using multi-way fluorescence fingerprint combined with chemometric methods. AM samples with different dilution levels have different fluorescence characteristics, resulting from different content of fluorescence components and chemical microenvironment. Therefore, AM samples were diluted 5-fold, 10-fold, and 20-fold with 40% ethanol aqueous solution to obtain excitation-emission matrix data, and multi-way (three-way and four-way) data arrays were constructed. And then, the fluorescence fingerprints of AM samples were characterized by three-way and four-way parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). In addition, four pattern recognition methods were used to classify AM from different provinces. The results show that the four-way data array can provide more abundant information than three-way data arrays, so it is more conducive to sample classification. According to the results obtained from the analysis of four-way data array, the correct classification rate (CCR) of the cross-validation and prediction set obtained by partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) were 90.5% and 100%, respectively. To sum up, the proposed method can be regarded as a powerful, feasible, convenient, reliable, and universal classification tool for the classification of AM samples from different provinces and can be used as a promising method to realize the geographical origin traceability of other TCMs.}

Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most lethal diseases with the insufficient pharmacology therapeutic approach. Sanwujiao granule (SW) is widely used for IS in China with little known about its underlying mechanism.
Aim of the study
To investigate the characteristics of therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of SW against IS.
Materials and methods
The fingerprint of SW was applied by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Three different drug treatment strategies, including prophylactic administration, early administration and delayed administration, were applied in rats' permanent middle cerebral occlusion (pMCAO) model. The Garcia neurological deficit test, adhesive removal test, rotarod test, TTC and TUNEL staining were performed to evaluate the pathological changes. The transcriptomic analysis was used to predict the potential mechanism of SW. The vascular deficiency model of Tg(kdrl:eGFP) zebrafish larvae and oxygen-glucose deprivation model on bEnd.3 cells were used to verify SW's pharmacological effect. qRT-PCR, immunofluorescent staining and Western Blot were applied to detect the expression of genes and proteins. The network pharmacology approach was applied to discover the potential bioactive compounds in SW that contribute to its pharmacological effect.
Results
SW early and delayed administration attenuated cerebral infarction, neurological deficit and cell apoptosis. The transcriptomic analysis revealed that SW activated angiogenesis-associated biological processes specifically by early administration. CD31 immunofluorescent staining further confirmed the microvessel intensity in peri-infarct regions was significantly elevated after SW early treatment. Additionally, on the vascular deficiency model of zebrafish larvae, SW showed the angiogenesis effect. Next, the cell migration and tube formation were also observed in the bEnd.3 cells with the oxygen-glucose deprivation induced cell injury. It's worth noting that both mRNA and protein levels of angiogenesis factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, were significantly elevated in the pMCAO rats' brains treated with SW. The network pharmacology approach was applied and chasmanine, karacoline, talatisamine, etc. were probably the main active compounds of SW in IS treatment as they affected the angiogenesis-associated targets.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate that SW plays a critical role in anti-IS via promoting angiogenesis through early administration, indicating that SW is a candidate herbal complex for further investigation in treating IS in the clinical.}

As a component of robust designation field, the IPA technique is reputed for providing a quantified index of expectation value from multiple patients' biological index series. The expectation value can be a specific drug in blood concentration reading, or the potential risk of a patient with a clinical syndrome, or the optimal trigger timing for CTA. This study verified the inverse problem algorithm (IPA) by integrated case studies in preventive medicine.
Methods
The risk factors can be Age, BSA (body surface area), Sugar AC, MAP (mean artery pressure), or others. The risk factor index is normalized to eliminate the physical dimensionality and yield a quantified index between -1.0 and +1.0, whereas the middle point, 0.0, implies the average risk factor index. The quantified indices of patients are organized into a vast data matrix for deriving the inverse matrix and obtaining the column matrix of the compromised solution. This study preset the STATISTICA program to derive the solution according to default quasi-Newton or Rosenbrock analysis.
Results
The derived solution can be defined as a nonlinear semi-empirical formula with multiple terms to express the specific expectation value. Accordingly, six IPA-related papers are comprehensively integrated to explore the applicability and critical points in adopting the IPA technique for preventive medicine tasks. Besides, the interpretation of cross-interactions among risk factors to affect the performing of IPA computation and the convergence rate of a semi-empirical formula related to the final constant term are also analyzed and discussed in detail.
Conclusion
The integrated IPA technique is instrumental in exploring potential syndromes in preventive medicine.}

abstract = {Background
Simulation-based learning that focuses on the development and assessment of communication and counseling skills can help nursing students achieve better skill performance and gain self-confidence with decision-making ability. It is unknown whether virtual simulation as an instructional design significantly improves educational outcomes than a traditional lecture with low-fidelity simulation in students.
Objectives
The aim was to explore the effect of a virtual simulation-based educational smartphone application on nursing students' beliefs and self-efficacy in communicating with patients about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use.
Design
A quasi-experimental study with pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design.
Settings and participants
A total of 101 nursing students, who were in their second or third-year nursing program at a Southern Taiwan university volunteered to participate in the academic year 2020–2021. Participants were assigned to an experimental or control group in an elective course.
Methods
All participants received a 4-hour lecture that included an in-class lecture with low-fidelity simulation (paper-based scenarios) about the risk-benefit assessment of a patient's CAM use. The experimental group received a series of 13 virtual simulation exercises with clinical scenarios by means of a smartphone application. Data from belief and self-efficacy scales were collected at the beginning and end of the course from September 2020 to February 2021. Descriptive and inferential statistics were analyzed using the IBM® SPSS® version 23.0.
Results
Although both groups significantly improved their belief and self-efficacy scale scores, the experimental group had significant differences in overall self-efficacy in communicating with patients about CAM use compared with the control group, specifically the CAM perceptions and self-confidence scores.
Conclusions
Although both in-class and virtual simulation improved nursing students' belief and self-efficacy, the virtual simulation-based educational app is effective as an adjunct learning tool in significantly increasing nursing students' self-efficacy in communicating with patients about CAM use to help minimize their risks.}

abstract = {The use of traditional medicines and traditional knowledge in Africa is constantly on the rise, now with new greater interest from the international herbal markets for herbal medicinal and nutraceutical products from Africa. Although there is some growing scientific studies conducted on African traditional medicines, these studies are few and mainly academic and are not addressing research and development questions required by the herbal pharmaceutical industry and the growing sophisticated consumers of herbal medicinal products. The scientific research should address regional and international market needs for basic requirements of safety, efficacy and quality for commercial products. It is therefore hoped that this chapter will give stimulus for research to be done that would lead to guiding research to meet; first, minimum quality control requirements for marketed products, secondly, scientifically proven safety and efficacy of these products to meet minimum medicine regulatory requirements for their registration and lastly, to meet market authorizations both locally and internationally.}
