abstract = {Purpose
To examine the effects and moderators of exercise effects on cardiometabolic outcomes in men with prostate cancer previously or currently undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).
Results
Seven trials including 560 patients were examined. Exercise resulted in significant effects on whole-body and regional fat mass (P ≤ 0.001). For whole-body fat mass, significant exercise effects were observed in patients who were unmarried (−1.4 kg, P < 0.05) and who presented with higher fat mass levels (−1.0 kg, P < 0.05). For diastolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), younger (−4.7 mmHg, P < 0.05) and older patients (−0.2 mmol.l-1, P < 0.10) achieved greater effects, respectively. Regarding high-density lipoprotein (HDL), patients undertaking ADT + prostatectomy + radiotherapy derived significant exercise effects (0.3 mmol.l-1, P < 0.05).
Conclusions
Exercise effectively reduces fat mass across subgroups of men undergoing or following ADT with different characteristics. For diastolic blood pressure, HDL and LDL, groups based on age and treatment history could be specifically targeted with exercise medicine.}

abstract = {Objective
To describe supervision preferences among pediatric hospitalists, Pediatric Hospital Medicine (PHM) fellows, and senior residents (SRs), and to better define the ideal role of a PHM fellow.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional survey study at 6 institutions nationwide. We developed 3 complementary surveys, one for each population (hospitalists, fellows, SRs). We calculated univariate descriptive and bivariate statistics for categorical variables using Chi-square tests with the Rao-Scott correction to account for clustering by institution.
Results
Survey respondents included 106 of 200 hospitalists (53%), all 20 fellows (100%), and 149 of 380 SRs (39%). Most hospitalists and all fellows preferred the supervising hospitalist to have 3+ years of experience or be fellowship-trained. Nearly all fellows preferred the attending round in-person providing progressive independence; while hospitalists and SRs desired greater attending presence on rounds. Hospitalists and fellows wanted more frequent communication when the attending does not round with the team, and more hospitalists desired at least 2 points of contact regardless of attending presence on rounds. Fifty-five percent of SRs reported experiencing much less/less autonomy when on with a fellow than when supervised by a hospitalist only. Regarding the fellow's role, most participants agreed SRs should lead rounds and contact the fellow first with questions. The majority agreed teaching should be a shared responsibility but lacked consensus about how to provide feedback.
Conclusions
Study results reveal preferences about supervising fellows in this new subspecialty. Hospitalists, fellows, and SRs may have differing opinions regarding workflow, communication, and teaching, impacting team leadership and autonomy.}

The capacity of machine-learning methods to handle large and complex datasets makes them suitable for applications in precision medicine. Current methods automate data analysis and predict physiological outcomes of patients with various types of clinical data to inform treatment strategies. In this perspective, we propose ways in which machine learning can be leveraged even further to advance methods of optimizing patient treatment. Namely, machine learning can be used to expand applications of feedback control to direct the response of complex biological systems predictably and automatically. This paves the way for highly sophisticated treatments that continuously adapt to an individual patient’s response. The elements of control that can be improved using machine learning include sensor data analysis, modeling, and methods of reconfiguring the control algorithm “on the fly.” We discuss the control challenges unique to the analysis/control of complex biological systems, existing work, and areas that remain underdeveloped.}

In the present study, to identify which cell types are suitable for human dry-preserved cell sheets (dry sheets), we compared the intracellular FGF2 levels in seven types of cells reported as cell sheets for clinical use or preclinical studies. FGF2 levels were high in mesenchymal cells, including human oral fibroblasts (HOFs) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); in contrast, FGF2 levels in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), human skeletal muscle myoblasts (SkMMs), and human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) were remarkably low, approximately 25% those in fibroblasts. In addition, we prepared dry sheets from HOFs, DPSCs, and MSCs, and analyzed the growth factors released from each dry sheet upon rehydration. High levels of FGF2, HGF, and VEGF were detected in the eluate prepared by immersing each dry sheet. In particular, FGF2 and HGF were the most abundant in HOFs. An in vitro cell proliferation assay showed that these eluates significantly enhanced HUVEC proliferation compared to control cells. Furthermore, cells incubated with HOF eluate showed significantly higher cell proliferation than cells incubated with DPSC and MSC eluates. However, this proliferative response was significantly blocked by FGF2-neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate that growth factors released from human dry sheets have physiological activity and that this activity is mainly mediated by the effect of FGF2. Fibroblasts are ideal for the clinical application of dry-preserved cell sheets in humans owing to their high intracellular FGF2 content, fast cell proliferation, ease of handling, availability, and low culture costs, making them the most suitable cell source for regenerative medicine, with FGF2 release as the mechanism of action.}

Tsantan Sumtang (TS), originated from the Four Tantras, is an empirical Tibetan medicine prescription, which has been widely used for treating cardiovascular diseases in the clinic in Qinghai Province of China. Our previous studies found that TS alleviated hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH) in rats. However, the effect and bioactive fractions of TS on hypoxia-injured pulmonary vascular endothelium are unknown.
Aim of the study
To investigate the effect, bioactive fractions and pharmacological mechanism of TS on hypoxia-injured pulmonary vascular endothelium in vivo and in vitro.
Materials and methods
In vivo studies, HPH animal model was established, and TS was administrated for four weeks. Then, hemodynamic indexes, ex vivo pulmonary artery perfusion experiment, morphological characteristics, nitric oxide (NO) production, and the protein expression of protein kinase B (AKT)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/eNOS signaling were determined. In vitro studies, 1% O2-induced pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) injury model was applied for screening bioactive fractions of TS by cell proliferation assay and NO production measurement. The associated proteins of AKT/eNOS signaling were further measured to elucidate underlying mechanism of bioactive fraction of TS via using phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS) was used to reveal the chemical profile of bioactive fraction of TS.
Results
TS showed protective effect on the integrity of distal pulmonary arterial endothelium in HPH rats. Tsantan Sumtang dilated pulmonary arterial rings in HPH rats. TS enhanced NO bioavailability in lung tissue via regulating AKT/eNOS signaling. Furthermore, in the cellular level, cell viability as well as NO content of hypoxia-injured PAECs were elevated by fraction 17 of water extract of TS (WTS), through activating the AKT/eNOS signaling. Ellagic acid could be one of compositions in fraction 17 of WTS to produce NO in hypoxia-injured PAECs.
Conclusion
TS restored pulmonary arterial endothelial function in HPH rats. The bioactive fraction 17 was screened, which protected hypoxia-injured PAECs via upregulating AKT/eNOS signaling.}

Nasal TCM formulations are used not only for treatment of pneumonia, asthma, sinusitis and allergic rhinitis but also Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as antidepressants and antiepileptics, and in ischemia reperfusion. However, according to the analysis of nasal preparations of TCM currently on the market, most of them were compound preparations, which were used to treat allergic rhinitis (AR), common cold, headache and other local treatments, with a small range of diseases. At the same time, the dosage forms were mainly traditional dosage forms, aerosols and sprays, but there were no new dosage forms, which can not meet the clinical needs in terms of variety number, variety diversity and disease types. In this manuscript, we reviewed the development and applications of different nasal preparations of TCM from the aspects of nasal structure, origin, factors affecting absorption and common dosage forms, pharmacodynamics, targeting of nasal delivery and safety. In the near future, we expect that more nasal preparations of Chinese medicine with independent intellectual property rights will be marketed to meet the needs of clinical disease management.}

The main components of YH, such as tetrandrine, astragaloside IV and ferulic acid, have the effects of regulating inflammation and immunity as well as analgesia. Our lab previously reported that YH could promote the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the nucleus pulposus cells. This study was to determine the effect and mechanism of YH on both ruptured and non-ruptured intervertebral disc (IVD). First, we isolated human primary nucleus pulposus cells, then incubated them with 10 μM H2O2 to imitate the condition of oxidative stress in vivo. We found that YH-containing serum could promote the apoptosis and autophagy of nucleus pulposus cells in vitro. Next, we constructed rat models of both ruptured and unruptured disc herniation. The in vivo results showed that YH significantly could promote the number of autophagosomes, proportion of apoptotic cells, and expression levels of autophagy/apoptosis-related proteins in the nucleus pulposus of ruptured IVD. Also, YH could promote the resorption and degeneration of the ruptured IVD. Further, we investigated the molecular mechanism of YH-enhanced resorption of ruptured IVD. The in vitro data suggested that YH could activate ERK/mTOR in nucleus pulposus cells, leading to excessive autophagy and apoptosis while ERK inhibitor U0126 reversed the effect of YH on the ROS content, proportion of apoptotic cells and expression levels of autophagy. Overall, this study has demonstrated that the traditional Chinese medicine Yiqi Huoxue decoction promotes the resorption of herniated IVD via regulating ERK/mTOR-mediated apoptosis/autophagy in the nucleus pulposus cells, which highlights traditional Chinese medicine has a great potential for clinical conservative treatment for lumbar disc herniation.}

To explore the structural and functional characteristics of microbiota in oropharynx of sub-healthy children with gastrointestinal heat retention syndrome (GHRS) differentiated by traditional Chinese medicine, and screen the biometric operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to assist the clinical diagnosis.
Methods
We recruited children according to the “GHRS diagnostic scale”, collected their oropharyngeal swabs, and sequenced the 16S rDNA V4 region. We described the bacterial structure with alpha-indexes, beta-distances, and relative abundances; moreover, we screened the differential genera/OTUs with Wilcoxon rank-sum test, MetagenomeSeq analysis, and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis, in which biometric OTUs were selected to construct the receiver operating characteristic curve to verify the diagnostic value. The bacterial function was predicted with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways according to 16S rDNA gene by using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States.
Results
The study population was composed of 10 children with GHRS and 10 healthy control children. GHRS children were more likely to overeat (gluttony, P = .033). Alpha-indexes, such as Sobs, abundance-based coverage estimator, Bootstrap, and Qstat, were significantly higher in the GHRS group, while beta-distances did not exhibit any significant intergroup differences. There were 9 differently distributed non-predominant genera between the groups in Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as well as 13 non-predominant genera in MetagenomeSeq analysis and 3 non-predominant OTUs in LEfSe analysis. OTU44 and OTU196 were used to construct the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under curve was 0.92. Predicted functions showed that pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation and carbon metabolism were enriched in healthy control samples, while the pathway related to renin secretion was remarkably enriched in GHRS samples.
Conclusion
Unique oropharyngeal microbial structure and function were identified in GHRS children. OTU44 and OTU196 were specific OTUs, which could be used as biomarkers of GHRS to assist clinical diagnosis.}

In the second line setting, only FOLFOX (5FU/folinic acid-oxaliplatin) is validated by a phase 3 trial, yet with a very modest benefit on survival; new options using 5FU with nanoliposomal-irinotecan may emerge in the next few years. The advent of molecular profiling in advanced cholangiocarcinoma in the last decade revealed frequent targetable alterations such as IDH1 mutations, FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, HER2 amplification, BRAF V600E mutation and others. This strategy opened the way to personalised medicine for patients which are still fit after first-line treatment and the use of targeted inhibitors in first line constitutes a huge challenge with many ongoing trials to improve patients’ care.

While the antimicrobial activity of a number of plants used in traditional Mayan medicine against infectious diseases has been documented, their potential to inhibit quorum sensing (QS) as means of discovering novel anti-virulence agents remains unexplored. Aim of the study: To evaluate the anti-virulence potential of plants used in traditional Mayan medicine by determining their inhibition of QS- regulated virulence factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Methods
A group of plants used in traditional Mayan medicine against infectious diseases was selected, and their methanolic extracts were evaluated at 10 mg/mL for their antibacterial and anti-virulence activity using the reference strain P. aeruginosa PA14WT. The broth microdilution method was used to determine antibacterial activity (MIC), while anti-virulence activity was evaluated by measuring the anti-biofilm effect and the inhibition of pyocyanin and protease activities. The most bioactive extract was fractionated using a liquid-liquid partition procedure and the semipurified fractions were evaluated at 5 mg/mL for antibacterial and anti-virulence activity.
Results
Seventeen Mayan medicinal plants traditionally used to treat infection-associated diseases were selected. None of the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity, whereas anti-virulence activity was detected in extracts of Bonellia flammea, Bursera simaruba, Capraria biflora, Ceiba aesculifolia, Cissampelos pareira and Colubrina yucatanensis. The most active extracts (74% and 69% inhibition) against biofilm formation were from C. aesculifolia (bark) and C. yucatanensis (root), respectively. Alternatively, the extracts of B. flammea (root), B. simaruba (bark), C. pareira (root), and C. biflora (root), reduced pyocyanin and protease production (50–84% and 30–58%, respectively). Fractionation of the bioactive root extract of C. yucatanensis allowed the identification of two semipurified fractions with anti-virulence activity.
Conclusions
The anti-virulence activity detected in the crude extracts of B. flammea, B. simaruba, C. biflora, C. aesculifolia, C. pareira, and C. yucatanensis, confirms the efficacy and traditional use of these medicinal plants against infectious diseases. The activity of the extract and semipurified fractions of C. yucatanensis indicates the presence of hydrophilic metabolites capable of interfering with QS in P. aeruginosa. This study represents the first report of Mayan medicinal plants with anti-QS properties and suggests they represent an important source of novel anti-virulence agents.}

abstract = {Context
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led many leaders to reassess how recruitment into the medical field is conducted. In Hospice and Palliative Medicine, many training programs are moving to virtual recruitment as a more permanent strategy. However, virtual recruitment disproportionately affects smaller training programs as well as those in smaller cities or those whose location is less well-known.
Objectives
To assess faculty perspective regarding the value of virtual vs. face-to-face recruitment methods in a well-established program located in a mid-sized city that is lesser known than many comparable programs.
Methods
After virtual recruitment season in 2020, we assessed our faculty regarding the process of virtual interviews. Survey items were based on results of the 2020 NRMP Internal Medicine Program Director Survey to include the most highly cited factors used to rank internal medicine applicants. Faculty was asked whether virtual or face-to-face interviews were more effective and were asked to make an overall choice between face to face and virtual recruitment formats and to explain the reason behind their decision.
Results
Twenty-three faculty received the survey and 17 completed. Although more faculty felt that in-person interviews allowed for better ability to recruit the most qualified trainees than virtual interviews, nine out of the 17 faculty chose virtual as their preferred format.
Conclusion
While acknowledging benefits that can only be achieved in-person, our faculty believe that virtual interviews for future Hospice and Palliative Medicine fellows is an effective and potentially advantageous way to recruit the future work force of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were derived and identified from the ducks infected with fungi. In order to investigate the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicines against Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus, in vitro antibacterial test and animal infection control test were conducted to study the antibacterial activity of the Chinese medicine mixture which was compatible with Acorus gramineus, Phellodendron chinensis, and Cassia obtusifolia. According to the results, the liver of chickens infected with Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus displayed granulomatous lesions, indicating that the isolation of pathogen from the lungs of sick ducks is also pathogenic to chickens. As suggested by the results of in vitro drug sensitivity test, the mixture 1 MIC80 was the minimum, the MIC80 of Aspergillus flavus was 16 μg/μL, and the MIC80 of Aspergillus fumigatus was 4 μg/μL. In a petri dish of the same concentration, the colony diameter of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus in Mixture 1 was the minimum. Besides, Aspergillus flavus colonies grew when the concentration was 64 μg/μL, and Aspergillus fumigatus colonies grew when the concentration was 4 μg/μL, which suggests the more significant inhibitory effect of Mixture 1 on Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus. According to the results of animal experiments, there was a significantly lower activity level of Glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and Glutamate pyruvic transaminase (GPT) in the protection group and the treatment group than in the bacterial infection group. As indicated by the blood smear results, there were more neutrophils in the infected group than in the prevention group and the treatment group. Thus, it can be seen from that the Mixture 1 produced preventive and therapeutic effects on the chickens infected with Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus.}

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a worldwide health concern, demanding innovative therapeutic approaches. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of herbal compounds by scrutinizing their interactions with Beta-Secretase-1 (BACE1). Through comprehensive molecular docking analyses, three compounds, Masticadienonic acid (ΔG: −9.6 kcal/mol), Hederagenin (ΔG: −9.3 kcal/mol), and Anthocyanins (ΔG: −8.1 kcal/mol), emerge as promising BACE1 ligands, displaying low binding energies and strong affinities. ADME parameter predictions, drug-likeness assessments, and toxicity analyses reveal favorable pharmacokinetic profiles for these compounds. Notably, Masticadienonic Acid exhibits optimal drug-likeness (−3.3736) and negligible toxicity concerns. Hederagenin (drug-likeness: −5.3272) and Anthocyanins (drug-likeness: −6.2041) also demonstrate promising safety profiles. Furthermore, pharmacophore modeling elucidates the compounds' unique interaction landscapes within BACE1′s active site. Masticadienonic acid showcases seven hydrophobic interactions and a hydrogen bond acceptor interaction with Thr232. Hederagenin exhibits a specific hydrogen bond acceptor interaction with Trp76, emphasizing its selective binding. Anthocyanins reveal a multifaceted engagement, combining hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bond interactions with key residues. In conclusion, Masticadienonic acid, Hederagenin, and Anthocyanins stand out as promising candidates for further experimental validation, presenting a synergistic balance of efficacy and safety in combating AD through BACE1 inhibition.}

abstract = {Background
This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is intended to provide clinicians an overview of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), an obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factor.
Methods
The scientific support for this CPS is based upon published citations and clinical perspectives of OMA authors.
Results
Topics include T2DM and obesity as cardiometabolic risk factors, definitions of obesity and adiposopathy, and mechanisms for how obesity causes insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Adipose tissue is an active immune and endocrine organ, whose adiposopathic obesity-mediated dysfunction contributes to metabolic abnormalities often encountered in clinical practice, including hyperglycemia (e.g., pre-diabetes mellitus and T2DM). The determination as to whether adiposopathy ultimately leads to clinical metabolic disease depends on crosstalk interactions and biometabolic responses of non-adipose tissue organs such as liver, muscle, pancreas, kidney, and brain.
Conclusions
This review is intended to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of obesity and T2DM. This CPS provides a simplified overview of how obesity may cause insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and T2DM. It also provides an algorithmic approach towards treatment of a patient with obesity and T2DM, with “treat obesity first” as a priority. Finally, treatment of obesity and T2DM might best focus upon therapies that not only improve the weight of patients, but also improve the health outcomes of patients (e.g., cardiovascular disease and cancer).}

abstract = {Aim
Mitigating pain requires a complex biopsychosocial approach that empowers patients to take an active role in their treatment plan. A correlation has been established between a healthful diet and reduced pain. The role of nutrition in pain science is an emerging field with increasing interest from clinicians and patients. Nurses are well-positioned to take a lead role in providing patients with education & tools that may optimize nutrition and mitigate inflammation to promote optimal health and well-being. This presentation will explore current literature, strategies to support patients, and the role of nurses in the food-as-medicine approach that can contribute to optimal pain care.
Background
Recent evidence including systematic reviews suggest that optimizing diet quality, incorporating anti-inflammatory foods & nutrients, and minimizing processed foods may reduce pain severity and interference. Diet plays a complex role in modulating systemic inflammation. Knowledge is expanding rapidly in this area and multiple links between diet and inflammation have been identified. Dietary interventions have been linked to changes in behavior and mood. Optimizing weight has been demonstrated to enhance function and movement which may improve quality of life. A strong correlation exists between pain self-efficacy and disability for people living with chronic pain.
Method
Participants will explore current evidence and practice recommendations to incorporate nutrition into the pain plan of care. Tools to empower patients with simple, easy-to-implement strategies will be shared. A review of evidence for supplements, medical foods, and prescribed dietary interventions will be explored to support nurses to make practice changes & pursue research opportunities to expand nursing science.
Results
A case study with interactive gaming strategy will be used to engage participants and evaluate learning outcomes.
Conclusions
Participants will be able to apply a foundational knowledge of the food-as-medicine approach to empower patients in making healthy food choices to support their individualized pain plan of care.}

Comparing the role of community pharmacists in the context of herbal medicines and their use, two contrasting approaches emerge, and we exemplify this using a case study approach with two countries, which show the different approaches in the context of healthcare and specifically community pharmacy. In Germany (as in many other European countries) herbal medicines have remained a core element of community pharmacy, and are an important healthcare resource, while in the UK, these products are no longer primarily sourced through community pharmacies. This case study also highlights different regulatory approaches and classification in these countries to identical healthcare/medical products. Pharmacy practice research should endeavour to systematically compare the regulatory framework of this class of products and their importance in community settings.}

After the internal pretesting phase performed by the (lead) panel institutes, in both 2021 and 2022, each EQA test set comprised n = 10 tissue samples of hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative invasive breast cancer that had to be analyzed and reported by the participants. In 2021, the results were evaluated separately for German-speaking countries (part 1) and international laboratories (part 2). In 2022, the EQA was performed across the European Union. The EQA success rates were 84.6% (n = 11/13), 88.6% (n = 39/44), and 87.9% (n = 29/33) for EQA 2021 part 1, part 2, and EQA 2022, respectively. The most commonly used methods were next-generation sequencing and mutation-/allele-specific qualitative PCR-based assays.

This review aims to evaluate the current preclinical state of liver bioengineering, the clinical context for liver cell therapies, the cell sources, the delivery routes, and the results of clinical trials for end-stage liver disease. Different clinical settings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, acute liver failure, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and acute-on-chronic liver failure, as well as multiple cellular sources were analyzed; namely, hepatocytes, hepatic progenitor cells, biliary tree stem/progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, and macrophages. The highly heterogeneous clinical scenario of liver disease and the availability of multiple cellular sources endowed with different biological properties make this a multidisciplinary translational research challenge. Data on each individual liver disease and more accurate endpoints are urgently needed, together with a characterization of the regenerative pathways leading to potential therapeutic benefit. Here, we critically review these topics and identify related research needs and perspectives in preclinical and clinical settings.}

abstract = {Although traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and modern medicine (MM) have considerably different treatment philosophies, they both make important contributions to human health care. TCM physicians usually treat diseases using TCM formula (TCMF), which is a combination of specific herbs, based on the holistic philosophy of TCM, whereas MM physicians treat diseases using chemical drugs that interact with specific biological molecules. The difference between the holistic view of TCM and the atomistic view of MM hinders their combination. Tools that are able to bridge together TCM and MM are essential for promoting the combination of these disciplines. In this paper, we present TCMFVis, a visual analytics system that would help domain experts explore the potential use of TCMFs in MM at the molecular level. TCMFVis deals with two significant challenges, namely, (i) intuitively obtaining valuable insights from heterogeneous data involved in TCMFs and (ii) efficiently identifying the common features among a cluster of TCMFs. In this study, a four-level (herb-ingredient-target-disease) visual analytics framework was designed to facilitate the analysis of heterogeneous data in a proper workflow. Several set visualization techniques were first introduced into the system to facilitate the identification of common features among TCMFs. Case studies on two groups of TCMFs clustered by function were conducted by domain experts to evaluate TCMFVis. The results of these case studies demonstrate the usability and scalability of the system.}

EBM is primarily about discovery of the best medical scientific evidence, as opposed to the best expert opinion for crafting clinical choices in the best interest of the patient. The major goal of EBM practice is finding the highest level of evidence to resolve a clinical problem. According to Thoma and Eaves, the British Medical Journal conducted an online poll of its readers in January 2007 finding that EBM was ranked seventh among the 15 most momentous milestones molding modern medicine. Some of these major milestones included sanitation (germ theory of disease), immunization (vaccines), antibiotics, and anesthesia along with imaging (radiology) noting that a Google search today (in 2015) regarding anything to do with EBM would be in the millions.Practicing EBM means incorporating three fundamental requirements:1.Primarily, harvesting the “best scientific” research from the literature.2.That best research evidence must be combined with the physician's unique clinical expertise.3.Integrating the patient’s values, desires, and specific situation into the decision-making process.}

Asthma is a common airway disease, particularly diagnosed in children, often treated with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators. Due to the disease’s tendency for exacerbations and consequently, when severe will require unscheduled health care utilisation including hospital admissions, considerable research has been done into the effects of medication adherence on asthma control.

abstract = {Objectives
Impostor syndrome (IS) is prevalent in medical professionals. However, little is known about the prevalence of IS among medical trainees and those who are underrepresented in medicine (UiM). Even less is known about the experiences of UiM students at predominantly white institutions (PWIs) and historically black colleges/universities (HBCUs) relative to their non-UiM peers. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in impostor syndrome among UiM and non-UiM medical students at a PWI and a HBCU. We additionally explored gender differences in impostor syndrome among UiM and non-UiM students at both institutions.
Method
Medical students (N = 278) at a PWI (N = 183, 107 (59%) women) and a HBCU (N = 95, 60 (63%) women), completed an anonymous, online two-part survey. In part one, students provided demographic information, and in part two, students completed the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, a 20-item self-report questionnaire that assessed feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt surrounding intelligence, success, achievements, and one's inability to accept praise/recognition. Based on the student's score, the level of IS was measured and placed into one of two levels: few/moderate IS feelings, or frequent/intense IS feelings. We conducted a series of chi-square tests, binary logistic regression, independent sample t-tests, and analysis of variance to test the main aim of the study.
Results
The response rate was 22% and 25% at the PWI and HBCU, respectively. Overall, 97% of students reported moderate to intense feelings of IS, and women were 1.7 times more likely than men to report frequent or intense feelings of IS (63.5% vs 50.5%, p = 0.03). Students at PWI were 2.7 times more likely to report frequent or intense IS than HBCU students (66.7% vs 42.1%, p< 0.01). In addition, UiM students at PWI were 3.0 times more likely to report frequent or intense IS compared to UiM students at HBCU (68.6 % vs 42.0%, p = 0.01). Computation of a three-way ANOVA with gender, minority status, and school type revealed a two-way interaction indicating that UiM women scored higher on impostor syndrome than UiM men at the PWI and HBCU. This trend was not observed among non-UiM students.
Conclusions
Impostor syndrome is informed by gender, UiM status, as well as environmental context. Efforts to provide supportive professional development for medical students should be directed towards understanding and combatting this phenomenon at this critical juncture of their medical career.}

abstract = {Purpose
To (1) identify the percentage of patients seen in an orthopaedic sports medicine practice who use social media and (2) identify the role that social media has in physician selection as compared with other factors.
Methods
After institutional review board approval was received, new patients aged 18 years or older who attended a single orthopaedic sports medicine office from February 2020 to May 2021 were identified for inclusion. Sociodemographic information was recorded, and each patient was asked to fill out a questionnaire that assessed social media usage and online resources used to choose and formulate opinions regarding the patient’s provider.
Results
Two hundred patients met the inclusion criteria and completed the questionnaire. Of these, 96.5% reported social media use. The most common online method of searching for and identifying a physician was Google (50.5%). Social media outlets such as Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn were only used 15.5% of the time to search for and select a physician. Older patients were more likely to use recommendations from friends and family in their consideration when selecting a physician.
Conclusions
Despite almost all participants stating that they use social media, only 15.5% of patients reported that they used social media to search for and potentially select their physician. Our study suggests that although social media can be a helpful tool for patient education, other factors such as physician education and physician reputation through word-of-mouth referrals, online reviews, and online ratings seem to play a larger role in the patient’s selection of his or her physician.
Clinical Relevance
This information may be of value to orthopaedic surgeons looking for ways to build their patient base, online reputation, or other aspects of their practice on the Internet.}

Resumen
El enfoque de la medicina centrada en el paciente (MCP) es cada vez más importante debido a su asociación de efectos positivos sobre el médico y el paciente. El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo conocer si el abordaje de un caso clínico, a través de la clasificación de problemas de consulta de un caso ficticio por médicos de Medicina General y de Familia, presenta características de abordaje mecanicista o sistémico. Estudio observacional transversal en una muestra de conveniencia de la población de Medicina General/Medicina Familiar, incluidos los internos, en abril del 2020, aplicando un caso clínico del mundo real modificado de Portugal y los especialistas en Medicina General/Medicina Familiar de Azores y de Portugal central. Especialistas en Medicina General/Medicina Familiar e internados. Los médicos fueron invitados a participar, de forma anónima, mediante invitación electrónica, ya sea en la red oficial de pasantías o en la red social de un médico específico, la red MGFamiliar. Se utilizó un cuestionario autocumplimentable para verificar la clasificación de un caso clínico en subjetivo, evaluación y planificación (de la metodología SOAP) con las opciones de respuesta de la Clasificación Internacional de Atención Primaria de Salud (CIPC2) en los capítulos P (Psicológico) y Z (Social) posible para este caso. Se definieron médicos «técnicos» solo clasificando con códigos «P» y «sistémicos» clasificando «P+Z»’ o solo con códigos ICPC2 «Z». Se estudiaron las diferencias entre géneros, lugar de trabajo, ser interno o especialista, ser tutor en formación especializada. En una muestra de 227 sujetos, 30% (n=68) varones, los especialistas representaron el 66% (n=149), de los cuales el 49% (n=73) fueron tutores internos y el 34% (n=78), internos. Para la clasificación en el capítulo subjetivo de la metodología SOAP, el 44,1% (n=100) eran «técnicos», para la evaluación n=93 (40,8%) eran «técnicos» y para la clasificación del capítulo P el 56,8% eran «técnicos». Para la clasificación de los capítulos S, A y P no hubo diferencia significativa entre las variables consideradas. En esta muestra, los médicos portugueses fueron más «sistémicos» para los capítulos S y A del modelo SOAP, es decir, tomar en consideración simultáneamente los problemas psicológicos y sociales del paciente, por lo que son holísticos. La terapéutica en el capítulo P fue técnicamente orientada.}

Two recent case–control studies, both published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, have shown that intake of pholcodine-containing cough medicines during the year preceding general anaesthesia significantly increased the risk of anaphylaxis caused by neuromuscular blocking agents. Both a French multicentre study and a single-centre study from Western Australia offer strong support to the pholcodine hypothesis for IgE-sensitisation to neuromuscular blocking agents. The European Medicines Agency, criticised for not taking preventive action at its first assessment of pholcodine in 2011, finally recommended a stop to sales of all pholcodine-containing medicines throughout the EU on December 1, 2022. Time will tell whether this reduces the incidence of perioperative anaphylaxis in the EU, as in Scandinavia.}

abstract = {Highly mutable influenza is successfully countered based on individual susceptibility and similar precision-like medicine approach should be effective against SARS-COV-2. Among predictive markers to bring precision medicine to COVID-19, circulating ACE2 has potential features being upregulated in both severe COVID-19 and predisposing comorbidities. Spike SARS-CoVs were shown to induce ADAM17-mediated shedding of enzymatic active ACE2, thus accounting for its increased activity that has also been suggested to induce positive feedback loops leading to COVID-19-like manifestations. For this reason, pre-existing ACE2 activity and inhibition of ACE2/ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases through zinc chelating agents have been proposed to predict COVID-19 outcome before infection and to protect from COVID-19, respectively. Since most diagnostic laboratories are not equipped for enzymatic activity determination, other potential predictive markers of disease progression exploitable by diagnostic laboratories were explored. Concentrations of circulating albumin, zinc, ACE2 protein and its activity were investigated in healthy, diabetic (COVID-19-susceptible) and SARS-CoV-2-negative COVID-19 individuals. ACE2 both protein levels and activity significantly increased in COVID-19 and diabetic patients. Abnormal high levels of ACE2 characterised a subgroup (16–19%) of diabetics, while COVID-19 patients were characterised by significantly higher zinc/albumin ratios, pointing to a relative increase of albumin-unbound zinc species, such as free zinc ones. Data on circulating ACE2 levels are in line with the hypothesis that they can drive susceptibility to COVID-19 and elevated zinc/albumin ratios support the therapeutic use of zinc chelating inhibitors of ACE2/ADAM17 zinc-metalloproteases in a targeted therapy for COVID-19.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to examine and propagate the medication experience and group formula of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Master XIONG Jibo in diagnosing and treating arthralgia syndrome (AS) through data mining.
Methods
Data of outpatient cases of Professor XIONG Jibo were collected from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018, along with cases recorded in A Real Famous Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor: XIONG Jibo's Clinical Medical Record 1, which was published in December 2019. The five variables collected from the patients’ data were TCM diagnostic information, TCM and western medicine diagnoses, syndrome, treatment, and prescription. A database was established for the collected data with Excel. Using the Python environment, a customized modified natural language processing (NLP) model for the diagnosis and treatment of AS by Professor XIONG Jibo was established to preprocess the data and to analyze the word cloud. Frequency analysis, association rule analysis, cluster analysis, and visual analysis of AS cases were performed based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Inheritance Computing Platform (V3.0) and RStudio (V4.0.3).
Results
A total of 610 medical records of Professor XIONG Jibo were collected from the case database. A total of 103 medical records were included after data screening criteria, which comprised 187 times (45 kinds) of prescriptions and 1 506 times (125 kinds) of Chinese herbs. The main related meridians were the liver, spleen, and kidney meridians. The properties of Chinese herbs used most were mainly warm, flat, and cold, while the flavors of herbs were mainly bitter, pungent, and sweet. The main patterns of AS included the damp heat, phlegm stasis, and neck arthralgia. The most commonly used herbs for AS were Chuanniuxi (Cyathulae Radix), Huangbo (Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex), Cangzhu (Atractylodis Rhizoma), Qinjiao (Gentianae Macrophyllae Radix), Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma), Huangqi (Astragali Radix), and Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma). The most common effect of the herbs was “promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis”, followed by “supplementing deficiency (Qi supplementing, blood supplementing, and Yang supplementing)”, and “dispelling wind and dampness”. The data were analyzed with the support ≥ 15% and confidence = 100%, and after de-duplication, five second-order association rules, 39 third-order association rules, 39 fourth-order association rules, and two fifth-order association rules were identified. The top-ranking association rules of each were “Cangzhu (Atractylodis Rhizoma) → Huangbo (Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex)” “Cangzhu (Atractylodis Rhizoma) + Chuanniuxi (Cyathulae Radix) → Huangbo (Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex)” “Chuanniuxi (Cyathulae Radix) + Danggui (Angelicae Sinensis Radix) + Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) → Qinjiao (Gentianae Macrophyllae Radix)” and “Chuanniuxi (Cyathulae Radix) + Danggui (Angelicae Sinensis Radix) +Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) + Huangbo (Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex) → Qinjiao (Gentianae Macrophyllae Radix)”, respectively. Five clusters were obtained using cluster analysis of the top 30 herbs. The herbs were mainly drying dampness, supplementing Qi, and promoting blood circulation. The main prescriptions of AS were Ermiao San (二妙散), Gegen Jianghuang San (葛根姜黄散), and Huangqi Chongteng Yin (黄芪虫藤饮). The herbs of core prescription included Cangzhu (Atractylodis Rhizoma), Chuanniuxi (Cyathulae Radix), Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma), Huangbo (Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex), Mugua (Chaenomelis Fructus), Qinjiao (Gentianae Macrophyllae Radix), Danggui (Angelicae Sinensis Radix), and Yiyiren (Coicis Semen).
Conclusion
Clearing heat and dampness, relieving collaterals and pain, and invigorating Qi and blood are the most commonly used therapies for the treatment of AS by Professor XIONG Jibo. Additionally, customized NLP model could improve the efficiency of data mining in TCM.}

Recruiting diverse participants for precision medicine (PM) research programs should overcome low literacy and varied expectations. Information aids (IA) can address these barriers through patient-centered education. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of three information aids (IA) on participating in PM.
Methods
An experiment with 290 U.S. participants recruited from Mturk was conducted to compare the effects of three IAs on the outcomes related to participation. Three conditions included an interactive IA (i.e., providing PM-related information responding to each participant’s questions), a static IA (i.e., providing uniform PM-related information), and a control condition (i.e., providing non-interactive information irrelevant to PM).
Results
Both interactive and non-interactive IAs increased attitudes and information-seeking intentions, but not knowledge or participation intention. Perceived control and responsiveness mediated the effects of interactive IA.
Conclusion
Both interactive and static IAs supported enrollment efforts for PM through fostering attitudes and follow-up information-seeking. Increased perceived control and responsiveness are key to the effects of interactive IA.
Practice implications
IAs provide effective education and enrollment support for PM. Interactive IA can respond to individuals’ inquiries and control the learning process.}

There are innumerable promising advancements in the discovery and validation of biomarkers, which could be used to alter radiation therapy directly or indirectly. Directly, biomarker-informed care may alter treatment dose or identify patients who would benefit most from radiation therapy and who could safely avoid more aggressive care. Indirectly, a variety of biomarkers could assist with choosing the best radiosensitizing chemotherapies. The translation of these advancements into clinical practice will bring radiation oncology even further into the era of precision medicine, treating patients according to their unique anatomical and biological differences.}

abstract = {Background
There are approximately 352,000 pharmacists practicing in the United States, with most (59%) being female. Editorial board membership and publications with a female as the first author in selected pharmacy journals has increased in the past 2 decades. This study determined whether these positive trends are also occurring in critical care pharmacy.
Objective
To report publication rate and publication impact stratified by male and female gender among pharmacists designated Fellow of Critical Care Medicine (FCCM).
Methods
Pharmacists designated FCCM from inception through the 2020 convocation year were identified in January 2021 using a list provided by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. Pharmacists were excluded if they were designated Master of Critical Care Medicine, did not have an active pharmacist license, or did not have data in the Scopus database. Data were collected in February 2021 including year of first publication, total number of publications, citations, and Hirsch index (h-index).
Results
A total of 134 pharmacists were evaluable, including 76 males (57%) and 58 females (43%). Males had an earlier first publication year than females (2005 vs. 2010; P < 0.001). Males have produced a higher number of publications per individual pharmacist (29 vs. 13; P = 0.002) and a similar number of publications per year (2 vs. 1; P = 0.05). When comparing publication impact, males generated more citations (384 vs. 139; P = 0.001) and had a higher h-index (10 vs. 6, P < 0.001). These trends persisted when data from only the past 5 years were used.
Conclusion
There is statistically significant gender disparity in publication rate and impact. However, this disparity seems to be decreasing with time as the rate of females designated FCCM is increasing. This is consistent with an overall increase in the proportion of pharmacists who are female and deserves further exploration.}

Besides, the nitrogen balance, humification process, and microbial dynamics during the composting process were studied. The results showed that the group supplemented with ADE could increase the nitrogen retention efficiency by 2.21 % compared to the control group. High ammonia nitrogen content and salinity did not negatively affect the maturity and phytotoxicity of compost products and even increase the humification degree of compost products. Moreover, additional ADE may not alter microbial community structure, which could contribute to microbial succession. This is the first time to investigate the substance transformation and shift in microbial community structure while applying composting process for ADE treatment, in which the anaerobic-aerobic collaborative disposal process provides an alternative solution for the recovery of ADE.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Niu Huang Jie Du prescription (NHJD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) widely used in patients suffering from excessive inner fire toxin (Huo Du Nei Sheng) syndrome, such as sore throat, gingival swelling, and pain, mouth and tongue sores, etc. This formula contains realgar (As4S4) which is one of the 28 toxic medicinal materials promulgated by the Chinese Ministry of Health. Many studies reported its toxicity on the liver and kidney, and the detoxification effect of NHJD. However, its detoxification mechanism is still unclear.
Aim of the study
To clarify the detoxification mechanism of NHJD to realgar, this study evaluated the detoxification effect of NHJD on realgar exposure in mice, and analyzed differences in mRNA expression profiles in liver tissues and associated functional predictions.
Material and methods
ICR mice were administered with NHJD, realgar, and CMC-Na as blank control for 12 weeks, respectively. Liver injury was evaluated by histopathologic examination and liver mRNA gene were sequenced by Illumina. Differentially expressed gene, functionally enrichment and protein association network analysis were conducted.
Results
43 genes were screened out, among which 15 genes in the realgar group were decreased, but the extent of the decline has been restored in the NHJD group. The remaining 28 genes have exactly the opposite trends. Functional module analysis revealed that those detoxification function-related genes were primarily for positive regulation of glutathione metabolism, P450 on the metabolism of exogenous compounds, oxidative stress and immune-related, etc.
Conclusions
The results indicated that realgar mainly causes liver damage by changing the common enzymes of drug metabolism, especially the expression of genes related to CYPs, GSTs family, oxidative stress, and complement immunity, while the TCM prescription NHJD has a regulatory effect on the abnormal expression of corresponding genes. Our results will provide some clues for the detoxification mechanism of arsenic-containing TCM prescriptions.}

Precision health is one step ahead of precision medicine, which aims to make one healthier and attend health-promoting activities. There are four key steps to achieving precision medicine, including the establishment of large-scale databases from various sources and formats of health care records. Advances in multiomics enable the generation of new data from biospecimens. Artificial intelligence (AI) uses supervised and unsupervised algorithms to build multilayer and interconnected algorithms to analyze these big datasets for application in clinical workflow and to renovate health care. Patients with chronic liver disease need surveillance for disease progression; AI has been used to monitor liver disease. The first step is digitalizing health indicators and to generate digital biomarkers. Mobile health has been used extensively to track various health information, providing reminders and even digital therapeutics, through wearable devices, smartphones, smart mirror systems, as well as various applications in specific tasks. The application of telemedicine delivers health care outside the hospital setting to provide continuous care in remote areas and during the pandemic. AI provides the promising capability to renovate the health care system and facilitate precision health by using multidisciplinary collaboration. Advances in data collection, sharing, the protection of data privacy, and validation of clinical effectiveness are needed. The application of AI in precision medicine and precision health of liver disease is changing the landscape of health care and will benefit both physicians and patients.}

Mentorship provides general career guidance in academic medicine. Sponsorship advocates for a sponsee by endorsing this person for a position or role. Sponsorship is less common and originates from the corporate world. The objective was to evaluate current mentorship and sponsorship practices in academic medicine in the German-speaking regions of Switzerland. The aim was to assess to which degree sponsorship is implemented in academic medicine in Switzerland.
Methods
Cross-sectional survey of current and alumni participants of career development programs at two Medical Faculties of Swiss universities. Both programs build on institutionalized mentoring. The anonymous electronic survey was based on a literature review with non-validated questions about mentorship and sponsorship.
Results
The overall survey response rate was 37.6% (38/101). The majority of respondents was female (31/38; 81.6%) and between 30 and 40 years of age (22/38; 57.9%). Almost all participants had at least one mentor (37/38; 97.4%), and mentoring addressed all or most (21/38; 55.3%) of the relevant topics regarding academic career development. More than one third of the respondents (13/38; 34.2%) did not have a sponsor, 4/38 (10.5%) were unsure whether they had a sponsor, and 5/38 (13.2%) had not yet heard about sponsorship.
Discussion
In Switzerland, mentorship is well-established in academic medicine while awareness for the benefits of sponsorship needs to be fostered in order to further advance academic careers in medicine.
Conclusion
Mentoring and sponsoring may be considered key instruments for empowerment of junior faculty/physician scientists to become leaders in the field of academic medicine.
Zusammenfassung
Hintergrund
Mentoring dient der allgemeinen Karriereberatung in der akademischen Medizin. Beim Sponsoring hingegen wird die geförderte Person gezielt für eine Position oder Rolle nominiert. Sponsoring ist weniger verbreitet und stammt aus der Unternehmenswelt. Das Ziel war die Untersuchung der aktuellen Mentoring- und Sponsoring-Praktiken in der akademischen Medizin in der deutschsprachigen Schweiz, insbesondere die Erhebung, inwieweit Sponsoring in diesem Kontext etabliert ist.
Methode
Querschnittsstudie unter aktuellen und ehemaligen Teilnehmenden von Karriereförderungsprogrammen an zwei Medizinischen Fakultäten Schweizer Universitäten. Beide Programme bauen auf institutionalisiertem Mentoring auf. Die anonymisierte, elektronische, nicht validierte Umfrage basierte auf einer Literaturrecherche zu Mentoring und Sponsoring.
Ergebnisse
Die Antwortrate der Umfrage lag bei 37,6% (38/101). Die Mehrheit der Antwortenden war weiblichen Geschlechts (31/38; 81,6%) im Alter von 30 bis 40 Jahren (22/38; 57,9%). Fast alle Teilnehmenden hatten zumindest eine Mentorperson (37/38; 97,4%), und Mentoring beinhaltete alle oder die meisten (21/38; 55,3%) relevanten Themen bezüglich Karriereentwicklung. Mehr als ein Drittel der Antwortenden (13/38; 34,2%) hatte keine Sponsorperson, 4/38 (10,5%) waren unsicher, ob sie eine Sponsorperson hatten, und 5/38 (13,2%) hatten bisher nicht von Sponsoring gehört.
Diskussion
In der Schweiz ist Mentoring in der akademischen Medizin weitverbreitet. Das Bewusstsein für die Vorteile des Sponsorings hingegen sollte weiter gestärkt werden, um akademische Karrieren in der Medizin weiterzuentwickeln und gezielt voranzutreiben.
Schlussfolgerung
Mentoring und Sponsoring nehmen eine Schlüsselfunktion in der Förderung von zukünftigen Führungskräften in der akademischen Medizin ein.}

In response to this concerning rise in indirect causes of maternal deaths, professional societies have developed guidelines that regionalize high-risk obstetric care and prioritize critical care expertise as a requirement for designated ‘top’ maternity hospitals. Critical care proficiency is mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for graduating obstetric anesthesiology fellows. Despite these requirements, no formal obstetric critical care educational curricula or fellowship pathways, combining critical care medicine and obstetric anesthesiology, currently exist. Dual subspecialty training in both obstetric anesthesiology and critical care medicine represents one strategy to improve the care of critically-ill obstetric patients and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, which is one of the pressing healthcare issues of our time.}

abstract = {Background & Aim
The last decade has witnessed tremendous progress in cell therapy (CT), regenerative medicine (RM), and gene therapy (GT). However, these advances come with their own set of challenges and opportunities, which may vary among jurisdictions depending on infrastructures, laws, regulations, access to funding, and socioeconomic, political and cultural aspects. In September 2023, a virtual symposium was held on the opportunities and challenges of CT, RM, and GT in Québec, Canada. The symposium brought together scientists, manufacturers, and experts in law, pharmacoeconomics, and regulatory affairs. This work reports on the discussions held during this symposium, with the aim of guiding the development of new policies for CT, RM, and GT treatments in Québec and within the Canadian ecosystem.
Methods, Results & Conclusion
The comments from three panels were grouped into seven strategic orientations that reflected dominant views among panelists. The orientations were that: (1) an ethical framework must be developed around CT, RM, and GT to enable fair and timely access to treatments for all; (2) governments should spur private and public research investments in CT, RM, and GT; (3) regulatory awareness may be improved among developers through outreach approaches (initiated by the regulator) and early consultations (initiated by developers); (4) the regulations governing the development of CT, RM, and GT products could be streamlined and further adapted to the needs of these emerging products; (5) the skill sets of developers should be mobilized to foster the development and production of CT, RM, and GT products in the academic and industrial setting, and the training of Québec's workforce could be better aligned with industry and population needs; (6) Québec should ensure that the province's production and health care capacity are aligned with current and future needs in CT, RM, and GT products, considering the rapidly evolving landscape of CT and RM; (7) ongoing efforts to reform the current reimbursement framework could be continued in Québec's public, single-payer health care system. This symposium provided guidance for addressing current limitations and taking advantage of opportunities in CT, RM, and GT in Québec. We surmise that other jurisdictions face challenges similar to those discussed in this symposium. The global CT, RM, and GT community should therefore share experiences to promote the optimal development and access to these promising therapies.}

Learning about the human condition through Greek tragedies offers a dynamic way for medical students and professionals to reflect on their own experiences.
Methodology
In this article, we discuss Philoctetes by Sophocles, which depicts an example of human vulnerability and offers powerful lessons on the nature and taxonomy of pain.
Results/Discussion
We describe how we used the lessons learned from Philoctetes to empathize with the different types of pain experienced by a patient with heart failure at a student-run clinic.
Conclusion/Perspectives
We hope that our experience using Greek tragedy to foster stronger patient-provider relationships and improve treatment outcomes encourages other medical students and healthcare professionals to use the humanities to inform our role as healers.}

Circadian disruption is directly related to diverse age-induced health abnormalities. Rising evidence from various organisms shows that core clock gene mutations cause premature aging, reduced lifespan, and sleeping irregularities. Improving the clock functions and correcting its disruption by pharmacological interventions or time-regulated feeding patterns could be a novel avenue for effective clinical management of aging and sleep disorders. To this end, many drugs for sleep disorders and anti-aging compounds interact with the core clock machinery and alter the circadian output. Evaluation of dosing time-dependency and circadian regulation of drug metabolism for therapeutic improvement of the existing drugs is another fundamental facet of chronomedicine. Multiple studies have demonstrated dose-dependent manipulation of the circadian period and phase-shifting by pharmacologically active compounds. The chronobiology research field is gradually moving towards the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on targeting the molecular clock or dosing time-oriented medications. However, such translational research ventures would require more experimental evidence from studies on humans. This review discusses the impact of circadian rhythms on aging and sleep, emphasizing the potentiality of circadian medicine in aging attenuation and sleep disorders.}

Ring dosimeters and calibrated ThermoLuminescent Dosimeters (TLDs), specifically, a lithium fluoride-based TLD-100, were used to measure dose equivalent values. In mSv, the mean annual dose and range for three groups for extremities’ dose exposure were as follows: group one (6.24 ± 4.28) (1.1–11.7), group two (55.45 ± 7.85) (49.9–61) and group three (221.45 ± 18.03) (208.7–234.2). Within each of the three groups, the annual radiation dose was similar; however, there was large intergroup variation as would be expected due to the different roles each personnel has. However, in all cases, the extremity dose was less than the annual dose limit (500 mSv) set. Hence, this reveals a wide variation in dose among the personnel. This revealed a wide variation in dose among the personnel, highlighting the need for careful assessment of working conditions to ensure annual occupational exposures below the recommended limits.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has relentlessly spread all over the world even after the advent of vaccines. It demands management, treatment, and prevention as well with utmost safety and effectiveness. It is well researched that herbal medicines or natural products have shown promising outcomes to strengthen immunity with antiviral potential against SARS-COV-2. Aim of the review: Our objective is to provide a comprehensive insight into the preventive and therapeutic effects of herbal medicines and products (Ayurvedic) for pre-and post-COVID manifestations.
Material and method
The database used in the text is collected and compiled from Scopus, PubMed, Nature, Elsevier, Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv, American Chemical Society, and clinicaltrials.gov up to January 2022. Articles from non-academic sources such as websites and news were also retrieved. Exploration of the studies was executed to recognize supplementary publications of research studies and systematic reviews. The keywords, such as “SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, COVID-19, herbal drugs, immunity, herbal immunomodulators, infection, herbal antiviral drugs, and WHO recommendation” were thoroughly searched. Chemical structures were drawn using the software Chemdraw Professional 15.0.0.160 (PerkinElmer Informatics, Inc.).
Result
A plethora of literature supports that the use of herbal regimens not only strengthen immunity but can also treat SARS-COV-2 infection with minimal side effects. This review summarizes the mechanistic insights into herbal therapy engaging interferons and antibodies to boost the response against SARS-COV-2 infection, several clinical trials, and in silico studies (computational approaches) on selected natural products including, Ashwagandha, Guduchi, Yashtimadhu, Tulsi, etc. as preventive and therapeutic measures against COVID. We have also emphasized the exploitation of herbal medicine-based pharmaceutical products along with perspectives for unseen upcoming alike diseases.
Conclusion
According to the current state of art and cutting-edge research on herbal medicines have showed a significant promise as modern COVID tools. Since vaccination cannot be purported as a long-term cure for viral infections, herbal/natural medicines can only be considered a viable alternative to current remedies, as conceived from our collected data to unroot recurring viral infections.}

abstract = {Objective
Reduction in patient-facing teaching encounters has limited practical exposure to Emergency Medicine for medical students. Simulation has traditionally provided an alternative to patient-facing learning, with increasing integration in courses. Rapid advancements in technology facilitate simulation of realistic complex simulations encountered in the emergency setting. This study evaluated the efficacy of high-fidelity simulation in undergraduate emergency trauma medicine teaching.
Methods
A consultant trauma expert delivered an introductory lecture, followed by consultant-led small group transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) and chest drain simulations, and a splinting station. Participants then responded to a major trauma incident with simulated patients and high-fidelity mannequins. Pre- and post-surveys were administered to assess change in delegates’ trauma surgery knowledge and confidence.
Design
One-group pretest-posttest research design.
Setting
A higher education institution in the United Kingdom.
Participants
A convenience sample of 50 pre-clinical and clinical medical students.
Results
Recall of the boundaries of the safe triangle for chest drain insertion improved by 46% (p < 0.01), and knowledge of cardinal signs of a tension pneumothorax improved by 26% (p = 0.02). There was a 22% increase in knowledge of what transoesophageal echocardiograms (TOEs) measure (p = 0.03), and 38% increased knowledge of contraindications for splinting a leg (p < 0.01). The average improvement in knowledge across all procedures when compared to baseline was 35.8% immediately post-simulation and 22.4% at six-weeks post-simulation. Confidence working in an emergency setting increased by 24% (p < 0.001) immediately, and by 27.2% (p < 0.001) at six weeks.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that simulation training within emergency medicine can result in significant increases in both competency and confidence. Benefits were observed over a six-week period. In the context of reduced patient-facing teaching opportunities, emergency medicine simulation training may represent an invaluable mechanism for delivery of teaching.}

1. Drawing on a brand new curriculum syllabus, this poster presentation will enable participants to demonstrate the goals, methods and outcomes of an interdisciplinary curriculum focused on spiritual care in the hospital setting, and equip them to implement it at their specific institutions. 2. Equip participants to evaluate the benefits of a creative, reflective, multi-discipline learning environment, and its relevance to clinical care. By investigating the connection between being present to another's humanity and being present in their own, participants will gain recognition of the need for holistic spiritual care -for patients and themselves.
Key Message
Last year at AAHPM, TJ Douglas received a standing ovation following their presentation about an innovative, interdisciplinary spirituality curriculum inaugurated at New York Presbyterian, partnering physicians and chaplains in a creative learning environment addressing the human spirit in medicine. This year they return with results from new adaptations / applications of the curriculum, and means for implementation at other institutions.
Introduction
Spiritual care is a key domain of quality Palliative care. Such care requires that medical teams address the human spirit, yet medical training overlooks care for the human spirit, making it challenging to identify and mitigate patients’ spiritual distress. Spiritual needs are always culturally located; thus, appropriately addressing them leads to more holistic, sensitive patient care.
Methods
The aims of our curriculum were: (1) Increase clinicians’ spiritual generalist skills; (2) Equip them to work collaboratively with chaplains as spiritual specialists; (3) foster reflective space to connect to self and meaning in life and work. The authors designed a 16-hour curriculum in four sessions: (1) meanings of spirituality and relevance in clinical context (2) spiritual assessment models and the role of the chaplain (3) suffering in illness; (4) death and dying. Each session consisted of a case study, large group didactic, small group discussion, creative reflection, and cross-discipline partnered reflections.
Results
This year, we have three more result pools to share. Authors conducted post-program interviews using a questionnaire addressing changes in skills, awareness & knowledge, and welcomed narrative feedback. Physicians reported increases in the following: awareness of chaplain's role; frequency of chaplaincy referrals; understanding the importance of a patient's spirit in their care plan; skill in conducting spiritual screenings / histories; ability to traverse existential terrain with patients; awareness of how spiritual distress manifests; recognizing importance of caring for their own spirit in their work. Chaplains reported greater integration into the interdisciplinary team.
Conclusions
This curriculum enhanced the competence of participants in navigating spiritual distress and fostered meaningful connection between disciplines. It suggests that cross-discipline learning facilitates greater integration of the human spirit in medicine (both patient and clinician), strengthening comprehensive patient-centered care and mitigating clinician burnout. It is a valuable resource for any patient-centered institution.

In China, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is often used as the main therapy for cancer-related fatigue (CRF). However, there is limited evidence to prove its therapeutic effect and mechanism.
Aim of the study
We aimed to provide a basis for the therapeutic effect of TCM for CRF.
Materials and methods
We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of TCM treatment for CRF. Through frequency statistics and association rule mining, we screened the core Chinese medicine components, Astragalus mongholicus Bunge., root (Radix astragali, Huangqi) and Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz., rhizome (Rhizoma atractylodis macrocephalae, Baizhu). We then used animal experiments to verify the effectiveness of these two TCMs and changes in related indicators in mice. Relevant molecular mechanisms were explored through network pharmacological analysis.
Results
Twenty-four randomised control trials (RCTs) involving 1865 patients were included in the meta-analysis. TCM produced more positive effects on CRF than standard therapy alone. Radix astragali and Rhizoma atractylodis macrocephalae, as the core drug pair for the treatment of CRF, enhanced the physical fitness of mice; reduced abdominal circumference, level of inflammatory factors, and tumour weight; and increased body weight and blood sugar. Network pharmacology analysis showed that the mechanism of action of Radix astragali and Rhizoma atractylodis macrocephalae on CRF mainly involved compounds, such as quercetin, kaempferol and luteolin, acting through multiple targets, such as Protein kinase B α (AKT1), Tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). These molecules regulate cytokines, cancer signalling, and metabolic pathways and confer an anti-CRF effect.
Conclusions
TCM may be a promising therapy to relieve CRF in cancer patients. Our research may provide a reference for the clinical application of TCM for treating CRF.}

The International Commission for Mountain Emergency Medicine (ICAR MedCom) developed updated recommendations for the management of avalanche victims.
Methods
ICAR MedCom created Population Intervention Comparator Outcome (PICO) questions and conducted a scoping review of the literature. We evaluated and graded the evidence using the American College of Chest Physicians system.
Results
We included 120 studies including original data in the qualitative synthesis. There were 45 retrospective studies (38%), 44 case reports or case series (37%), and 18 prospective studies on volunteers (15%). The main cause of death from avalanche burial was asphyxia (range of all studies 65–100%). Trauma was the second most common cause of death (5–29%). Hypothermia accounted for few deaths (0–4%).
Conclusions and recommendations
For a victim with a burial time ≤ 60 minutes without signs of life, presume asphyxia and provide rescue breaths as soon as possible, regardless of airway patency. For a victim with a burial time > 60 minutes, no signs of life but a patent airway or airway with unknown patency, presume that a primary hypothermic CA has occurred and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) unless temperature can be measured to rule out hypothermic cardiac arrest. For a victim buried > 60 minutes without signs of life and with an obstructed airway, if core temperature cannot be measured, rescuers can presume asphyxia-induced CA, and should not initiate CPR. If core temperature can be measured, for a victim without signs of life, with a patent airway, and with a core temperature < 30 °C attempt resuscitation, regardless of burial duration.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile is a commonly used Mongolian in folk medicine used to treat cerebral nervous system diseases such as cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, nerve injury and cognitive function, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and coronary heart disease. Eerdun wurile may effect anti-postoperative cognitive function.
Aim of the study
To investigate the molecular mechanism of the Mongolian medicine Eerdun Wurile Basic Formula (EWB) in improving postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) based on Network pharmacology, and to confirm involvement of the SIRT1/p53 signal pathway, one of the key signal pathways, by using the POCD mouse model.
Material and methods
Obtain compounds and disease-related targets through TCMSP, TCMID, PubChem, PharmMapper platforms, GeneCards, and OMIM databases, and screen intersection genes; Use Cytoscape software to build a “drug-ingredient-disease-target” network, and the STRING platform for protein interaction analysis.; R software was used to analyze the function of gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment.; AutoDock Vina software for active components and core targets to Perform molecular docking. The POCD mouse model was prepared by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the morphological changes of hippocampal tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Western blot, immunofluorescence and TUNEL were used to verify the results of network pharmacological enrichment analysis.
Results
There were 110 potential targets for improving POCD by EWB, 117 items were enriched by GO, and 113 pathways were enriched by KEGG, among which the SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway was related to the occurrence of POCD. Quercetin, kaempferol, vestitol, β-sitosterol and 7-methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone in EWB can form stable conformations with low binding energy with core target proteins IL-6, CASP3, VEGFA, EGFR and ESR1. Animal experiments showed that compared with the POCD model group, the EWB group could significantly improve the apoptosis in the hippocampus of the mice, and significantly down-regulate the expression of Acetyl-p53 protein (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
EWB can improve POCD with the characteristics of multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway synergistic effects. Studies have confirmed that EWB can improve the occurrence of POCD by regulating the expression of genes related to the SIRT1/p53 signal pathway, which provides a new target and basis for the treatment of POCD.}

However, the disadvantages of using prolonged enzymatic treatment and low cell harvest efficiency still trouble researchers. In this study, PNIPAAm-immobilized gelatin microspheres (abbreviated as GNMS) were synthesized using a simple power-driven flow-focusing microinjection system. The developed thermosensitive GNMS can allow easier harvesting of cells from the microspheres, requiring only 10 ​min of low-temperature treatment and 5 ​min of trypsin treatment. The developed GNMS was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Further, live/dead staining, F-actin staining, and PrestoBlue cell viability assays were used to evaluate cytotoxicity, cell morphology, cell proliferation, and harvest efficiency. The gene expression of stem cell markers was determined by real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analysis to investigate the stemness and phenotypic changes in Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The results showed that the engineered cell-laden thermosensitive GNMS could significantly increase the cell harvest rate with over 99% cell survival rate and no change in the cell phenotype. Thus, the described strategy GNMS could be the suitable 3D cell carriers in the therapeutic application and opens new avenues for regenerative medicine.}

Fungi have always been given a great deal of attention and reverence in traditional medical practices for their ability to minimize harmful symptoms of diseases. More recently, the role of fungi in influencing healthspan and lifespan is being directly studied in the lab. To treat animal model organisms with fungi-derived molecules, extractions from different life cycle stages of fungi are performed. This includes mycelium (the vegetative stage), sporocarps (the reproductive stage), or spores (the end product of the reproductive stage), and each stage provides a variety of bioactive compounds. These bioactive compounds include glycoproteins, polysaccharides, triterpenoids, meroterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, steroids, alkaloids, benzopyran derivatives, and benzoic acid derivatives, amongst others. In this work, we review evidence that fungal extracts from multiple species can have beneficial effects on the lifespan and healthspan of model organisms, such as C. elegans worms, D. melanogaster flies, and M. musculus mice. We cover extraction methods and lifespan effects of Ganoderma lucidum (i.e. Reishi), Lentinula edodes (i.e. Shiitake), the genus Auricularia (i.e. jelly ear mushrooms), the genera Cordyceps and Ophiocordyceps (e.g. the caterpillar fungi), Hericium erinaceus (i.e. Lion’s mane), the mold genus Monascus, and also Inonotus obliquus (i.e. Chaga), Grifola frondosa (i.e. Maitake or hen-of-the-woods), the genus Pleurotus (e.g. oyster mushrooms), and Agaricus subrufescens (i.e. the almond mushroom). We propose that further research on fungal extracts will provide a greater picture of the role fungi-derived bioactive molecules can have in developing longevity and neuroprotective medicines for humans.}

abstract = {Context
Between 2000 and 2020 Open Society Foundations was one of very few funders that supported global palliative care development and advocacy.
Objectives
To describe progress made in three priority areas—the integration of palliative care into public health systems, access to controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative care—during those 20 years.
Methods
Activities and developments between 2000 and 2020 on global integration of palliative care into health systems, access to and availability of controlled medicines, and pediatric palliative care are described and analyzed.
Results
Major progress has been made in each area. Whereas in 2000, integration of palliative care into public healthcare systems was on the agenda in just a few pioneering countries, by 2020 a global consensus had emerged that palliative care should be integral to all health systems including in universal health coverage and countries were increasingly taking steps to integrate it into national health systems. While limited availability of these medicines was barely recognized as a public health or drug control issue in 2000, it had become an important priority in global drug policy debates by 2020 and numerous countries had taken steps to improve access to these medicines. Pediatric palliative care, available mostly in a small number of wealthy countries in the 1990s, has seen rapid growth, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and now has a solid foothold in all world regions.
Conclusion
Despite this progress, significant challenges remain as funding for palliative care advocacy is limited, the overdose crisis in the US has recently had a chilling effect on efforts to improve availability of opioid analgesics, and economic crises related to the COVID-19 pandemic create uncertainty over the future of universal health coverage.}

abstract = {Background
The field of network pharmacology showed significant development. The concept of network pharmacology has many similarities to the philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), making it suitable to understand the action mechanisms of TCM in treating complex diseases, such as ischemic heart diseases (IHDs).
Purpose
This review summarizes the representative applications of network pharmacology in deciphering the mechanism underlying the treatment of IHDs with TCM.
Methods
In this report, we used “ischemic heart disease” OR “coronary heart disease” OR “coronary artery disease” OR “myocardial ischemia” AND (“network pharmacology” OR “systematic pharmacology”) as keywords to search for publications from PubMed, the Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases and then analyzed the representative research reports that summarized and validated the active components and targets network of TCM in improving IHDs to show the advantages and deficiencies of network pharmacology applied in TCM research.
Results
The network pharmacology research indicated that HGF, PGF, MMP3, INSR, PI3K, MAPK1, SRC, VEGF, VEGFR-1, NO, eNOS, NO3, IL-6, TNF-α, and more are the main targets of TCM. Apigenin, 25S-macrostemonoside P, ginsenosides Re, Rb3, Rg3, SheXiang XinTongNing, colchicine, dried ginger-aconite decoction, Suxiao Xintong dropping pills, Ginseng-Danshen drug pair and Shenlian and more are the active ingredients, extracts, and formulations of TCM to ameliorate IHDs. These active compounds, extract, and formulations of TCM treat IHDs by delaying ventricular remodeling, reducing myocardial fibrosis, decreasing reactive oxygen species, regulating myocardial energy metabolism, ameliorating inflammation, mitigating apoptosis, and many other aspects.
Conclusions
The network pharmacology supplies a novel research exemplification for understanding the treatment of IHDs with TCM. However, the application of network pharmacology in TCM studies is still at a superficial level. By rational combining artificial intelligence technology and network pharmacology, molecular biology, metabolomics, and other advanced theories and technologies, and systematically studying the metabolic process and the network among products, targets, and pathways of TCM from the clinical perspective may be a potential development trend in network pharmacology.}

abstract = {Introduction
Newer pharmacotherapy agents (anti-obesity medication [AOM]) are revolutionizing the management of children and adolescents with obesity. Previously, treatment based on intensive behavioral therapy involved many patient and family contact hours and yielded improvements in obesity status of 1-3 percent of the 95th percentile of the body mass index (BMI). Newer AOMs are yielding more clinically significant improvement of 5-18 percent. This review provides guidance for practitioners in the care of children and adolescents with obesity who frequently have complex medical and behavioral health care needs. Specifically, we discuss the use of newer AOMs in these complex patients.
Methods
This review details an approach to the care of the child and adolescent with obesity using AOMs. A shared decision-making process is presented in which the provider and the patient and family collaborate on care. Management of medical and behavioral components of the disease of obesity in the child are discussed.
Results
Early aggressive treatment is recommended, starting with an assessment of associated medical and behavioral complications, weight promoting medications, use of AOMs and ongoing care. Intensive behavioral therapy is foundational to treatment, but not a specific treatment. Patients and families deserve education on expected outcomes with each therapeutic option.
Conclusions
The use of new AOMs in children and adolescents has changed expected clinical outcomes in the field of pediatric obesity management. Clinically significant improvement in obesity status occurs when AOMs are used early and aggressively. Ongoing, chronic care is the model for optimizing outcomes using a shared decision-making between provider and patient/family. Depending on the experience and comfort level of the primary care practitioner, referral to an obesity medicine specialist may be appropriate, particularly when obesity related co-morbidities are present and pharmacotherapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery are considerations.}

These heterogeneous nanoparticles (30–150 nm) are secreted from various cells and play important biological roles in intercellular communication. EXOs have received much attention for application in regenerative therapies and tissue repair due to their stability, biosafety, and functional versatility. However, in their free forms, “EXOs have poor bioavailability” at the site of action and are devoid of controlled-release mechanisms. These issues have been largely remedied by scaffolding EXOs with appropriate biomaterials such as hydrogels to create EXOs -loaded scaffold (ELS). These biomaterial-based scaffolds can be rationally designed and functionalized to enhance various aspects of ELS including bioavailability, biocompatibility, and loading/release control. Additionally, the ELS are superior to free EXOs due to reduced injection-related side effects. This review article provides a comprehensive and updated account of EXOs and ELS isolation, characterization, and application in regenerative medicine with a focus on soft tissue repair. We also offer insights into the advantages of ELS therapy compared to stem cell therapy towards application in wound healing, cardiac and bone repair. ELS promotes cell migration to the scaffold and will cause better homing of exosomes. Different types of scaffolds are made and each one can be modified based on the repair in the target tissues so that the reactions between the scaffold and exosome take place properly and effective signals are created for tissue repair.}

New possibilities for a ubiquitous and constant data collection and the processing of data in real-time enable more personalized health services. These technologies might also allow users to actively participate in health practices, thus potentially changing the role of patients from passive receivers of healthcare to active agents. The crucial driving force of this transformation is the implementation of data-intensive surveillance and monitoring as well as self-monitoring technologies. Some commentators use terms like revolution, democratization, and empowerment to describe the aforementioned transformation process in medicine. The public debate as well as most of the ethical discourse on digital health tends to focus on the technologies themselves, mostly ignoring the economic framework of their design and implementation. Analyzing the transformation process connected to digital health technologies needs an epistemic lens that also considers said economic framework, which I argue is surveillance capitalism. This paper introduces the concept of liquid health as such an epistemic lens. Liquid health is based on Zygmunt Bauman's framing of modernity as a process of liquefaction that dissolves traditional norms and standards, roles, and relations. By using liquid health as an epistemic lens, I aim to show how digital health technologies reshape concepts of health and illness, change the scope of the medical domain, and liquify roles and relationships that surround health and healthcare. The basic hypothesis is that although digital health technologies can lead to personalization of treatment and empowerment of users, their economic framework of surveillance capitalism may undermine these very goals. Using liquid health as a concept allows us to better understand and describe practices of health and healthcare that are shaped by digital technologies and the specific economic practices they are inseparably attached to.}
