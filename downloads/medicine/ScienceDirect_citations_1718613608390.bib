abstract = {Connected health is a new model for health management. It puts the correct information in the correct hands at the correct time. It allows patients and clinicians to make better decisions and relies heavily on advanced technologies to do so. In the connected health era there is an opportunity to collect a multitude of data about a patient. These may include daily life and behavior, including compliance to interventions or psychological aspects, as well as daily fluctuations of physiological parameters and contextual factors that influence them and can be combined with clinical and biological data available for the patient at different time points. This multitude of data can offer the opportunity to move from evidence-based medicine to knowledge-based medicine, that is, medicine that relies on knowledge about the patient. To achieve this goal, it is worth investigating the path from new technological methods for data acquisition to analysis and new knowledge and the path from patient knowledge to better intervention, as aspects that have gradually been discovered within the connected health domain. Both points would contribute to the impact of wide adoption of connected health technologies (CHT) as parts of new healthcare models. This chapter discusses first the connected health technologies in cardiac care. Basic concepts and building blocks are discussed, such as point-of-care diagnostics and new sensors, big data analytics, health behavior informatics and systems medicine, interventions, and knowledge-based medicine. CHT as a part of an iterative learning cycle for knowledge acquisition and application is presented, and the relevant challenges are discussed.}

abstract = {To enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse effects, ancient practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescribe combinations of plant species/animal species and minerals designated “TCM formulae” developed based on TCM theory and clinical experience. TCM formulae have been shown to exert curative effects on complex diseases via immune regulation but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown at present. Considerable progress in the field of immunometabolism, referring to alterations in the intracellular metabolism of immune cells that regulate their function, has been made over the past decade. The core context of immunometabolism is regulation of the allocation of metabolic resources supporting host defense and survival, which provides a critical additional dimension and emerging insights into how the immune system and metabolism influence each other during disease progression. This review summarizes research findings on the significant association between the immune function and metabolic remodeling in health and disease as well as the therapeutic modulatory effects of TCM formulae on immunometabolism. Progressive elucidation of the immunometabolic mechanisms involved during the course of TCM treatment continues to aid in the identification of novel potential targets against pathogenicity. In this report, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the benefits of TCM based on regulation of immunometabolism that are potentially applicable for the treatment of modern diseases.}

The documents aimed to compare their chemical differences are rare, to date. An untargeted metabolomics approach, based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QTOF-MS), was elaborated to unveil the potential chemical markers to differentiate among GSF, GFA, and GS. Good chromatographic separation of all the GSF/GFA/GS components was achieved within 33 min by utilizing a BEH C18 column, while data-independent MSE in the positive mode was selected for profiling the metabolic features. Notably, the high-mass saponins (1300–2500 Da) gave unique protonated precursors ([M + H]+) in the positive ESI mode, compared with those complicated ion species occurring in the negative mode. Pattern recognition chemometrics analysis of 45 batches of G. sinensis samples could unveil 70 significantly altered ions assigned as 46 potentially differential components. The positive/negative high-accuracy MS2 data analysis, phytochemical isolation/NMR analysis, and searching of an in-house library of G. sinensis, were utilized for structural elucidation. Three compounds (saikachinoside A, locustoside A, and locustoside B) rich in GSF could be the markers to differentiate from GFA/GS, while four components were characteristic for GS. These results obtained can greatly benefit the quality control of TCMs derived from G. sinensis.}

abstract = {Background
A structured clinical communication skills training program was introduced in 2019 at the Koc University School of Medicine. Handling sensitive issues (HSI) and breaking bad news (BBN) were introduced as two specific communication skills in the program. This study aimed to measure the effectiveness of the HSI and BBN training on students’ communication skills
Method
Forty-five medical students in their first clinical year were initiated into the program and randomly divided into two groups. The first group received HSI training while the second group received BBN training; one month later, they were interchanged. The training included lectures, video discussions, and role-playings. Students were trained to use NURSE statements for showing empathy, the CDC’s 5Ps approach for taking a sexual history, and the six-step SPIKES protocol for BBN. Two different OSCE stations were used to assess students after each training session. Each group encountered a scenario based on the related training; the other station presented a scenario for which they were not trained. Students were graded using a pre-validated checklist. Students also submitted written self-assessments and feedback after the two trainings were completed. The OSCE scores of both groups were analyzed and compared.
Findings
A total of 43 students completed the training. In both the HIS and BBN groups, the post-training OSCE mean score increased significantly. There was no significant decrease in the mean score of the OSCEs performed one month after the training. Students endorsed the training, saying it would help them face real situations in clinical settings.
Discussion
HSI and BBN training significantly improved the students’ communication skills. This study’s results provide evidence to stakeholders about the importance and effectiveness of the program and encourages us to redesign other communication skills lessons within the curriculum to provide the students with the most efficient and effectual training and practice.}

abstract = {A diagnosis of cancer is frightening at any age, but especially when the patient is a child. Only what is suspected can be diagnosed, only what is known or at least known to exist is suspected, but musculoskeletal tumors are infrequent and therefore very difficult to diagnose or treat. Probably due to their infrequency, the complexity of the radiological images, histopathological appearance, as well as the serious consequences due to inadequate biopsies and treatments, musculoskeletal tumor pathology requires clinical management that must be carried out by a group of specialists with specific training, allowing an adequate diagnosis, introduction of adjuvant therapies, as well as surgical treatment, making multidisciplinary treatment essential today. Imaging studies provide essential information on the nature of each lesion, its size, its anatomical location, the effect on the surrounding bone or soft tissues and the involvement of adjacent joints and neurovascular structures. In this article the authors will discuss the advances in nuclear medicine techniques (scintigraphy, SPECT/CT and PET/CT) and their usefulness in the staging of pediatric malignant musculoskeletal tumors, as well as in the assessment of response, follow-up, and diagnosis of recurrence.
Resumen
Un diagnóstico de cáncer es perturbador a cualquier edad, pero especialmente cuando el paciente es un niño. Solo se puede diagnosticar lo que se sospecha, solo se sospecha lo que se conoce o, al menos, se conoce su existencia, pero los tumores musculoesqueléticos son infrecuentes y, por tanto, muy difíciles de diagnosticar o tratar. Probablemente por su infrecuencia, por la complejidad de las imágenes radiológicas, por la apariencia histopatológica, así como por las serias consecuencias debido a biopsias y tratamientos inadecuados, la patología tumoral musculoesquelética necesita un manejo clínico que debe ser llevado a cabo por un grupo de especialistas con formación específica, que permita un adecuado diagnóstico, la introducción de terapias adyuvantes, así como un tratamiento quirúrgico, haciéndose hoy imprescindible un tratamiento multidisciplinar. Los estudios de imagen proporcionan información esencial sobre la naturaleza de cada lesión, su tamaño, su localización anatómica, el efecto sobre el hueso o los tejidos blandos circundantes y la afectación de las articulaciones adyacentes y las estructuras neurovasculares. En este artículo los autores analizan los avances de las técnicas de medicina nuclear (gammagrafías, PET/TC y SPECT/TC) y su utilidad en la estadificación de tumores musculoesqueléticos malignos pediátricos, así como en la valoración de la respuesta, el seguimiento y el diagnóstico de recidiva.}

Public partnerships, a route to sharing expertise, networks and resources anchored in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, has been championed by multiple stakeholders.
Objective
To propose a new evidence-based medicine (EBM) curriculum for harnessing patient and public expertise to ensure that EBM teaching and learning can become more relevant and impactful.
Methods
A curriculum development group comprising of EBM teachers, patient and public involvement representatives, clinicians, clinical epidemiologists, public health experts and educationalists, with experience of delivering and evaluating face-to-face and online EBM courses across many countries and continents, prepared a new EBM course.
Results
A student-centred, problem-based and clinically integrated course for teaching and learning EBM was developed. In the spirit of shared decision-making, practitioners can learn to support patients, articulate their perspectives, recognise the need for their contribution and ensure community involvement when generating and applying evidence. With end users in mind, the application of research findings, delivery of care and EBM effectiveness in the workplace would carry increased priority.
Conclusions
Embracing patients as EBM collaborators can help deliver cognitive diversity and inspire different ways of thinking and working. Adopting the proposed approach in EBM education lays the foundations for a joint practitioner–patient partnership to ask, acquire, appraise and apply EBM in a more holistic context which will strengthen the EBM proposition.
Resumen
Introducción
Las asociaciones de pacientes y ciudadanos constituyen una vía para compartir experiencias, redes y recursos siendo promovidas por los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible de la Organización de Naciones Unidas (ONU), y defendidas por todas las partes y sectores interesados.
Objetivo
Proponer un nuevo plan de estudios de medicina basada en la evidencia (MBE) para aprovechar la experiencia de los pacientes con el fin de garantizar de que la enseñanza y el aprendizaje de la MBE sean más relevantes e impactantes.
Métodos
Un grupo de expertos compuesto por profesores del área de MBE, representantes de pacientes, médicos, epidemiólogos clínicos, expertos en salud pública y pedagogos, con experiencia en la impartición y evaluación de cursos de MBE presenciales y online en el ámbito internacional, desarrolló e implementó un curso de MBE.
Resultados
Se desarrolló un curso centrado en el estudiante, basado en problemas y clínicamente integrado para la enseñanza y el aprendizaje de la MBE. En el espíritu de la toma de decisiones compartida, los profesionales pueden aprender a apoyar a los pacientes, a articular sus perspectivas, a reconocer la necesidad de su contribución y a garantizar la participación de la comunidad a la hora de generar y aplicar las pruebas. La aplicación de los resultados de la investigación, la prestación de cuidados y la eficacia de la MBE en el lugar de trabajo son las áreas de mayor prioridad para los asistentes.
Conclusiones
Adoptar a los pacientes como colaboradores de la MBE puede ayudar a proporcionar diversidad cognitiva e inspirar diferentes formas de pensar y trabajar. La adopción del enfoque propuesto en la formación en MBE sienta las bases para una colaboración conjunta entre profesionales y pacientes para preguntar, adquirir, valorar y aplicar la MBE en un contexto más holístico que reforzará la propuesta de MBE.}

Multidisciplinary, because collaboration between surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, nuclear physicians, pathologists, and all those involved in patient follow-up is necessary, and multimodality, because we must move towards precision surgery tailored to each patient in which, on the part of Nuclear Medicine, hybrid imaging (SPECT/CT and PET/CT), bimodal tracers, the use of new allies such as ultrasound or our own adaptation to robotic surgery have a great deal to say. A wide range of possibilities is built on the solid foundation of preoperative scintigraphy, which makes it possible to identify the target tissues and whose knowledge prior to surgery allows the necessary surgical approach to be considered for each patient.

Common antibiotics, although useful, have adverse effects or are ineffective against many infections. Also, many emerging or reemerging infections lack proper therapeutics. To face this global threat, alternative or new drugs are urgently required. The secondary metabolites of plants are the vital components of nature that help in human defense by interfering with specific molecules of microbial or human cells, modulating the cell signaling pathways, and protecting against UV damage and oxidative stress. Hence, “plant-derived antimicrobials” or “phyto-antimicrobials” can predispose inhibitory activity against diverse viruses, bacteria, and fungi to parasites. It not only causes leakage of the microbial cell wall, damage to the cell membrane, or cell lysis, but also inactivate/disrupt proteins or enzymes and interfere transcription to translation leading to the death of the microbes. Hence, natural antimicrobials may be the most ideal for health care, as it can help in healing process and kill/inhibit the pathogens efficiently and may prevent the development of drug resistance. Billions of living species on the earth from bacteria to animals produce a plethora of healing chemicals, many of which are still unknown. Thus, the present review portrays the antimicrobial role of selected traditional medicine(s) including their active compounds with the possible mechanism of action for managing difficult-to-treat infections.}

Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is currently performed at select centers worldwide, with the current standard of practice being postprocedural inpatient monitoring for 24 to 72 hours. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BPA in a cohort of patients with chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and outline a protocol for implementation in the outpatient setting.
Methods
All patients with distal, inoperable CTEPH, residual symptoms after pulmonary endarterectomy, or symptomatic CTEPD from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022, were evaluated by a multidisciplinary chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension team for consideration of BPA. Patients undergoing each BPA session adhered to a regimented protocol developed and implemented at our institution. Safety and efficacy were retrospectively evaluated with a mean follow-up time of 8.5 months.
Results
Eighteen patients underwent a total of 78 BPA sessions. Overall, there was a significant improvement in World Health Organization functional class and mean improvement in 6-minute walking distance of +67 m. Hemodynamic parameters significantly improved with a mean decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance of 7.3 ± 5.8 mm Hg and 1.7 ± 1.5 Wood units, respectively (P <.05). Complication rates were low with 3 (3.9%) of 78 patients developing scant hemoptysis and 1 (1.3%) of 78 experiencing vascular injury requiring inpatient hospitalization.
Conclusions
BPA is both safe and effective when implemented in the outpatient setting using a regimented protocol provided there are necessary contingencies in place.}

abstract = {While assisted reproductive technology has given so many people the ability to bear children, it is still far from a cure-all for fertility issues. Two traditional medical systems, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda have been using a very different, more holistic approach to help couples enhance fertility for millennia. This chapter explains how TCM and Ayurveda approach infertility issues. Specifically, it discusses the fundamental principles of both systems, the importance of focusing on foundation health and creating balance in the body, and how these systems personalize treatment. Both systems believe that proper preparation for pregnancy can set the stage for a healthier pregnancy and better long-term health for the future child. TCM refers to this as “tilling the soil before planting the seed.” The basic elements of diagnosis, patterns of imbalance, treatment approaches including acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, panchakarma, and research on the efficacy of these approaches are discussed.}

abstract = {Objectives
We aimed at investigating the whole-blood transcriptome, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and levels of selected serological markers in patients with SLE versus healthy controls (HC) to gain insight into pathogenesis and identify drug targets.
Methods
We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and dysregulated gene modules in a cohort of 350 SLE patients and 497 HC from the European PRECISESADS project (NTC02890121), split into a discovery (60%) and a replication (40%) set. Replicated DEGs qualified for eQTL, pathway enrichment, regulatory network, and druggability analysis. For validation purposes, a separate gene module analysis was performed in an independent cohort (GSE88887).
Results
Analysis of 521 replicated DEGs identified multiple enriched interferon signaling pathways through Reactome. Gene module analysis yielded 18 replicated gene modules in SLE patients, including 11 gene modules that were validated in GSE88887. Three distinct gene module clusters were defined i.e., “interferon/plasma cells”, “inflammation”, and “lymphocyte signaling”. Predominant downregulation of the lymphocyte signaling cluster denoted renal activity. By contrast, upregulation of interferon-related genes indicated hematological activity and vasculitis. Druggability analysis revealed several potential drugs interfering with dysregulated genes within the “interferon” and “PLK1 signaling events” modules. STAT1 was identified as the chief regulator in the most enriched signaling molecule network. Drugs annotated to 15 DEGs associated with cis-eQTLs included bortezomib for its ability to modulate CTSL activity. Belimumab was annotated to TNFSF13B (BAFF) and daratumumab was annotated to CD38 among the remaining replicated DEGs.
Conclusions
Modulation of interferon, STAT1, PLK1, B and plasma cell signatures showed promise as viable approaches to treat SLE, pointing to their importance in SLE pathogenesis.}

abstract = {Regulatory approvals of, and subsequent access to, innovative cardiovascular medications have declined. How much of this decline relates to the final step of gaining reimbursement for new treatments is unknown. Payers and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies look beyond efficacy and safety to assess whether a new drug improves patient outcomes, quality of life, or satisfaction at a cost that is affordable compared to existing treatments. HTA bodies work within a limited healthcare budget, and this is one of the reasons why only half of newly approved drugs are accepted for reimbursement, or receive restricted or “optimised” recommendations from HTA bodies. All stakeholders have the common goal of facilitating access to safe, effective, and affordable treatments to appropriate patients. An important strategy to expedite this is providing optimal data. This is demonstrably facilitated by early (and ongoing) discussions between all stakeholders. Many countries have formal programmes to provide collaborative regulatory and HTA advice to developers. Other strategies include aligning regulatory and HTA processes, increasing use of real-world evidence, formally defining the decision-making process, and educating stakeholders on the criteria for positive decision making. Industry should focus on developing treatments for unmet medical needs, seek early engagement with HTA and regulatory bodies, improve methodologies for optimal price setting, develop internal systems to collaborate with national and international stakeholders, and conduct post-approval studies. Patient involvement in all stages of development, including HTA, is critical to capture the lived experience and priorities of those whose lives will be impacted by new treatment approvals.}

Background
Islet transplantation represents an established therapeutic option for people with type 1 diabetes who have hypoglycemia unawareness syndrome and frequent problematic hypoglycemic episodes when other methods comprising diabetes education and use of technological support fail. Because the current standard method of islet infusion into the liver has some limitations, novel approaches are under investigation.
Methods
We report our first results with 2 cases of islet transplantation into an omental pouch using a biocompatible plasma-fibrin gel. The recipients received 12,350 and 5,350 islet equivalents per kilogram that were mixed with autologous plasma, seeded during a laparoscopic procedure on the omentum, overlaid with human thrombin solution, and fixed by flapping the omentum over.
Results
During a 9-month follow-up, neither patient experienced any moderate or severe hypoglycemia. Their glucose control significantly improved, insulin dose decreased by approximately 50%, and C-peptide at 1 year was 0.22 and 0.14 pmol/mL, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful, but C-peptide production in the first patient progressively declined at 1 year and hypoglycemic episodes recurred.
Conclusions
Though the results for these first 2 cases are not fully satisfactory, we have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and ability of this novel method to restore insulin production. Further refinements to improve immediate islet survival seem necessary.}

Otoscopy and otoendoscopy examinations are essential first steps in the evaluation of patients with otological diseases. Misdiagnosis often occurs when the doctor lacks experience in interpreting the results of otoscopy or otoendoscopy, leading to delays in treatment or complications. Using deep learning to process otoscopy images and developing otoscopic artificial-intelligence-based decision-making systems will become a significant trend in the future. However, the uneven quality of otoscopy images is among the major obstacles to development of such artificial intelligence systems, and no standardized process for data acquisition, and annotation of otoscopy images in intelligent medicine has yet been fully established. The standards for data storage and data management are unified with those of other specialties and are introduced in detail here. This expert recommendation criterion improved and standardized the collection and annotation procedures for otoscopy images and fills the current gap in otologic intelligent medicine; it would thus lay a solid foundation for the standardized collection, storage, and annotation of otoscopy images and the application of training algorithms, and promote the development of automatic diagnosis and treatment for otological diseases.

abstract = {Background and objective
Neonatal screening and early treatment have changed the natural history of PKU, preventing severe neurological and intellectual disability. Nevertheless, the outcome of the disease in early-treated adult patients (ETPKU) is less than optimal, the predictive value of metabolic biomarkers is feeble, and the recommended levels of blood phenylalanine (Phe) for adulthood are controversial. A crucial question whose answer will improve our understanding and treatment of PKU is whether cognitive outcomes can be modulated by levels of Phe even in early-treated adults. To address this question, we carried out an interventional study in seven ETPKU women planning a pregnancy.
Methods
They underwent an extensive neurocognitive assessment at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after having attained the blood Phe concentration recommended to prevent PKU fetopathy, but before pregnancy.
Results
After 3 and 6 months with a stable blood Phe level of about 240 μmol/L, all participants experienced significant improvements in almost all neurocognitive domains and tasks. IQ also increased of 11 to 21 points from the last assessment before enrolment. This pattern remained strong and consistent after correction for multiple comparisons.
Conclusion
Our results indicate that a) strong cognitive improvement is possible even in adulthood and may be demonstrated by lowering Phe near normal levels; b) testing cognition under different metabolic conditions may unveil an individual vulnerability to Phe. These results pave the way for personalised treatment of the disease in adults with ETPKU.}

In China, efforts to qualify innovative medical products for reimbursement used to be subject to substantial delays after regulatory approval due to fiscal and bureaucratic barriers. In this review, we surveyed the Chinese government’s most recent initiatives to improve access to innovative medicines from both the regulatory and the reimbursement aspects, which not only accelerated the launching of drugs in the Chinese market but also expanded the reimbursement coverage of such products. We also provided a discussion of the current challenges.
Areas Covered
We provided a comprehensive review of the updates in China’s national reimbursement listing policies of medicines.
Expert Opinion
As the most recognized regulatory shortcuts, priority and conditional approvals have expedited the authorization of many innovative medicines. In addition, the national negotiation process was institutionalized to enable timely access to innovative medicines through the National Reimbursement Drug List, leading examples of which were new anticancer drugs. Other impactful reimbursement policies in recent years included dynamic updates of the National Reimbursement Drug List, manufacturer-initiated reimbursement coverage applications, and parallel fund robustness tests and pharmacoeconomic analyses for price estimation. Recent administrative efforts have substantially improved the access to and affordability of innovative medicines in China. Nevertheless, standardized and transparent evidence appraisal processes need to be established for informed decision making in the future.}

Mutations in the IQSEC2 gene are associated with drug resistant epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism. Precision medicine based therapeutics to treat IQSEC2 associated epilepsy requires the development and characterization of mutation specific animal models. To date no EEG recordings have been presented for any mouse model of any IQSEC2 mutation showing seizures. In this study we characterize the seizures and EEG brain wave abnormalities present in mice with a A350V IQSEC2 missense mutation that is associated with drug resistant epilepsy in man. We show that seizures are associated with a greater than 40% mortality rate in male mice and occur exclusively from post-natal day 16–20. EEG recordings of mouse pups during this window demonstrate seizures and the presence of spikes with a marked increase in delta waves. EEG recordings in adult male mice have persistent excessive slow frequency activity and spikes, but seizures were not recorded. RNAseq analysis of the hippocampi of mice prior to the development of seizures demonstrated marked abnormalities in canonical pathways involved in synaptogenesis and dendritic maturation with the most prominently dysregulated gene being that for TRH suggesting a potential target for therapy given the previous demonstration of TRH to decrease seizures in several forms of drug resistant epilepsy.}

However, ethno-medicinal data must be recorded as soon as possible in order to preserve them and prevent extinction due to oral transmission, as well as to determine which remedies are still in use. Data was gathered from 70 informants (25 female and 45 male) through semi-structured interviews and group discussions. Informants were chosen at random or, in certain cases, using the snow-ball approach. To evaluate the gathered information, different ethnobotanical indices including UV, RFC, FL%, and ICF were used. Moreover, the information gathered in the current research work was contrasted with 22 different studies of aligned areas, including Pakistan. A total of 125 plant species used in herbal medicine were identified, which were distributed among 56 families and employed in 16 illness categories. Asteraceae (16 spp.) was the most used family in the area. The herbaceous life form was dominantly (66 spp., 53.65%) used in herbal preparation. The most commonly used part in herbal medicine was leaves (29.55%), and the most generally used method for preparing herbal recipes was extract (26.53%). The maximum ICF index value (0.92) was calculated for liver and digestive problems. The highest UV (0.92) was calculated for Berginia virgata. Olea ferruginea had the highest relative importance (100). Two plant species, Berberis lycium and Thymus surphylum, had 100% fidelity value. A high similarity was found with the study conducted on Devi Gali and Neelum valley with JI of 16.75 and 14.58. The plants with the highest levels of UV, RFC, RI, and FL would be examined for future pharmacological study in order to validate the findings and produce novel medications. Local residents have remained closer to nature due to their lack of communication with modern civilization. Despite the fact that they continued to employ medicinal plants in different herbal recipes, this tradition is on the verge of extinction since it is mostly retained by hakims, midwives, or the elderly people. The new generation is much less interested in traditional health practices due to advanced healthcare facilities and modern lifestyles.}

Current treatments for skin disorders include use of surgical sections phototherapy, systemic and topical medications; however, each of them is associated with certain limitations. Prominently, the ongoing therapeutic strategies have been reported to be present with adverse reactions, low efficacy and often, drug resistance complicates the disease status, emerging as one of the most diminishing situations. The emerging in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies indicate that herbal plants have been used for their immense potential against almost every kind of skin disorder. Importantly, the herbal plants were identified to contain alkaloids, phenolics, glycosides, terpenes, lignans, quinones, flavonoids, tannins, coumarins curcuminoids etc. Numerous herbal medicines and plant-derived products show promising credibility for the treatment and prevention in many skin disorders. The herbal medicines are of great interest due to their beneficial aspects in terms of safety, efficacy and fewer side effects. Interestingly, the herbal medicines and their bioactive ingredients have long been investigated for their antibacterial, anti-dermatophytic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and chemoprotective against melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, dermatophytosis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne.

Analyses of morphology and structure showed that well-crystalline p (L-Cys) on g-C3N4/GCE was successfully electropolymerized. Studying the electrochemical characteristics of p (L-Cys)/g-C3N4/GCE using CV and DPV techniques revealed a synergistic impact between g-C3N4 and l-cysteine that improved the stability and selectivity of the electrochemical oxidation of MTX while enhancing the electrochemical signal. Results showed that 7.5–780 μM was the linear range, and that 0.11841 μA/μM and 6 nM, respectively, were the sensitivity and limit of detection. The applicability of the suggested sensors was assessed using real pharmaceutical preparations, and the results showed that p (L-Cys)/g-C3N4/GCE had a high degree of precision. Five breast cancer patients who volunteered and provided prepared blood serum samples between the ages of 35 and 50 were used to examine the validity and accuracy of the proposed sensor in the current work for the determination of MTX. The results showed good recovery values (greater than 97.20%), appropriate accuracy (RSD less than 5.11%), and good agreement between the ELISA and DPV analysis results. These findings showed that p (L-Cys)/g-C3N4/GCE can be applied as a trustworthy MTX sensor for MTX level monitoring in blood samples and pharmaceutical samples.}

1. Upon completion, participants will self-report the ability to describe the impact of a telephonic palliative care program on a patient's quality of life 2. Upon completion, participants will self-report the different layers of support that a palliative care telephonic nurse program can apply to vulnerable populations (eg, seriously ill and older adults)
Research objective
The emergency department (ED) serves as the healthcare safety net for the most vulnerable older adults. Palliative care interventions in the ED can capture high-risk patients at a time of crisis and improve patient-centered outcomes. Nurse-led telephonic care is cost effective and more accessible to seriously ill patients than face-to-face outpatient palliative care encounters.
Study design
The Emergency Medicine Palliative Care Access (EMPallA) study is an ongoing PCORI-funded, multicenter, two-armed randomized trial comparing two models of palliative care for patients recruited from the ED: nurse-led telephonic case management and specialty outpatient palliative care. The study enrolled patients aged 50+ with serious life-limiting organ failure or advanced cancer from 19 participating EDs across the United States. Patients in the telephonic arm received weekly or biweekly calls by a palliative nurse over a 6-month period. Nurses completed an end of intervention implementation checklist at the 6-month time point reporting on advance care planning (ACP), caregiver-specific goals, and status (eg, vital, physical, functional health) of the patient at study completion.
Results
A total of 505 patients had completed checklists. 283 (56%) were female, 49 (10%) were Latinx, and 166 (33%) were Black. The median age was 66 years old. 245 patients (49%) completed all 6 months of the intervention, 173 (34%) withdrew or were lost to follow-up, and 31 (6%) enrolled in hospice within 6 months of enrollment. 210 (43%) completed ACP and named a healthcare proxy.
Conclusions
Nurse-led telephonic care for vulnerable, seriously ill patients recruited from the ED was successful in engaging patients and completing ACP. Telephonic palliative nursing may influence a patient's quality of life through an additional layer of supportive, accessible care among multiple vulnerable populations, indicating a continued need for such initiatives.}

abstract = {Outcomes
1. Define narrative competence and analyze its role in direct patient care and as part of a hospice and palliative care practice. 2. Evaluate the impact of incorporating narrative training into a palliative medicine fellowship curriculum.
Background
Narrative medical practice is the ability to recognize, absorb, metabolize, interpret, and be moved by patients’ stories of illness. Narrative competence includes skills of attention, representation, and affiliation. Being attuned to patients’ experiences, effectively interpreting stories of illness, and reflective practice enhance clinical effectiveness.
Methods
A narrative medicine (NM) series was incorporated into HPM fellowship. Fellows participated in 3 to 4 sessions which included (1) didactic principles/practices, (2) close examination of text, (3) reflective writing, and (4) dialogue with peers and faculty. HPM physician faculty completed coursework at the program in narrative medicine at Columbia University and series curriculum was informed by that program's teaching. Fellows completed pre and post 4-point Likert-style surveys.
Results
Pre- and postintervention surveys (n=36) were administered to 20 HPM fellows. Four surveys were missing due to absences. Pre- and postintervention, fellows reported high responses to (1) importance of eliciting patient's story (μ=3.94, 4), (2) enjoying patients’ stories (μ=3.72, 3.83), and (3) openness to learning narrative skills (μ=3.83, 3.94). Postintervention, fellows reported significant increases in NM knowledge (μ=2.17, 3.72, p = <0.01) and confidence in ability to successfully elicit and appreciate a patient's story (μ=2.22, 3.39, p = <0.01).
Discussion
The pre and post high levels of value, enjoyment, and interest in narrative skills may represent selection bias in this cohort of HPM fellows. Post surveys indicated a significant increase in perceived understanding of NM and possession of narrative skills, which may be due to the intervention or other components of HPM training. Results support the potential benefits of a NM curriculum within an HPM fellowship related to skills required to conduct a comprehensive palliative assessment.
Conclusion
Integration of an educational NM series was associated with a significant increase in narrative knowledge and competence and may be a meaningful curricular component of HPM fellowship training.}

author = {François René {de Cotret}},
abstract = {Background
Interpreters facilitate cross-cultural communication. The effectiveness of the process depends, among other things, on the ability of the interpreter and the clinician to collaborate, which the Typology of Healthcare Interpreter Positionings is intended to facilitate. The Typology was developed based on the experience of mental health providers. It includes 17 positionings, organized into four types.
Purpose
The primary purpose of this study was to assess the applicability potential of the Typology in family medicine settings. It also included two secondary purpose. The first was to assess the effect that lesser (physician in training) and greater (physician) clinical experience may have on the potential for use. The second was to verify the complementarity of the Typology with the concept of the role of the interpreters.
Method
A deductive thematic analysis and co-occurrence analyses were conducted following 15 focus groups about working with interpreters with 89 experienced (n=47) and trainee family physicians (n=42).
Findings
The applicability potential for family physicians is confirmed. The majority of participants' responses referred to one or the other of the four types of positioning. The vast majority of positionings (13/17) were addressed. Junior clinicians addressed slightly fewer positionings. The concept of role was found to be complementary but could not be integrated into the Typology on the basis of the results obtained.
Discussion
The participants' expectations of the interpreter were similar to those of the participants in the original study: the discourses of both groups of participants contained the conceptual underpinnings of the Typology. The participants were also not looking for the interpreter to be removed from the interaction, but rather to be positioned in a way that consolidate communication. This finding also applies to junior clinicians. The results suggest that this tool has as much potential for use in family medicine as in mental health.}

Background
Less than half of medical school professorships and decanal ranks are held by women. Our study investigates the gender-based geographical distribution and differences in lifetime peer-reviewed publications, H-index, and grant funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of all allopathic medical school deans in the United States (US).
Methods
A cross-sectional cohort study utilizing data from US allopathic medical school websites, PubMed, and the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools regarding lifetime peer-reviewed publications and quantity/monetary sum of NIH grants received by medical school deans. Descriptive statistics, independent sample T-tests, and ANOVA were performed with statistical significance defined as P < 0.05.
Results
Women occupied 33/157 (21.0%) dean positions overall. Compared to women, men possess higher mean number of lifetime peer-reviewed publications (112.0 vs. 55.2, P = 0.001) and H-index (43.2 vs. 25.7, P = 0.001); however, there are no differences in the mean number of NIH grants (27.5 vs. 19.1, P = 0.323) nor mean total NIH funding received ($18,931,336 vs. $14,289,529, P = 0.524). While significant differences in mean H-index between all US regions were found (P = 0.002), no significant differences exist between major US regions regarding the mean lifetime publication count (P = 0.223), NIH grants received (P = 0.200), nor total NIH funding (P = 0.824) received.
Conclusion
A significant discrepancy in the gender distribution, lifetime peer-reviewed publications, and H-index of allopathic medical school deans exists across the US, highlighting the need for adequate support for women in academic medicine. Greater implementation of mentorship, increased institutional support, and diversity training can improve the representation of women in medical school decanal positions.}

However, the underlying therapeutic mechanisms of GRGM for acetaminophen-induced liver injury (APAP) are still unknown. The preventive impact of GRGM on APAP-induced drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and its protective mechanism were examined in this work. The core targets and signaling pathways of GRGM in the treatment of DILI were explored by network pharmacology strategy. Histopathological and biochemical indices were used to confirm the therapeutic effect of GRGM. Metabolomics strategy was used to explore the plasma metabolic spectrum of rats, and the potential biomarkers were annotated and clustering analyzed. The results of network pharmacology analysis showed that AKT1, TNF, EGFR, ESR1, CCND1 and SRC may be important targets of GRGM for the treatment of DILI, and that GRGM may decrease the inflammatory response and oxidative stress by acting on many targets. Histopathological results showed that GRGM could create complete liver cells that showed an orderly formation and inhibited the inflammation. The results of the biochemical indices showed that GRGM could inhibit the expression of ALT, AST, TNF-α and TGF-β1. The DILI process was linked to 21 different metabolites, with a majority of which involved in the Glycosyl phosphidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis and the glycophyte metabolism pathway. This study speculated that GRGM might have various protective effects on DILI through multi-components, multi-targets and multi-pathways. Metabolomics showed that GRGM could play a therapeutic role by interfering with the metabolic characteristics of DILI rats. The present work might provide a new insights into the relationships between GRGM and APAP-induced DILI.}

The greatest limiting factor is probably equipment compatibility due to the small size of most amphibians. In recent years, the development of multimodal techniques and application of optical imaging may be the new frontier of medical imaging. It is actually possible to obtain physiological and pathophysiological measurements within an accurate anatomical framework, even in very small animals.}

Advanced techniques are aimed at facilitating changes in behaviour and include coaching, mentoring and motivational interviewing. The focus is on the complexities of the chronic pain presentation and a variety of potential challenges in a consultation are explored. Example scenarios are used to illustrate how aspects of each specific communication skill might be useful to prevent avoidable distress, diffuse anger and engender change. The expectation is that anaesthetists who communicate well will help patients to make informed decisions and empower them to take steps to optimise their own pain management.}

To treat pleural effusion appropriately, it is important to determine its etiology; which however, remains unclear in nearly 20% of cases.A 73-year-old man with a history of invasive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), had been experiencing chest congestion and dyspnea with undiagnosed pleural effusion for six years. After a series of clinical examination and laboratory tests, there was still no clear diagnosis. Despite administering diuretics and intermittent draining, the patient's condition aggravated progressively. He sought further treatment at Dongzhimen Hospital Respiratory Outpatient Clinic. The patient was treated with Zanthoxylum and Trichosanthes Decoction (Jiao Mu Gua Lou Tang). After one and a half years, his symptoms greatly improved and ultrasound revealed that the pleural effusion had apparently absorbed.It is suggested that TCM herbal formulas can play a critical role in preventing the progression of complicated, undiagnosed pleural effusion, especially in cases of poor response to conventional therapy and thoracentesis. Additional studies on the functions and mechanisms of the medicinals are warranted.}

Three dimensions make up the meta-leadership model: the person, the situation, and connectivity. These address the need for leader cognitive and emotional grounding, accurate situational awareness and insight, and robust formal and informal connections across the response enterprise, respectively. The scholarly foundation for each dimension is explored along with tools and techniques for effective practice. As role models, leaders integrate the dimensions in practice to create the conditions for “swarm” leadership that fosters unity of effort and action, clarity of roles and responsibilities, generosity across inter- and intraorganizational boundaries, and prosocial attitudes and behaviors.}

For this purpose, herbal biochar preparation by low-temperature pyrolysis and its application as soil amendment is designed, and the integrated effects are assessed by a combined techno-economic, exergy, thermoeconomic and life cycle analyses based on the accounting of material flow, energy flow and environmental flow. Firstly, the economic benefits (i.e., net present value, internal rate of return and payback period) of the system is analyzed by combination of cost-benefit method and sensitivity analysis. Secondly, exergy analysis determines exergy destruction, exergy destruction ratio, exergy destruction coefficient, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of pyrolysis system. Furthermore, by combining techno-economic and exergy analyses, exergy destruction cost and exergy economic coefficient are calculated to optimize pyrolysis system. Thirdly, the CO2 mitigation cost, carbon neutrality potential and environmental impact are evaluated via combining life cycle assessment with techno-economic and exergy analyses. The results indicate that the higher pyrolysis temperature shows preferable exergy efficiency, energy efficiency and thermodynamic performance. From 400 to 600 °C, herbal biochar preparation and its application can improve economic benefits by 12.9–15%. At 550 °C, such TCMR disposal process can reduce environmental impact to −8651.65 mPts, and the GHG emissions and CO2 mitigation cost of the life cycle process are 395.1 kg CO2-eq/t feedstock and 63.4 CNY/t CO2-eq, respectively. In general, herbal biochar preparation by low-temperature pyrolysis and related application as soil amendment can realize the carbon-negative disposal of TCMR by an economical and efficient way.}

abstract = {Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a significant clinical challenge, with complex genetic heterogeneity that underlies the variable patient response to existing treatment modalities. While molecular features and novel therapeutic options offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is often compromised by inter-patient and intra-leukemia variability, coupled with an overall lack of biomarkers that can reliably inform therapeutic benefit. Consequently, these therapies yield clinical responses limited to only a subset of patients. Predicting a patient's response before initiating therapy optimizes treatment selection by improving the benefit/risk ratio (therapeutic index) and increasing response rates. This helps avoid treating non-responding patients, thereby reducing the occurrence of adverse effects and minimizing the costs associated with ineffective care. Here, we present an actionable strategy in AML that employs an automated, high-throughput, multi-color flow cytometry-based predictive precision medicine platform (PPMP) offering a genetic biomarker-agnostic approach to identify responders to standard-of-care (SOC) treatments and the polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) inhibitor volasertib. Clinical validation of the PPMP To date, we have conducted four studies evaluating the PPMP's predictive performance in myelodysplastic syndromes, adult AML, and pediatric AML with several SOC agents. For all studies, pre-induction blood or bone marrow samples were collected from patients then ex vivo treatment responses of individual leukemic cells were assessed using multi-color flow cytometry. The results were validated with the patient's actual clinical response as reported by physicians and indicated high precision-with positive predictive values (PPVs) of 83-100%. These findings help establish a PPMP-based pursuit of investigational therapies to enhance their therapeutic utility in distinct response groups. Case study: Volasertib One application of this approach involves the revival of volasertib, a PLK-1 inhibitor with demonstrated activity in AML, that was discontinued by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) after failing its Phase 3 study. A BI Phase 2 study showed volasertib combined with low-dose cytarabine (V+LDAC) delivered a complete response (CR) + CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rate of 31.0% compared to 13.3% from LDAC monotherapy, and higher overall survival (OS). Similarly, in a global Phase 3 study a CR + CRi rate for V+LDAC (27.7% overall response) compared to Placebo+LDAC (17.1%) was reported. However, the Phase 3 study showed a higher frequency of fatal events with V+LDAC, especially in non-responders, resulting in lower median OS. By accurately pinpointing clinical responders, the integration of PPMP aims to identify those patients deriving clinical benefit (CR or CRi) from volasertib. Clinical trial design We plan on initiating a Phase 2a single-arm, open-label clinical trial in AML with volasertib in Ven-HMA relapsed or refractory patients, while co-developing PPMP as a companion diagnostic to selectively enroll predicted responders in a follow-up Phase 2b study (Figure 1). Intially, 20-30 patients will be enrolled. Once sufficient responders are achieved and certain performance thresholds of the drug sensitivity platform are met, an additional 20-30 patients will be enrolled, utilizing the companion diagnostic to selectively enroll predicted responders. The primary objectives will be focused on efficacy and safety of intravenous volasertib (possibly in combination with another drug) in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Secondary objectives will include ex vivo response data collection to optimize the diagnostic parameters for the Phase 2b study. Primary Phase 2a endpoints include AML disease response assessment per pre-specified criteria. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the diagnostic performance characteristic of Notable's drug sensitivity score in predicting in vivo volasertib clinical response. Specific strategies, including tailored dosing, robust infection control, and carefully selecting drug combination partners are designed to mitigate the adverse events observed in BI's Phase 3 trial and maximize volasertib's therapeutic impact regarding both efficacy and safety.}

Neuroprotective Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced in alternative medicine from early days. TCM-derived neuroprotective compounds, such as Chrysin, Cannabidiol, Toonasinoids, and β-asaron, exert significant effectiveness's towards Parkinson's disease (PD). Further, these neuroprotective TCM showed antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-septic, analgesic properties. Recent research showed that the reduction in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased the α-synuclein (α-syn) toxicity and enhanced the dopaminergic neuron regenerations, the main hallmarks of PD. Therefore, the neuroprotective effects of novel TCM due to its antiradical activities needed deep investigations.
Aims of the study
This review aims to enlighten the neuroprotective TCM and its components with their antioxidative properties to the scientific community for future research.
Method
The relevant information on the neuroprotective TCM was gathered from scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Wiley Online Library, ACS Publications, and CNKI). Information was also gained from MS and Ph.D. thesis, books, and online databases. The literature cited in this review dates from 2001 to June 2, 0201.
Results
Novel therapies for PD are accessible, mostly rely on Rivastigmine and Donepezil, offers to slow down the progression of disease at an early stage but embraces lots of disadvantages. Researchers are trying to find a potential drug against PD, which is proficient at preventing or curing the disease progress, but still needed to be further identified. Oxidative insult and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be the main culprit of neurodegenerations. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the only causative agent in all interactions, leading to PD, from mitochondrial dysfunctions, α-syn aggregative toxicity, and DA neurons degenerations. It is evident from the redox balance, which seems an imperative therapeutic approach against PD and was necessary for the significant neuronal activities.
Conclusion
Our study is explaining the newly discovered TCM and their neuroprotective and antioxidative properties. But also bring up the possible treatment approaches against PD for future researchers.}

Methods
Spine Intervention Society’s guidelines for assessing studies on the treatment of pain were applied to a published cost-effectiveness analysis of radiofrequency denervation data from the MINT RCTs.
Results
Application of evidence-based medicine principles reveals the MINT RCTs’ major deficiencies in patient selection, diagnostic paradigm, radiofrequency neurotomy technique, co-interventions, outcome measurement, power analysis study sample characteristics, data analysis, and loss to follow-up; which marginalizes the generalizability and conclusions of the cost-effectiveness analysis.
Conclusions
The cost analysis performed in “Cost-Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Denervation for Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: The MINT Randomized Clinical Trials” is based on the MINT RCTs results. The MINT RCTs significant metholodological design flaws, lead to issues in validty for the subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis. Application of the cost-effective analysis to patient care paradigms should be limited given the concerns with validity.}

Background
Many individuals take long-term immunosuppressive medications. We evaluated whether these individuals have worse outcomes when hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with non-immunosuppressed individuals.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), the largest longitudinal electronic health record repository of patients in hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the USA, between Jan 1, 2020, and June 11, 2021, within 42 health systems. We compared adults with immunosuppressive medications used before admission to adults without long-term immunosuppression. We considered immunosuppression overall, as well as by 15 classes of medication and three broad indications for immunosuppressive medicines. We used Fine and Gray's proportional subdistribution hazards models to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation, with the competing risk of death. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs for in-hospital death. Models were adjusted using doubly robust propensity score methodology.
Findings
Among 231 830 potentially eligible adults in the N3C repository who were admitted to hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 during the study period, 222 575 met the inclusion criteria (mean age 59 years [SD 19]; 111 269 [50%] male). The most common comorbidities were diabetes (23%), pulmonary disease (17%), and renal disease (13%). 16 494 (7%) patients had long-term immunosuppression with medications for diverse conditions, including rheumatological disease (33%), solid organ transplant (26%), or cancer (22%). In the propensity score matched cohort (including 12 841 immunosuppressed patients and 29 386 non-immunosuppressed patients), immunosuppression was associated with a reduced risk of invasive ventilation (HR 0·89, 95% CI 0·83–0·96) and there was no overall association between long-term immunosuppression and the risk of in-hospital death. None of the 15 medication classes examined were associated with an increased risk of invasive mechanical ventilation. Although there was no statistically significant association between most drugs and in-hospital death, increases were found with rituximab for rheumatological disease (1·72, 1·10–2·69) and for cancer (2·57, 1·86–3·56). Results were generally consistent across subgroup analyses that considered race and ethnicity or sex, as well as across sensitivity analyses that varied exposure, covariate, and outcome definitions.
Interpretation
Among this cohort, with the exception of rituximab, there was no increased risk of mechanical ventilation or in-hospital death for the rheumatological, antineoplastic, or antimetabolite therapies examined.
Funding
None.}

abstract = {Background There is emerging evidence that whole genome sequencing (WGS) can benefit children with hematological malignancies, even when compared to extensive molecular assays. However, studies have been restricted to selected patient groups, and so there is a need to evaluate the feasibility and impact of WGS delivered as part of children's routine care. In England, following the 100k genome project, since early 2021 paired germline and tumor WGS has been made available to all children with a suspected malignancy via the nationalized Genomic Medicine Service. We set out to assess the real world impact of routine WGS, where sequential unselected children were sequenced, and results were used in clinical practice. Methods Clinical and diagnostic information was collected from all patients presenting to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) hematology department over a 2-year period. WGS findings were superimposed onto the center's standard of care (SOC) and WGS impact was evaluated. Results Between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2022, 152 children with new diagnoses or relapsed disease had paired WGS, with an uptake rate of 83% (76/92) in the first year and (79/83) 95% in the second. Barriers to recruitment were clinicians not offering WGS (n=16) in year 1, and early death (n=2) or parents declining consent (n=2) in year 2. WGS was performed for all 20 diseases that were treated (Figure 1). Importantly, WGS matched all SOC findings by other genetic tests, including targeted DNA high throughput sequencing (HTS) and RNA-fusion panels. WGS revealed additional oncogenic drivers in 79/152 (52%) of patients, compared to all other genomic tests (including HTS and RNA-fusion panels). WGS aided diagnosis in 11% (17/152) of cases through picking up a novel lesion that defined the child's malignancy, and for 7% (10/152) of patients, it was able to place them into a new formal cytogenetic risk category. In 25/152 (17%) cases care was changed solely because of WGS (Figure 2), with a similar rate in year 1 (14%) and 2 (17%). In 3 cases of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) diagnostic testing failed to reveal a risk-defining lesion but WGS identified good risk variants (ETV6-RUNX1 and High Hyperdiploidy) allowing de-escalation of chemotherapy. IGH-DUX4 re-arrangements, solely picked up by WGS in 2 cases of B-ALL, led to 1 child not receiving escalated chemotherapy. In a child presenting with mixed phenotype leukemia, WGS alone revealed a KMT2A-USP2 fusion, which directed therapy, as well as providing an MRD marker. In 12 patients presenting with marrow failure (subsequently diagnosed with aplastic anemia or MDS), WGS was prioritized with a median turnaround time of 2 weeks. WGS was able to give an accelerated diagnosis, facilitating timely therapy. 9 children were found to have pathogenic germline variants. This included 2 cases of an accelerated diagnosis of expected mutations (e.g. an SBDS mutation). Other unexpected germline mutations (e.g. a TP53 mutation presenting with leukemia, and an incidental PMS2 mutation in the context of aplastic anemia), led to cascade testing for patients and their families, and tailored surveillance programs. WGS made 9 children eligible for novel therapeutics, including patients found to have a RAS pathway mutation solely by WGS, and patients who were hypermutated. Conclusion WGS can successfully be delivered as a nationalized genomics medicine service, for all children with suspected hematological malignancies. WGS can match conventional and advanced genomic diagnostics in a single assay, with obvious economic benefits of test consolidation. Beyond this, it delivers additional germline and somatic findings that aid diagnosis, offer therapeutic opportunities, and tangibly change the care patients and families receive. WGS has the additional benefit of future proofing diagnostic and research capabilities, as over time analysis pipelines can be modified and new variants added. For all children presenting with marrow failure, WGS was practice changing, providing all necessary read-outs, and facilitating timely therapy. In the case of the most common childhood malignancy, ALL, one test can replace all diagnostics, including IG/TCR MRD marker screening and pharmacogenomics for TPMT/NUDT15. With continued improvements in turnaround time, and reducing costs, we propose that WGS could feasibly replace multiple molecular diagnostic tests for pediatric hematological malignancies.}

abstract = {Background
Liver cancer (LCa) is one of the most common malignancies. Western medicine is the main treatment strategy of LCa, but it has not achieved the ideal therapeutic effect. Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) have a wide range of biological effects, lots of evidence suggests that they may kill tumors by regulating the tumor microenvironment and enhancing the immune system.
Object
The purpose of this research is to explore the medication rules of TCMs in treating LCa and excavate the potential TCMs for LCa.
Methods
We combined genes associated with the MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR signaling pathways, as well as differentially expressed genes of LCa from the TCGA database, to determine 12 prospective core targets by building a prognostic model. We added 18 previously published LCa core targets to create a list of key targets. GO and KEGG analyses were used to validate the rationality of the key targets. The reliability of the corresponding relationships between targets and compounds was verified by molecular docking. The targets-compounds-herbs network was constructed and topologically analyzed to obtain potential herbs for LCa. The nature, flavor and meridian tropism of the herbs were analyzed to explore the rule of TCMs in the treatment of LCa.
Results
We obtained 30 potential targets including BRCA1, STMN1, MECOM, ITGB5 and SKP2. A total of 115 candidate compounds including resveratrol, quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, estradiol and curcumin, and 1182 candidate herbs, including Jinyinhua, Gouguye, Tufuling, Huzhang, Jishiteng, Nvzhenzi, Sangbaipi and Qianhu were obtained. The vast majority of LCa's core targets, compounds and herbs we obtained have been verified by previous studies. Among the potential herbs, the categories of clearing heat and detoxifying, activating blood and dissolving stasis, and strengthening the spleen and benefiting the qi accounted for a high percentage. The herbs against LCa are mainly bitter, pungent, sweet in flavor, warm, cold, and mild in nature, and are mainly distributed in the liver, stomach, and lung meridians.
Conclusions
Some of the potential herbs we obtained like Jinyinhua, Gouguye, Tufuling, Huzhang and Qianhu have been proved to be effective for LCa, while some of them like Jishiteng, Nvzhenzi and Sangbaipi have been shown to have a protective effect on the liver. The potential herbs have not been widely and deeply used and need to be further explored. The combination of network pharmacology and data mining provides novel approaches to the screening and exploitation of TCM.}

To evaluate the impact of ACRM Diversity Complementary Integrative Rehabilitation Medicine(DCIRM) Mentoring & Career Development Fellowship Program(2021) on selected scholarship activities.
Design
Cross-sectional and longitudinal survey analysis.
Setting
A remotely delivered workshop with a focus on Complementary Integrative Rehabilitation Medicine (CIRM) followed by remote mentoring and scholarship activities from September 2021 to September 2022.
Participants
Early career allied health professionals from diverse backgrounds.
Interventions
N/A.
Main Outcome Measures
A project specific, non-standardized survey was designed to evaluate participants’ engagement in the remote workshop program. Scholarship components related to research productivity, networking, mentor support and collaborations were evaluated.
Results
A total of 35 participants were included in the workshop. Most participants were from USA (23.5%) and female(77 %). Other countries included Malaysia and India. Over 50% were Asian. 62% of participants had less than 5 years of clinical and/or research training. Majority of participants reported benefitting from the workshop, shared peer experiences, networking, mentors, grants, and research. In an informal survey, participants mentioned that the fellowship program helped “By providing us opportunities to explore research and facilitate growth as leaders in academia”. They also expressed that the workshop strengthened their research abilities. Common themes among participants were high satisfaction with the friendly environment, high camaraderie among workshop participants and mentors. The one-year follow-up survey results will be further discussed in this scientific paper.
Conclusions
Designing and implementing inclusive training that addresses the unmet needs of a diversified, well-prepared biomedical workforce in CIRM is feasible and can have a positive impact on early career development of researchers from diverse backgrounds. The ACRM DCIRM Mentoring & Career Development Fellowship Program was supported by an NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) grant. Preliminary survey data indicates that participants benefitted from this fellowship program, which aligns with NIH NCCIH priorities to facilitate inclusion of individuals from URM. It's important to perform a post completion longitudinal survey assessing the benefits and drawbacks of this program and tracking the effects of program activities on participant's career developments.

abstract = {Objective
Guidance for preventing myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke by tailoring treatment for individual patients with atherosclerosis is an unmet need. Such development may be possible with computational modeling. Given the multifactorial biology of atherosclerosis, modeling must be based on complete biological networks that capture protein-protein interactions estimated to drive disease progression. Here, we aimed to develop a clinically relevant scale model of atherosclerosis, calibrate it with individual patient data, and use it to simulate optimized pharmacotherapy for individual patients.
Approach and results
The study used a uniquely constituted plaque proteomic dataset to create a comprehensive systems biology disease model for simulating individualized responses to pharmacotherapy. Plaque tissue was collected from 18 patients with 6735 proteins at two locations per patient. 113 pathways were identified and included in the systems biology model of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and the integrated intima, altogether spanning 4411 proteins, demonstrating a range of 39–96% plaque instability. After calibrating the systems biology models for individual patients, we simulated intensive lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic drugs. We also simulated a combination therapy. Drug response was evaluated as the degree of change in plaque stability, where an improvement was defined as a reduction of plaque instability. In patients with initially unstable lesions, simulated responses varied from high (20%, on combination therapy) to marginal improvement, whereas patients with initially stable plaques showed generally less improvement.
Conclusion
In this pilot study, proteomics-based system biology modeling was shown to simulate drug response based on atherosclerotic plaque instability with a power of 90%, providing a potential strategy for improved personalized management of patients with cardiovascular disease.}

Here we describe the process for rigorous prospective evaluation of this hypothesis in a formal national proof-of-concept program for epitope-based matching. This encompasses broad societal consultation to engage the public, patients and providers; the development of clear allocation policies with strategies to support candidates who may be difficult to match; molecular and sequencing methods and web-based calculators enabling rapid epitope typing and recipient selection; precise immunological monitoring of the graft response; information systems permitting real-time monitoring of clinical outcomes; and assessment of health benefit and economic cost. The results of this objective evaluation can then be provided to payers and policy-makers for review, and adoption if of proven benefit.}

On 22 November 2021, a marketing authorization valid through the European Union (EU) was issued under the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s accelerated assessment program for SG as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received two or more prior systemic therapies, including at least one of them for advanced disease. The assessment was based on results from an open-label, randomized, phase III trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SG versus treatment of physician’s choice (TPC) in patients with mTNBC who received at least two prior treatments including at least one of them for advanced disease. The efficacy results in the overall population, based on mature data, showed a statistically significant improvement of SG over TPC in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The median PFS was 4.8 months versus 1.7 months [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.43, n = 529; 95% CI 0.35-0.54; P < 0.0001] and the median OS was 11.8 months versus 6.9 months (HR = 0.51, n = 529; 95% CI 0.41-0.62; P < 0.0001). The most common (>30%) side effects of SG were diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, alopecia, anemia, constipation and vomiting. The aim of this manuscript is to summarize the scientific review of the application leading to regulatory approval in the EU.}

For a significant duration, enhancing the efficacy of cancer therapy has remained a critical concern. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), often likened to micro-robots, hold substantial promise as a drug delivery system. MTB, classified as anaerobic, aquatic, and gram-negative microorganisms, exhibit remarkable motility and precise control over their internal biomineralization processes. This unique ability results in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles arranged along filamentous structures in a catenary fashion, enclosed within a membrane. These bacteria possess distinctive biochemical properties that facilitate their precise positioning within complex environments. By harnessing these biochemical attributes, MTB could potentially offer substantial advantages in the realm of cancer therapy. This article reviews the drug delivery capabilities of MTB in tumor treatment and explores various applications based on their inherent properties. The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of MTB-driven drug delivery and stimulate innovative insights in this field.}

Our canine companions share many similarities to human disease, particularly cancer. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology, we are beginning to unravel the complexity of cancer and the vast intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity that makes treatment difficult. Consequently, precision medicine has emerged as a therapeutic approach to improve patient survival by evaluating and classifying an individual tumor's molecular profile. Many canine and human cancers share striking similarities in terms of genotypic, phenotypic, clinical, and histological presentations. Dogs are superior to rodent models of cancer because they are a naturally heterogeneous population in which tumors occur spontaneously, are exposed to similar environmental conditions, and show more similarities in key modulators of tumorigenesis and clinical response, including the immune system, drug metabolism, and gut microbiome. In this chapter, we will explore various canine models of human cancers and emphasize the dog's critical role in advancing precision medicine and improving the survival of both man and man's best friend.}

Taking on this role for families requires a great deal of time and strategic emotional labor. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 12 physicians across two different children's hospitals on the east coast, I find that these physicians conceptualize this work as a fundamental responsibility to the children and families in their care despite believing that their formal medical training fails to prepare them for this component of their jobs. These physicians deliberately laid groundwork for the potential that children may die from their earliest interactions with patients and worked to shift families away from continued medical intervention when they believed such efforts to be futile. They described this work as deeply meaningful and rewarding, but potentially emotionally overwhelming. These physicians felt duty-bound to address what they perceived as a deficit in medical training by intentionally modeling emotionally intense exchanges with families for the next generation of practitioners. Though these dual commitments demanded extensive and potentially exhausting emotional labor, this particular group of physicians was able to use the structural features of their faculty positions in academic medical centers to buffer against potential burnout, maintain their emotional capacity at work and home, and protect their own well-being. My analysis shows that when physicians inhabit structurally favorable working conditions and conceptualize their jobs in ways that center emotional support for patients they may use these resources to work to mitigate disparities in care and take pride in their ability to provide sustained and substantive emotional support at the end of life.}

Blood samples were prepared using the protein precipitation method and atazanavir was selected as the internal standard (IS). Separation was performed on an Agilent ZORBAX eclipse plus C18 (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) column using acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase for gradient elution. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min and the injection volume was 2 μL. Agilent Jet Stream electrospray ionization was used for mass spectrometry detection under positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode at a transition of m/z 629.3→447.3 for lopinavir, m/z 721.3→296.1 for ritonavir, and m/z 705.4→168.1 for the IS. The method showed good linearity in the concentration range of 25–2500 ng/mL (r=0.9981) for lopinavir and 5–500 ng/mL (r=0.9984) for ritonavir. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were both within ±15%. Items, such as dilution reliability and residual effect, were also within the acceptable limits. The method was used to determine the effects of five types of traditional Chinese medicines on the pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir in rats. The pharmacokinetic results showed that the half-life of ritonavir in the groups administered Lianhua Qingwen granules and Huoxiang Zhengqi capsules combined with lopinavir/ritonavir was prolonged by approximately 1.5- to 2-fold relative to that in the control group. Similarly, the pharmacokinetic parameters of lopinavir were altered. Overall, the results of this study offer important theoretical parameters for the effective clinical use of five types of traditional Chinese medicines combined with lopinavir/ritonavir to reduce the occurrence of clinical adverse reactions.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Shouhui tongbian capsule (SHTC) is a commercial Chinese patent medicine used in the treatment of constipation. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Aim of the study: The present study was undertaken to assess SHTC relieved effects on the clinical symptoms of loperamide (LOP) induced constipation in Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model and to clarify the relationship between the protective effect of SHTC on constipation and the gut microbiota.
Materials and methods
Constipation male SD rats models were induced with solution of LOP (1.5 mg/kg bw), and rats were treated with an oral dose of SHTC (35, 70 mg/kg bw) three times a day after successful modeling. All rats were assessed weekly by change in body weight, gastric emptying rate, fecal moisture content and wet/dry weight. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were used to observe parts of the rats small intestine. The gut microbiota in colonic contents was analyzed using 16SrRNA gene sequencing. Contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS).
Results
The results confirmed the therapeutic effects of SHTC on constipation. Specifically, SHTC could alleviate the decrease in body weight, gastric emptying rate and fecal moisture content caused by LOP-induced constipation. The pathological damage of small intestine was significantly improved by H&E staining. Notably, SHTC increased the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides (F/B). In addition, the content of acetic acid and propionic acid was significantly increased in constipated rats fed with SHTC.
Conclusion
SHTC could ameliorate the development of LOP-induced constipation in rats by remodeling the structure of gut microbial community and regulating production of intestinal metabolites.}
