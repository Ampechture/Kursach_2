abstract = {ABSTRACT
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) are common morbidities in the elderly, which are both chronic, progressive and often concomitant diseases. Several studies revealed that DM increases the risk of developing severe CAS, yet clear information about the relationship between both these diseases and the influence of DM on the progression of CAS is currently lacking. To evaluate the effect of DM on aortic valves and on the process of calcification, and to achieve better patient management in daily clinical practice, we analysed calcified and noncalcified valve tissue from patients with severe CAS, with or without DM. A proteomic strategy using isobaric tags was adopted and the plasma concentrations of nine proteins were studied using 3 orthogonal methods and in a separate cell model. The differentially expressed proteins identified are implicated in biological processes like endopeptidase activity, lipid metabolism, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. The results obtained provide evidence that DM provokes changes in the proteome of aortic valves, affecting valve calcification. This finding may help enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of CAS and how DM affects the evolution of this condition, an important step in identifying targets to personalize the treatment of these patients.}

Dietary habits are unanimously considered relevant to the patient's health, particularly in chronic conditions. This article reports the differences in where and how dietary advice is occasioned and co-constructed by participants in two settings. One significant finding of this paper is that while Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors take dietary talk to instruct patients and put it into the treatment recommendation, WM doctors may treat it as incidental and only valuable for diagnostic assessment, leaving its treatment opaque and not discussed with the patient. Data are in Mandarin Chinese. Using Conversation Analysis, the article describes the interactional organisation of dietary advice delivery in different medical practices and ascribes their differences to clinical pathology.}

abstract = {In sports medicine and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions, training, knowledge and expertise of clinicians are the guarantors of good clinical practice. But are they really? Since the 1970s, a growing body of sociological and behavioral science has developed the concepts of cognitive biases and thinking errors. In a nutshell, it tries to explain how we approach decision-making using shortcuts, or heuristics. Our brains will alternatively use 2 systems to think and decide: system 1 is fast, intuitive and emotional, whereas system 2 is slow, logical and conscious. We may think clinicians use the latter systematically, but they actually use system 1 in many situations. Whether due to intrinsic thinking errors or external forces that cloud our judgment, we are under unconscious influences and so are all the stakeholders in the rehabilitation setting, including the patient/athlete. We present some of the most prevalent biases that pervade clinical decision-making and attempt to give a bit of background context starting from the typical tension between academic authority and personal experience. The field of sports performance is also riddled with beliefs, egocentrism and a general tendency to search for magic bullets that will bring the marginal gains and edge over the competition. This plays into the rehabilitation of patient-athletes in different ways. Finally, there are ways to mitigate the effect of cognitive biases to improve decision-making. This must include better communication, shared decisions and ultimately the understanding that we should drive our profession to deliver high-value care tailored to the patients, in line with the best evidence at the best possible cost. Hopefully, we can shed some light without too many of our own biases on the complexities of thinking in sports medicine and rehabilitation.}

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the clinical efficacy of TCM medicine in the treatment for COVID-19. We obtained the data of COVID-19 and traditional Chinese medicine from PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and other databases, and searched from January 1, 2020 to January 26, 2022 to determine the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) without language restrictions. The review includes 26 randomized clinical trials including 2981 patients. The treatment of COVID-19 by TCM combined with conventional treatment is more effective than by pure conventional treatment in many aspects, including increasing of the effective rate [OR ​= ​2.47, 95%CI (1.85, 3.30), P ​< ​0.00001], fever disappearance rate [OR ​= ​3.68, 95%CI (1.95, 6.96), P ​< ​0.0001], fatigue disappearance rate [OR ​= ​3.15, 95%CI (1.60, 6.21), P ​= ​0.0009], cough disappearance rate [OR ​= ​2.89, 95%CI (1.84, 4.54), P ​< ​0.00001], expectoration disappearance rate [OR ​= ​5.94, 95%CI (1.98, 17.84), P ​= ​0.001], disappearance rate of shortness of breath [OR ​= ​2.57, 95%CI (1.13, 5.80), P ​= ​0.02], improvement rate of CT image [OR ​= ​2.43, 95%CI (1.86, 3.16), P ​< ​0.00001], and reduction of the hospitalization time [MD ​= ​−3.16, 95%CI (−3.75, −2.56), P ​< ​0.00001], and deterioration rate [OR ​= ​0.49, 95%CI (0.29, 0.83), P ​= ​0.007].

abstract = {Background
Patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are more likely to experience poor health outcomes and family physicians receive inadequate training to provide appropriate care to this patient group. Little prior research has studied how to effectively train family physicians to care for patients with IDD.
Objective
The aim of this pilot study was to assess the value of adding an experiential component to didactic education strategies to improve family medicine resident perceived comfort, skills and knowledge related to caring for patients with IDD.
Methods
Structured education programs for residents were implemented at three primary care practices in Ontario, Canada. Two practices received didactic information only (didactic-only group); one received didactic information and an experiential training model including clinical interactions and a written reflection on that experience (didactic plus experiential group). In this separate-sample pre-post design, residents were invited to complete a brief anonymous survey prior to and following the training assessing their perceived comfort, skills and knowledge related to patients with IDD.
Results
At baseline, there were no significant differences between the two groups of residents. At follow up, the experiential group reported significantly higher levels of comfort, skills, and knowledge compared to baseline for most items assessed, while in the didactic-only group most items showed little or no improvement.
Conclusion
This pilot study suggests that providing residents the opportunity to participate in clinical encounters with patients with IDD, as well as a structured process to reflect on such encounters, results in greater benefit than didactic training alone.}

abstract = {Backgrounds
Despite the absolute need for life-long treatment of inherited and genetic diseases, there has been little effort to develop such treatments for most of these conditions due to their rarity. Familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency is recognized as one such orphan disease. We have been developing an adipocyte-based ex vivo gene therapy/regenerative medicine, a novel methodology that differs from the adeno-associated virus-mediated in vivo gene therapy or ex vivo gene-transduced hematopoietic cell therapy, to treat familial LCAT deficiency. Recently, a first-in-human (FIH) clinical study was conducted under the Act on Securement of Safety of Regenerative Medicine, wherein a patient with familial LCAT deficiency was treated. To obtain approval to put this treatment into practical use, a clinical trial has been designed with reference to the FIH clinical study.
Methods
An interventional, open-label, unblinded dose-escalation trial was planned, referring to previous FIH clinical study. The trial aims to evaluate the safety of the investigational product in relation to the characteristics of the investigational product (ex vivo gene/cell therapy product by retroviral vector-mediated LCAT gene transduction) using two doses, and the efficacy of the treatment will be evaluated exploratively. A total of three patients will be enrolled sequentially and followed for 24 weeks after administration. This study is designed as a multicenter trial, with Chiba University Hospital administering and evaluating the safety/efficacy of the investigational products at the prescribed visit.
Conclusion
This clinical trial is expected to facilitate the provision of lifelong treatment to many patients with LCAT deficiency.

As renal function falls, drug clearance decreases and exposure to free drug often increases, leading to increased risks of toxicity and adverse drug reactions. There is also a risk of therapeutic failure as some drugs become less effective when renal function declines or dose reductions are excessive. Polypharmacy is common in this patient group, increasing the risk of drug interactions. It is therefore important that prescribers have a good understanding of the altered pharmacokinetics seen in renal disease and understand the need for dose alterations of some drugs, as well as enhanced monitoring for early signs of drug toxicity.}

This study aimed to investigate CAMs used, and reasons for and disclosure of this use by cancer patients in a regional hospital in North Queensland, Australia.
Methods
Patients attending the Day Oncology Unit of the Townsville University Hospital were invited to participate in a self-completed questionnaire or telephone interview regarding perspectives of their CAM use. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and chi-squared and independent t-tests were performed to allow comparison between the responses by CAM users and non-users.
Results
102 completed questionnaires were used in the analysis, where 40.2 % of respondents were found to be using some form of CAM. Cannabis, magnesium, and massage were the most prominent therapies used, with cannabis use in cancer, not commonly reported in prior literature. The main reasons given for using CAM were to treat symptoms of cancer, side-effects of treatment or to improve general health. Two-thirds of these respondents disclosed their CAM use to health professionals mostly to obtain a professional opinion or due to concerns of interactions with cancer treatment. CAM users were statistically more likely to have used CAM prior to their cancer diagnosis and have lower emotional wellbeing than non-users. Non-CAM users indicated that a lack of knowledge of CAM or concerns regarding interactions with cancer treatment were the most popular reasons for not adopting these therapies.
Conclusion
While lower than the averages of previously published CAM use, our study highlights that there is still a significant group of cancer patients in the North Queensland region using CAMs.}

This study aimed to explore the lived experience of patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) and investigate what treatment-related outcomes are the most important to them and should be included in a core outcome set (COS) for OLP.
Study Design
A qualitative study involving focus group work with 10 participants was conducted. Interviews with each focus group were held twice: session 1 explored the lived experience of patients with OLP, and session 2 allowed patients to review a summary of the outcome domains used in the OLP literature to date. The discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using framework analysis.
Results
In session 1, 4 themes and 8 sub-themes emerged from the data analysis. An additional outcome, ‘knowledge of family and friends,’ was suggested in session 2.
Conclusions
We have gained valuable insight into the lived experience of patients with OLP via this qualitative study. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the patient perspective on what should be measured in clinical trials on OLP, highlighting an important additional suggested outcome. This additional outcome will be voted upon in a consensus process to determine a minimum COS for OLP.}

These infections are common in underdeveloped, tropical and subtropical countries and cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Single-celled organisms called protozoa are primarily responsible for parasitic infections, which can live and multiply in the host body. These infections routinely cause significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated, especially in developing countries. Since 1900, many medicines have been developed to treat and prevent these infections worldwide. In order to combat these infections, efforts are in place by health organizations, such as, WHO and CDC, and significant resources are allocated for antiparasitic medication discovery. Healthcare professionals must be aware of antiprotozoal drug's potential toxic effects prior to treating these debilitating infections. A risk-benefit analysis must be considered prior to mass exposure. This chapter focuses on toxicokinetic, adverse effects, organ toxicology, and overdose of a host of antiprotozoal medications listed below: 4-Aminoquinolines (amodiaquine, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine), 8-Aminoquinolins (primaquine, tafenoquine), Amino alcohols (halofantrine, lumefantrine), biguanides (proguanil), Cinchona alkaloid (quinine), Diaminopyrimidines (pyrimethamine), mannich base (pyronaridine), Naphthoquinone (atovaquone), Quinoline-methanol (mefloquine), sesquiterpenes (artesunate, artemether), Sulfonamides, tetracyclines, Miscellaneous other anti-protozoal drugs: benzimidazole derivatives (albendazole, mebendazole), Nitroimidazole derivatives (benznidazole, metronidazole, tinidazole), Nitrofuran derivatives (nifurtimox), Aminoglycoside antibiotics (paromomycin), Misc quinoline derivatives (praziquantel), Tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives (pyrantel), Miscellaneous others (nitazoxanide, eflornithine, pentamidine, triclabendazole).}

Recent years of studies have redefined endothelial progenitor cells into subtypes of blood-derived endothelial cells, largely attributed to the functional differences in their cell culture derivatives and mechanisms of neovascularization. As research on these cells advances, our understanding of their physiology is growing. However, this progress has also led to the development of a chaotic nomenclature system for these cells. Given the circumstances, in this chapter, we provide a framework for standardizing the nomenclature system and characterization of blood-derived endothelial cells. Various subsets of endothelial cells in the circulation can be recruited to injured blood vessels and contribute to homeostasis and regeneration through direct angiogenesis or paracrine mechanisms. We will also discuss their roles as biomarkers, cellular models, and mediators of vascular repair.}

These unique organelles are also implicated in many pathological conditions affecting a variety of organs in various systems. Recently, mitochondrial transplantation, inspired by mitochondria’s endosymbiotic origin, has been attempted as a potential biotherapy in mitigating a variety of pathological conditions. Mitochondrial transplantation consists of the process of isolation, transfer, and uptake of exogenous, intact mitochondria into damaged cells. Here, we discuss mitochondrial transplantation in the context of clinical medicine practiced in neurology, cardiology, pulmonary medicine, and oncology, among others. We outline the role of mitochondria in various pathologies and discuss the state-of-the-art research that potentially form the basis of new therapeutics for the treatment of a variety of diseases due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Lastly, we explore some of the challenges associated with mitochondrial transplantation that must be addressed before mitochondrial transplantation becomes a viable therapeutic option in clinical settings.}

abstract = {Objective
To describe the satisfaction of dentists with the use of a telediagnosis service in Oral Medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Study design
Quantitative cross-sectional study with dentists who constitute the North health macro-region of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Data collection was through an online questionnaire, from May to October 2022, and the information was transferred to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)® software, 24.0, to build the database. Absolute and relative frequencies were performed. The study was approved by CEP (# 5.267.570).
Results
A total of 255 dentists participated in the study, most of them female (74.9%) and 57.8% used the teleconsultation service to monitor patients. Among dentists, 60.6% agreed that the technology is easy to use. A significant percentage reported the desire to continue using it after the pandemic, however, more than half remained neutral or disagreed when asked if they felt safe and comfortable using telediagnosis.
Conclusion
Oral telediagnosis proved to be an easy and adequate tool. It is suggested the implementation of this service in the remote diagnosis of oral lesions in dentistry, mainly in geographically distant regions, becoming important in the access to public health services. Acknowledgment: FAPEMIG, CNPq.}

However, the efficacy of TCM in the treatment of RPL remains unclear due not only to a lack of experimental evidence, but also a lack of comprehensive summarized conclusions. Therefore, the current manuscript reviews recent relevant publications of the clinical use of TCM in RPL and illustrates its potential mechanisms. All publications (in both Chinese and English), especially randomized controlled trials (RCTs), on the use of TCM in RPL for the last ten years and research on its mechanisms were included.

In the past 2 years, national medicines regulatory authorities have held consultations with external stakeholders to adapt regulatory frameworks to embrace point-of-care manufacturing. The proposed concept of decentralized manufacturing (DM) involves the provision of feedstock intermediates (pharma-inks) prepared by pharmaceutical companies to DM sites for manufacturing into the final medicine. In this study, we examine the feasibility of this model, with respect to both manufacturing and quality control. Efavirenz-loaded granulates (0–35%w/w) were produced by a manufacturing partner and shipped to a 3DP site in a different country. Direct powder extrusion (DPE) 3DP was subsequently used to prepare printlets (3D printed tablets), with mass ranging 266–371 mg. All printlets released more than 80% drug load within the first 60 min of the in vitro drug release test. An in-line near-infrared spectroscopy system was used as a process analytical technology (PAT) to quantify the printlets' drug load. Calibration models were developed using partial least squares regression, which showed excellent linearity (R2 = 0.9833) and accuracy (RMSE = 1.0662). Overall, this work is the first to report the use of an in-line NIR system to perform real-time analysis of printlets prepared using pharma-inks produced by a pharmaceutical company. By demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed distribution model through this proof-of-concept study, this work paves the way for investigation of further PAT tools for quality control in 3DP point-of-care manufacturing.}

Discussing complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) with patients undergoing oncology treatment is important due to its widespread use. Prior to integrating open dialogue between health professionals and patients about CAM it is necessary to evaluate its impact. This qualitative study aimed to explore the impact of open dialogue about CAM integrated early in the oncology treatment trajectory on patients’ lived experiences of health, quality of life and well-being.
Method
Fifteen patients undergoing oncology treatment who participated in the open dialogue about CAM with a nurse specialist were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Analysis and interpretation were inspired by Kvale and Brinkmann's description of the interpretation of meaning.
Results
Life with oncology treatment was marked by 1) doubt and uncertainty as to living a safe and healthy life, 2) an inherent desire and responsibility to do something, including a patient-relative collaborative fighting spirit, and 3) keeping an optimistic view and seeing possibilities. In accommodating these aspects, the open dialogue about CAM considerably alleviated guilt and enhanced the hope for a longer, good life and courage. An empathic approach by the health professional and explicit faith in the patient, together with professional knowledge about both conventional medicine and CAM were crucial elements of the dialogue.
Conclusion
Open dialogue about CAM with a trained health professional reassured patients and enhanced their hope and life courage. Such dialogue is important and can be feasibly integrated early in the oncology treatment trajectory.}

Most carbohydrate polymers such as plant polysaccharides exhibit advantages of biodegradability, ease of modification, low immunogenicity and low toxicity. They can be conjugated, cross-linked or functionally modified, and then used as nanocarrier materials. Polysaccharide drug delivery system can avoid the phagocytosis of the reticuloendothelial system, prevent the degradation of biomolecules, and increase the bioavailability of small molecules, thus exerting effective therapeutic effects. Therefore, they have been fully explored. In this paper, we reviewed the construction methods of drug delivery systems based on carbohydrate polymers (astragalus polysaccharide, angelica polysaccharide, lycium barbarum polysaccharide, ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide, bletilla polysaccharide, glycyrrhiza polysaccharide, and epimedium polysaccharides, etc). The application of polysaccharide drug delivery systems to deliver small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs, gene drugs, and metal ion drugs was also briefly introduced. At the same time, the role of the polysaccharide drug delivery system in tumor treatment, targeted therapy, and wound healing was discussed. In addition, the research of polysaccharide delivery systems based on the therapeutic efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine was also summarized and prospected.}

Using 340 product categories offered by 385 traders located in 55 countries we conducted a network analysis centred on trade in donkey skins. We identified over 60 tree species of 54 genera and 22 families, most of the species of conservation concern were native to Africa, including four hongmu species, which are high-value tree species identified by the National Rosewood Standard in China. We found 24 tree species of global conservation concern included in the donkey skin product network; these are designated by CITES in Appendices and/or by the IUCN as threatened or near-threatened. The presence of both donkey skins and timber species of conservation concern indicates a need for heightened surveillance and transparent reporting of the donkey skin trade. Furthermore, this points to a fresh avenue for monitoring the trade of timber, particularly for those species that are linked to the donkey skin product network.}

abstract = {Background
Peri-procedural myocardial injury (PMI) is a common complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which cannot be entirely avoided using available treatments. The findings of earlier research have shown that Shen-Yuan-Dan (SYD) capsules, a traditional Chinese medicine, can potentially alleviating PMI. This study aimed to confirm further this hypothesis in a rigorous, well-designed randomized controlled study.
Methods
Our clinical trial was randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled. A total of 181 patients with unstable angina (UA) undergoing elective PCI were randomized to pretreatment with SYD or a placebo under the basis of conventional treatment; 87 patients were pretreated with SYD (4 capsules, 3 times a day, with a further 4 capsules 2 h before PCI) 3 days before the procedure, and 94 patients were given a placebo. No patients received reloading statins before PCI, and SYD or placebo was maintained for 1 month after PCI. The primary endpoint was the incidence of PMI. The secondary endpoint was calculating the incidence rate of all 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization). The safety outcomes, including abnormalities in electrocardiogram and serum biochemical examinations caused by drug use, were also tested.
Results
The levels of creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) in both the SYD and placebo groups were increased at 4 h and 24 h after PCI compared with before the procedure (P < 0.05). The incidence rate of PMI in the SYD group (10.3 %) was lower than that in the placebo group (34 %) (absolute difference, 23.7 % [95 % CI, 11.7–34.8 %], P < 0.01). After taking SYD, the relative risk reduction (RRR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) were 69.7 % and 24.3 %, respectively; further, number needed to treat (NNT) was 4.2. The 30-day major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate was not statistically different between the SYD and placebo groups (6.9 % vs. 9.6 %, P = 0.352). There were no abnormal situations during the trial.
Conclusion
These findings showed that pretreatment with SYD could safely reduce the incidence rate of PMI in patients with UA undergoing elective PCI. Further study on the effects of SYD and how it can improve adverse cardiovascular events outcomes is needed.}

abstract = {Background
The use of technologies continues to grow in healthcare provision, and learning technologies now dominate tertiary education. Meanwhile, complementary medicine (CM) constitutes a substantial component of contemporary healthcare, yet the education of existing and future CM practitioners has received little empirical attention. In direct response, our study examines the perceptions of CM students and faculty related specifically to health and learning technologies in clinical CM work and education.
Methods
A cross-sectional online survey was administered to all current students (n = 4851) and tenured, contracted and adjunct academics (n =530) at two CM education institutions – in the US and in Australia.
Results
Most student respondents (n = 134, 49%) reported that they either felt they were unsure if they would use telehealth in clinical practice or that they would use it (n = 116, 43%). The majority of all academic respondents did not believe it possible to conduct basic clinical processes online such as reading a patient's body language (M3.8, SD 1.0), conducting quality clinical training in CM settings (M3.2, SD 1.3) or learning rapport skills (M3.2, SD 1.2). Of those academics who were also in clinical practice, only a small number reported conducting virtual consultations in their CM work (n = 7,15.9%).
Conclusion
Our findings highlight a potential disparity of perceptions between academics and students in these CM educational settings especially in relation to telehealth. Academics expressed hesitancy to fully rely on technologies to develop practitioners in a field where ‘formation of professional character’ is considered so important.}

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) fitness could improve the state of health of adults’ intestinal flora. The research aims at analyzing the impact of TCM fitness on the intestinal probiotics (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus) and opportunistic pathogen (Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae) by the noninvasive imaging. In accordance with the searching results, the researchers have found that TCM fitness has a significant impact on improving Bifidobacterium (SDM = 1.55; P = 0.02) and Lactobacillus (SDM = 1.26; P <0.01), while the impact could not be seen on Enterococcus (SDM = 0.29;P = 0.68) and Enterobacteriaceae (SDM = 0.05;P = 0.94). And there is no significant difference between the two interventions of Tai Chi and Fitness Qigong. The results of the present review show that TCM fitness could significantly better the probiotics of intestinal flora while the influence on opportunistic pathogen needs to be further investigated with the precise and reasonable proof of scientific studies.The findings suggest that TCM fitness can be used as an effective intervention, and there is no significant difference between the two interventions on the improvement of the intestinal flora. The using of optical tool based on ultrasensitive bioluminescent imaging may lead to better precision medicine treatments in the future.}

Here, we reviewed how omics, including genomics, proteomics, single-cell multi-omics, and clinical phenomics, play roles in answering biological and clinical questions about COVID-19. Large-scale sequencing and advanced analysis methods facilitate COVID-19 discovery from virus evolution and severity risk prediction to potential treatment identification. Omics would indicate precise and globalized prevention and medicine for the COVID-19 pandemic under the utilization of big data capability and phenotypes refinement. Furthermore, decoding the evolution rule of SARS-CoV-2 by deep learning models is promising to forecast new variants and achieve more precise data to predict future pandemics and prevent them on time.}

abstract = {Background
Reporting bias poses a fundamental threat to the transparency and validity of interpretations of clinical trials, which may, in part, be mitigated through access Clinical Study Reports (CSRs). The European Medicines Agency (EMA), under their Policy 0070, prospectively publishes clinical data, including CSRs, submitted as part of marketing authorization applications or post-authorization procedures, although this practice is currently suspended for non-COVID-19 medicines, and have set out planned timelines for publication.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study assessing the content and characteristics of all clinical data packages released by the EMA under Policy 0070 and the time to their publication. We extracted the number and characteristics of trials included in the clinical packages, assessed the delay to publication relative to the EMAs planned timeline and whether it differed between the EMAs various transparency measures and types of application procedures.
Results
We identified 148 clinical data packages that contained data on a total of 1,005 clinical trials, of which 261 (26%) were labelled as phase 3 trials. Full CSRs were available for 913 (90•8%) of the trials. The median time to publication was 511 (IQR 411 to 574) days. Only 2 (1•4%) of the clinical data packages were published within the EMA's planned timeline. The delay was shorter for clinical data packages released under the EMAs transparency measures for COVID.19 medicines compared with their standard transparency measure.
Conclusion
The clinical data packages released by the EMA under Policy 0070 contained CSRs on many trials but were published with considerable delays relative to the timeline set forth by the EMA, reducing their potential impact on reporting bias.}

In China, the clinical use of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) for children with respiratory and/or digestive diseases (RDDs) is increasing, and there are many clinical studies on CPMs. However, little is known about the overall impact of CPMs on RDDs and co-morbid RDDs. Thus, this scoping review will aim to systematically identify and map available research evidence on CPMs for children with RDDs and co-morbid RDDs, explore the research gaps and drive further research.
Methods
The scoping review will be conducted based on the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, and reported following the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Both Chinese and international literature databases will be searched to identify eligible studies and other publicly available documents. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and organized in response to review questions. Findings will be presented in a visual and aggregate form as well as a descriptive format aligning with the objectives and scope of this protocol.
Conclusion
A dedicated article will be drafted to reflect the profile of the use of CPMs and research stemming from this protocol. The findings of the review will extend beyond previous reviews, and attempt to provide comprehensive insight into the role of CPMs in treating children with RDDs and co-morbid RDDs.}

abstract = {Digestive system cancers account for nearly half of all cancers around the world and have a high mortality rate. Cell culture and animal models represent cornerstones of digestive cancer research. However, their ability to enable cancer precision medicine is limited. Cell culture models cannot retain the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumors and lack tumor microenvironment (TME). Patient-derived xenograft mouse models are not suitable for immune-oncology research. While humanized mouse models are time- and cost-consuming. Suitable preclinical models, which can facilitate the understanding of mechanisms of tumor progression and develop new therapeutic strategies, are in high demand. This review article summarizes the recent progress on the establishment of TME by using tumor organoid models and microfluidic systems. The main challenges regarding the translation of organoid models from bench to bedside are discussed. The integration of organoids and a microfluidic platform is the emerging trend in drug screening and precision medicine. A future prospective on this field is also provided.}

Monascus ruber (M. ruber), a filamentous fungus with edible properties, produces bio-functional metabolites including a good deal of enzymes. In this study, the effect of the biological transformation of fermented food on obesity and hyperlipidemia, was systematically investigated using the mixture of medicine and food homology (MFH) hawthorn and millet as fermentation substrate. Results showed that fermentation promoted the release of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds. Pancreas lipase assay indicated that the inhibition rate and IC50 of free phenolic compounds in fermented MFH food were 70.51% ± 2.59%, and 1.34 mg/mL, respectively. In vitro, the binding rates of free phenolic compounds in fermented MFH food to Sodium cholate (SC), sodium glycinate (SGC) and sodium taurocholate (STC) were 84.99% ± 6.59%, 80.29% ± 6.23%, and 79.68% ± 6.18%. Further, Monascus-fermented hawthorn and millet (MFHM) of fermented MFH food markedly suppressed lipid accumulation in oleic acid (OA)-induced HepG2, with cell triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) clearance of 24.31% ± 1.81% and 73.88% ± 2.72%, respectively. These findings implied that the fermentation of a mixture of MFH millet and hawthorn by M. ruber holds promise for reducing obesity and lowering lipid levels, thereby serving as a valuable foundation and reference for future research on the development of multifunctional food products.}

abstract = {Background
Viral- and host-targeted traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulae NRICM101 and NRICM102 were administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the mid-2021 outbreak in Taiwan. We report the outcomes by measuring the risks of intubation or admission to intensive care unit (ICU) for patients requiring no oxygen support, and death for those requiring oxygen therapy.
Methods
This multicenter retrospective study retrieved data of 840 patients admitted to 9 hospitals between May 1 and July 26, 2021. After propensity score matching, 302 patients (151 received NRICM101 and 151 did not) and 246 patients (123 received NRICM102 and 123 did not) were included in the analysis to assess relative risks.
Results
During the 30-day observation period, no endpoint occurred in the patients receiving NRICM101 plus usual care while 14 (9.27%) in the group receiving only usual care were intubated or admitted to ICU. The numbers of deceased patients were 7 (5.69%) in the group receiving NRICM102 plus usual care and 27 (21.95%) in the usual care group. No patients receiving NRICM101 transitioned to a more severe status; NRICM102 users were 74.07% less likely to die than non-users (relative risk= 25.93%, 95% confidence interval 11.73%-57.29%).
Conclusion
NRICM101 and NRICM102 were significantly associated with a lower risk of intubation/ICU admission or death among patients with mild-to-severe COVID-19. This study provides real-world evidence of adopting broad-spectrum oral therapeutics and shortening the gap between outbreak and effective response. It offers a new vision in our preparation for future pandemics.}

Fifty-eight kinds of TCM oral formulations and basic taste substances were utilized to assess the applicability of the novel method, which compared with the results of E-tongue evaluation. According to the PCA map, the oral stimulation of TCM oral formulations were divided into three groups (Group 1: SM < 0.05; Group 2: SM = 0.05; Group 3: SM > 0.05). In this study, the results of PLS revealed that the responses of E-tongue sensors could be characterized 71.9% of the SM information (R2 = 71.9%). These showed that the taste stimulation of TCM had certain influence in SM. And the sensors of CA, JE, GA, and HA were critical parameters on palatability evaluation of TCM oral formulations. In conclusion, SM can be used to characterize the chemical and mechanical senses of TCM oral formulation. And it can be predicted the palatability of TCM according to the classification results of E-tongue.}

Clinicians often order the international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to evaluate for the possibility of inherited bleeding disorders despite sensitivities and specificities of 1%–2%. The most accurate tool to evaluate for bleeding disorders is a validated bleeding assessment tool (BAT). Our aim was to reduce coagulation testing by >50% in a large family practice in Ontario, Canada.
Methods
We conducted an implementation study from May 2016 to February 2020. Iterative interventions included introduction of a validated BAT into the electronic medical record (EMR); removal of the APTT as a prepopulated selection from the laboratory requisition; and education targeting family medicine teams and laboratory personnel. The primary outcome was the rate of pre‐ and post‐APTT testing. Creatinine testing was the control. Data were analyzed via an interrupted time series analysis using Stata 13.
Results
Immediately following education of the laboratory personnel on coagulation testing, the APTT rate level dropped by 1.26 tests per 100 patient visits per month (p < 0.001) and was sustained until the end of the study. Meanwhile, the PT/INR and creatinine testing rate levels did not change (rate level = −0.02 per 100 visits per month, p = 0.79 and 0.49, p = 0.22 respectively). There was good uptake of the BAT following integration and 18/88 (20%) obtained a referral to hematology after BAT completion.
Conclusions
Multidisciplinary, iterative interventions reduced APTT testing and enabled the use of BATs to guide hematology referrals in a large family practice.}

abstract = {Summary
Large-scale precision medicine research requires massive amounts of data representing people from all walks of life; thus, in the US, it is often multistate research. Significant legal and ethical quandaries arise as a result of the patchwork of laws states have enacted that may apply to research, are not preempted by federal law, and may impose requirements or provide participant rights and protections that differ from other states. Determining which state’s laws apply, and under what circumstances, is not solved by the transition to a single-IRB model and researchers cannot simply choose one state’s laws to apply uniformly. At a minimum, the current process of meeting each state’s requirements could be made more reliable and efficient. To fundamentally change this status quo, however, requires action at multiple levels. Federally, well-known gaps in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act should be closed, and a coherent system of compensation for research injury—including non-physical injuries—should be developed. States should clarify which of their laws are intended to apply to research and work collaboratively to harmonize them. At the level of individual research projects, numerous policies and procedures could be standardized through authoritative guidelines. Examples include clarifying the scope of broad consent, understanding and upholding Certificates of Confidentiality, offering individual research results responsibly, and consistently disseminating aggregate results to participants and the public. Overall, development of a choice of law framework specific to the research context could significantly promote clarity and consistency.}

Numerous artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tools for cardiovascular diseases have been published, with a high impact on public health. However, few have been adopted into, or have meaningfully affected, routine clinical care.
Objective
To evaluate current awareness, perceptions, and clinical use of AI-enabled digital health tools for patients with cardiovascular disease, and challenges to adoption.
Methods
This mixed-methods study included interviews with 12 cardiologists and 8 health information technology (IT) administrators, and a follow-on survey of 90 cardiologists and 30 IT administrators.
Results
We identified 5 major challenges: (1) limited knowledge, (2) insufficient usability, (3) cost constraints, (4) poor electronic health record interoperability, and (5) lack of trust. A minority of cardiologists were using AI tools; more were prepared to implement AI tools, but their sophistication level varied greatly.
Conclusion
Most respondents believe in the potential of AI-enabled tools to improve care quality and efficiency, but they identified several fundamental barriers to wide-scale adoption.}

Traditionally, medication classes such as opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics have been the foundation of symptom management. However, there is a growing interest in cannabis-based medicine’s possible benefits to aid in symptom management of patients living with serious illnesses. The most recent literature on the benefits, burdens, and risks associated with cannabis-based medicines for symptom management often provides conflicting data.

abstract = {Introduction
The need for specific therapeutics against infectious diseases is made very important at this moment by the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2. Vaccines containing live attenuated or heat-inactivated pathogens elicit robust immune responses, but their safety is sometimes not assured. Subunit vaccines consisting of the most potent antigenic protein or carbohydrates of the pathogen are safer but often induce a weak immune response. Traditional Ayurveda medicines have a long history of safety and may act as immuno-modulators or vaccine adjuvants. They can reduce the amount of vaccine booster doses required to elicit an immune response against any pathogen. The main objective of this review is a mechanistic evaluation of the antiviral potential of Ayurveda herbal compositions for their ability to increase cytokine expression and enhance NK cell activity, activate CD4/ CD8 + T cells, and increase the formation of IL-2 and IFNγ against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
Various peer-reviewed publications, books, monographs, and reputed search engines were reviewed in depth. Information available from the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and in recent in silico analyses were compared in order to understand the mechanism of action of herbal components against SARS-CoV-2.
Results
It was found in various molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies that many bioactive natural components of Ayurvedic medicines could prevent viral entry or multiplication within a human host.
Conclusion
Ayurvedic herbal medicines can be used either independently as therapeutics or as a complement to the modern-day recombinant vaccines with immediate effect. Ayurveda-based adjuvant therapy can also efficiently manage the secondary symptoms of COVID 19 patients.}

abstract = {Intron retention (IR) is a regulatory mechanism that can retard protein production by acting at the level of mRNA processing. We recently demonstrated that IR occurs at the pre-symptomatic state during the aging process of a mouse model of aging, providing a promising biomarker for that state, and can be restored to the normal state by juzentaihoto (JTT), a Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo) (Okada et al. 2021). Here we characterized the genes that accumulate retained introns, examined the biological significance of increased IR in these genes for the host, and determined whether drugs other than JTT can have this effect. By analyzing RNA-sequencing data generated from the hippocampus of the 19-week-old SAMP8 mouse, a model for studying age-related depression and Alzheimer's disease, we showed that genes with increased IR are generally involved in multiple metabolic pathways and have pivotal roles in sensing homeostasis. We thus propose that IR is a stress response and works to fine-tune the expression of many downstream target genes, leading to lower levels of their translation under stress conditions. Interestingly, Kampo medicines, as well as other organic compounds, restored splicing of a specific set of retained introns in these sensor genes in accordance with the physiological recovery conditions of the host, which corresponds with the recovery of transcripts represented by differentially expressed genes. Thus, analysis of IR genes may have broad applicability in evaluating the pre-symptomatic state based on the extent of IR of selective sensor genes, opening a promising early diagnosis of any diseases and a strategy for evaluating efficacies of several drugs based on the extent of IR restoration of these sensor genes.}

Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is a common pathological manifestation of many cardiovascular diseases at a certain stage, with excessive accumulation of collagen fibers, excessive increase in collagen content, and a significant increase in collagen volume as the main pathological changes. There are currently no effective drugs for the treatment of myocardial fibrosis. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the main component of the medical practice used for more than 5000 years, especially in China, often exerts a wider action spectrum than previously attempted options in treating human diseases. In recent times, the great potential of TCM in the treatment of MF has received much attention. Especially many experimental studies on the treatment of MF by Astragalus mongholicus Bunge have been conducted, and the effect is remarkable, which may provide more comprehensive database and theoretical support for the application of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge in the treatment of MF and could be considered a promising candidate drug for preventing MF.
Aim of the review
This review summarizes the chemical components of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, Astragalus mongholicus Bunge extract, Astragalus mongholicus Bunge single prescription, and Astragalus mongholicus Bunge compound preparation in the treatment of MF, and provides comprehensive information and a reliable basis for the exploration of new treatment strategies of botanical drugs in the therapy of MF.
Methods
The literature information was obtained from the scientific databases on ethnobotany and ethnomedicines (up to August 2022), mainly from the PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI databases. The experimental studies on the anti-myocardial fibrosis role of the effective active components of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge and the utility of its compound preparation and the involved mechanisms were identified. The search keywords for such work included: “myocardial fibrosis” or “Cardiac fibrosis ”, and “Astragalus mongholicus Bunge”, “extract,” or “herb”.
Results
Several studies have shown that the effective active components of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge and its formulas, particularly Astragaloside IV, Astragalus polysaccharide, total saponins of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, triterpenoid saponins of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge, and cycloastragenol, exhibit potential benefits against MF, the mechanisms of which appear to involve the regulation of inflammation, oxidant stress, and pro-fibrotic signaling pathways, etc. Conclusion: These research works have shown the therapeutic benefits of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge in the treatment of MF. However, further research should be undertaken to clarify the unconfirmed chemical composition and regulatory mechanisms, conduct standard clinical trials, and evaluate the possible side effects. The insights in the present review provided rich ideas for developing new anti-MF drugs.
Thesis
Myocardial fibrosis (MF) with excessive accumulation of collagen fibers, excessive increase in collagen content, and a significant increase in collagen volume as the main pathological changes is a common pathological manifestation of many cardiovascular diseases at a certain stage, which seriously affects cardiac function. At present, there is still a lack of effective drugs for the treatment of MF. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the main component of the medical practice used for more than 5000 years especially in China, often exerts wider action spectrum than previously attempted options in treating human diseases. In recent times, the great potential of TCM in the treatment of MF has received much attention. Especially many experimental studies on the treatment of MF by Astragalus mongholicus Bunge have been conducted, and the effect is remarkable, which may provide more comprehensive data base and theoretical support for the application of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge in the treatment of MF and could be considered a promising candidate drug for preventing MF.}

Hand hygiene (HH) compliance among health-care workers is important for preventing transmission of infectious diseases.
Aim
To describe health-care worker hand hygiene activity in ICU and non-ICU patients’ rooms, using an automated monitoring system (AMS), before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
At the Intercommunal Hospital of Créteil, near Paris, France, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) consumption in the Department of Medicine (DM) and ICU was recorded using an AMS during four periods: before, during, and after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and during its second wave.
Findings
From 1st February to 30th November 2020, in the DM, the mean number of doses per patient-day for each of the four periods was, respectively, 5.7 (±0.3), 19.4 (±1.3), 17.6 (±0.7), and 7.9 (±0.2, P < 0.0001). In contrast, ICU ABHS consumption remained relatively constant. In the DM, during the pandemic waves, ABHS consumption was higher in rooms of COVID-19 patients than in other patients’ rooms. Multivariate analysis showed ABHS consumption was associated with the period in the DM, and with the number of HCWs in the ICU.
Conclusion
An AMS allows real-time collection of ABHS consumption data that can be used to adapt training and prevention measures to specific hospital departments.}

This study presents a strategy utilizing bispecific antibodies for the targeted delivery of nucleic acid drugs to the surface of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)-overexpressing cancer cells. Strong binding affinity of the bispecific antibodies to GRP78-overexpressing cancer cells, including HEPG2 cells, confirmed the tumor-targeting potential of this platform. Functional analyses demonstrated the role of the bispecific antibodies in enhancing lipid nanoparticle (LNP) uptake, causing increased gene expression levels of nucleic acid drugs loaded within LNPs. In vivo imaging confirmed the potency of the bispecific-antibody-modified LNPs in delivering nucleic acid drugs to tumors and sustaining therapeutic expression levels. In vivo therapy results indicated that the bispecific antibodies improved the antitumor activity of PE38-loaded LNPs in tumors overexpressing surface GRP78. This study pioneered a bispecific-antibody-centered platform for the targeted delivery of nucleic acid drugs. The robust antigen–antibody binding affinity, tumor-selective interactions, enhanced cellular uptake, and proficient gene expression promise to advance precision therapeutics in oncology. Continued refinement and translation of this drug delivery strategy are important to unlock its full clinical potential.}

Aim of the study: The objective of this review is to summarize the TCM theories, experimental methods, TCM extracts, active TCM ingredients, and TCM formulas for the treatment of COPD and reveal the effects and mechanisms of TCM treatments on COPD.
Materials and methods
This article reviewed literature on TCM-based treatments for COPD reported from 2016 to 2021. Relevant scientific studies were obtained from databases that included PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science, Google Scholar, The Plant List, ScienceDirect, and SciFinder.
Results
This review summarized TCM-based theory, experimental methods, active ingredients, and potential toxicities, the effects of TCM extracts and formulations, and their mechanisms for the treatment of COPD. Most investigators have used in vivo models of cigarette smoke combined with lipopolysaccharide induction in rats and in vitro models of cigarette smoke extract induction. The active ingredients of TCM used for the treatment of COPD in relevant studies were triterpenoids, flavonoids, phenolics, quinones, glycosides, and alkaloids. TCMs commonly used in the treatment of COPD include antipyretic drugs, tonic medicines, anticough medications, and asthma medications. TCM can treat COPD by suppressing inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, and improving airway remodeling.
Conclusions
This review enriches the theory of COPD treatments based on TCM, established the clinical significance and development prospects of TCM-based COPD treatments, and provided the necessary theoretical support for the further development of TCM resources for the treatment of COPD.}

Cymbaria daurica L. (C. daurica) is a perennial herb known commonly as “Xinba” (Chinese) and “Kanba-Arong” (Mongolian). In Mongolia, it is used as a traditional medicine to treat eczema and other skin diseases due to its anti-swelling, anti-inflammatory, anti-hemorrhagic, and anti-itching properties. However, the potential mechanism of action for eczema treatment has not been reported.
Aim of the study
To investigate the effect of C. daurica on 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced eczema in rats and the associated action mechanism.
Materials and methods
Qualitative analysis of C. daurica was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Based on information obtained from compound identification and relevant literature, the possible targets of C. daurica against eczema were analyzed using network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. The DNCB-induced eczema rat models were treated with different dosages of C. daurica extract (10, 50, and 250 mg/mL per day), and the therapeutic effects subsequently evaluated based on the degree of skin inflammation, spleen index, and hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E staining). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting were used to analyze the relevant target effects. The C. daurica mechanism of action on eczema was verified by animal experiments. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out to determine the content of active ingredients in C. daurica. In addition, the physicochemical properties of the extract were evaluated.
Results
Our analysis of the 173 targets included in the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network identified tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) as key targets involved in the treatment of eczema with C. daurica extract. Furthermore, the 173 targets were associated with the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. Our results showed that C. daurica significantly reduced IL-2 and TNF-α serum levels in eczema rat models (P < 0.0001); thus, playing an important role in the anti-inflammatory response. Furthermore, according to the p-value, RT-qPCR and western blotting showed that the expression of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Vav), and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) changed in the skin of the eczema model rats after treatment with the C. daurica extract.
Conclusion
Our study confirms that C. daurica can inhibit SHP-1, Vav, and Grb2 expression; thereby, inhibiting the natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. These results provide insight into the mechanism of C. daurica in treating eczema.}

Herein, a combined process of reduction roasting of herb-medicine residue (HMR) and oxalic acid (OA) leaching is proposed to improve the recovery efficiency of lithium. Due to the large amount of reducing gas produced by the pyrolysis of herb-medicine residue, the layered structure of LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathode powder can be destroyed at 650℃ for 10 min, and the cathode powder is converted into Li2CO3, Ni, Co, MnO. Moreover, about 99.6 % of Li in the roasting residue can be selectively extracted by 0.5 mol L−1 oxalic acid for 20 min. Under the combined action of HMR and OA, the extraction efficiency and kinetics of lithium are improved simultaneously. This work achieves synergistic treatment of two types of waste from the perspective of waste management for waste. Meanwhile, it provides an alternative and innovative approach for the difficult problem of low efficiency of lithium recovery from spent LIBs.}

Our study aims to describe the use of complementary medicine by patients with multiple sclerosis.
Material(s) and Method(s)
A quantitative descriptive study was adopted to study this subject. For data collection, we opted for an anonymous questionnaire, which was intended for a sample of 100 patients with MS. Data collection took place from March to June. To lead this investigation, written approval was obtained from the Health Ministry of Morocco on 30 April 2022 (reference no. 8366-3/3/2021). In addition, this investigation was carried out according to the institutional ethical committee with the approval number of FST/LGB/2018/15-JAN.2018-DEC.2018. For the questionnaire, informed written consent was obtained from all participants after explaining the purpose of the study, the importance of their contribution, and their right to refuse participation. The data are anonymized and free of personally identifiable information
Result(s)
The results show that patients with multiple sclerosis are characterized by female dominance (68 %). In addition, this study showed that patients with this disease are generally young: their mean age is 34.5 years, and 45.5% are single. Furthermore, the results show that 52% of patients use complementary medicine, of which 29% use cupping (Hijama), 23% for Quran and Ruqia, and 15% use phytotherapy. While apitherapy is adopted by 13% and acupuncture is used by 10%. In addition, 66.3% of the surveyed declare that alternative medicine positively affects their health state. Finally, there are statistically significant associations between the use of complementary medicine and age (p = 0.014): almost half (49.1%) of patients who use alternative medicine their age is between 30 and 40 years old. The results also show that there is a significant dependence between the use of complementary medicine and the intensity of the physical pain suffered by the patients (p = 0.032).
Conclusion(s)
This study showed that more than half of the patients surveyed use complementary medicine. Furthermore, the use of complementary medicine can have several explanations, namely: the socio-cultural characteristics of the patients and the clinico-epidemiological and therapeutic characteristics of the disease}

Pharmacists are drug experts who can play a significant role in promoting the use of biosimilar medicines. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess community pharmacists' knowledge and attitude toward biosimilars in Lebanon, as well as potential factors influencing their knowledge.
Methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional study involving licensed community pharmacists in Lebanon was conducted using random sampling between January and July 2022. An electronic survey consisting of 30-closed ended questions was used, it included 10 questions to assess participants knowledge towards biosimilars and 10 attitudinal statements. A knowledge score was then calculated. A multivariable analysis was conducted to determine predictors of knowledge using binary logistic regression including all variables with p < 0.20 on univariate analysis. Statistical significance was set at p value < 0.05.
Key findings
In total, 354 community pharmacists completed this survey. The majority of participants 261 (73.7%) were knowledgeable, with only 54 (15.3%) answering all the questions correctly. The results of the multivariable analysis showed only a statistically significant association between knowledge and pharmacists who had taken a course or post-graduate training course about biosimilar drugs (OR = 2.213, 95% CI = 1.088–4.500, p-value = 0.028). The majority of pharmacists 314 (88.7%) agreed with the statement “Healthcare professionals should be further educated to eliminate potential misconceptions and integrate biosimilars into routine clinical practice.”
Conclusions
Overall, community pharmacists in Lebanon had a good knowledge about biosimilars that was significantly associated with post-graduate training courses. Additionally, our participants had a generally favorable attitude toward biosimilars.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
‘Ershiwuwei Shanhu’ Pill (ESP) is a classic Tibetan medicine to treat neurological disorders in nervous system, especially for neurological pains and epilepsy. It contains many Tibet-specific mineral medicines, among which Halloysite (Halloysitum rubrum, HR) was regarded as the main active one. As mineral medicines contain heavy metals with poor solubility, the doubts about its safety restricted its clinical application and further development.
Aim of the study
A 7-day acute toxicity of ESP and its main active mineral medicine HR was systematically studied for investigating the safety of ESP and exploring the role of HR in ESP's potential toxicity.
Materials and methods
In this study, the acute oral toxicity assessment of formula-ESP and HR were performed on rats for 7 days at doses equivalent to 10 (1 g/kg) and 40 times (4 g/kg) the typical clinical dose (0.1 g/kg). 1H NMR based metabolomics profiling, aided with biochemical analysis and histopathology, was conducted to explore the global metabolic changes in the livers and kidneys of the administrated rats.
Results
High-dose HR caused oxidative stress, energy metabolism disorders, purine metabolism impairments and amino acid metabolism imbalance in rats, resulting in hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which in accordance with the increased biochemical index in blood (ALT, AST, BUN and CRE). ESP (low-dose) induced metabolites changes were far more less than HR in livers, showcasing the distinct advantage of formula in reducing toxicity. Furthermore, low-dose ESP disturbed renal metabolism in a way similar to high-dose HR, which implies that HR might be the major source of the potential nephrotoxicity of ESP.
Conclusion
HR exhibited potential hepatoxicity and nephrotoxicity, but the formula- ‘Ershiwuwei Shanhu’ Pill which contains HR is considered relatively safe.}

abstract = {Objective
To describe patients hospitalized in internal medicine in terms of malnutrition and sarcopenia, depending on the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), as well as to evaluate short- and long-term mortality related to both.
Methods
Cross-sectional, single-center study, which included consecutive patients admitted to internal medicine in May and October 2021. Malnutrition was determined using the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) and sarcopenia using SARC-F and handgrip strength. Patients hospitalized for more than 48 h are excluded.
Results
511 patients were analyzed, 49.1% male, mean age 75.2 +/− 15 years, 210 (41.1%) DM2. 6 groups (2 × 3 design) are generated based on the presence of DM2 and the nutritional status according to the result of the MNA-SF: 12–14 points, without risk; MNA-SF 8–12 points, high risk; MNA-SF 0–7 points, malnourished. Malnourished patients with DM2 had significantly higher sarcopenia, comorbidity, inflammation, and pressure ulcers. The main determinants of in-hospital mortality were sarcopenia (OR 1.27, 95%CI 1.06–1.54, p = 0.01), comorbidity (OR 1.27, 95%CI 1,08−1,49, p = 0.003) and inflammation (OR 1.01, 95%CI 1.00–1.02, p = 0.02). The 120-day prognosis was worse among malnourished patients (p = 0.042).
Conclusion
Patients admitted with DM2 have a similar degree of malnutrition than the rest, but with greater sarcopenia. This sarcopenia, together with inflammation and comorbidity determine a worse prognosis. The active and early identification of malnutrition and sarcopenia and their subsequent approach could improve the prognosis of patients.
Resumen
Objetivo
Describir los pacientes hospitalizados en medicina interna en términos de desnutrición y sarcopenia, en función de la presencia o no de diabetes mellitus tipo 2 (DM2), así como evaluar la mortalidad a corto y largo plazo relacionada con ambas.
Métodos
Estudio de cohortes, unicéntrico, que recoge pacientes consecutivos ingresados en medicina interna en mayo y octubre de 2021. La desnutrición se determinó mediante el Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) y la sarcopenia mediante SARC-F y dinamometría. Se excluye los pacientes hospitalizados más de 48 horas.
Resultados
Se analizan 511 pacientes, 49,1% varones, edad media de 75.2 +/− 15 años, 210 (41,1%) DM2. Se generan 6 grupos (diseño 2 × 3) en función de la presencia de DM2 y del estado nutricional acorde con el resultado del MNA-SF: 12–14 puntos, sin riesgo; MNA-SF 8–12 puntos, alto riesgo; MNA-SF 0–7 puntos, desnutridos. Los pacientes con DM2 y desnutridos, tenían significativamente mayor sarcopenia, comorbilidad, inflamación, y úlceras por presión. Los principales determinantes de mortalidad intrahospitalaria fueron la sarcopenia (OR 1,27, IC95% 1,06−1,54, p = 0,01), la comorbilidad (OR 1,27, IC95% 1,08−1,49, P = 0,003) y la inflamación (OR 1,01, IC95% 1,00–1,02, p = 0,02). El pronóstico a 120 días fue peor entre los pacientes desnutridos (p = 0,042).
Conclusión
Los pacientes ingresados con DM2 presentan similar grado de desnutrición que el resto, pero con mayor sarcopenia. Esta sarcopenia, junto a la inflamación y la comorbilidad determinan un peor pronóstico. La identificación activa y temprana de la desnutrición y la sarcopenia y su abordaje posterior podrían mejorar el pronóstico de los pacientes.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) was introduced as a concept in the early 1990s as an integration of the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.
Objective
To evaluate the current status of EBM training and EBM perception, attitudes, and self-perceived skills among European urology residents.
Design, setting, and participants
Our online open survey comprised 28 multiple-choice items, including ten questions with responses on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. The survey was distributed via the mailing lists and social media accounts of the European Society of Residents in Urology, German Society of Residents in Urology, French Society of Urologists in Training, Spanish Urology Residents Working Group, Italian Society of Residents in Urology, and the Urology Social Media Working Group in two rounds (May–July 2019 and July 2020). We excluded responses from non-European countries.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
The online open survey comprised 28 multiple-choice items. These included ten questions with answers on a five-point Likert scale with response items ranging from strongly disagree (score of 1) to strongly agree (score of 5).
Results and limitations
We received 210 responses, of which 181 from 23 European countries were eligible. Approximately three-quarters (73.7%) of the respondents were male, with a mean age of 31 yr. Only 28.2% reported EBM training as part of their urology curriculum and 19.3% felt that the training they received was sufficient to guide their daily practice. An overwhelming majority (91.5%) stated that they would be interested in more formalized EBM training or additional training. There was a strong level of agreement (median score 5, interquartile range 4–5) that EBM is important for daily medical and surgical practice and that it improves patient care. Overall, the mean self-perceived understanding of basic EBM concepts was good. Limitations include concerns about generalizability given its internet-based format, the inability to calculate a response rate, poor representation from some European regions, and limited sample size.
Conclusions
Our survey suggests that European urology residents receive a limited amount of EBM training despite considerable appreciation, interest, and self-perceived deficits for more advanced concepts. Formal integration of EBM teaching in all European residency programs should be considered.
Patient summary
We performed an online survey of urology residents in Europe. We found that residents have positive perceptions of and attitudes to evidence-based medicine but most programs lack formal training in this area.}

Imbalanced redox caused by excessive reactive oxygen species is one of the crucial factors in weakening vascularization. Conditions such as implant osseointegration failure and delayed wound healing in orthopedic diseases are significantly influenced by the vascularization deficits in diabetic mellitus. Promoting angiogenesis by modulating endothelial function is considered as an effective therapy for diabetes, yet current efforts remain insufficient. Nanocatalytic medicine has emerged as promising candidates for therapy. Herein, carbon dots (CDs) with preferable catalytic effect by mimicking both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)-like activity were designed and synthesized using anhydrous citric acid and ethane diamine. CDs effectively scavenged superoxide anion (O2•−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with excellent biocompatibility. Meanwhile, CDs promoted the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with enhanced SOD and CAT activity in simulated oxidative stress of diabetes. Notably, CDs promoted vascularization by activate PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in impaired endothelial cells, which was demonstrated through transcriptome sequencing, western blot, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The therapeutic effect of CDs based on promoting vascularization was found in orthopedic disease models of subcutaneous implant and wound healing of diabetic rat. These findings highlight a promising clinical application for CDs as a nanocatalytic medicine in enhancing vascularization for diabetic mellitus.}

abstract = {Background
Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common cancers. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) based first-line chemotherapy for colorectal cancer treatment often leads to chemoresistance and gastrointestinal mucositis.
Purpose
This study aimed to find potential therapeutic agents from herbal medicine with anti-colorectal cancer and anti-mucositis activities.
Methods
Chinese medicine theory, network pharmacology analyses, and antioxidant activity coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses were used to identify potential bioactive compounds. HT-29 human colorectal cancer cell culture and xenograft tumor models were employed to study anti-colorectal cancer efficacy. Lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 and 5-FU treated Dark Agouti rats were used to evaluate anti-inflammatory and anti-mucositis activities. Histological staining, immunofluorescence imaging, western blots, and flow cytometric analyses were employed to explore the underlying mechanisms.
Results
Both Chinese medicine theory and network pharmacology analyses indicated pomegranate peels as a potential anti-colorectal cancer and anti-mucositis agent. Antioxidant activity coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses revealed granatin B and punicalagin as the most potent antioxidant compounds in pomegranate peels. Granatin B and punicalagin demonstrated superior anti-colorectal cancer activities in both cell culture and xenograft tumor models. Granatin B and punicalagin also exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activities in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells and anti-mucositis activities in 5-FU-treated rats. Mechanistic studies revealed that granatin B and punicalagin induced reactive oxygen species-mediated S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Moreover, these compounds sensitized HT-29 cells to 5-FU-induced cell death and S-phase cell cycle arrest.
Conclusion
We report that granatin B and punicalagin exhibit superior anti-colorectal cancer and anti-mucositis activities. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel and suggest that utilizing phenols from herbal medicine, such as granatin B and punicalagin, to target reactive oxygen species may be an innovative therapy to treat colorectal cancer and intestinal mucositis.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a history of over 3000 years of medical practice. Due to the complex ingredients and unclear pharmacological mechanism of TCM, it is very difficult to predict its risks. With the increase in the number and severity of spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of TCM, its safety has received widespread attention.
Aim of the study
In this study, we proposed a framework based on deep learning to predict the probability of adverse reactions caused by TCM ingredients and validated the model using real-world data.
Materials and methods
The spontaneous reporting data from Jiangsu Province of China was selected as the research data, which included 72,561 ADR reports of TCMs. All the ingredients of these TCMs were collected from the medical website and correlated with the corresponding ADRs. Then, a risk prediction model was constructed based on a deep neural network (DNN), named TIRPnet. Based on one-hot encoded data, our model achieved the optimal performance by fine-tuning some hyperparameters. The ten most commonly used TCM ingredients and their ADRs were collected as the test set to evaluate their performance as objective criteria.
Results
TIRPnet was constructed as a 7-layer DNN. The experimental results showed that TIRPnet performs excellently in all indicators, with a sensitivity of 0.950, specificity of 0.995, accuracy of 0.994, precision of 0.708, and F1 of 0.811.
Conclusions
The proposed TIRPnet owns the ability to predict the ADRs of a single TCM ingredient by learning a large number of TCM-related spontaneous reports, which can help doctors design safe prescriptions and provide technical support for the pharmacovigilance of TCM.}

abstract = {Adopting healthy behaviors is a multifaceted and complex process that poses significant challenges for individuals. Despite awareness of the detrimental effects of certain behaviors on health, many individuals continue to engage in risky practices. Traditional medical advice and prescriptions, while well intentioned, often fall short in fostering lasting lifestyle changes. Although individuals may also have good intentions, solely relying on doctor's counsel does not ensure successful lifestyle adjustments. One primary reason for this limitation is the lack of specialized expertise in behavioral modification among gynecologists and healthcare providers. Health psychologists are specialized professionals capable of effectively guiding and assisting individuals in modifying health-related behaviors. Their expertise in behavior change strategies and psychological interventions proves invaluable in empowering individuals to embrace healthier lifestyles and contributes to people's well-being. This paper emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts between medical professionals, such as gynecologists, and health psychologists to promote healthy behaviors among peri- and postmenopausal women and enhance women's health. By forging integrative alliances, they can develop comprehensive and tailored interventions. By bridging the gap between medical advice and behavior modification, this collaborative effort has the potential to ensure a more effective intervention process. This holistic approach not only addresses women's specific health needs but also fosters sustainable behavior change when promoting healthy behaviors among middle-aged women. The ultimate goal of such a synergy is to improve women's health outcomes and contribute to a healthier society overall.}

abstract = {Background
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic nonspecific inflammatory disease that causes a heavy burden and lacks effective treatments. Chinese herbal medicine prescriptions (CHMPs), which are characterized by a synergistic usage of herbs, are widely used in the management of IBD. The molecular mechanisms of action of CHMP are still ambiguous as the canonical “one-compound-one-target” approach has difficulty describing the dynamic bioreactions among CHMP objects. It seems more flexible to define the holism of CHMP for IBD by employing high-throughput analysis. However, studies that discuss the development of CHMP in treating IBD in a holistic view are still lacking.
Purpose
This review appraised preclinical and clinical research to fully describe the anti-IBD capacity of CHMPs and discussed CHMPs’ holistic characteristics that can contribute to better management of IBD.
Methods & results
We screened clinical and preclinical references of CHMP being used as treatments for IBD. We discussed the complexity of IBD and the development of CHMP to present the sophistication of CHMP treatments. To describe the clinical effectiveness of CHMPs against IBD, we performed an umbrella review of CHMP-associated META analyses, in which 1174 records were filtered down to 12 references. Then, we discussed 14 kinds of CHMPs that had a long history of use and analyzed their mechanisms of action. Representative herbs were employed to provide a subordinate explanation for the whole prescription. As holism is the dominant characteristic of CHMPs, we explored applications of CHMPs for IBD with the help of omics, gut microbiome, and network pharmacology, which are potential approaches to a dynamic figure of bioactions of CHMPs.
Conclusion
This review is the first to discuss the potential of CHMPs to manage IBD in a holistic context and will provide inspiring explanations for CHMP applications for further product transformation and application to other diseases.}

1. Recognize the multiple palliative care domains and clinical competencies associated with caring for patients with hematologic malignancies 2. Define the three subpopulations of patients with hematologic malignancies being cared for in the inpatient setting
Objective
To assess and improve clinical competencies for hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) fellowship trainees across multiple domains related to patients with hematologic malignancies
Methods
From July 2021 to June 2022, four HPM fellows at North Shore University Hospital participated in a novel 2-week rotation focused on early palliative medicine for several populations of patients with hematologic malignancies. This rotation was named C.H.A.S.E. (Cellular therapies, Hematologic malignancies, And Stem cell transplant Experience). Each fellow participated in a self-administered survey before the rotation to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and practice across 12 domains related to patients with hematologic malignancies. The rotation consisted of four parts: 1) providing palliative consultation for stem cell transplant patients, cellular therapy patients, or leukemia patients; 2) self-directed learning from an 8-day curriculum using an inverted classroom model; 3) conducting targeted chart reviews to reinforce reading; and 4) delivering two capstone presentations on the last day highlighting a specific disease (e.g., APL) or treatment modality (e.g., CAR-T), and addressing a clinical question utilizing vignettes. At the conclusion of the rotation, the fellows completed the same survey.
Results
All four fellows completed the pre- and post-rotation surveys. Overall, there was a substantial increase across all domains of knowledge, attitudes, and practice. Survey components included questions regarding exposure to patient populations and familiarity with diagnosis, prognosis, disease and treatment-related symptom burden, treatment indications and adverse effects, and patient/caregiver reported outcomes.
Conclusion
As palliative medicine moves upstream for patients with hematologic malignancies, workforce development involving this population will be paramount for trainees. The C.H.A.S.E. rotation for HPM fellows enhances exposure and cultivates expertise in recognizing the complexities within this cohort. Broader adoption of innovative rotations may foster greater access to palliative care for hematologic malignancy patients and deepen fellows' knowledge base.}

abstract = {The sensitive and selective determination of the active ingredient in medicines has become an inescapable challenge in the sensing field. With the concerns above, an electrochemical sensor has been designed based on theoretically optimized bioenzyme-induced molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the specific determination of protocatechuic acid (PA) for the first time. In detail, the LaFeO3 nanosphere is employed as the carrier to support bovine hemoglobin (BHb) and biomimetic enzyme Au nanoparticles, which can decompose hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals. These hydroxyl radicals can initiate polymerization to afford the optimized MIPs. More importantly, density functional theory based on computational chemistry is utilized to deduce the optimal functional monomer, resulting in the best recognition effect. Subsequently, the pre-fabricated electrochemical sensor based on LaFeO3 @Au@BHb-MIPs could achieve the specific determination of PA with a wide linear detection range of 0.2 μM to 1000 μM and the limit of detection of 55 nM. Meanwhile, the specific recognition of PA in traditional Chinese medicines such as hibiscus has been also accomplished with satisfactory recoveries, foreboding that the LaFeO3 @Au@BHb-MIPs is indeed a suitable candidate for monitoring medication safety.}
