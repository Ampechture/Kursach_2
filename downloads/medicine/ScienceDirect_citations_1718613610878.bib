abstract = {Abstract:
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), being a reproductive endocrine disorder, is characterized by multiple ovarian cysts; chronic anovulation because of hyperandrogenism leading to menstrual disturbance; hirsutism; acne; and metabolic dysfunction. Because of its complex etiology, its pathogenesis involves the interplay of endocrine, genetic, and environmental factors. To date, there is no specific, compliant, promising treatment for PCOS. Therefore it is direly needed to develop a compliant and efficacious alternative treatment with minimal adverse effects and maximum patient compliance. This chapter reviews the efficacy of complementary and alternative treatments, including mechanistic evidence for the use of herbal remedies, nuts, vitamins, and indigenous functional foods to counter the burden of PCOS with maximal efficacy and minimal side effects. Studies have revealed that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments are cardioprotective and have a beneficial role as antiinflammatory agents in the mainstream line for restoring metabolic, endocrine, and reproductive disturbances. In PCOS patients, they decrease ovarian reserve and improve subfertility. Nevertheless, available studies are nonrandomized and uncontrolled in this context. Therefore extensive research with well-designed studies is required in the future to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAM in PCOS.}

Orthopaedic surgeons should critically evaluate clinical research that shows no statistically significant difference between groups to rule out a β error, given that underpowered studies are particularly prone to fragility. If an orthopaedic trial reports statistically insignificant results, this does not mean the results are clinically insignificant.}

Here, we summarize the current knowledge on eight promising drugs and natural compounds that have been tested in the clinic: metformin, NAD+ precursors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, TORC1 inhibitors, spermidine, senolytics, probiotics, and anti-inflammatories. Multiple clinical trials have commenced to evaluate the efficacy of such agents against age-associated diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. There are reasonable expectations that drugs able to decelerate or reverse aging processes will also exert broad disease-preventing or -attenuating effects. Hence, the outcome of past, ongoing, and future disease-specific trials may pave the way to the development of new anti-aging medicines. Drugs approved for specific disease indications may subsequently be repurposed for the treatment of organism-wide aging consequences.}

Impaired wound healing is a serious diabetes complication compromising patients’ quality of life. However, the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds (DWs) remains incompletely understood. Human epidermal keratinocyte (HEK) is the sentinel cell that initiates healing processes after the epidermal integrity has been disrupted.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the functional roles of HEKs in wound healing and to identify candidate genes, signaling pathways and molecular signatures contributing to the DWs.
Methods
HEKs were cultured in normal or high-glucose environment, followed by scratch, to mimic the microenvironment of normal wounds and DWs. Subsequently, we performed RNA sequencing and systematically analyzed the expression profiles by bioinformatics approaches.
Results
High-glucose environment altered the keratinocyte transcriptome responses to wounding. In experimental model of DWs, we found that TNF, CYP24A1, NR4A3 and GGT1 were key overexpressed genes in keratinocytes and were implicated in multiple cellular responses. Further analysis showed that wounding in high-glucose environment activated G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling, and adrenomedullin signaling in keratinocytes, while dysregulated skin development and immune responses as compared to their counterpart in normal glucose settings.
Conclusion
This simplified in-vitro model serves as a valuable tool to gain insights into the molecular basis of DWs and to facilitate establishment of personalized therapies in clinical practice}

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism, resulting from removal and/or devascularization of one or more parathyroid glands, is a feared complication of total thyroidectomy. Two forms, which are distinguished by their frequency, their time to onset and their duration as well as by their presentation, must be individualized: early postoperative hypocalcemia, often secondary to early hypoparathyroidism is a frequent and often transient situation occurring within the first days after surgery; permanent hypoparathyroidism, which is rarer, manifests when parathyroid function remains impaired for more than six months after surgery. Because of their severity, these conditions must be known and ideally prevented during total thyroidectomy. The objective of this article is to provide surgeons with practical recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hypoparathyroidism after total thyroidectomy. These recommendations, which are the fruit of a medico-surgical consensus, were developed by the Francophone Association of Endocrine Surgery (AFCE), the French Society of Endocrinology (SFE) and the French Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.

abstract = {Objective
Numerous studies have demonstrated the close relationship between chronic stress and blood pressure (BP). Hypertensive subjects exhibit exaggerated reactions to stress, especially higher BP. The mechanisms by which stress affects pre-existing hypertension still need to be explored. Danzhi Xiaoyao Powder (DP), a historical traditional Chinese medicine formula, is a promising treatment for BP control in hypertensive patients under stress. The present study investigated the metabolomic disruption caused by chronic stress and the treatment effect and mechanism of DP.
Methods
Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 4 weeks. BP was measured via the tail-cuff method, and anxiety-like behavior was quantified using the elevated-plus-maze test. Meanwhile, DP was administered intragastrically, and its effects were observed. Global metabolomic analysis was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, followed by multivariate statistical analysis to detect differential metabolites and pathways.
Results
DP alleviated the CRS-induced increase in BP and anxiety-like behavior. Systematic metabolic differences were found among the three study groups. A total of 29 differential plasma metabolites were identified in both positive- and negative-ion modes. These metabolites were involved in triglyceride metabolism, amino acid (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and glycine) metabolism, and steroid hormone pathways.
Conclusion
These findings expose the metabolomic disturbances induced by chronic stress in SHRs and suggest an innovative treatment for this disorder.}

In response to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Dying in America, we undertook an institution wide effort to improve the experience of patients and families facing serious illness by engaging leadership and developing a program to promote the practice of generalist palliative care.
Measures
The impact of the program was measured with process measures related to its’ three parts.
Intervention
We developed a three-part generalist palliative care program that focuses on 1) instructional design, 2) advance care planning, and 3) engagement.
Outcomes
Over four years, the program trained 51 interprofessional clinicians in a two-week intensive palliative care course and 1,541 interprofessional clinicians in a 90–150 min skills-based training. Clinicians documented 15,791 serious illness conversations. Zoom community engagement sessions were attended by 411 live viewers, and subsequently, 1918 YouTube views. Additionally, we report on the impact of the COIVD-19 crisis on our efforts. Early in the pandemic, over two months, 464 interprofessional clinicians documented 5,168 conversations with patients.
Conclusion/Lessons Learned
A broad based strategy resulted wide institutional engagement with serious illness care.}

We systematically reviewed PubMed articles published between 2008 and 2022 and reviewed reference lists of included articles to identify additional publications. See Search Strategy for more details. Several randomized trials of medication abortion between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks of gestation demonstrate that mifepristone 200 mg orally before misoprostol increases effectiveness (complete abortion at 24 or 48 hours) compared to misoprostol only. Studies continue to evaluate different doses, routes, and dosing intervals for misoprostol. If mifepristone is unavailable, several misoprostol regimens with individual doses of at least 200 mcg or more are effective. Adjunctive osmotic dilators are of limited benefit. It is important to individualize care, with consideration to reducing misoprostol dose in low-resource settings or at 24 0/7 weeks of gestation or later (or equivalent uterine size). Misoprostol in the setting of two or more previous cesarean sections is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture compared to one or none, but risk remains low. Most contraceptives can be started during or immediately following abortion. Appropriately trained and credentialed advanced practice clinicians can provide medication abortion between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks of gestation with appropriate backup within the confines of local regulations and licensure.}

abstract = {Background
Kabasura Kudineer (KSK) is a Siddha polyherbal decoction recommended by the Ministry of AYUSH and the Tamil Nadu government to prevent and manage COVID-19 in India.
Objective(s)
We aimed to determine the outcome of integrated therapy for COVID-19 using KSK in virologic clearance and length of hospital stay.
Materials and methods
It was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study. We included the COVID-19 patients admitted to SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai, during May–June 2020. KSK was administered along with the standard of care for all the patients. We collected data pertaining to demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters and presented as frequencies and proportions.
Results
We collected 204 COVID-19 positive patients’ data. The mean (SD) age was 39.5 (13.4) years with a range of 13–79. Majority of the patients were male (n = 157; 77%), 28% (n = 58) had any co-morbidities, and 61% (n = 131) had mild symptoms. Fever (n = 57; 27.9%) and cough (n = 53; 25.9%) were the commonly reported symptoms. Paracetamol (n = 135; 66.7%) and Zincovit (n = 197, 96.6%) were the commonly administered medicines along with KSK. About 74% of asymptomatic (n = 54) and 65% of mild symptomatic (n = 85) patients turned negative for COVID-19 in RT-PCR within 4–7 days. There was a significant difference in the blood parameters (p < 0.05) after the integrated treatment.
Conclusion
The use of KSK with standard care of treatment in COVID-19 treatment had notable results in the duration taken for virologic clearance, thereby reducing the length of hospital stay and improvement in laboratory parameters.}

We report a novel fracture fixation treatment by applying a hydroxyapatite (HA) based biomaterial at the bone-implant interface and biologically activating the biomaterial by systemic administration of a bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid, ZA). We first used an animal model of implant integration and applied a calcium sulphate (CaS)/HA biomaterial around a metallic screw in the tibia of osteoporotic rats. Using systemic ZA administration at 2-weeks post-surgery, we demonstrated that the implant surrounded by HA particles showed significantly higher peri‑implant bone formation compared to the unaugmented implants at 6-weeks. We then evaluated the optimal timing (day 1, 3, 7 and 14) of ZA administration to achieve a robust effect on peri‑implant bone formation. Using fluorescent ZA, we demonstrated that the uptake of ZA in the CaS/HA material was the highest at 3- and 7-days post-implantation and the uptake kinetics had a profound effect on the eventual peri‑implant bone formation. We furthered our concept in a feasibility study on trochanteric fracture patients randomized to either CaS/HA augmentation or no augmentation followed by systemic ZA treatment. Radiographically, the CaS/HA group showed signs of increased peri‑implant bone formation compared with the controls. Finally, apart from HA, we demonstrated that the concept of biologically activating a ceramic material by ZA could also be applied to β-tricalcium phosphate. This novel approach for fracture treatment that enhances immediate and long-term fracture fixation in osteoporotic bone could potentially reduce reoperations, morbidity and mortality.
Statement of significance
• Fracture fixation in an ageing population is challenging. Biomaterial-based augmentation of fracture fixation devices has been attempted but lack of satisfactory biological response limits their widespread use. • We report the biological activation of locally implanted microparticulate hydroxyapatite (HA) particles placed around an implant by systemic administration of the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZA). The biological activation of HA by ZA enhances peri‑implant bone formation. •Timing of ZA administration after HA implantation is critical for optimal ZA uptake and consequently determines the extent of peri‑implant bone formation. • We translate the developed concept from small animal models of implant integration to a proof-of-concept clinical study on osteoporotic trochanteric fracture patients. • ZA based biological activation can also be applied to other calcium phosphate biomaterials.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Rare biallelic pathogenic mutations in PCSK1 (encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 [PC1/3]) cause early-onset obesity associated with various endocrinopathies. Setmelanotide has been approved for carriers of these biallelic mutations in the past 3 years. We aimed to perform a large-scale functional genomic study focusing on rare heterozygous variants of PCSK1 to decipher their putative impact on obesity risk.
Methods
This case-control study included all participants with overweight and obesity (ie, cases) or healthy weight (ie, controls) from the RaDiO study of three community-based and one hospital-based cohort in France recruited between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2000. In adults older than 18 years, healthy weight was defined as BMI of less than 25·0 kg/m2, overweight as 25·0–29·9 kg/m2, and obesity as 30·0 kg/m2 or higher. Participants with type 2 diabetes had fasting glucose of 7·0 mmol/L or higher or used treatment for hyperglycaemia (or both) and were negative for islet or insulin autoantibodies. Functional assessment of rare missense variants of PCSK1 was performed. Pathogenicity clusters of variants were determined with machine learning. The effect of each cluster of PCSK1 variants on obesity was assessed using the adjusted mixed-effects score test.
Findings
All 13 coding exons of PCSK1 were sequenced in 9320 participants (including 7260 adults and 2060 children and adolescents) recruited from the RaDiO study. We detected 65 rare heterozygous PCSK1 variants, including four null variants and 61 missense variants that were analysed in vitro and clustered into five groups (A–E), according to enzymatic activity. Compared with the wild-type, 15 missense variants led to complete PC1/3 loss of function (group A; reference) and rare exome variant ensemble learner (REVEL) led to 15 (25%) false positives and four (7%) false negatives. Carrying complete loss-of-function or null PCSK1 variants was significantly associated with obesity (six [86%] of seven carriers vs 1518 [35%] of 4395 non-carriers; OR 9·3 [95% CI 1·5–177·4]; p=0·014) and higher BMI (32·0 kg/m2 [SD 9·3] in carriers vs 27·3 kg/m2 [6·5] in non-carriers; mean effect π 6·94 [SE 1·95]; p=0·00029). Clusters of PCSK1 variants with partial or neutral effect on PC1/3 activity did not have an effect on obesity or overweight and on BMI.
Interpretation
Only carriers of heterozygous, null, or complete loss-of-function PCSK1 variants cause monogenic obesity and, therefore, might be eligible for setmelanotide. In silico tests were unable to accurately detect these variants, which suggests that in vitro assays are necessary to determine the variant pathogenicity for genetic diagnosis and precision medicine purposes.

abstract = {Background
Medicine food homology (MFH) refers to food that can be used as medicine, and compounds isolated from MFH materials are valuable in novel drug discovery due to their good safety. Transcriptome signature reversion (TSR) is an attractive method for discovering drugs through transcriptional reverse matching; namely, the changes in transcriptional signatures induced by compounds are matched to a certain disease. This strategy can be used to discover anti-influenza agents among MFH natural compounds.
Purpose
MFH natural compounds with anti-influenza activities were identified through analyses of the reversal in the expression of multiple informative genes followed by in vitro evaluation of the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by influenza infection and relative quantification of the nucleoprotein (NP) gene in viral RNA (vRNA). The combined effect of active compounds was determined through network-based separation score prediction followed by quantification of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) level.
Methods
The transcriptome profiles of 4 lung or airway cell lines infected with 7 influenza virus strains were analyzed by robust rank aggregation (RRA) to identify informative genes in the signature of influenza virus infection. The identified informative genes were then matched to a transcriptomic profile library of MFH natural compounds. The anti-influenza activities of MFH natural compounds with negative enrichment scores (ESs) were evaluated in vitro using a CPE assay and relative quantification of the NP gene in the vRNA in the supernatant and cytoplasm to identify anti-influenza agents. The effects of combinations of active compounds were analyzed using network-based calculations followed by confirmation through bioassays for quantifying the viral HA levels.
Results
Among the 159 MFH natural compounds, 54 compounds had negative ESs, as determined through TSR, and the anti-influenza activities of nardosinone and aurantio-obtusin were confirmed by bioassays. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of nardosinone and aurantio-obtusin were 4.3-84.4 μM and 31.9-113.6 μM, respectively. The separation score between the informative genes with expression that was negatively regulated by nardosinone and aurantio-obtusin in the human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was calculated to be 0.10, which indicated that the two compounds potentially exert a synergistic effect, and this effect was confirmed by the finding that the combination indexes (CIs) were calculated to equal 0.86 at inhibition level of 50% and 0.44 at inhibition level of 90%.
Conclusion
The TSR analysis and in vitro evaluation identified nardosinone and aurantio-obtusin as anti-influenza agents. Their antiviral activities were exerted by reversing the expression of multiple informative genes of the host cells. The separation analysis between the informative genes that were reversely regulated by nardosinone and aurantio-obtusin indicated that their combination may exert a synergistic effect, which was confirmed in vitro.}

The electronic health record has dramatically improved the safety of medical care as well as the clarity and accessibility of the notes. An equally profound, but under-recognised consequence, is the effect it has had on ‘patient ownership’ and responsibility within the hospital. It is now very easy to access and read through patients notes, from a distance and at scale, to identify patients for attention. Automated alerts can be set for quantitative laboratory or physiological variables, for the same purpose, and artificial intelligence is being developed for alerts based on free text or radiographic interpretation. This article explores the risk of this approach to healthcare and the danger of a ‘collusion of anonymity’, whereby responsibility for care is sufficiently diffuse that no one has ownership of a patient’s care.}

Reflect on the experience of young adults and families facing serious illness as they transition from pediatric to adult medicine, including the impact on medical decision making and end-of-life care 2. Describe challenges and strategies for providers and teams navigating this transition from both the pediatric and adult medicine perspective For young adults living with serious illnesses, the transition from pediatrics to adult medical care can be challenging and traumatic, especially if this transition occurs alongside disease progression and complex decision making. Two pediatric palliative clinicians will share their experience preparing patients and families for this transition. For these clinicians, preparing patients is nuanced and complex, as family-centered care is a core tenet of pediatric medicine. Clinicians must establish rapport and trust-building during conversations regarding future planning and adjustment. Fostering independence in a patient whose physical function or coping are regressing can be challenging, and the adolescent's perceived and legal level of autonomy can be conflicting. An adult palliative care clinician will share her experience supporting patients and families in this transition. Adult clinicians often feel unprepared to care for patients and families who are accustomed to pediatric care norms. Assuming this role often requires a paradigm shift and different approaches to communication, family dynamics, and shared decision-making. Additional challenges include lack of familiarity with traditionally “pediatric” illnesses, recognition of discordance between a patient's emotional and chronological maturity level, and navigation of intricacies around information-sharing. For patients and families, this transition can feel abrupt, arbitrary, and traumatic, as patients leave longitudinal providers and meet new teams. One parent will share her family's experience of transitioning to the adult setting amid cystic fibrosis disease progression. She will reflect on difficult decisions faced regarding lung transplantation possibilities, family relocation, long-term management of a multi-drug resistant bacterium, and, ultimately, end-of-life care and information sharing. She will highlight her daughter's increased physical and emotional vulnerability and corresponding need for increased familial involvement and support during this challenging time, particularly around medical decision making. Panel and audience participants will have an opportunity to integrate discussed themes into best practice.}

abstract = {Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder that affects approximately 1:20,000 males. It is caused by mutations in the F9 gene that encodes for the factor IX (FIX) protein, an essential enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The current recommended therapy for hemophilia B patients is prophylactic administration of exogenous FIX derived from recombinant protein. The short biological half-life of FIX requires frequent infusions to maintain therapeutic level. More recently, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based gene therapy, etranacogene dezaparvovec, has been approved for some adults as a potential new option. Despite these advances, there remains a significant unmet medical need in hemophilia B. Intravenous infusions of weekly (or more frequently, 3 times per week) factor replacements are an enormous burden to patients and their caregivers. Gene therapy, while a promising option for some, carries potential for significant risk. Importantly, the limitations associated with increasing the dose of FIX needed to treat pediatric patients as they age make immunogenic AAV-based gene therapy inappropriate for this patient population. Terminally differentiated human plasma cells derived from genetically engineered B cells (termed B Cell Medicines, BeCMs), potentially offer natural longevity (persisting for decades), capacity for high levels of protein secretion (thousands of Ig molecules/cell/sec), the ability to engraft without host preconditioning, and the ability to re-dose, making them an attractive platform for the sustained supply of biologics where continuous dosing is required to achieve therapeutic benefit. We have developed an ex vivo precision engineered BeCM platform with modularity and broad therapeutic utility. In this study, primary human B cells were isolated, activated, and engineered by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing followed by AAV-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) insertion of human F9 gene into the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) safe harbor locus. The cells were then further expanded and differentiated towards the plasma cell lineage, resulting in FIX-producing BeCMs. We achieved approximately 40% targeted integration as measured by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Engineered BeCMs secreted up to 60 ng/1e6 cells/hour of FIX protein, approaching 40% of IgG secretion rate as measured by ELISA. BeCM-produced FIX was analyzed by LC-MS which demonstrated gamma carobxylation of FIX protein Gal-domain. Vitamin K-dependent activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), using the one stage clotting assay, was employed to verify biological activity of BeCM-produced FIX. Similarly, FIX-expressing BeCMs exhibited vitamin K-dependent activity in vitro in the chromogenic assay. FIX-expressing BeCMs were transferred into immunodeficient NOG-hIL6 mice, with FIX production demonstrated at least 20 weeks in vivo. The safety of FIX-expressing BeCMs has been characterized based on 28-day and 5-month in vivo studies in NOG-hIL6 mice. Neither abnormal clinical observations nor mortality were observed in those studies. Biodistribution of the FIX expressing BeCM product was assessed using a qPCR assay. The qPCR data confirms the expected biodistribution of FIX-expressing BeCMs, which engraft and persist in bone marrow tissue over time. In summary, we have developed an ex vivo precision gene engineered B cell medicine that produces active and sustained levels of FIX for the treatment of hemophilia B. The potential therapeutic application of this unique biologic delivery system could afford a novel treatment modality for hemophilia B.}

abstract = {Background
Dysosma versipellis (D. versipellis) and Phyllanthus urinaria (P. urinaria) are two typical Chinese herbs with diverse chemical composition and affluent pharmacological activities. Yet, the specific bioactive components with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects and corresponding mechanisms remain unclear.
Purpose
The aim of this study was to screen for the specific constituents with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities from the anti-HBV formulation.
Study design
The anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities of D. versipellis, P. urinaria and the anti-HBV formulation extracts were evaluated by in vitro ACE2 and COX-2 inhibitory assays. Affinity ultrafiltration combining liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry (UF-LC/MS) with COX-2, ACE2, and NTCP was conducted according to its empirical traditional use, and then molecular docking analysis was applied to validate the activity of the ligands.
Methods
An efficient strategy was employed to screen bioactive compounds from the anti-HBV formulation. Corresponding activities of the extracts or phytochemicals were confirmed by inhibitor screening kits or docking simulation.
Results
A total of 8, 3 and 8 phytochemicals exerting distinct affinities with COX-2, ACE2 or NTCP were rapidly screened out and characterized from D. versipellis, P. urinaria and the anti-HBV formulation, respectively. Thereafter, the interaction between the specific binding ligands, namely dehydropodophyllotoxin, β-apopicropodophyllin, quercetin, and COX-2, ACE2 or NTCP was further simulated by docking analysis, and the results were well correspondent with the UF results. Noticeably, the interaction network among multiple component-target-activity correlations was for the first time constructed in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of action exerting its therapeutic effects for the anti-HBV formulation, which was also better in accordance with the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory.
Conclusion
The present study showcased an integrative strategy that could offer not only a puissant tool to screen for active constituents from this anti-HBV formulation, and further help to unveil its underlying mechanisms, but also provide an alternative platform for discovering new candidate drugs for anti-inflammation and anti-virus from other medicinal plants in the near future.}

abstract = {The global interest in natural dyes and pigments is now high relating to public awareness of the medicinal uses of natural dyes and pigments. They are a nontoxic substitute for the poisonous synthetic dyes and pigments that are wreaking havoc on the environment. Moreover, numerous synthetic dyes and pigments have been forbidden due to their potential to trigger allergic reactions or to be malignancies. The harmful compounds generated by synthetic dyes and pigments can really be significantly reduced by employing natural dyes and pigments. Natural dyes and pigments are obtained from natural resources, i.e., plants, animals, insects, minerals, and microorganisms. A few types of medicinal plants and trees (including seeds, roots, barks, stems, leaves, peels, flowers, and fruits) are often used as natural dyes and pigments, i.e., yarrow, chamomile, oak, rosemary, wormwood, marigolds, goldenrod, tagetes, saffron, safflower, henna, indigo, watermelon, pomegranate, carrot, turmeric, etc. Likewise, animals and insects, i.e., dried insect shells of sea snails, cochineal, lac kermes mollusks, octopus, etc., are also used as natural dyes and pigments. Some minerals like rock, earth crust, ocher, limonite azure blue, etc., and microorganisms such as fungi, algae, bacteria, lichens, etc., are popular as natural dyes and pigments. However, plant and tree-based dyes and pigments have a huge variety of medicinal benefits among the entire natural dyes and pigments. They have recently been famous for their structural and protective functions, despite the fact that they are being used for dyeing and medicinal purposes for a long time. Because of the inclusion of quinone, phenol, and tannin, several plant dyes and pigments are discovered to have amazing antibacterial characteristics. Therefore, the principles of the basic chemistry of natural dyes and pigments as a source of medicine, as well as their medicinal benefits discovered in natural dye-producing plants, animals, insects, minerals, and microorganisms are strongly discussed in this chapter, which will aid in the development of future medicinal formulations.}

Thanks to discoveries in immunology, our world has seen tremendous progress in how we understand and treat disease. However, a lot of unmet clinical needs remain, which require focused, real-time collaboration at the clinical and scientific research forefronts. Moreover, the current exponential growth in the generation of research data makes it impossible to handle, analyze, visualize, and interpret such data without the use of advanced computational tools. We think immunoinformatics- a discipline at the intersection of immunology and computer science- will greatly increase efficiency in research productivity and disease treatment. This perspective paper aims to emphasize the role of immunoinformatics toward pushing the boundaries of immunology research. It will also illustrate its clinical applications, including disease prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, monitoring, as well as in drug discovery. We believe informatics approaches will be implemented increasingly more frequently in research. Thus, here we also discuss a set of fundamental prerequisites to facilitate the efficient and ethical integration of informatics in research and ensure immunological advancements provide maximum benefits to society.}

Understanding the biological and clinical impact of copy number aberrations (CNAs) on the development of precision therapies in cancer remains an unmet challenge. Genetic amplification of chromosome 1q (chr1q-amp) is a major CNA conferring an adverse prognosis in several types of cancer, including in the blood cancer multiple myeloma (MM). Although several genes across chromosome 1 (chr1q) portend high-risk MM disease, the underpinning molecular etiology remains elusive. Here, with reference to the 3-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure, we integrate multi-omics data sets from patients with MM with genetic variables to obtain an associated clinical risk map across chr1q and to identify 103 adverse prognosis genes in chr1q-amp MM. Prominent among these genes, the transcription factor PBX1 is ectopically expressed by genetic amplification and epigenetic activation of its own preserved 3D regulatory domain. By binding to reprogrammed superenhancers, PBX1 directly regulates critical oncogenic pathways and a FOXM1-dependent transcriptional program. Together, PBX1 and FOXM1 activate a proliferative gene signature that predicts adverse prognosis across multiple types of cancer. Notably, pharmacological disruption of the PBX1-FOXM1 axis with existing agents (thiostrepton) and a novel PBX1 small molecule inhibitor (T417) is selectively toxic against chr1q-amp myeloma and solid tumor cells. Overall, our systems medicine approach successfully identifies CNA-driven oncogenic circuitries, links them to clinical phenotypes, and proposes novel CNA-targeted therapy strategies in MM and other types of cancer.}

abstract = {In recent years, isothiocyanates (ITCs), bioactive compounds primarily derived from Brassicaceae vegetables and herbs, have gained significant attention within the biomedical field due to their versatile biological effects. This comprehensive review provides an in-depth exploration of the therapeutic potential and individual biological mechanisms of the three specific ITCs phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), and benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), as well as their collective impact within the formulation of ANGOCIN® Anti-Infekt N (Angocin). Angocin comprises horseradish root (Armoracia rusticanae radix, 80 mg) and nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba, 200 mg) and is authorized for treating inflammatory diseases affecting the respiratory and urinary tract. The antimicrobial efficacy of this substance has been confirmed both in vitro and in various clinical trials, with its primary effectiveness attributed to ITCs. PEITC, AITC, and BITC exhibit a wide array of health benefits, including potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties, along with noteworthy anticancer potentials. Moreover, we highlight their ability to modulate critical biochemical pathways, such as the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways, shedding light on their involvement in cellular apoptosis and their intricate role to guide immune responses.}

A healthy lifestyle, including physical activity and exercise, is increasingly seen as an important component of the physical, mental, and overall well-being of patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD). No medication can positively influence as many organ systems as physical activity and exercise. The positive effect of exercise appears to be even more significant in NMD than in the healthy population: an increasing number of trials show that exercise can slow down disease progression. Exercise is not a medicine but a lifestyle. It will have to be applied for as long as possible. It is important to let patients adhere to an active lifestyle from an early age to take full advantage of this effect. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that explain the beneficial effects of exercise in NMD is fundamental to optimising exercise interventions in general and tailoring optimal interventions to single patients. Possible underlying mechanisms of effect lie in inhibiting inflammation, epigenetics and on the mental level: positively implementing exercise can increase patients' self-efficacy. Physical activity as part of psychological treatment has been proven to be an effective intervention in several studies. But we are still far from there: there is a great need for research into the underlying mechanisms of effect, which can also be helpful in the development of medication. Finally, there is still much to be gained in tailor-made exercises to prevent over- and under-exertion.}

Herbal medication has been used for thousands of years. Although synergic efficiency of compound herbal medicine to humans have been explored for years, detailed mechanisms behind this "cocktail" medication still required open for discussion.
Method
With electrochemical inspections, this feasibility study tended to decipher combined interactions of synergy and antagonism of Levodopa (L-DOPA) and tea extracts of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze (green tea) and Camelliaboreali-yunnanica (black tea) extracted from different temperatures via total phenolics concentrations, DPPH free radical scavenging ability, bioelectricity-generating capability of microbial fuel cells for bioenergy expression.
Significance of findings
According to replacement series and concentration addition (CA) methods, the most significant synergistic effect was quantitatively disclosed at the ratio of L-DOPA: tea extract at 80:20. This work provided the novel means revealing synergic efficacy of herbal medicine via the perspective of bioenergy extraction for medication. The rankings of power-stimulating efficiency in DC-MFC modules were HG2 > CG2 > HR2 > CR2. The replacement-series method indicated that both L-DOPA and tea extracts did not own tendency to out-compete each other. The CA method revealed that both L-DOPA and tea extracts were dis-similar and synergistic in action of bioenergy extraction. The most promising ratio of interactive synergy is L-DOPA: tea extract at 80:20.}

1. Understand the value of using social media to market your palliative medicine program 2. Explain how social media can be used for palliative medicine education 3. Use digital media to build a medical reputation and create the foundation of a doctor-patient relationship and build trust before the initial patient visit
Background
In Trinidad and Tobago, there are no formalized home palliative care services. Care is established sporadically by primary care physicians but is limited by lack of education, access, affordability, and misconception of the palliative philosophy. Additionally, there is no after-hours at home care model equipped with a multidisciplinary team with access to staff, emergency medications, and equipment. Palliative medicine is often stigmatized as care at the time of death, which can deter patients from seeking help from the onset of a diagnosis. This results in referral at a very late stage of disease, high symptom burden, and decreased quality of life for patients with serious illnesses and their caregivers.
Aim Statement
To advance the specialty of palliative medicine via a social media educational strategy to help achieve equity and access to care.
Methods
We aimed to educate the population about palliative medicine through the use of a variety of social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and LinkedIn. Although not many medical professionals use social media for professional purposes, we saw the value in doing so and in disseminating key information to target audiences and increasing referrals.
Results
Between January and June 2021, LivHealth received 90 new patients (15, 7, 7, 5, 24, and 32 patients from January to June, respectively). Of those 90 patients, 57 (63%) came from social media. On Instagram alone, LivHealth's medical posts were seen by 91,394 people in Trinidad and Tobago and shared 4,767 times, informational posts were saved by 886 people for future reference, and 465 conversations were started, with no advertising spend.
Conclusions and Implications
Through social media, we increased patient volume increased and were able to increase access to palliative medicine for those who most need it.}

We systematically reviewed PubMed articles published between 2008 and 2022 and reviewed reference lists of included articles to identify additional publications. See Search Strategy for more details. Several randomized trials of medication abortion between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks of gestation demonstrate that mifepristone 200 mg orally before misoprostol increases effectiveness (complete abortion at 24 or 48 hours) compared to misoprostol only. Studies continue to evaluate different doses, routes, and dosing intervals for misoprostol. If mifepristone is unavailable, several misoprostol regimens with individual doses of at least 200 mcg or more are effective. Adjunctive osmotic dilators are of limited benefit. It is important to individualize care, with consideration to reducing misoprostol dose in low-resource settings or at 24 0/7 weeks of gestation or later (or equivalent uterine size). Misoprostol in the setting of two or more previous cesarean sections is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture compared to one or none, but risk remains low. Most contraceptives can be started during or immediately following abortion. Appropriately trained and credentialed advanced practice clinicians can provide medication abortion between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks of gestation with appropriate backup within the confines of local regulations and licensure.}

For millennia, numerous cultures and civilizations have relied on traditional remedies derived from plants to treat a wide range of conditions and ailments. Here, we systematically analyzed ethnobotanical patterns across taxonomically related plants, demonstrating that congeneric medicinal plants are more likely to be used for treating similar indications. Next, we reconstructed the phytochemical space covered by medicinal plants to reveal that (i) taxonomically related medicinal plants cover a similar phytochemical space, and (ii) chemical similarity correlates with similar therapeutic usage. Lastly, we present several case scenarios illustrating how mining this information can be used for drug discovery applications, including: (i) investigating taxonomic hotspots around particular indications, (ii) exploring shared patterns of congeneric plants located in different geographic areas, but which have been used to treat the same indications, and (iii) showing the concordance between ethnobotanical patterns among non-taxonomically related plants and the presence of shared bioactive phytochemicals.}

To characterize doctor-patient communication patterns around the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) in the context of oncology care in Colombia.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted using snowball sampling until data saturation was reached. We included oncology specialists and cancer patients who were in active treatment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted following a guide designed for each group of participants. An analysis based on open coding was performed to identify thematic areas. The coherence of emerging categories was verified by contrasting the data set within the content of the participants’ reports and existing literature.
Results
In total, 10 oncologists and 16 cancer patients were included, representing diverse professional fields and cancer diagnoses, respectively. Communication patterns comprise themes regarding the beginning of the interaction (i.e., patient’s anticipations), the patient–doctor relationship (i.e., confidence), the characteristics of the message (i.e., synthetic vs explanatory), the communication styles (i.e., confrontational vs conciliatory), and the closing of the interaction (i.e., continuity vs. end of communication). In addition, extrinsic factors influencing communication were found to be related to participants (i.e., knowledge, cultural background) and context (i.e., institutional procedures).
Conclusions
The low frequency of communication contrasts to the increasing use of CAM. Divergent perspectives between doctors and patients could limit shared decision-making on the use of CAM. Enhanced knowledge and education on CAM for both actors is fundamental to improve their interaction and to move away from paternalistic and confrontational communication, particularly in a world region with cultural backgrounds that influence the use of CAM.}

A 4-year-old boy was referred to our department by the Pediatric Surgery department for swelling in the right floor of the mouth which had been present since birth. An elastic soft and mobile mass on the floor of the mouth, and left lateral deviation of the tongue were observed. However, there were no issues with swallowing and speech. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a multilocular mass on the right floor of the mouth; T1- and T2-weighted images showed low and high signal intensities, respectively. Considering the possibility of spontaneous resolution over time, we decided on long-term observation without treatment. Five years after our initial consultation, the patient presented with rapidly worsening intraoral swelling due to infection. Following treatment with antibiotics, we prescribed Eppikajutsuto (TJ-28) for a period of one year. During this treatment period the intraoral and submandibular swelling decreased, and the lateral deviation of the tongue improved. Follow-up MRI scans showed a marked decrease in contrast effect, reduced swelling, and improvement in tongue deviation. Follow-up of the patient by our department is ongoing. The treatment with Eppikajutsuto (TJ-28) is non-invasive and should be further evaluated as an effective treatment for pediatric LMs.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), a public health problem, affects 1-3.7% of women under 40 yielding infertility and a shorter lifespan. Most causes are unknown. Recently, genetic causes were identified, mostly in single families. We studied an unprecedented large cohort of POI to unravel its molecular pathophysiology.
Methods
375 patients with 70 families were studied using targeted (88 genes) or whole exome sequencing with pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variant selection. Mitomycin-induced chromosome breakages were studied in patients’ lymphocytes if necessary.
Findings
A high-yield of 29.3% supports a clinical genetic diagnosis of POI. In addition, we found strong evidence of pathogenicity for nine genes not previously related to a Mendelian phenotype or POI: ELAVL2, NLRP11, CENPE, SPATA33, CCDC150, CCDC185, including DNA repair genes: C17orf53(HROB), HELQ, SWI5 yielding high chromosomal fragility. We confirmed the causal role of BRCA2, FANCM, BNC1, ERCC6, MSH4, BMPR1A, BMPR1B, BMPR2, ESR2, CAV1, SPIDR, RCBTB1 and ATG7 previously reported in isolated patients/families. In 8.5% of cases, POI is the only symptom of a multi-organ genetic disease. New pathways were identified: NF-kB, post-translational regulation, and mitophagy (mitochondrial autophagy), providing future therapeutic targets. Three new genes have been shown to affect the age of natural menopause supporting a genetic link.
Interpretation
We have developed high-performance genetic diagnostic of POI, dissecting the molecular pathogenesis of POI and enabling personalized medicine to i) prevent/cure comorbidities for tumour/cancer susceptibility genes that could affect life-expectancy (37.4% of cases), or for genetically-revealed syndromic POI (8.5% of cases), ii) predict residual ovarian reserve (60.5% of cases). Genetic diagnosis could help to identify patients who may benefit from the promising in vitro activation-IVA technique in the near future, greatly improving its success in treating infertility.

Abstract
Many medical educators struggle to get students and trainees to be active, engaged participants in learning. We know that lecturing, without substantial interactive components, does not take advantage of how we learn best. Over the last ten years, K-12 educators have applied the neurobiology of learning to promote students’ knowledge and skill acquisition. In this session, we will help you adapt those techniques, as developed by Teach Like a Champion, to your adult medical learners. First, we will teach you what “ratio” (the proportion of time individual students spend cognitively engaged with a subject) is and how to analyze ratio in your own teaching sessions. Then, we will focus on two specific strategies that that get all learners involved. First, wait time increases the quality of responses by allowing learners to think deeply about their answer before being called on by the educator to share their response. Second, in cold calling, educators ask a question and, regardless of who has raised hands, call on someone. This ensures all learners are considering the faculty's questions and thus thinking about the topic at hand. In addition, cold calling increases voice equity and allows the faculty to ensure that all learners are participating in the educational session. Before starting to cold call, a roll out speech is critical in setting learner expectations and creating a safe space for the practice. Session participants will practice each of the techniques in pairs and small groups. We will also discuss the application of these teaching techniques in didactic content (formerly lecture style format) as well as communication skills training.

abstract = {Introduction
Aidi injection (Aidi), a traditional Chinese medicine injection, is often practiced to control malignant pleural effusion (MPE).
Objectives
We performed a registered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42022337611) to clarify the clinical role of Aidi in MPE, reveal optimal combinations of Aidi and chemical agents, their indications, therapeutic route and usage, and demonstrate their clinical effectiveness and safety.
Methodology
All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about Aidi in controlling MPE were collected from Chinese and English databases (up to October 2022). We clustered them into multiple homogenous regimens, evaluated the risk-of-bias at outcome level using a RoB 2, extracted and pooled the data using meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, and finally summarized their evidence quality.
Results
All 56 studies were clustered into intrapleural administration with Aidi alone or plus chemical agents, and intravenous administration with Aidi for MPE. Intrapleural administration with Aidi alone displayed similar clinical responses on Cisplatin (DDP) alone. Only administration with Aidi plus DDP significantly improved complete response and quality of life, and displayed a low pleurodesis failure, disease progression, hematotoxicity, gastrointestinal and hepatorenal toxicity. For patients with moderate to massive effusion, Karnofsky Performance Status score ≥ 50 or anticipated survival time ≥3 months, Aidi (50 ml to 80 ml each time, one time each week and three to eight times) plus DDP (20 to 30 mg, 40 to 50 mg, or 60 to 80 mg each time) significantly improved clinical responses. Most results had moderate to low quality.
Conclusions
Current evidences indicate that Aidi, a pleurodesis agent, plays an interesting clinical role in controlling MPE. Aidi plus DDP perfusion is a most commonly used regimen, which shows a significant improvement in clinical responses. These findings also provide an indication and possible optimal usage for rational drug use.}

This has the potential of overcoming the simplification of current diagnostic and treatment approaches, which presumes that all patients with the same signs of heart disease share a common pathophenotype and, therefore should be treated similarly based on large-scale clinical trial evidence. While heavily relied on genomic understanding that has yielded some successes in other medical fields, there is now a growing call to the cardiovascular community for more precise phenotyping to advance precision medicine as a strategy to improve cardiovascular health and prevent disease, not only through genomic insights but also big data analytics, digital health advances, and artificial intelligence.}

To assess the ability of the “wall-carving (WC) image technique”, which uses vascular images from 3-dimensional digital subtraction angiograms (3DDSAs). Also, to verify the accuracy of the resulting 3D-printed hollow models of intracranial aneurysms.
Methods
The 3DDSA data from 9 aneurysms were processed to obtain volumetric models suitable for the stereolithography apparatus. The resulting models were filled with iodinated contrast media. 3D rotational angiography of the models was carried out, and the aneurysm geometry was compared with the original patient data. The accuracy of the 3D-printed hollow models’ sizes and shapes was evaluated using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Dice coefficient index.
Results
The aneurysm volumes ranged from 34.1 to 4609.8 mm3 (maximum diameters 5.1–30.1 mm), and no statistically significant differences were noted between the patient data and the 3D-printed models (P = 0.4). Shape analysis of the aneurysms and related arteries indicated a high level of accuracy (Dice coefficient index value: 88.7%–97.3%; mean ± SD: 93.6% ± 2.5%). The vessel wall thickness of the 3D-printed hollow models was 0.4 mm for the parent and 0.2 mm for small branches and aneurysms, almost the same as the patient data.
Conclusions
The WC technique, which involves volume rendering of 3DDSAs, can provide a detailed description of the contrast enhancement of intracranial vessels and aneurysms at arbitrary depths. These models can provide precise anatomic information and be used for simulations of endovascular treatment.}

Although a small proportion of helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) missions are for pediatric patients, it is recognized that children do present unique challenges. This case series aims to evaluate the intubation first-pass success rate in HEMS pediatric patients for both medical and trauma patients in a UK semiurban environment.
Methods
A retrospective review of the computerized records system was performed from January 1, 2015, to July 31, 2022, at 1 UK HEMS. Anonymous data relating to advanced airway interventions in patients < 16 years of age were extracted. Primary analysis related to the first-pass success rate was performed; secondary analysis relating to the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of the pediatric patients requiring prehospital anesthesia (rapid sequence induction with drugs) and first-pass success rates by clinician group was also performed.
Results
Of the pediatric patients, 15.8% required intubation. The overall first-pass success rate for intubation (including in cardiac arrest) was 83.5%; for prehospital anesthesia (drugs administered), it was 98.4%. First-pass success rates were lowest for those under 2 years of age (45.2% without drugs and 87.5% with drugs). There was no difference between physician background in the first-pass success rate. The median GCS for pediatric prehospital anesthesia was 7 versus 5 for adults (P = .012). No children with an initial GCS of 15 had prehospital anesthesia.
Conclusion
The overall intubation first-pass success rates for pediatric patients is high at 83.5% and higher still for prehospital anesthesia (98.4%). However, it remains a rare intervention for clinicians, and children under 2 years of age require special consideration.}

The European Society for Medical Oncology Precision Medicine Working Group (ESMO PMWG) was reconvened to update its 2018/19 recommendations on follow-up of putative germline variants detected on tumour-only sequencing, which were based on an analysis of 17 152 cancers.
Methods
We analysed an expanded dataset including 49 264 paired tumour-normal samples. We applied filters to tumour-detected variants based on variant allele frequency, predicted pathogenicity and population variant frequency. For 58 cancer-susceptibility genes, we then examined the proportion of filtered tumour-detected variants of true germline origin [germline conversion rate (GCR)]. We conducted subanalyses based on the age of cancer diagnosis, specific tumour types and ‘on-tumour’ status (established tumour-gene association).
Results
Analysis of 45 472 nonhypermutated solid malignancy tumour samples yielded 21 351 filtered tumour-detected variants of which 3515 were of true germline origin. 3.1% of true germline pathogenic variants were absent from the filtered tumour-detected variants. For genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, the GCR in filtered tumour-detected variants was >80%; conversely for TP53, APC and STK11 this GCR was <2%.
Conclusion
Strategic germline-focused analysis can prioritise a subset of tumour-detected variants for which germline follow-up will produce the highest yield of most actionable true germline variants. We present updated recommendations around germline follow-up of tumour-only sequencing including (i) revision to 5% for the minimum per-gene GCR, (ii) inclusion of actionable intermediate penetrance genes ATM and CHEK2, (iii) definition of a set of seven ‘most actionable’ cancer-susceptibility genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and RET) in which germline follow-up is recommended regardless of tumour type.}

In this context, PET imaging is used with three main types of radiotracers: 18F-FDG, amino acid radiotracers, and 68Ga conjugated to somatostatin receptor ligands (SSTRs). At initial diagnosis, 18F-FDG helps to characterize primary central nervous system (PCNS) lymphomas and high-grade gliomas, amino acid radiotracers are indicated for gliomas, and SSTR PET ligands are indicated for meningiomas. Such radiotracers provide information on tumour grade or type, assist in directing biopsies and help with treatment planning. During follow-up, in the presence of symptoms and/or MRI modifications, the differential diagnosis between tumour recurrence and post-therapeutic changes, in particular radiation necrosis, may be challenging, and there is strong interest in using PET to evaluate therapeutic toxicity. PET may also contribute to identifying specific complications, such as postradiation therapy encephalopathy, encephalitis associated with PCNS lymphoma, and stroke-like migraine after radiation therapy (SMART) syndrome associated with glioma recurrence and temporal epilepsy, originally illustrated in this review. This review summarizes the main contribution of PET to the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of brain tumours, specifically gliomas, meningiomas, and primary central nervous system lymphomas.}
