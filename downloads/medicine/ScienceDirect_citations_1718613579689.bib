abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by significant interindividual heterogeneity. With a wider selection of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions available and in advanced developmental stages, a priority for the coming decade is to determine accurate methods of predicting treatment response and disease course. Precision medicine strategies will allow tailoring of preventative and therapeutic decisions to individual patient needs. In this review, we consider the future of precision medicine in inflammatory bowel disease. We discuss the critical need to extend from research focused on short-term symptomatic response to integrative multi-omic systems biology strategies to identify and validate biomarkers that underpin precision approaches. Crucially, the international community has collective responsibility to provide well-phenotyped and -curated longitudinal datasets for scientific discovery and validation. Research must also study broader aspects of the immune response, including components of the extracellular matrix, to better understand biological pathways initiating and perpetuating tissue fibrosis and longer-term disease complications.}

This study aims to describe the cohort of Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) research program participants and evaluate whether the ATN's recently completed 5-year cycle recruited study participants who parallel the populations most impacted by HIV in the United States.
Methods
Harmonized measures across ATN studies collected at baseline were aggregated for participants aged 13–24 years. Pooled means and proportions stratified by HIV status (at risk for or living with HIV) were calculated using unweighted averages of study-specific aggregate data. Medians were estimated using a weighted median of medians method. Public use 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data for state-level new HIV diagnoses and HIV prevalence among US youth aged 13–24 years were obtained for use as reference populations for ATN at-risk youth and youth living with HIV (YLWH), respectively.
Results
Data from 3,185 youth at-risk for HIV and 542 YLWH were pooled from 21 ATN study phases conducted across the United States. Among ATN studies tailored to at-risk youth, a higher proportion of participants were White and a lower proportion were Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx compared to youth newly diagnosed with HIV in the United States in 2019. Participants in ATN studies tailored to YLWH were demographically similar to YLWH in the United States.
Discussion
The development of data harmonization guidelines for ATN research activities facilitated this cross-network pooled analysis. These findings suggest the ATN's YLWH are representative, but that future studies of at-risk youth should prioritize recruitment strategies to enroll more participants from African American and Hispanic/Latinx populations.}

Although nanogel is a type in the class of hydrogel, it possesses both hydrogel and nanoparticle properties that make it more advantageous than hydrogel in several areas. Nanogels are flexible 3D structures that can be easily modified. Also, they possess the tunable size and large surface area that enhances bioconjugation properties. Nanogels are considered a promising structure for various areas, and among the most attractive is biomedicine. For instance, nanogels are considered as next-generation drug delivery systems and they have been used in targeted and controlled delivery of drugs because of their high drug-loading capacity, flexibility, stimuli responsiveness to external stimuli, and nanoscale size-like properties. Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide and is formed from chitin after the deacetylation process. The unique chemical structure of chitosan makes it favorable for chemical modifications. Besides chemical structure, chitosan is considered as biodegradable and biocompatible biopolymer. The formulation of nanogels from chitosan improves the biodegradability and biocompatibility of nanogels to be used in biomedicine applications, especially drug delivery and regenerative medicine. This chapter is composed of recent studies, conducted between 2018 and 2022 years, of chitosan-based nanogels for drug delivery and regenerative medicine. It is based on the nanogels formulation from chitosan, chitosan derivatives, functionalized chitosan, and blend of chitosan with other polymers. Apart from the content of chitosan nanogel, it considers formulations of chitosan nanogels with various responsiveness, such as temperature, pH, light, magnetic, or combinations of them.}

Due to its ability to create a distinct three-dimensional structure, provide mechanical support for the cells in the engineered tissues, and simulate the native extracellular matrix, this technology has progressed over the last two decades. This chapter outlines a brief overview of the properties of thermoresponsive hydrogels (TRHs), the research spectrum, and their applications in tissue engineering in particular. To illustrate the phase transition, TRHs use temperature as an external stimulus. As per the polymer's nature, it can form either a soft or hard hydrogel matrix around or into biological tissue. The ease of availability of biocompatible thermoresponsive polymers, ease of handling and fabrication, and high functionality of TRHs offer many advantages for developing a broad range of tissue engineering applications.}

abstract = {During the past decade, more and more large-scale pragmatic clinical trials have been carried out in orthopedic trauma surgery. This trend is fueled by the common belief that the larger the numbers in a trial, the broader the eligibility criteria, and the less strict the regimentation of local treatment standards by protocol, the more trustworthy the findings would be. However, it must also be taken into account that the precision of an outcome measurement does not depend on the sample size alone, but the homogeneity of the studied population. Consequently, a small trial with stringent entry and assessment criteria may offer similarly precise answers as a large trial with less strict entry and assessment criteria because of the basic mathematical correlation between standard deviation and standard error of the mean. There is now a lively and controversial debate about the role of randomized controlled trials (RCT) in an era of stratified medicine driven by the ever increasing understanding and clinical measurability of molecular pathways, making a certain intervention more effective in patients who show a distinct genetic variant. Cluster and pattern recognition by artificial intelligence (AI) and its methodological variety applied to huge datasets and population-based cohorts further propel the spiral of knowledge. Advanced adaptive RCT concepts like enrichment designs, basket and bucket trials, master protocols etc. were developed to combine classic principles of the scientific method with big data, the latter of which have not arrived yet in trauma care. In spite of all biomedical and methodological achievements made, surprisingly such key questions remain unanswered as a) is a certain treatment causally responsible for making a difference in patient-centered outcomes compared to placebo, a control treatment, or the standard of care, b) do the results of a controlled experiment are relevant enough to change clinical practice, and c) under which conditions and assumptions shall we conduct large-scale pragmatic RCTs, focused confirmatory RCTs, or personalized analyses with or without AI support.}

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) poses a severe threat to human health. Compound Xiancao Granule (CXCG), a classic Zhuang medicinal formula, is reported as highly effective in treating DKD. However, the mechanisms underlying the action of CXCG in DKD remain unclear.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of CXCG against DKD using multi-omics analysis, including 16s rRNA sequencing, metabolomics, and transcriptomics.
Materials and methods
The chemical compounds of CXCG were identified using ultra-high- performance liquid chromatography quadrupole/electrostatic field orbital trap high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis. A rat model of DKD was established by combining nephrectomy of the left kidney, high-fat diet, and streptozotocin. The therapeutic effects of CXCG on DKD were assessed based on body weight, blood glucose level, renal function, inflammatory cytokine levels, and histological staining. Subsequently, 16s rRNA sequencing, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry untargeted metabolomic profiling, and RNA sequencing analysis were used to investigate the mechanisms of action of CXCG in DKD. Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to elucidate the correlations between efficacy indicators, gut microbiota, metabolites, and inflammation-related genes.
Results
A total of 118 compounds were identified in CXCG. CXCG significantly ameliorated glucose metabolism disorders, improved renal function, attenuated inflammation, and delayed renal pathological changes in DKD rats. CXCG modulated gut microbiota dysbiosis, including Alloprevotella, Oscillibacter, Anaeroplasma, Anaerotruncus, and Faecalibacterium. In addition, metabolic disruption in DKD rats was regulated by CXCG, which is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids. Transcriptome analysis showed that CXCG affected DKD mainly by regulating inflammation-related genes and pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, there were significant correlations between efficacy indicators, gut microbiota, metabolites, and genes.
Conclusion
This multi-omics association study provides novel insights into the effects of CXCG on DKD by remodeling the gut microbiota structure and restoring the metabolic homeostasis through the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and inflammation-related pathways, highlighting a potential therapeutic strategy for DKD.}

abstract = {Objectives
This cross-sectional study is aimed to investigate the prevalence of the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), types of CAMs used, as well as reasons and factors found in patients with neurological diseases or neurological disability.
Methods
An anonymous, self-administered survey was designed to collect information about demographics, personal medical history, CAM usage habits, and different opinions about CAM vs. conventional medicine (CM). The survey was applied by non-medical personnel in a rehabilitation hospital to patients older than 18 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of neurological disorder or neurological disability.
Results
453 patients were included, 59.7 % were female. Mean age: 49 years (SD: 18.2). 200 patients (44.2 %) had a history of chronic diseases. Depression was found in 139 patients (30.7 %). Neurological disorders were: peripheral neuropathy: 97 (21.4 %), headache or migraine: 78 (17.2 %), neurodegenerative diseases: 69 (15.2 %) and stroke: 58 (12.8 %). 60.2 % (n = 273) had some degree of disability. Prevalence of CAM use was 36 % (n = 163). Most common CAMs were: Biological therapies: 133 (71.1 %), energy-based therapies: 63 (33.7 %) and body manipulation therapies: 51 (27.3 %). Reasons to use CAM were: “to complement the pharmacological treatment” (45 = 27.6 %), and “treatment failure with CM” (43 = 26.4 %). Finally, older age (p = 0.0280) and having a chronic disease (p = 0.0229) or depression (p < 0.001) were the factors associated with the current use of CAM.
Conclusion
One third of patients with neurological pathologies use CAM, the most popular type of CAM is biologic therapies. As in other pathologies, CAM use was associated with older age, history of depression, and chronic diseases. Therefore, it is suggested that physicians routinely ask patients about the use of CAM, if they need more information about CAM, and even verify the possibility of drug interactions or adverse effects.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Ultrasound training is a vital component of maternal-fetal medicine fellowships in the United States. Of the 18 months of core clinical training, the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology currently requires a minimum of 3 months to be dedicated to ultrasound to be eligible for board certification. However, the experience and degree of hands-on training differ among the fellowship programs and have not been reassessed for nearly a decade.
OBJECTIVE
To assess regional heterogeneity in the ultrasound training experience during maternal-fetal medicine fellowship in the United States.
STUDY DESIGN
A survey was distributed to postgraduate year (PGY)-6 maternal-fetal medicine fellows registered to attend an annual ultrasound training course before the conference (n=114). For programs with >1 fellow attending (n=39), only 1 of them completed the survey to represent the program. The questions included demographics of the program, ultrasound training structure, the fellows’ self-perception of ultrasound capabilities, research, mentorship, and technical aspects of sonography.
RESULTS
Seventy two postgraduate year 6 fellows with a wide geographic distribution as follows completed the survey (96% response rate): 10 (14%) from the West, 16 (22%) from the Midwest, 17 (24%) from the South, and 29 (40%) from the Northeast. Respondents undergoing training in the South were less likely to report feeling comfortable performing nuchal translucency and detailed anatomic surveys than those from other regions (nuchal translucency: P=.046; anatomy: P=.011). Most of the respondents reported feeling comfortable performing growth (78%) and umbilical artery Doppler (58%) and feeling uncomfortable with three-dimensional ultrasound, neurosonography, and fetal echocardiography. Respondents in the Northeast were more likely to report feeling comfortable performing chorionic villus sampling (P=.001). There was no difference among fellowship programs in the presence or absence of ultrasound curriculum, bedside teaching, ultrasound-focused research mentorship, or months of ultrasound training.
CONCLUSION
Despite the standardization of ultrasound training structure across the United States, there remains regional heterogeneity in fellow self-reported comfort with specific ultrasound techniques and chorionic villus sampling at a midpoint in their fellowship training. The maternal-fetal medicine attending involvement at the bedside did not affect the fellow self-reported comfort with ultrasound surveys. This study highlights the need for further optimization of maternal-fetal medicine fellowship ultrasound training, especially in advanced sonography and diagnostic procedures.}

Therefore, this study aims to determine the prevalence of CAM usage among pregnant and lactating women and to examine their practice, knowledge, and perceptions of CAMs. Methods: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional questionnaire-based study, performed among pregnant and lactating women who accessed primary or secondary care in the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia. Results: A total of 801 participants (pregnant women PW (n=401), lactating women LW (n=400)), were interviewed. Both groups of women were found to use different CAM therapies and remedies during pregnancy or lactation (PW: n=372: 92.8% and LW: n=348: 87%), with a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.031). The most frequent therapies used were self-practiced, and those provided by practitioners such as herbalists and massage therapists. The most common source of CAM-related information for both groups was family recommendation (n=131: 33% for PW and n=244: 61% for LW). A third of the PW and half of the LW did not disclose CAM usage to healthcare providers, mainly because they were not asked about any alternative practices. Three-quarters of the participants perceived CAM to be effective and believed it to be safe. Conclusion: CAM usage is common among PW and LW, however, there is a lack of good communication between women and healthcare providers about CAM modalities, which may affect the intended benefits of CAM practices.}

We searched the electronic literature published up to March 2021 from CNKI, VIP, WanFang, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and clinicaltrials.gov; a total of 56 studies and 5464 participants were included. We found that TCM plus ACEI, TCM plus ARB, and TCM alone are very effective treatment methods compared with ACEI, ARB, and the placebo in reducing 24-h urine protein, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. TCM plus ACEI was the most effective treatment (TCM plus ACEI vs. the placebo in 24-h urine protein [mean difference (MD) − 757.18, 95% confidence interval-1177.41 to − 353.31], serum creatinine [MD − 25.81, 95% confidence interval − 35.51 to − 16.03], and blood urea nitrogen [MD − 3.48, 95% confidence interval − 5.04 to − 1.90]). Although the incidence of end-stage renal disease while receiving an TCM plus ARB compared with a placebo was not statistically significant, the treatment ranking showed this combination therapy to have the greatest probability (72.8%) of reducing end-stage renal disease mortality, followed by SGLT2i (68%). Our analyses showed that combining TCM with conventional treatments for patients with DKD can improve renoprotective effects and superiority, and ACEI plus TCM may be the most effective option for treating DKD.}

Despite the potential feasibility of universal prenatal serological screening, its introduction in prenatal diagnosis continues to raise concerns related to its real cost-effectiveness. Contextually, anticipating the confirmation of fetal infection earlier in pregnancy is one of the most pressing issues to reduce the parental psychological burden. Amniocentesis is still the gold standard and recent data have demonstrated that it could be performed before 20 weeks of gestation, provided that at least 8 weeks have elapsed from the presumed date of maternal seroconversion. New approaches, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and virome DNA, even if not yet validated as confirmation of fetal infection, have been studied alternatively to amniocentesis to reduce the time-interval from maternal seroconversion and the amniocentesis results. Risk stratification for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and long-term sequelae should be provided according to the prognostic predictors. Nevertheless, in the era of valacyclovir, maternal high-dose therapy, mainly for first trimester infections, can reduce the risk of vertical transmission and increase the likelihood of asymptomatic newborns, but it is still unclear whether valacyclovir continues to exert a beneficial effect on fetuses with positive amniocentesis. This review provides updated evidence-based key counseling points with GRADE recommendations.}

Disturbed energy status plays a crucial role in DPN pathogenesis. However, the integrated profile of energy metabolism, especially the central carbohydrate metabolism, remains unclear in DPN. Here, we developed a metabolomics approach by targeting 56 metabolites using high-performance ion chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPIC-MS/MS) to illustrate the integrative characteristics of central carbohydrate metabolism in patients with DPN and streptozotocin-induced DPN rats. Furthermore, JinMaiTong (JMT), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, was found to be effective for DPN, improving the peripheral neurological function and alleviating the neuropathology of DPN rats even after demyelination and axonal degeneration. JMT ameliorated DPN by regulating the aberrant energy balance and mitochondrial functions, including excessive glycolysis restoration, tricarboxylic acid cycle improvement, and increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. Bioenergetic profile was aberrant in cultured rat Schwann cells under high-glucose conditions, which was remarkably corrected by JMT treatment. In-vivo and in-vitro studies revealed that these effects of JMT were mainly attributed to the activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and downstream peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Our results expand the therapeutic framework for DPN and suggest the integrative modulation of energy metabolism using TCMs, such as JMT, as an effective strategy for its treatment.}

abstract = {In the healthcare sector, patient data plays a crucial role in medical diagnoses and treatment plans. However, existing techniques for finding similar patients based on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data face challenges due to high-dimensional and sparse vectors. To overcome this challenge, the paper proposes developing a novel heterogeneous network-embedded drug recommendation system. The system focuses on classifying the sentiment of drug users based on their reviews and other relevant features such as their medical condition, drug rating, and usage date. The overall framework of the system follows a step-by-step approach, starting with data exploration and preprocessing, followed by the development of a classification model based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. During the data exploration phase, various visualization and statistical techniques are employed to analyze the different data types. This process helps in understanding the characteristics of the data, identifying patterns, and preparing the data to align with the research objective. Furthermore, additional variables are considered suitable for the LSTM model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) type designed to handle sequence data and long-term prediction problems. Unlike other models that process individual data points, LSTM incorporates feedback connections to process complete data sequences. This approach enhances the effectiveness of recommendation systems and enables the prediction of new drug user ratings based on existing user ratings. The developed system demonstrates promising results, achieving a classification accuracy of 92%. This indicates its ability to accurately predict the sentiment of drug users based on their reviews and other associated features. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of a heterogeneous network-embedded approach with LSTM-based classification, providing a more comprehensive and accurate drug recommendation system compared to existing methods.}

abstract = {Summary
The microcirculation describes the network of the smallest vessels in our cardiovascular system. On a microcirculatory level, oxygen delivery is determined by the flow of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in a given single capillary (capillary red blood cell flow) and the density of the capillary network in a given tissue volume (capillary vessel density). Handheld vital videomicroscopy enables visualisation of the capillary bed on the surface of organs and tissues but currently is only used for research. Measurements are generally possible on all organ surfaces but are most often performed in the sublingual area. In patients presenting for elective surgery, the sublingual microcirculation is usually intact and functional. Induction of general anaesthesia slightly decreases capillary red blood cell flow and increases capillary vessel density. During elective, even major, noncardiac surgery, the sublingual microcirculation is preserved and remains functional, presumably because elective noncardiac surgery is scheduled trauma and haemodynamic alterations are immediately treated by anaesthesiologists, usually restoring the macrocirculation before the microcirculation is substantially impaired. Additionally, surgery is regional trauma and thus likely causes regional, rather than systemic, impairment of the microcirculation. Whether or not the sublingual microcirculation is impaired after noncardiac surgery remains a subject of ongoing research. Similarly, it remains unclear if cardiac surgery, especially with cardiopulmonary bypass, impairs the sublingual microcirculation. The effects of therapeutic interventions specifically targeting the microcirculation remain to be elucidated and tested. Future research should focus on further improving microcirculation monitoring methods and investigating how regional microcirculation monitoring can inform clinical decision-making and treatment.}

Pingchan granule (PCG) is a traditional Chinese medicine for Parkinson's disease (PD).
Hypothesis/Purpose
This was the first study aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PCG for motor symptoms, gait impairments and quality of life in PD.
Study Design and Methods
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 292 participants were included and followed for 9 months, randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to receive PCG or placebo. The primary outcome was the severity of motor symptoms assessed by Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Rating Scale III (MDS-UPDRS-III) motor score. Secondary outcomes included timed up and go test (TUG), functional gait assessment (FGA), freezing of gait (FOG), and quality of life assessed by Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39). Assessments were done at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), 6 months (T2) and 9 months (T3). Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR-INR-1,701,194.
Results
Generalized estimating equation analyses revealed that PCG group had significantly better improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III motor score than placebo group, as well as its domain scores of axial symptoms, bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Improvements of TUG time, FGA, FOG questionnaire (FOGQ), and PDQ39 scores were also observed.
Conclusion
PCG had a long-lasting efficacy for motor symptoms and function in PD with good tolerance, supporting that PCG might be a viable alternative in the management of PD.}

Thai herbal formulations have been used traditionally in Thailand for the treatment of psoriasis. However, there is still a lack of scientific data supporting the effects of Thai herbal formulations in psoriasis treatment.
Objectives
This study aimed to demonstrate the therapeutic effects of Thai herbal formulations for the treatment of erythrodermic psoriasis.
Materials and methods
All Thai herbal formulations (haematic tonic, lymphatic treatment, skin treatment) were obtained from a traditional Thai medicine doctor, Mr. Somporn Chanwanitsakul. The effects of Thai herbal formulations in a patient with erythrodermic psoriasis were assessed for four weeks. Primary outcome, psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and secondary outcome, safety data and dermatology life quality index (DLQI) measurements were evaluated at baseline and four weeks. Then, in vitro biological activities (antioxidant, anti-microbial, cytotoxic effects, and anti-inflammatory) of Thai herbal formulations were determined to promote the therapeutic effects.
Results
Thai herbal formulations were safe and effective in the treatment of erythrodermic psoriasis and had a modest positive impact on the DQLI of the patient. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that all Thai herbal formulations revealed remarkable anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential to support their therapeutic activities. However, the Thai herbal formulations possessed weak intrinsic antibacterial activities against all tested bacterial strains (MIC and MBC E. coli, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa: > 256 µg/ml).
Conclusion
The findings indicated that successful treatment of erythrodermic psoriasis with Thai herbal formulations was involved in their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. They could be considered as an alternative treatment for refractory erythrodermic psoriasis.}

abstract = {Background
Pharmacist-driven continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is associated with reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and achievement of daily glycemic goals. Community-based pharmacists are well-positioned to improve CGM uptake among patients with diabetes due to their accessibility and expertise. However, little data exists evaluating the outcomes of CGM services led by a community-based pharmacist.
Objective
To evaluate the impact of a community-based pharmacy resident-driven CGM service on HbA1c, revenue, and patient satisfaction.
Practice Description
Independent community pharmacy sharing a clinical services agreement with a primary care clinic for Postgraduate Year One (PGY1) Community-based Pharmacy Residents to provide patient care under general supervision of the physician.
Practice innovation
Patients were offered CGM services if they were 18+ years with an HbA1c > 7.0% and had insurance coverage for CGM. Enrolled patients engaged in three months of pharmacist-led appointments for CGM application, data interpretation, diabetes education, and lifestyle management. Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 99211, 95250, or 95251 were billed based on each encounter. HbA1c values were collected at program enrollment and conclusion. Patients completed a satisfaction survey at program conclusion.
Evaluation methods
Demographics and billed CPT codes were collected from the electronic health record. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data.
Results
Eighteen patients were included. A mean reduction of 1.2% occurred in HbA1c (n = 12; 9.7%−8.5%). Forty CPT codes were billed, generating $3671.40 of revenue. Satisfaction surveys were collected for 50% of participants (n = 9). Most were satisfied with the CGM service and its individual components (n = 8, 89%). Most were willing to continue using CGM devices and receive diabetes education from a pharmacist (n = 8, 89%).
Conclusion
A community-based pharmacist-led CGM service demonstrated a reduction in HbA1c and generated revenue for the clinic. Patients reported satisfaction and willingness to continue the service.}

abstract = {Climate change has led to a multitude of ecological disruptions and downstream reproductive health consequences that impair our reproductive capacity and, in turn, harm the health and survival of future generations. Atmospheric changes, driven by anthropogenic emissions, expose global populations to droughts, heat waves, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events—posing major threats to public health and exacerbating environmental health disparities. Existing evidence demonstrates the potential for climate-driven events to impact reproductive health outcomes, yet very few studies have explored this relationship. Recently, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics released position statements regarding reproductive health and environmental exposures. Unfortunately, such initiatives have yielded little action within the health care system. To address this stagnation, health care workers must meld research findings into actionable preventive medicine strategies and transition to a more action-oriented approach to address the climate crisis. The objective of this article is to elucidate the urgency of the climate crisis in relation to reproductive health and push the health care workers to recognize their intrinsic opportunity as leaders in climate action at local, state, national, and international levels. We call on health care organizations and health care workers to leverage their inherent positions as climate action leaders to increase climate resilience and mitigate climate-related adverse reproductive health outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission bringing mild ocular weakness to severe generalized muscle weakness and disability. The conventional treatments have long-term side effects, and Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have shown possible effect and safety for MG patients, but the existing evidence was not robust enough and the results were out of date.
Methods
Searching for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in 7 databases and clinical trial registries until July 2021. The Risk of Bias (ROB) 2 tool was used to assess the study quality and GRADE was used to assess the quality of whole evidence. Meta-analyses were conducted and the results were presented as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Nineteen RCTs (1283 participants) testing 13 kinds of CHM with adequate randomization were included and six RCTs investigating Compound Huangqi were included in the meta-analyses. In addition to conventional treatment, nine CHMs reduced symptom scores of MG. Compound Huangqi plus conventional treatment (pyridostigmine bromide or prednisone or both) reduced the symptom scores compared with conventional treatment (MD = -3.56, 95%CI -4.86 to -2.26). Less adverse events happened in the CHM groups (3/247 in the CHM groups, 52/245 in the control groups, RR = 0.13, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.30, 9 RCTs, a total of 492 participants). The effect on quality of life was inconsistent.
Conclusion
Nine CHMs could probably bring benefit for MG symptom improvement. Moderate to low certainty of evidence supported Compound Huangqi added-on conventional treatment probably bring extra benefit of improving MG symptoms. Adding CHMs could be safer than giving only conventional treatment.
Study registration
The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42016032718).}

abstract = {Objective
A comparison between Cinematic Rendering Technique (CRT) and Volume Rendering Technique (VRT) in cases with postmortem CT-angiography (PMCTA) was carried out.
Methods
For different injuries seen in PMCTA, a VRT and a CRT image of exactly the same pathological section was generated. Two questionnaires were created, one with CRT and one with VRT reconstructions, with the same questions per 3D-image. The questionnaires were sent to forensic pathologists, lawyers and police officers. In total eleven different injuries had to be analyzed.
Results
In total 109 questionnaires were answered fully. Of these returnees, 36 stated that they were forensic pathologists. Seventy-three people were assigned to the group of medical laypersons, in the study this group consists mainly of police officers, judges and lawyers. Between the two software programs CRT and VRT that were compared, no significant difference could be identified in any of the participating groups with regard to the assessment of the life-threatening nature of the injury images shown. When asked about the comprehensibility of pathology, there was a significant difference in favour of CRT. This advantage was apparent to named medical laypersons and to forensic pathologists.
Conclusions
The study showed a positive trend that CRT may be more understandable than VRT. Not only the medical laypersons, but also the forensic physicians found CRT to be beneficial.}

abstract = {Uterine transplantation is a novel approach to solving a clinical problem faced by women with uterine factor infertility whose desire to parent includes a desire to give birth. The ethical precepts used for other solid organ transplants are helpful in developing normative frameworks for understanding this experimental therapy. Nevertheless, both fetal and neonatal risks complicate this calculus and therefore it is useful to incorporate analyses used in other realms of maternal-fetal medicine to understand and justify this research. Preliminary data on maternal and neonatal outcomes from the many centers exploring this technique are encouraging, but as these techniques move into mainstream care, ongoing vigilance will be necessary to ensure that women and their families are afforded similar protections required of research protocols. Uterine transplantation is a captivating topic for the myriad ethical issues it raises. Many of these issues have been analyzed extensively in the literature since the marvel of solid organ transplantation was first realized in the 1950s. But we have now been collecting data on uterine transplantation since the first successful birth in 20151 and the questions raised have morphed very quickly from “Can we do this?” to “Should we do this?” and “How should we do this?” The good news for patients and the public is that bioethicists have been front and center in participating in and helping to inform the rolling out of this innovative treatment for rare forms of infertility. The model for such an integrative role of ethics in uterine transplantation programs grew out of similar programs in high risk obstetrical procedures such as the repair of fetal meningomyelocele trials.2 The goal of this review is to outline some of the key issues these transplantations raise from the perspective of maternal-fetal medicine, a field well acquainted with the dilemmas that may arise in maximizing outcomes for both pregnant women and their fetuses.}

abstract = {Background
Food insecurity is associated with worse glycemic management for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but whether medically tailored meals (MTM), a food insecurity intervention, can improve glycemic management is unclear.
Objective
To describe the protocol for a trial assessing whether an MTM plus lifestyle intervention improves hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and participant-reported outcomes, relative to a food subsidy (money that can be spent on foods participants choose), for adults with both T2DM and food insecurity.
Methods
The Food as Medicine for Diabetes (FAME-D) randomized clinical trial (goal n = 200) is a pragmatic trial with an active comparator. Participants, who will have T2DM and report food insecurity, will be randomly assigned to a 6-month MTM plus telephone-delivered lifestyle change intervention, or a 6-month food subsidy ($40/month). The primary outcome is HbA1c at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include HbA1c at 12 months to assess whether the intervention effect (if any) is sustained, along with weight, food insecurity, diabetes distress, and health-related quality of life. Qualitative analyses of semi-structured interviews will help understand why, how, and under what circumstances the intervention achieved its observed results.
Conclusion
Results from FAME-D will help inform clinical management of food insecurity when it co-occurs with T2DM. Further, results may be useful as healthcare payors are considering coverage for MTM interventions. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04828785}

abstract = {Parametric imaging is utilized in a diverse range of nuclear medicine procedures and can be applied to provide additional information of the radiopharmaceutical distribution of the examined tissues and organs that are of physiological and biochemical interest. These findings cannot usually be observed directly in the original (static) scintigraphic images. Parametric imaging can be applied both to Positron Emission tomography (PET) or PET-Computed Tomography (CT) as well as Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. There are several approaches available for parametric imaging. The simplest parametric image is a difference image obtained by subtraction of two images. Furthermore, there are various image post-processing and analysis methods to facilitate improved delineation of body organs. The current publication describes in detail, the practical applications of image subtraction, time of maximum (Tixel) image, Rutland-Patlak and Logan plots as well as Factor Analysis in the NM field. Current literature results show that parametric imaging is helpful to visualize parameters of tracer kinetics and adds a new information in images. The development of new-generation imaging devices as well as advances in computer hardware and advanced software tools will facilitate the wider use of parametric imaging also in the everyday clinical routine.}

The cornea, the transparent tissue located on the anterior chamber of the eye, is extremely susceptible to fibrotic diseases, which cause loss of corneal transparency and are often associated with blindness. Although topical corticosteroids and antimetabolites are extensively used in the management of corneal fibrosis, they are associated with glaucoma, cataract formation, corneoscleral melting and infection, imposing the need of far more effective therapies. Herein, we summarise and discuss shortfalls and recent advances in in vitro models (e.g. transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) / ascorbic acid / interleukin (IL) induced) and drug (e.g. TGF-β inhibitors, epigenetic modulators) and gene (e.g. gene editing, gene silencing) therapeutic strategies in the corneal fibrosis context. Emerging therapeutical agents (e.g. neutralising antibodies, ligand traps, receptor kinase inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides) that have shown promise in clinical setting but have not yet assessed in corneal fibrosis context are also discussed.}

abstract = {With the development of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), the sensory evaluation methods of apparent texture and oral texture of TCM oral liquid formulations have increased the difficulty of texture simulation in the preparation of TCM placebos due to the lack of systematic research, especially the selection of fillers. In this study, the contact angle (CA), advancing angle (AA) and receding angle (RA), and friction coefficient (Uf) combined with oral stimulation results were discovered to characterize the spreading, fluid flow and lubrication behavior of 59 types of TCM oral liquid formulations on their oral properties. Besides, optical density (OD)and sedimentation volume (Sv) combined with particle number was verified with the clarity property of TCM oral liquid formulations on apparent texture. Based on these, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to classify TCM oral liquid formulations and analyze the characteristics of each category based on organoleptic properties. And decision tree was used for validation and inference function. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were established to predict the clarity property (OD), Sv, lubricity (Uf) and spreading property (CA) based on the TCM oral liquid formulation's fundamental properties. The results show that: (i) the apparent texture and oral texture of TCM oral liquid formulations were quite different; (ii) These formulations could be classified well based on their organoleptic parameters (Sv, OD, AA, RA, CA, Uf20, Uf0.05, Uf40). The order of these formulations complex for placebo simulation was identified as Group 1 > Group 2 > Group 3; (iii) Density is beneficial to the OD, Uf20 and CA. The final time (FT), settling velocity (SV) and PN of TCM oral liquid formulations correlated positively with Sv; nevertheless, the CA correlated negatively with Uf20. Overall, this study systematically evaluated the apparent and oral texture properties of TCM oral liquid formulations and found the key properties that affect their organoleptic properties. In the light of classification results, it can predicate applicability of fillers for TCM placebo texture simulation.}

keywords = {Radiology, Female, Residency, Under-represented in medicine},
abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Diagnostic radiology remains one of the least diverse medical specialties. Recent reports have found that the number of female and under-represented in medicine (URiM) residents have not increased despite efforts to increase representation over the last decade. Given the critical role of residency program directors in selecting diverse applicants, this study was performed to identify which strategies were most preferred to increase the number of female and/or URiM residents by directors of diagnostic radiology residency training programs.
Materials and Methods
This was an anonymous, cross-sectional study of diagnostic radiology residency program directors that included a survey about program characteristics, demographics, and strategies to increase the number of female and/or URiM residents.
Results
The questionnaire was submitted to 181 potential participants with a 19.9% response rate. The most preferred strategies to increase diversity involved directly recruiting medical students, promoting mentorship, increasing the number of diverse teaching faculty, and unconscious bias training. The least supported strategies included deemphasizing exam scores, accepting more international graduates, accepting a minimum number of female and/or URiM applicants, and de-identifying applications. Female and/or URiM program directors indicated a statistically significant preference for medical student recruitment and providing an opportunity to discuss workplace issues for female and/or URiM trainees (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Diagnostic radiology residency program directors endorsed a wide variety of strategies to increase diversity. Recruitment of female and/or URiM medical students and promoting the number of diverse faculty members and mentorship of trainees by these faculty appear to be the most preferred strategies to increase female and/or URiM residents. Female and/or URiM program directors placed a greater importance on recruiting diverse applicants and supporting safe discussion of workplace issues faced by female and/or URiM radiology residents.}

abstract = {Background
Medical professional performances can be assessed by objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) where medical trainees go through a series of simulated clinical situations. OSCEs are now the gold standard for the assessment of medical students’ competence during their training. In France, the first national OSCEs will take place in May 2024 and respiratory teachers will be involved in this reform and will use OSCEs for students’ training and assessment in respiratory medicine. Students training regarding this final OSCE may vary across medical faculties and may impact students' results. Therefore, we aimed to provide a national overview of OSCE's training performed by respiratory teachers and their interest in developing a common French databank of OSCEs.
Methods
We conducted a national anonymous online survey among the members of the French college of respiratory teachers (CEP), from 2021 February the 15th to 2021 June the 15th. The survey consisted of 32 questions.
Results
Among 118 French pulmonologists teachers, 52 (45%) responded to the survey. We received a response from at least one of each of the French Medical Universities. Twenty-two (42%) had received specific training on how to conduct an OSCE. Twenty-eight (54%) of respondents used OSCEs for training purposes and 24 (46%) for assessment purposes, for less than 1 year in more than half of the participants. The average satisfaction scores out of 10 about OSCEs was 7.3 ± 1.7 for training and 7.4 ± 1.5 for students’ assessment. Respondents were willing (8.9 ± 1.8 out of ten) to develop a common databank to share OSCEs subjects in respiratory medicine in France.
Conclusions
This survey confirms heterogeneity in the training and the use of OSCEs among French respiratory teachers. However, a common national databank could be a useful tool to reduce these disparities.}

We aimed to establish a simple and efficient cryopreservation method for mouse small intestinal organoids (MIOs) and colon organoids (MCOs) using various concentrations of cryoprotectant. Based on the theoretical simulation, we optimized the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration by pretreating the organoids with 5, 7.5, and 10% DMSO for 30 min at 4 °C to allow penetration into the organoids and evaluated their viability, proliferation, and function after cryopreservation. Gene expression in the MIOs and staining of lineage markers were examined real-time PCR. The organoids in the DMSO-treated groups as well as the control, expressed ChrgA, Ecad, Muc2, Lyz, villin, and Lgr5, and there are no significant. A forskolin-induced swelling assay for MIOs was performed to confirm normal cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity. Similar forskolin-induced swelling was observed in the DMSO-treated groups and the control. In addition, MCOs were transplanted into mouse colon for confirmation of regeneration therapy efficacy. Thawing organoids were cultured for two and four sequential passages after cryopreservation with 5% DMSO to confirm any changes in the gene expression of lineage markers after subculture. We developed a simple and efficient organoid freezing method using 5% DMSO with low potential toxicity and validated our findings with theoretical simulation.}

abstract = {Background
Referrals to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) remain low despite evidence showing reduction in cardiovascular mortality and hospital readmissions. Resident education and awareness may be an opportunity to address barriers to CR referrals.
Methods
This pilot study involves 20 internal medicine residents rotating at an ambulatory primary care clinic. Voluntary surveys were sent through an online-based survey platform. Following survey completion, residents received a 10-minute scripted lecture and an educational handout outlining CR components, availability, indications, insurance eligibility criteria, and referral process. Surveys were redistributed 2 months post-education to assess changes in mean aggregate knowledge scores and attitude ratings on a 5-point Likert scale. CR referral rates of eligible patients pre- and post-education were obtained through review of electronic medical records.
Results
Sixteen (80%) residents completed both pre and post surveys, and 13 (81%) reported no education on CR in the prior year. There was a significant increase in mean aggregate knowledge scores on CR components (5.1 versus 7.0, P = 0.001), insurance coverage (2.4 versus 5.6, P< 0.001), and eligible diagnoses (7.1 versus 9.9, P = 0.03) following education. Attitudes towards CR also improved following education, particularly in self-reported comfort level with explaining CR to patients (3.69 versus 2.06, P<0.001) and perceived familiarity with CR referral process (4.00 versus 2.18, P<0.001). CR referrals increased from 0% (0 out of 10 eligible patients) to 33% (3 out of 9 eligible patients) over a 2-month period before and after education, respectively (P = 0.09).
Conclusions
Internal medicine resident knowledge and attitudes towards CR significantly improved after formal education. Although there was a modest increase in the rates of CR referrals following resident education, this pilot study was not powered to detect statistical significance.}

Lagotis integra W. W. Smith (L. integra W. W. Smith) is an important origin plant of the famous Tibetan medicine HERBA LAGOTIS. It was documented to treat “Chi Ba” disease clinically, the symptoms of which are similar to ulcerative colitis (UC).
Aims of this study
To screen out the active components and study the mechanisms of L. integra W. W. Smith treating UC.
Materials and methods
The components of L. integra W. W. Smith were comprehensively analyzed using UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS method. The mechanisms were investigated using network pharmacology method including target prediction, protein-protein interaction network analysis and gene enrichment analysis. Then, the mechanisms were verified using Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS)-induced UC model. Finally, the core active components were further screened out through molecular docking.
Results
The results showed that 32 major components were identified including 8 flavonoids, 9 phenylpropanoid glycosides, 13 iridoid glycosides and 1 phenolic acid. 76 potential core therapeutic targets and top 5 key targets, which were AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and caspase-3 (CASP3), were screened out according to network pharmacology analysis. Animal experiments confirmed that those compounds could downregulate the expression levels of the 5 key target proteins in colonic tissue of mice to exert excellent anti-UC effect. Molecular docking results showed that the main active components were echinacoside, hemiphroside B, plantamajoside, plantainoside D, 10-O-trans-isoferuloyl catalpol and scutellarioside II.
Conclusions
For the first time, our study provides insights into the effective materials and molecular mechanisms of L. integra W. W. Smith treating UC, which contributes to the understanding of its pharmacodynamics.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
This is the first multi-center study intended to document the prevalence, characteristics, and associations of depression in Medicine patients at the time of hospital discharge and their referral to Primary Care (PC).
Methods
Adult patients randomly selected among consecutive admissions to Medicine wards in 8 hospitals in Spain, covering health districts, were examined in a two-phase 'case-finding' procedure. Standardized, Spanish versions of instruments were used, including the Standardized Polyvalent Psychiatric Interview (SPPI) and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). Cases of depression were diagnosed according to ICD-10 general hospital research criteria.
Results
Three hundred and twelve patients with treatable depression and 777 non-depressed controls were identified. In a conservative estimate, the global prevalence of major depression was 7.1%, dysthymia 4.2% and adjustment depression 7.1%, and 51.9% of cases were of moderate/ severe intensity. Depression was more frequent in women, the differences being significant in all categories of depression. The prevalence of depression was lower in individuals aged 85 or more years, the differences being significant in cases of both dysthymia and adjustment depression. A clear pattern of decreasing prevalence with age was observed in women. The depressed had as an average five medical systems affected, and higher CIRS scores compared with the controls, the differences being significant in cases of both major depression and dysthymia.
Conclusions
This is the first report showing a considerable prevalence of treatable cases of depression in Medicine patients at the time of hospital discharge and referral to PC. Depression is associated with the severity of the medical condition, and differences observed by age and sex have clinical implications.

In food animal production medicine (FAPM), the success of control programs for infectious diseases that have serious animal health and economic consequences frequently rely on the veterinarian's effective communication and producer adherence to veterinary recommendations. However, little research has been conducted on communication skills of practicing FAPM veterinarians. During this study, we developed a communication training workshop intervention to support the Atlantic Johne's Disease Initiative. Seventeen FAPM veterinarians across 10 clinics practicing within Maritime Canada participated in a pre-post intervention study design. Communication skills were evaluated utilizing 3 assessment tools; an objective structured clinical exam (OSCE), standardized client feedback, and an instrument designed for veterinary participants to assess their self-efficacy. Study results showed that before training, communication skills of participating veterinarians had limitations, including skill deficits in communication tasks strongly associated with increased adherence to veterinary recommendations. Based on the 3 assessment tools, communication skills of participating veterinarians improved with the training provided. Significant increases were detected in pre- to postintervention self-efficacy percentage scores, OSCE percentage and global scores from expert raters, and OSCE percentage and global scores from standardized client feedback. These improvements emphasize the importance of communication skills training specific to FAPM.}

abstract = {Introduction
Vascular disease (VD) is the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality and its prevalence increases with age. Old patients are not included in studies on VD, their characteristics and treatments being unknown.
Objective
Know the clinical characteristics of nonagenarian patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine services with a diagnosis of established VD and the adequacy of their pharmacological management.
Material and methods
The NONAVASC-2 registry is an observational, prospective, multicentre study. Hospitalized patients for any cause were included. Data collection was carried out through an anonymous online database with sociodemographic, clinical, analytical, therapeutic and evolutionary parameters.
Results
One thousand forty-nine patients with a mean age of 93.14 years (57.8% women) were included. The prevalence of risk factors and VD was high: hypertension (84.9%), dyslipidemia (50.9%) and diabetes mellitus (29.4%). 33.4% presented severe-total dependency. 82.9% received antithrombotic treatment (53.7% antiplatelets, 25.4% anticoagulation and 3.8% double therapy). Only 38.2% received statins. The percentage of severe dependence (39.2% vs 24.1%; p = 0.00) and severe cognitive impairment (30.8% vs 13.8%; p = 0.00) was significantly higher among patients who did not receive them. 19% died during admission.
Conclusions
Nonagenarian patients with VD present high comorbidity, dependence and mortality. Despite being in secondary prevention, 17% did not receive antithrombotics and only 38% received statins. The underprescription is conditioned, among other factors, by the functional status. More studies are necessary to determine the impact of this issue on their prognosis.
Resumen
Introducción
La enfermedad vascular (EV) es la causa más frecuente de morbimortalidad, y su prevalencia incrementa con la edad. Los pacientes muy añosos no se encuentran incluidos en los estudios sobre EV, desconociéndose sus características y tratamientos.
Objetivo
Conocer las características clínicas de los pacientes nonagenarios hospitalizados en servicios de medicina interna con diagnóstico de EV establecida y la adecuación de su manejo farmacológico.
Material y métodos
El Registro NONAVASC-2 es un estudio observacional, prospectivo y multicéntrico. Se incluyeron pacientes hospitalizados por cualquier causa. La recogida de datos se realizó a través de una base anonimizada online con parámetros sociodemográficos, clínicos, analíticos, terapéuticos y evolutivos.
Resultados
Se incluyeron 1.049 pacientes con una edad media de 93,14 años (57,8% mujeres). La prevalencia de los factores de riesgo fue muy elevada: hipertensión (84,9%), dislipemia (50,9%) y diabetes mellitus (29,4%). El 33,4% presentaba dependencia grave/total. El 82,9% recibía tratamiento antitrombótico (53,7% antiagregantes, 25,4% anticoagulación y 3,8% doble terapia). Solo el 38,2% recibía estatinas. El porcentaje de dependencia (39,2 vs. 24,1%; p = 0,00) y deterioro cognitivo grave (30,8 vs. 13,8%; p = 0,00) era significativamente mayor entre los pacientes que no las recibían. El 19% falleció durante el ingreso.
Conclusión
Los pacientes nonagenarios con EV presentan una elevada comorbilidad, dependencia y mortalidad. A pesar de estar en prevención secundaria, el 17% de ellos no recibía antitrombóticos y solo el 38% estatinas. Esta infraprescripción está condicionada por la situación funcional, entre otros factores, por lo que es necesario realizar más estudios para conocer el impacto sobre su pronóstico.}

abstract = {Objective
To improve access to oral medicine (OM) and orofacial pain (OFP) specialty care for Black and Hispanic patients in the Greater Boston area.
Methods
We assembled a team comprised of faculty and residents from the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Division of OM and Dentistry and Massachusetts General Hospital Division (MGH) of OFP. We then created relationships with local community health centers (CHC) serving largely Hispanic and Black patients and provided OM and OFP lectures to their clinicians to increase awareness of these specialties. In August 2021, we launched BWH OM and MGH OFP e-consult services for use by these CHC providers. In February 2022, we initiated a monthly OM/OFP clinic at Brookside Community Health Center (BCHC).
Results
A total of 61 e-consults (BWH OM: n = 37, MGH OFP: n = 24) have been completed, of which, over one-third were regarding Hispanic (n = 16, 26%) 26% (n = 16) and Black (n = 5, 8%) patients. Over 7 monthly clinical sessions at BCHC, care was established for 24 new patients. With respect to race (available for 13 of these 24 patients, 54%), 8% identified as Black (n = 2), 8% white (n = 2), 4% Asian (n = 1), and 34% other (n = 8), which includes those who identified as multiple races. Regarding ethnicity, 87% identified as Hispanic (n = 21) and 13% as not Hispanic (n = 3). One year following the implementation of these interventions, there was a modest increase in the portion of Black and Hispanic patients seen at both BWH OM (+1% Black, +1% Hispanic) and MGH OFP (+2% Black, +3% Hispanic).
Conclusions
Introducing OM and OFP to local CHCs via educational lectures, offering an e-consultation service to their clinicians, and implementing an OM/OFP clinic within an existing, trusted CHC resulted in initial strides toward increasing access to OM and OFP specialty care for Black and Hispanic patients in the Greater Boston area.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objectives
Registered nurse prescribing has been put forth, for decades, as an innovative approach to meet growing healthcare needs, particularly in areas of care where medications are essential and highly controlled such as for patients requiring cancer and palliative care. However, the adoption of innovative health delivery models requires acceptance by key stakeholders. This study explores cancer and palliative care nurses’ attitudes toward nurse prescribing and their perceptions about educational requirements for a nurse prescriber.
Data Sources
A cross-sectional survey was distributed to Australian nurses between March and July 2021. Data were collected using the Advancing Implementation of Nurse Prescribing in Australia online survey. Pearson χ2 tests were used to examine associations between nurses in cancer care, palliative care, and all other specialties on demographics, attitudes to nurse prescribing, and educational perspectives to become prescribers. Of the 4,424 nurses who participated in the survey, 161 nurses identified they worked in cancer care and 109 in palliative care settings.
Conclusion
Although nurses have a common set of core capabilities, their work contexts and their professional experiences shape their attitudes toward practice. Nurses in cancer care were significantly less certain than nurses in palliative care [χ2(2) = 6.68, P = .04], and nurses from all other specialties [χ2(2) =13.87, P = <.01] of the benefits of nurse prescribing (ie, nurse prescribing would decrease health care system costs, reduce patient risk). Nurses in cancer care were more certain that successfully implementing nurse prescribing requires strong support from their medical and pharmacy colleagues. In addition, nurses working in cancer and palliative care agreed that improving patient care was their primary motivator for becoming a prescriber.
Implications for Nursing Practice
Open to expanding their role and responsibilities, nurses in cancer and palliative care settings reported that successfully adopting nurse prescribing must be supported by their other healthcare colleagues within the same environment, which demands strong interprofessional collaborative efforts.}
