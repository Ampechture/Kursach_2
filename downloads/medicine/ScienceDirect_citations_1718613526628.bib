abstract = {Introduction
Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is an increasingly popular tool used in the care of medical patients by Acute and General Internal Medicine Physicians. This is an audit of the first year of a UK District General Hospital Acute medicine department using POCUS; to try to determine when, where, why and how effectively the imaging modality is being used. We developed a novel reporting system whereby an electronic reporting template was used as part of the mandatory reporting of scans.
Method
Due to our electronic medical records we were able to use our novel reporting system to comprehensively collect data from all formally reported scans over the course of 12 months. Each scan was assessed according to the following parameters: time from admission to when the scan was performed; how the scan contributed to or changed a patient's management, subsequent requirement for formal departmental imaging and how many scans were performed by trainees.
Results
We were able to collect the data from 585 scan reports. The majority of which were thoracic scans, with a number of Echo, DVT and renal scans. The minority were for procedural scans. Over 50% of the scans were undertaken on the Acute Assessment Unit, with the Same Day Emergency Care Unit and Emergency Department making up the rest. A significant proportion of the scans negated the need for departmental imaging, which highlights the potential for reducing the workload for radiology and improving patient flow through the Acute Medical wards.
Conclusion
POCUS is an established practice in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine however its utility in General Medicine is expanding and evolving. Therefore, this work attempts to understand how POCUS is being used in this setting to highlight areas for further development. We believe this is the first work of its kind in Acute or General Medicine in the United Kingdom and the results will help inform practice both locally and potentially nationally, to help other units who are considering developing their own POCUS service.}

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare but serious condition associated with significant morbidity.
Objective
This review provides a focused assessment of MS for emergency clinicians, including the presentation, evaluation, and emergency department (ED) management based on current evidence.
Discussion
MS is an autoimmune disorder targeting the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by clinical relapses and radiological lesions disseminated in time and location. Patients with MS most commonly present with long tract signs (e.g., myelopathy, asymmetric spastic paraplegia, urinary dysfunction, Lhermitte's sign), optic neuritis, or brainstem syndromes (bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia). Cortical syndromes or multifocal presentations are less common. Radiologically isolated syndrome and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) may or may not progress to chronic forms of MS, including relapsing remitting MS, primary progressive MS, and secondary progressive MS. The foundation of outpatient management involves disease-modifying therapy, which is typically initiated with the first signs of disease onset. Management of CIS and acute flares of MS in the ED includes corticosteroid therapy, ideally after diagnostic testing with imaging and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Emergency clinicians should evaluate whether patients with MS are presenting with new-onset debilitating neurological symptoms to avoid unnecessary testing and admissions, but failure to appropriately diagnose CIS or MS flare is associated with increased morbidity.
Conclusions
An understanding of MS can assist emergency clinicians in better diagnosing and managing this neurologically devastating disease.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological human diseases, affecting 1% of the population in all age groups. Despite the availability of over 25 anti-seizure medications (ASMs), which are approved in most industrialized countries, approximately 30% of epilepsy patients still experience seizures that are resistant to these drugs. Since ASMs target only limited number of neurochemical mechanisms, drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is not only an unmet medical need, but also a formidable challenge in drug discovery.
Aim
In this review, we examine recently approved epilepsy drugs based on natural product (NP) such as cannabidiol (CBD) and rapamycin, as well as NP-based epilepsy drug candidates still in clinical development, such as huperzine A. We also critically evaluate the therapeutic potential of botanical drugs as polytherapy or adjunct therapy specifically for DRE.
Methods
Articles related to ethnopharmacological anti-epileptic medicines and NPs in treating all forms of epilepsy were collected from PubMed and Scopus using keywords related to epilepsy, DRE, herbal medicines, and NPs. The database clinicaltrials.gov was used to find ongoing, terminated and planned clinical trials using herbal medicines or NPs in epilepsy treatment.
Results
A comprehensive review on anti-epileptic herbal drugs and natural products from the ethnomedical literature is provided. We discuss the ethnomedical context of recently approved drugs and drug candidates derived from NPs, including CBD, rapamycin, and huperzine A. Recently published studies on natural products with preclinical efficacy in animal models of DRE are summarized. Moreover, we highlight that natural products capable of pharmacologically activating the vagus nerve (VN), such as CBD, may be therapeutically useful to treat DRE.
Conclusions
The review highlights that herbal drugs utilized in traditional medicine offer a valuable source of potential anti-epileptic drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action, and with clinical promise for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Moreover, recently developed NP-based anti-seizure medications (ASMs) indicate the translational potential of metabolites of plant, microbial, fungal and animal origin.}

abstract = {Motivation and objective: Emergency medicine is becoming a popular application area for artificial intelligence methods but remains less investigated than other healthcare branches. The need for time-sensitive decision-making on the basis of high data volumes makes the use of quantitative technologies inevitable. However, the specifics of healthcare regulations impose strict requirements for such applications. Published contributions cover separate parts of emergency medicine and use disparate data and algorithms. This study aims to systematize the relevant contributions, investigate the main obstacles to artificial intelligence applications in emergency medicine, and propose directions for further studies. Methods: The contributions selection process was conducted with systematic electronic databases querying and filtering with respect to established exclusion criteria. Among the 380 papers gathered from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer Library, ScienceDirect, and Nature databases 116 were considered to be a part of the survey. The main features of the selected papers are the focus on emergency medicine and the use of machine learning or deep learning algorithms. Findings and discussion: The selected papers were classified into two branches: diagnostics-specific and triage-specific. The former ones are focused on either diagnosis prediction or decision support. The latter covers such applications as mortality, outcome, admission prediction, condition severity estimation, and urgent care prediction. The observed contributions are highly specialized within a single disease or medical operation and often use privately collected retrospective data, making them incomparable. These and other issues can be addressed by creating an end-to-end solution based on human-machine interaction. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence applications are finding their place in emergency medicine, while most of the corresponding studies remain isolated and lack higher generalization and more sophisticated methodology, which can be a matter of forthcoming improvements.}

Although experimental and large-scale clinical evidence indicates the potential long-term efficacy of ChEI, primary outcomes are generally heterogeneous across outpatient clinics and regional healthcare systems. Sub-optimal dosing or slow tapering, heterogeneous guidelines about the timing for therapy initiation (prodromal versus dementia stages), healthcare providers’ ambivalence to treatment, lack of disease awareness, delayed medical consultation, prescription of ChEI in non-AD cognitive disorders, contribute to the negative outcomes. We present an evidence-based overview of determinants, spanning genetic, molecular, and large-scale networks, involved in the response to ChEI in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A comprehensive understanding of cerebral and retinal cholinergic system dysfunctions along with ChEI response predictors in AD is crucial since disease-modifying therapies will frequently be prescribed in combination with ChEI. Therapeutic algorithms tailored to genetic, biological, clinical (endo)phenotypes, and disease stages will help leverage inter-drug synergy and attain optimal combined response outcomes, in line with the precision medicine model.}

The use of natural health products has increased globally. It is important to properly regulate these products to guarantee good quality control, ensure consumers' safety, and integrate them into modern medicine. This study was conducted to identify the prevalence of NHP use among university employees in Nineveh Province, Iraq, along with the employees’ awareness, usage patterns, attitudes, and information needs.
Method
A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2 October and 6 December 2022 in four main universities (Mosul, Nineveh, Al- Hamdaniya, and Tal-Afar) in Nineveh Province, Iraq. Data were collected face-to-face through an interviewer-administrated structured questionnaire from a multi-stage sampling of employees. Information was gathered using a data collection form and sent to a Microsoft Office Excel® (2010) spreadsheet. Statistical significance was determined using a chi-squared test, with a p-value of less than 0.01 representing a significant finding.
Results
Our results showed that (42.2% of the sample used herbal medications. However, we identified a statistically significant correlation between the female gender and herbal medicine use (p = 0.001). More than half of those surveyed (56%) felt that herbal medicines might be used to prevent and treat sickness, and 49% felt that they were safe to use. A total of 153 people (37.4%) said they felt comfortable combining herbal remedies with conventional treatments. Females were shown to have more knowledge regarding the origin of herbal medicines than males, and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.05). Further, there was a statistically significant difference between the percentage of those with no medical problems and those with chronic diseases who used herbal medicines (p = 0.001). Intriguingly, over half of all respondents (n = 204; 49.9%) initially relied on herbal remedies whenever they fell ill, and nearly as many (n = 172; 42.1%) did not even check with their doctors before using herbal remedies.
Conclusion
When writing prescriptions and delivering medications to patients, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists should take care to inform patients about the effectiveness and adverse effects of herbal medicine (HMs) using evidence-based information. To increase patients’ awareness of pharmaceutical use, patient counselling and education are necessary.}

Objective: The primary objective was to identify the racial and ethnic and gender distributions across academic ranks in EM. The secondary objective was to describe the racial and gender proportions across different tenure tracks and degrees. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. Simple descriptive statistics and time series analysis were employed to assess the trends and relationship between race and gender across academic rank, type of degree, and tenure status. Results: When averaged, 75% of all faculty members were White physicians and 67.5% were male. Asian faculty members showed an increased representation in the lower academic ranks and underrepresented minority groups demonstrated a small increase. Asian faculty members demonstrated a significantly increasing trend at the level of instructor (t = 0.02; p = 0.034; 95% CI 0.05–1.03). Female faculty members showed a significantly decreasing trend over the study period (t = –0.01; p < 0.001; 95% CI 0.68–0.75). White academic physicians and male faculty members made up most of all degree types and tenure categories. Conclusions: Despite an increase in proportional representation, the underrepresentation of female faculty members and those from minority groups persists in emergency medicine. Further studies are needed to identify and address the root causes of these differences.}

abstract = {Objectives
Oral medicine, due to its interfaces with medicine, is a central specialty for the progress of dentistry in developing countries and has undergone a clear expansion in several parts of the globe in addition to the United States, the UK, and Europe. Hence, it has become paramount to define the status of the clinical practice of Oral Medicine in Latin American and Caribbean countries so that the results may drive consolidation and practice progress. Methods: this was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered REDCap web-based survey designed by an international panel of Oral Medicine experts (in Spanish and English) to assess the current state of Oral Medicine practice in Latin America and the Caribbean. The survey was sent to Oral Medicine specialists and responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results
Specialists representing 21 countries answered the questionnaire showing a mean age of 46.9 years and a slight male predominance (1.1:1). A high rate (over 90%) of training based on postgraduate courses coupled with >75% of the specialists having training in international institutions was observed. Oral medicine is recognized as an official specialty (certified by ministries of health or education) in approximately 40% of the countries targeted by the study; in more than 66% of the countries it is independent of oral pathology and more than 42% of countries reported official graduate programs in oral medicine. Approximately 50% of the countries studied do not have policies or regulations for professionalization in oral medicine and a very heterogeneous understanding of the clinical competencies of oral medicine was observed. Private practice was the most common field of work in the investigated context and more than 90% of the specialists representing Latin America and the Caribbean reported that the lack of recognition of oral medicine as a specialty by multidisciplinary health teams is the greatest barrier to the expansion of specialized clinical practice.
Conclusions
This seems to be the first study to depicture the professional profile of Latin American and Caribbean oral medicinists and to demonstrate a heterogenous professional background as well as a poorly recognized reputation within a multidisciplinary medical context.}

abstract = {Background
Adequate knowledge, attitude and practices about the use of antibiotics are essential for effective treatment and the cure of diseases.
Objective
To assess the knowledge, attitude and practice towards the use of antibiotics among the outpatients of the general medicine department and to find the factors that are significantly associated with it.
Materials and methods
A prospective cross-sectional study of eight months duration was carried out among 263 outpatients, in the department of general medicine. The socio-demographic details pertaining to the patients were collected in a well-designed data collection form. The knowledge, attitude and practice of the subjects were assessed by using previously validated KAP questionnaire.
Results
The highest number of subjects were found to be females, 135 (51.3%), and most of the subjects belonged to the age category of 18–34 years, 107 (40.7%). The mean score of knowledge, attitude and practice were found to be 62.74 ± 23.28, 76.96 ± 17.73, and 52.55 ± 14.06 respectively. Age, domiciliary status, educational qualification, occupation, and socio-economic class were found to be the factors significantly associated with knowledge. Factors significantly associated with attitude were found to be age, educational qualification and socio-economic class whereas only educational qualification and occupation were found associated with practice.
Conclusion
The results of the current study will serve as the foundation for future implications to enhance public knowledge and perceptions regarding antibiotic usage.}

Responding to calls for human genomics to shift away from the use of race, genomic investigators are coalescing around the possibility of using genetic ancestry. This shift has renewed questions about the use of social and genetic concepts of difference in precision medicine research (PMR). Drawing from qualitative data on five PMR projects, we illustrate negotiations within and between research teams as genomic investigators deliberate on the relevance of race and genetic ancestry for different analyses and contexts. We highlight how concepts of both social and genetic difference are embedded within and travel through research practices, and identify multiple points across the research life course at which conceptual slippage and conflation between race and genetic ancestry occur. We argue that moving beyond race will require PMR investigators to confront the entrenched ways in which race is built into research practices and biomedical infrastructures.}

abstract = {Objective
To analyze the medication rules of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for malaria treatment.
Methods
Statistical analysis was conducted on the basic attributes of TCM drugs with regard to property, therapeutic methods, flavor, and meridian tropism. A complex network of TCM drug associations was constructed. Cluster analysis was applied to obtain the core drugs for malaria treatment. The Apriori algorithm was applied to analyze the association rules of these core drugs.
Results
A total of 3S7 herbs were used 3,194 times in 461 prescriptions for malaria treatment. Radix Glycyrrhizae (), Rhizoma Pinelliae (), Radix Bupleuri (), and Radix Dichroae () were the frequently used herbs through supplementing, exterior-releasing, heat-clearing, qi-rectifying, and damp-resolving therapeutic methods. Such herbs had warm, natural, and cold herbal properties; pungent, bitter, and sweet flavors; and spleen, lung, and stomach meridian tropisms. Cluster analysis showed 61 core drugs, including Radix Glycyrrhizae, Rhizoma Pinelliae, Radix Bupleuri, and Radix Scutellariae (). Apriori association rule analysis yielded 12 binomial rules (herb pairs) and 6 trinomial rules (herb combinations). Radix Bupleuri plus Radix Scutellariae was the core herbal pair for treating malaria. This pair could be combined with Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae () for treating warm or cold malaria, combined with Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae () or Radix Dichroae () for treating miasmic malaria, or combined with turtle shells () for treating malaria with splenomegaly.
Conclusions
TCM can be used to classify and treat malaria in accordance with the different stages of development. As the core herbal pair, Radix Bupleuri and Radix Scutellariae can be combined with other drugs to treat malaria with different syndrome types.}

Herein, a novel heating online extraction electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (H-oEESI-MS) was developed for the rapid and direct analysis of extremely complex substances without the requirement for any sample pretreatment or pre-separation steps. The overall molecular profile and fragment structure features of various herbal medicines could be completely captured within 10–15 s, with minimal sample (<0.5 mg) and solvent consumption (<20 μL for one sample). Furthermore, a rapid differentiation and authentication strategy for TCMs based on H-oEESI-MS was proposed, including metabolic profile characterization, characteristic marker screening and identification, and multivariate statistical analysis model validation. In an analysis of 52 batches of seven types of Aconitum medicinal materials, 20 and 21 key compounds were screened out as the characteristic markers of raw and processed Aconitum herbal medicines, respectively, and the possible structures of all the characteristic markers were comprehensively identified based on Compound Discoverer databases. Finally, multivariate statistical analysis showed that all the different types of herbal medicines were well differentiated and identified (R2X > 0.87, R2Y > 0.91, and Q2 > 0.72), which further verified the feasibility and reliability of this comprehensive strategy for the rapid authentication of different TCMs based on H-oEESI-MS. In summary, this rapid authentication strategy realized the ultra-high-throughput, low-cost, and standardized detection of various complex TCMs for the first time, thereby demonstrating wide applicability and value for the development of quality standards for TCMs.}

Readmission to primary care is challenging for patients due to involvement of multiple healthcare providers across different settings and implementing new medicines into their daily routine. Elucidating patients’ needs is crucial to tailor counseling support.
Objective
To explore the patient perspectives on implementing a newly prescribed cardiovascular medicine into their daily routine at readmission to primary care.
Methods
A qualitative study was performed within the outpatient pharmacy. Adult patients who were prescribed a new cardiovascular medicine by their treating hospital physician at hospital discharge or during an outpatient clinic visit were eligible to participate. Purposive sampling was applied to equally distribute adherence-influencing factors. Patients were interviewed by telephone and inclusion continued until theoretical data saturation. An adapted Greenhalgh framework for implementation research was used for a thematic content analysis by conceptualizing the new medicine as an innovation that requires implementation by a patient (adopter).
Results
Data saturation was reached at 44 patients of which 19 discontinued their new medicine at the time of the interview. Reasons for discontinuing included: side-effects, insufficient efficacy or negligence. Patients considered a lack of basic knowledge on their newly prescribed cardiovascular medicine as a major barrier for adopting it into their daily routine. They were in need of information on risks and benefits of their new medicine. A noticeable effect and tailored counseling facilitated patients in taking their medicine as prescribed. Patients mentioned personalized organizing tools and routinization of medication intake as important success factors for addressing their practical challenges with their new medicine.
Conclusions
By applying the adapted Greenhalgh framework, this study provided a unique and structured insight in patients’ barriers and facilitators that could influence their ability to implement a new cardiovascular medicine at readmission to primary care. This knowledge enables pharmacists to tailor their patient support and provide individualized patient counseling.}

Fine particles, including nano and micro-sized crystals, are increasingly important, particularly in the production of inhalation medicines. A novel application of freeze-dissolving technology has been demonstrated in the production of metronidazole, a model drug. This process involves creating frozen spherical particles by introducing a tert-butanol solution containing dissolved metronidazole into liquid nitrogen. Various antisolvents, such as n-hexane, n-heptane, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, or n-pentanol, were employed to dissolve these frozen templates at temperatures ranging from 248.15 to 278.15 K. During this process, pre-formed metronidazole fine particles within the frozen template were released into the antisolvent solution. An alternative method involved placing these frozen particles into a vacuumed freeze dryer to extract the fine particles. The new freeze-dissolving technology can save 99% both energy and time compared to the traditional freeze-drying method, demonstrating a significantly more efficient and sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing approach.}

abstract = {Objective
Patients with gynecological cancer commonly use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods to cope with the disease. However, despite the existence of treatment strategies, the effect of fear and anxiety caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on attitudes about CAM use is unclear. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of fear and anxiety experienced by patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic on their attitudes towards the use of CAM.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional and descriptive study that included 177 women with gynecological cancer; participants were recruited from a social networking site for cancer patients in Turkey between June and December 2021. Data were collected using an online survey that included the Personal Information Form, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and the Attitude Towards Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicine Scale. Descriptive statistics, t-test, Pearson’s correlation test, and simple linear and multiple regression analyses were performed to analyze the data.
Results
During the pandemic, 55.4% of the participants reported using CAM methods, but only 22.6% were using CAM before the pandemic. The participants who used CAM during the pandemic also scored higher on the fear of COVID-19 and coronavirus anxiety scales (20.69 ± 5.37 and 13.09 ± 6.29, respectively) compared to the participants who did not use CAM (9.29 ± 2.72 and 6.35 ± 2.06, respectively). Fear of COVID-19 accounted for 52% of the CAM attitude score, while coronavirus anxiety accounted for 15% of the CAM attitude score. Fear of COVID-19 and coronavirus anxiety together accounted for 53% of CAM attitude.
Conclusion
Gynecological cancer patients with high levels of COVID-19-related anxiety and fear during the pandemic used CAM more. Given that the psychological effects of the pandemic will continue in the coming years, CAM use should be evaluated as a coping strategy, especially due to the COVID-19-related anxiety and fear experienced by patients with gynecological cancer. While the rational and effective CAM methods should be supported, strategies should be developed to prevent misuse of CAM and its interference in prescribed medical treatments.

Psychological stress is associated with various diseases including liver dysfunction, yet effective intervention strategies remain lacking due to the unrevealed pathogenesis mechanism.
Purpose
This study aims to explore the relevance between BMAL1-controlled circadian rhythms and lipoxygenase 15 (ALOX15)-mediated phospholipids peroxidation in psychological stress-induced liver injury, and to investigate whether hepatocyte phospholipid peroxidation signaling is involved in the hepatoprotective effects of a Chinese patent medicine, Pien Tze Huang (PZH).
Methods
Restraint stress models were established to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of psychological stress-induced liver injury and the hepatoprotective effects of PZH. Redox lipidomics based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was applied for lipid profiling.
Results
The present study discovered that acute restraint stress could induce liver injury. Notably, lipidomic analysis confirmed that phospholipid peroxidation was accumulated in the livers of stressed mice. Additionally, the essential core circadian clock gene Brain and Muscle Arnt-like Protein-1 (Bmal1) was altered in stressed mice. Circadian disruption in mice, as well as BMAL1-overexpression in human HepaRG cells, also appeared to have a significant increase in phospholipid peroxidation, suggesting that stress-induced liver injury is closely related to circadian rhythm and phospholipid peroxidation. Subsequently, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), a critical enzyme that contributed to phospholipid peroxidation, was screened as a potential regulatory target of BMAL1. Mechanistically, BMAL1 promoted ALOX15 expression via direct binding to an E-box-like motif in the promoter. Finally, this study revealed that PZH treatment significantly relieved pathological symptoms of psychological stress-induced liver injury with a potential mechanism of alleviating ALOX15-mediated phospholipid peroxidation.
Conclusion
Our findings illustrate the critical role of BMAL1-triggered phospholipid peroxidation in psychological stress-induced liver injury and provide new insight into treating psychological stress-associated liver diseases by TCM intervention.}

abstract = {Background
The effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine Huashibaidu granule (HSBD) in treating mild Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain to be identified. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of HSBD in mild COVID-19 patients.
Methods
A prospective, non-randomized, controlled study in mild COVID-19 patients was conducted in Shanghai, China, from April 8 to May 6, 2022. Finally, 360 mild COVID-19 patients received HSBD (orally 20 g twice daily for 7 days), and 368 patients received herbal medicine placebo (orally 20 g twice daily for 7 days). The primary endpoints were the negative conversion rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the negative conversion time. Secondary endpoints included the hospitalized days and the improvement in the clinical condition.
Results
The negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days posttreatment in the HSBD group was higher than that in the control group (95.28% vs. 82.61%, P < 0.001). The median negative conversion time in the HSBD group was markedly decreased by 2 days compared with the control group (3 [3–6] vs. 5 [4–7], P < 0.001). In addition, the median hospitalized day was shortened in the HSBD group by 1 day compared with the control group (6 [4–7] vs. 7 [5–9], P < 0.001). The clinical improvement rate (275/360 [76.39%]) in the HSBD group within 7 days was significantly higher than that (203/368 [55.16%]) in the control group (P < 0.001). The improvement of symptom scores in the HSBD group was higher than that in the control group (2 [1–4] vs. 1 [1–2], P < 0.001). No severe adverse events occurred.
Conclusions
Our study suggested that HSBD effectively increased the negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 and shortened the negative conversion time and hospitalized days in mild COVID-19 patients.
Clinical trial registration
The trial was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2200058668.}

At the level of EFIM and its associated internal societies, promoting educational activities and developing a toolkit to prepare internists to better care for citizens who suffer from the consequences of climate change. In addition to advocating and implementing effective actions to reduce the ecological footprint of the health industry, recommending the introduction of these themes in scientific programs of Internal Medicine meetings and congresses and the pre- and postgraduate medical training. At a personal level, internists must be active agents in advocating sustainable practices for the environment, increasing the awareness of the community about the health risks of climate change and environmental degradation, and being role models in the adoption of environmentally friendly behaviour.}

abstract = {Background
Management of narcolepsy includes behavior strategies and symptomatic pharmacological treatment. In the general population, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is common in Europe (30%), also in chronic neurological disorders (10–20%). The aim of our study was to evaluate frequency and characteristics of CAM use in German narcolepsy patients.
Methods
Demographic, disease-related data frequency and impact of CAM use were assessed in an online survey. Commonly used CAM treatments were predetermined in a questionnaire based on the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and included the domains: (1) alternative medical systems; (2) biologically based therapies; (3) energy therapies; (4) mind-body interventions, and (5) manipulative and body-based therapies.
Results
We analyzed data from 254 questionnaires. Fifteen percent of participants were at the time of survey administration using CAM for narcolepsy, and an additional 18% of participants reported past use. Among the 33% of CAM users, vitamins/trace elements (54%), homoeopathy (48%) and meditation (39%) were used most frequently. 54% of the users described CAM as helpful. CAM users more frequently described having side effects from their previous medication (p = 0.001), and stated more frequently not to comply with pharmacological treatment than non-CAM users (21% vs. 8%; p = 0.024).
Discussion
The use of CAM in narcolepsy patients is common. Our results indicate that many patients still feel the need to improve their symptoms, sleepiness and psychological well-being in particular. Frequent medication change, the experience of adverse events and low adherence to physician-recommended medication appears more frequent in CAM users. The impact of CAM however seems to be limited.}

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.
Objective
This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.
Discussion
Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Change in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein. Imaging options can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings. While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.
Conclusions
An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with acute diverticulitis.}

abstract = {Background
The introduction of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) services into health systems has been advocated by the World Health Organization, but there is a paucity of reviews synthesising the experiences of (i) implementing TCIM services in conventional healthcare settings and (ii) introducing evidence-based practice in TCIM. Knowledge of the first issue will assist policymakers to innovate implementation interventions in their own health system contexts. Addressing the second issue will facilitate the closure of the evidence–practice gap in TCIM and improve the translation of research evidence into health outcome benefits.
Purpose
The aim of this study was to identify, describe and analyse publications on these two key TCIM policy issues via an overview from an implementation science perspective.
Methods
Publications describing international experiences of implementing TCIM services or evidence for TCIM practices were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases in November 2021. The findings were summarised using a narrative synthesis approach.
Results
Sixty-three relevant publications were included in the analysis. Current experiences in China and the United Sates (US) reflect varying policy priorities at different stages of implementing TCIM services. In the US, where TCIM have yet to be introduced into mainstream healthcare settings, implementation interventions were designed to facilitate the provision of specific, evidence-based TCIM modalities via referrals from conventional clinicians. The application of these strategies at the health system, regulatory, financial, community, provider and patient levels provided a comprehensive picture of how TCIM implementation may be facilitated via multi-level interventions. In China, the major form of TCIM is traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), for which service provision has already been adopted at all levels of healthcare. With the high volume of clinical research that has been generated in the past several decades, a key policy question at this stage is how to translate TCM-related clinical evidence into practice. The development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) is the main implementation intervention, but adherence by TCM clinicians has been poor, due to the conflict between classical individualised practice and CPG standardisation. While tailoring interventions to facilitate CPG uptake is indicated, concurrent innovations in TCM clinical research methods would improve the compatibility between classical and CPG-based practice.
Conclusion
Policymakers managing different stages of TCIM implementation will benefit from the experiences of practitioners in the US and China. Multi-level implementation interventions launched in the US provide ideas for the initial introduction of TCIM into a conventional medicine-dominated health system. As TCIM service provision and related clinical research become more common, China's experience will inform how clinical evidence related to TCIM may be disseminated and implemented to improve service quality.}

To map the randomized trial evidence describing the feasibility of discontinuing active medications with potential adverse effects in older patients.
Design
Scoping review with systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library.
Setting and Participants
Randomized trials investigating discontinuation of a single medicine or medicine class in patients with mean age ≥65 years.
Methods
We extracted trial characteristics including study design and assessed bias. As proxies for the “feasibility of discontinuation,” we extracted the “dropout rate” and “disease recurrence rate.”
Results
We identified 40 trials investigating discontinuation of symptomatic (n = 26), preventive (n = 6), or both preventive and symptomatic medicines (n = 8) against psychiatric (n = 10), neurologic (n = 9), musculoskeletal (n = 8), cardiovascular (n = 5), respiratory (n = 4), and urologic diseases (n = 4). Five discontinuation designs were used, 75% (30/40) of trials were placebo-controlled, and 48% (19/40) of trials had bias disfavoring discontinuation. The dropout rate was similar between the discontinuation group and the continuation group in 79% of the trials (30/38), whereas disease recurrence was similar in 72% (23/32) of the trials. In 42% (13/31) of trials reporting both dropout rate and disease recurrence rate, the differences between groups were statistically insignificant and less than 10%; these trials investigated discontinuation of cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease in various settings (n = 3), alendronate for osteoporosis (n = 3), glucosamine for osteoarthritis, lithium as adjunct for unipolar depression, statins for cardiovascular disease in patients with limited life expectancy, droxidopa for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, tamsulosin for lower urinary tract symptoms, sertraline for major depressive episode, and fentanyl patch for low back or osteoarthritis pain.
Conclusions and Implications
We identified 40 randomized trials using a variety of designs investigating discontinuation of both symptomatic and preventive medicines in older patients. Discontinuation of medicines seems feasible for most of the investigated medicines. This scoping review can guide clinical practice and future trials on deprescribing.}

The shrimp shell-derived iron nickel oxide doped magnetic biochar (INOMB) was successfully prepared by a combined impregnation and pyrolysis method. The molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) layer was then in-situ coated onto the surface of the INOMB carrier by the incipient metal coordination interaction between Mct and bimetallic Fe/Ni elements, and dopamine self-autoxidation process. The obtained FeNi@Mct-MIPs was systematically characterized through various characterization techniques. Profiting from the synergistic effect, the synthesized FeNi@Mct-MIPs obviously enhanced the adsorption capacity in capturing Mct, and the maximum adsorption capacity and imprinting factor were determined as 64.59 mg g−1 and 2.16 accordingly. Furthermore, the resultant FeNi@Mct-MIPs composite can be further used as a novel solid-phase extraction absorbent to enrich and detect trace Mct in herbal plants by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrum (UHPLC-MS) technology. Overall, the present INOMB-based composite shows great potential for selective separation and detection of Mct from traditional Chinese medicine samples.}

In this study, a traditional Chinese medicine microspheres (TCM-MPs) target fishing strategy was developed to discover the key drug targets from complex system. The microspheres are composed of Fe3O4 magnetic nanolayer, oleic acid modified layer, the photoaffinity group (4- [3-(Trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl] benzoic acid, TAD) layer and active small molecule layer from inside to outside. TAD produces highly reactive carbene under ultraviolet light, which can realize the self-assembly and fixation of drug active small molecules with non-selective properties. Here, taking Shenqi Jiangtang Granules (SJG) as an example, the constructed TCM-MPs was used to fish the related proteins of human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) lysate. 28 differential proteins were screened. According to the target analysis based on bioinformatics, GNAS was selected as the key target, which participated in insulin secretion and cAMP signaling pathway. To further verify the interaction effect of GNAS and small molecules, a reverse fishing technique was established based on bio-layer interferometry (BLI) coupled with UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS/MS. The results displayed that 26 small molecules may potentially interact with GNAS, and 7 of them were found to have strong binding activity. In vitro experiments for HMCs have shown that 7 active compounds can significantly activate the cAMP pathway by binding to GNAS. The developed TCM-MPs target fishing strategy combined with BLI reverse fishing technology to screen out key proteins that directly interact with active ingredients from complex target protein systems is significant for the discovery of drug targets for complex systems of TCM.}

abstract = {Monitoring the dimerization state of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (Met) was essential for in-depth understanding of the tumor signal transduction network. At present, the dimerization activation pathway of Met protein was mainly studied at the macro level, while the research at the single molecule level was far from comprehensive. Herein, the dimerization activation of Met protein's extracellular domain induced by ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was dynamically studied by single-molecule force spectroscopy. Met protein was immobilized on a biomimetic lipid membrane for ensuring its physiological environment, and then the Met dimers were recognized by bivalent probe which was formed by two Met-binding aptamers. Then the dimeric state of Met protein could be distinguished from monomeric state of Met protein through some parameters, (such as unimodal ratio, bimodal ratio and separation work). The unimodal indicates the occurrence of single molecule binding event, and the bimodal represents the occurrence of double binding event (also represents the presence of Met dimer). Before HGF treatment, most of the Met protein on the lipid membrane was still in the form of monomer, so the unimodal ratio in the force curve was larger (78.8 ± 5.2%), and the bimodal ratio was smaller (17.0 ± 4.1%). After HGF treatment, the unimodal ratio decreased to 54.0 ± 7.4%, and the bimodal ratio increased to 43.2 ± 7.3%. It was due to the formation of dimers after the binding of Met protein on the fluidity lipid membrane with HGF. In addition, the average separation work increased to about 2 times after HGF treatment. Given that studies of Met protein dimerization inhibitors have contributed to the development of more potent and safe inhibitors to significantly inhibit tumor metastasis, the effects of different medicines (including anticoagulant medicines, different antibiotics and anti-cancer medicines) on the dimerization activation of Met protein were then explored by the platform described above. The results showed that anticoagulant medicines heparin and its analogs can significantly inhibit HGF-mediated Met protein activation, while different antibiotics and anticancer medicines had no significant effect on the dimerization of Met protein. This work provided a platform for studying protein dimerization as well as for screening Met protein dimerization inhibitors at the single-molecule level.}

abstract = {Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally despite effective treatments. Along with high-quality health services, essential medicines are a key tool in curbing TB related mortality. Examining relationships between listing TB medicines on national essential medicines lists (NEMLs) and population health outcomes related to amenable mortality is one way to assess TB care.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study of 137 countries, we used linear regression to examine the relationship between the number of TB medicines listed on NEMLs and TB related mortality while controlling for country income, region and TB burden.
Results
Most countries listed essential TB medicines to treat latent, drug-sensitive and disseminated TB but few listed enough for multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) therapy. The total number of TB medicines listed ranged from 1 to 29 (median: 19, interquartile range: 15 to 22). Over 75% of the variation in health outcomes were explained by the number of TB medicines listed, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, region and high-burden MDR-TB status. The number of TB medicines listed was not associated with TB mortality.
Conclusion
Most countries list essential TB treatments and the variation in TB outcomes is explained by other factors such as GDP.}

Here, we report disposable (bio)sensors combining electrochemical and colorimetric technologies on an accessible and lightweight wooden tongue depressor platform. The array of (bio)sensors on this commonly used medical tool enables rapid, and safe saliva sampling and showed promise to be used for frequent self-testing of four clinically relevant biomarkers (glucose, uric acid, nitrite, and thiocyanate) in saliva. The electrochemical system was designed to detect uric acid and glucose by chronoamperometric measurements in clinically relevant concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 µmol/L and from 10 to 5000 µmol/L, respectively. Meanwhile, the colorimetric paper-based spot tests were optimized to detect nitrite and thiocyanate in concentrations ranging from 5 to 200 µmol/L and 0.5 to 2.1 mmol/L, respectively, using digital image colorimetry. Our affordable tongue depressor (bio)sensors provide results within 5 min and achieve limits of detection in the µmol/L range. Importantly, the results provided by our tests when applied to human saliva samples presented excellent concordance with the traditional spectrophotometric method (at a 95 % confidence level), demonstrating the reliability and robustness of our method. In addition, the toxicity and biocompatibility studies of the tongue depressor (bio)sensors were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (Calcein AM), and Calcein Propidium Iodide Hoechst (Calcein PI) Analysis, confirming the safety use of the test. Therefore, our tongue depressor (bio)sensor facilitates frequent testing of several biomarkers and can contribute to personalized medicine.}

Childhood adversity profoundly influences health, well-being, and longevity. Prevention and interventions to mitigate its harmful effects are essential. The American College of Preventive Medicine reviewed the research literature and other professional and governmental statements about adverse childhood experiences to support the development of evidence-based and population-focused recommendations about prevention, screening, and mitigation interventions for childhood adversity.
Methods
We performed an umbrella review to find, assess and synthesize the evidence from systematic reviews focused on 3 key questions: the prevention or mitigation of the effects of adverse childhood experiences; the association of screening for adverse childhood experiences with various benefits, including health outcomes; and the effectiveness and harms of interventions in individuals with elevated adverse childhood experience scores. Adverse childhood experience‒related recommendations from 6 professional and governmental organizations were also reviewed. On the basis of these reviews, the American College of Preventive Medicine developed a position statement through consensus.
Results
A total of 8 systematic reviews, including 260 studies in total, were identified and combined with adverse childhood experiences‒related recommendations from 6 professional organizations to support the American College of Preventive Medicine recommendations. The American College of Preventive Medicine offers 7 adverse childhood experiences‒related recommendations focused on screening, education/training, policy/practice, and research: 2 are evidence-based, and 5 are based on expert opinion. Notably, regarding secondary prevention of adverse childhood experiences, the American College of Preventive Medicine endorses population-level surveillance and research around childhood adversity but not adverse childhood experience screening in individual clinical encounters.
Conclusions
Despite limitations in the heterogeneity and quality of the published systematic reviews, the extant literature supports the American College of Preventive Medicine recommendations. Interventions to enhance protective factors and prevent and mitigate the consequences of adverse childhood experiences and other childhood adversity are promising and require further implementation and research.}

Some traditional medicine systems are supported by huge volumes of literature and records of the theoretical concepts and practical skills; others pass down from generation to generation through verbal teaching. To date, in some parts of the world, the majority of the population continue to rely on their own traditional medicine to meet their primary health care needs.

Preclinical studies have implicated the orexin neuropeptide system as a potential target for psychiatric disorders through its role in regulating emotional, cognitive, and behavioral processes. Clinical studies are investigating orexin modulation in addiction and mood disorders. Here we review performance-outcome measures (POMs) arising from experimental medicine research methods which may show promise as markers of efficacy of orexin receptor modulators in humans. POMs provide objective measures of brain function, complementing patient-reported or clinician-observed symptom evaluation, and aid the translation from preclinical to clinical research. Significant challenges include the development, validation, and operationalization of these measures. We suggest that collaborative networks comprising clinical practitioners, academics, individuals working in the pharmaceutical industry, drug regulators, patients, patient advocacy groups, and other relevant stakeholders may provide infrastructure to facilitate validation of experimental medicine approaches in translational research and in the implementation of these approaches in real-world clinical practice.}

Melanoma, the uncontrolled accumulation of malignant melanocytes, remains one of the most dangerous and deadly types of skin cancer. Current medical interventions, such as radiation and immunotherapy, are ineffective in treating malignant metastatic melanoma of the lung. Due to the complexity of cancer, abnormalities occur and lead to treatment failure.
Methods
In this study, a novel, dual-reaction hydrogel was composed of a thermo-sensitive type (fundamental) and a pH-sensitive type. In addition, the innovative hydrogel showed thermal reversibility and could liquefy at low temperatures and recover at room temperature. We used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and rheometer to observe the hydrogel's mechanical properties.
Significant findings
Results show the hydrogel had a small pore size, revealing positive interactions between molecular chains. The dual-reactive hydrogel exhibited the least cytotoxicity to B16F10 cells in vitro, indicating great biocompatibility and potential. The hydrogel in microparticles brings several advantages, including a high surface area-to-volume ratio and delivery within microscale structures. Microfluidic devices are promising for producing hydrogel particles because they enable high-precision flow control during microfabrication, resulting in precise size and shape. This study used a microfluidic device to produce hydrogel particles and encapsulate cells for future drug screening applications.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Longdan zhike tablet (LDZK) is a Tibetan medicine formula commonly used in the highland region of Tibet, China, to ameliorate respiratory diseases, such as acute bronchitis and asthma. In Chinese traditional medicine, some herbal formulas with anti-inflammatory properties targeting the respiratory system are clinically adopted as supplementary therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the specific anti-COPD effects of LDZK remain to be evaluated.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study is to identify the principal bioactive compounds in LDZK, and elucidate the effects and mechanisms of the LDZK on COPD.
Methods
High-resolution mass spectrometry was utilized for a comprehensive characterization of the chemical composition of LDZK. The therapeutic effects of LDZK were assessed on the LPS-papain-induced COPD mouse model, and LPS-induced activation model of A549 cells. The safety of LDZK was evaluated by orally administering a single dose of 30 g/kg to rats and monitoring physiological and biochemical indicators after a 14-day period. Network pharmacology and Western blot analysis were employed for mechanism prediction of LDZK.
Results
A comprehensive analysis identified a total of 45 compounds as the major constituents of LDZK. Oral administration of LDZK resulted in notable ameliorative effects in respiratory function, accompanied by reduced inflammatory cell counts and cytokine levels in the lungs of COPD mice. Acute toxicity tests demonstrated a favorable safety profile at a dose equivalent to 292 times the clinically prescribed dose. In vitro studies revealed that LDZK exhibited protective effects on A549 cells by mitigating LPS-induced cellular damage, reducing the release of NO, and downregulating the expression of iNOS, COX2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Network pharmacology and Western blot analysis indicated that LDZK primarily modulated the MAPK signaling pathway and inhibited the phosphorylation of p38/ERK/JNK.
Conclusions
LDZK exerts significant therapeutic effects on COPD through the regulation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting its potential as a promising adjunctive therapy for the treatment of chronic inflammation in COPD.}

Environmental based health outcome disparities are well recognized. Social forces based on environmental dystopia will affect public health in a heterogeneous manner and requires reflective practice by interdisciplinary teams of healthcare professional students and practitioners. Fast, cheap sequencing will allow whole genome association studies (GWAS) that can identify genetic risk factors for adverse reactions to specific toxic exposures. Deep analysis of big data can identify gene/environment interactions including epigenetic alterations. Personal exposure information can be gained from citizen science approaches to capturing exposures. Robust reporting mechanisms of suspected exposure can leverage existing data in superfund and other resources. Putting these together will help us to understand disparities and inform environmental justice efforts. To further such efforts, interprofessional teams of healthcare professional students can begin by reflecting on pertinent community service projects they perform together. Specific examples will be discussed as well as experiences of persons met during service-learning. Consideration is given to the microbiome and to marine biology of wetlands, critical sources of food and vulnerable to pesticide and fertilizer run off. Mitigation of outcomes of toxic exposure involves personalized exposure prevention, political action informed by science and chemical interventions like lead chelation. In the future, we may find altering specific polymorphisms in individuals with gene editing methods may gain a place as we move toward personalized medicine in public health. Effective communication between patient and practitioner, learned through development of listening skills and bias mitigation, is essential.

abstract = {Ustukhuddūs (Lavandula stoechas L.) has been extensively used orally and topically in treating various neurological disorders, including dementia. The optimum potential of traditional dosage forms of Ustukhuddūs is limited for various reasons. Transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) is a novel means of drug delivery and is known to overcome the drawbacks associated with traditional dosage forms. The current study aimed at fabricating and evaluating Ustukhuddūs hydro-alcoholic extract (UHAE) and essential oil (UEO) loaded matrix-type transdermal patches having a combination of hydrophilic - hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and hydrophobic - ethyl cellulose (EC) polymers. ATR–FTIR, DSC, XRD, and SEM analysis were carried out to study drug–polymer interactions, confirming the formation of developed patches and drug compatibility with excipients. We assessed the fabricated patches to evaluate their physicochemical properties, in vitro drug release, and permeation characteristics via ex vivo experiments. The physicochemical characteristics of patches showcased the development of good and stable films with clarity, smoothness, homogeneity, optimum flexibility and free from causing skin irritancy or sensitization. In vitro drug release and ex vivo permeation profile of developed patches were evaluated employing Franz diffusion cells. UHAE and UEO patches exhibited a cumulative drug release of 81.61 and 85.24 %, respectively, in a sustained-release manner and followed non-Fickian release mechanisms. The ex vivo permeation data revealed 66.82 % and 76.41 % of drug permeated from UHAE and UEO patches, respectively. The current research suggests that the formulated patches are more suitable for TDDS and hold potential significance in the treatment of dementia, contributing to enhanced patient compliance, thereby highlighting the implication of Unani Medicine in Nisyan (Dementia) treatment.}

Therapeutics based on RNAs have become a viable option for addressing the intricate molecular pathways that underlie the pathophysiology of CVDs. We provide an in-depth analysis of the state of RNA therapies in the context of CVDs, emphasizing various approaches that target the various stages of the basic dogma of molecular biology to effect temporary or long-term changes. In this review, we summarize recent methodologies used to screen for novel coding and non-coding RNA candidates with diagnostic and treatment possibilities in cardiovascular diseases. These methods include single-cell sequencing techniques, functional RNA screening, and next-generation sequencing.Lastly, we highlighted the potential of using oligonucleotide-based chemical products such as modified RNA and RNA mimics/inhibitors for the treatment of CVDs. Moreover, there will be an increasing number of potential RNA diagnostic and therapeutic for CVDs that will progress to expand for years to come.}

abstract = {Background
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), is the main cause of end-stage renal disease, that causes serious physical and psychological burden to patients worldwide. Some traditional treatment measures, such as blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, controlling blood pressure, and following a low-protein diet, may not achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, more effective and safe therapies for IgAN are urgently needed.
Purpose
The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and their active ingredients in the treatment and management of IgAN based on the results of clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, to fully understand the advantages and perspectives of CHMs in the treatment of IgAN.
Study design and methods
For this review, the following electronic databases were consulted: PubMed, ResearchGate, Science Direct, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data, "IgA nephropathy," "traditional Chinese medicine," "Chinese herbal medicine," "herb," "mechanism," "Meta-analysis," "systematic review," "RCT" and their combinations were the keywords to search the relevant literature. Data were collected from 1990 to 2022.
Results
This review found that the active ingredients of CHMs commonly act on multiple signaling pathways in the clinical treatment of IgAN, mainly with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects, and regulation of autophagy.
Conclusion
Compared with the single-target therapy of modern medicine, CHMs can regulate the corresponding pathways from the aspects of anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-fibrosis and autophagy to play a multi-target treatment of IgAN through syndrome differentiation and treatment, which has good clinical efficacy and can be used as the first choice or alternative therapy for IgAN treatment. This review provides evidence and research direction for a comprehensive clinical understanding of the protective effect of Chinese herbal medicine on IgAN.}

abstract = {Introduction
Monthly injectable extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP) can address several systemic and individual barriers to consistent sublingual buprenorphine treatment for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Real-world evaluations of XR-BUP in the outpatient addiction treatment setting are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare 6-month treatment retention and urine drug tests between patients who initiated XR-BUP compared to those who were prescribed but did not initiate XR-BUP in a low-barrier addiction medicine specialty clinic.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with OUD prescribed XR-BUP between 12/1/2018 and 12/31/2020 in a low-barrier addiction medicine specialty clinic to compare 6-month treatment retention between patients who initiated XR-BUP and those who were prescribed but did not initiate XR-BUP (comparison group). Secondary outcomes included percent of urine toxicology tests negative for non-prescribed opioids. Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated factors associated with 6-month treatment retention and XR-BUP initiation.
Results
Of the 233 patients prescribed XR-BUP, 148 (63.8 %) identified as non-Hispanic white, 218 (93.6 %) were insured by public insurance (Medicare/Medicaid), and nearly two-thirds were prescribed XR-BUP due to unstable OUD. Approximately 50 % of patients initiated XR-BUP treatment (mean number of injections = 3.7). About 60 % of XR-BUP-treated patients received supplemental sublingual buprenorphine and nearly two-thirds received a 300 mg maintenance dose. Six-month treatment retention was greater in the XR-BUP treatment versus comparison group (70.3 % vs. 36.5 %, p < 0.001). The XR-BUP treatment group had a higher percentage of opioid-negative urine toxicology tests versus the comparison group (67.2 % vs. 36.3 %, p < 0.001). Receipt of XR-BUP was an independent predictor of 6-month treatment retention (OR 5.40, 95 % CI 2.18–13.38). Those prescribed XR-BUP due to unstable OUD had lower odds of treatment retention (OR 0.41, 95 % CI 0.24–0.98) after controlling for receipt of XR-BUP and other variables known to impact retention.
Conclusions
XR-BUP improved 6-month treatment retention and resulted in a greater proportion of opioid-negative urine toxicology tests compared to a comparison group of patients who were prescribed but did not initiate XR-BUP. Patients with unstable OUD had lower odds of XR-BUP initiation, suggesting the need for targeted interventions to increase XR-BUP uptake in this high-risk population.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Chronic liver diseases mainly include chronic viral liver disease, metabolic liver disease, cholestatic liver disease (CLD), autoimmune liver disease, and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Notably, the compound formulas of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is effective for chronic liver diseases in clinical trials and basic research in vivo, which provide evidence of chronic liver disease treatment with integrated TCM and traditional Western medicine.
Aim of the review
This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the compound formulas of TCM for treating different chronic liver diseases to elucidate the composition, main curative effects, and mechanisms of these formulas and research methods.
Materials and methods
Different keywords related to chronic liver diseases and keywords related to the compound formulas of TCM were used to search the literature. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CNKI were searched to screen out original articles about the compound formulas of TCM related to the treatment of chronic liver diseases, mainly including clinical trials and basic in vivo research related to Chinese patent drugs, classic prescriptions, proven prescriptions, and hospital preparations. We excluded review articles, meta-analysis articles, in vitro experiments, articles about TCM monomers, articles about single-medicine extracts, and articles with incomplete or uncertain description of prescription composition. Plant names were checked with MPNS (http://mpns.kew.org).
Results
In this review, the clinical efficacy and mechanism of compound formulas of TCM were summarized for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, CLD, and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis developed from these diseases and other chronic liver diseases. For each clinical trial and basic research in vivo, this review provides a detailed record of the specific composition of the compound formulas of TCM, type of clinical research, modeling method of animal experiments, grouping methods, medication administration, main efficacy, and mechanisms.
Conclusion
The general development process of chronic liver disease can be summarized as chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The compound formulas of TCM have some applications in these stages of chronic liver diseases. Owing to the continuous progress of medical technology, the benefits of the compound formulas of TCM in the treatment of chronic liver diseases are constantly changing and developing.}

The purpose of this article is to present successful treatment of two male patients with face seborrheic dermatitis, one aged 50 and the other aged 56, who developed facial seborrheic dermatitis following facial erythema eruptions. We diagnosed it as face seborrheic dermatitis based on the patients' initial appearances and the location of the erythema during the episode. The previous doctor diagnosed the patients' facial symptoms as related to allergies or infections; therefore, they were treated with long-term anti-inflammatory (tacrolimus) and antiallergic medications (loratadine) throughout the disease's early stages. Erythema of the face was recurring and recalcitrant. Their facial skin lesions vanished after one week of Chinese herbal medicine treatment along with warming yang therapy. The application of the principle of warming the kidney yang to the treatment of face seborrheic dermatitis produced favorable results. This may be an advantageous adjunct to the treatment of recurrent seborrheic dermatitis of the face. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) was used to determine the primary components of the Chinese herbal formula "adjusted Shen-Liu-Wei (ASLW)," which has six natural substances as its primary components. As a result, we believe that the Chinese herbal compound ASLW might be a viable alternative for symptom relief and successful treatment of face seborrheic dermatitis.}

The impacts of the data reproducibility issues were investigated. We identified 48 systematic reviews with 244 meta-analyses of continuous outcomes and 54 of binary outcomes. Our results suggest that for continuous outcomes, 20.03% of the data used in meta-analyses cannot be reproduced at the trial level, and 43.44% of the data cannot be reproduced at the meta-analysis level. For binary outcomes, the proportions were 14.14% and 40.74%. In total, 83.33% of the data cannot be reproduced at the systematic review level. Our further analysis suggested that these reproducibility issues would lead to as much as 6.52% of the available meta-analyses changing the direction of the effects, and 9.78% changing the significance of the P-values. Sleep medicine systematic reviews and meta-analyses face serious issues in terms of data reproducibility, and further efforts are urgently needed to improve this situation.}

Meaningful ageing research across the UK is dependent on a network of engaged geriatricians. The research in geriatric specialty training (RGST) survey aimed to establish current research opportunities available to geriatric medicine specialty trainees in the UK.
Methods
The RGST survey was disseminated to UK higher specialist trainees in geriatric medicine in 2019 via the Geriatric Medicine Research Collaborative network.
Results
Among the 36.9% (192/521) of respondents, 44% (83/188) reported previous research involvement and 7% (n=8) held a PhD or MD. Of the respondents with no research experience to date, 59.0% (n=49) reported a desire to undertake a period of research. One-third (31%) of geriatric registrars surveyed felt that they had gained sufficient research experience during their training. Perceived encouragement and support to undertake research was low (30.7%). Enablers and barriers to research engagement were identified.
Conclusion
Research opportunity and engagement in geriatric medicine training is lacking. This could jeopardise the future workforce of research-active geriatricians in the UK and limit patient access to emerging research and innovation. Interventions to promote research engagement among geriatric medicine trainees are needed to facilitate integration of research into routine clinical practice to improve the health and care of older people.}

abstract = {Background
Hospital pharmacists play an important role in the discharge process, including conducting medicine reconciliation, counselling patients or carers, and generating discharge medicine lists. These contribute to medicine handover at transition of care from hospital discharge. However, pharmacists face numerous barriers to providing comprehensive discharge services.
Aim
To gain a deeper understanding of the hospital pharmacists discharge processes.
Method
Qualitative study design was used to explore pharmacists' experiences and opinions regarding (1) the use of technology and software to prepare patient discharges, (2) involvement of pharmacy assistants in discharge processes, and (3) challenges and facilitators in preparing patient discharges. An independent researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 pharmacists between 29 October and 22 December 2021 (mean interview 21 min). Interview transcriptions were analysed using thematic analysis.
Results
Interviews revealed four overarching themes: patient safety, staff involved in discharge processes, discharge handover procedures and electronic health software. Barriers to completing discharges included staff workloads, poor medical record software integration and lack of advanced discharge notice. Good communication between pharmacists and other clinicians, including the presence of a discharge nurse on the inpatient unit, made discharges more efficient, and most pharmacists favoured utilisation of pharmacy assistants in preparing discharge medicine lists.
Conclusion
Poor integration between medical software systems negatively impacts pharmacists' ability to complete discharge medicine lists. Pharmacists require advance notice of upcoming discharges to effectively prioritise high workloads, while increased utilisation of trained pharmacy assistants may facilitate discharge workflows.}

abstract = {According to Kelley et al. (2023), BBI Integrative ‘recognises the historical importance of Eastern health practices in the entire field of PNI’ (psychoneuroimmunology). We applaud this editorial innovation and believe that it is an important step in advancing the ability to provide healing to human beings.This article aims to illustrate suggestions for scientific research and integrative care derived from studying the ancient Chinese medicine and philosophy using pathophysiological and clinical examples. It shows how some fundamental categories of ancient Chinese philosophies, such as the yin–yang theory, and healing models, such as yang sheng (nurturing life), can help us understand how the immune system works and where the foundations of health are rooted. It also examines some examples of the yin–yang dialectic in immunology, such as T helper 1 (Th1) circuit control by the same cells that initially produce cytokines (IL-12 and IFN-γ) to activate this circuit and then produce Th2 circuit cytokines (IL-4) to moderate it. In addition, the transformation of regulatory T-cells into inflammatory T-cells (Th17) and the IL-6 dual pro- or anti-inflammatory face, depends on the context. In the first example, yin is present in yang. In the second, the yang is in the yin. Finally, we present an example of the cytokine yin–yang. This article also shows the surprising concordances of ancient Chinese chronobiology with the modern science of circadian rhythms and the unknown connections between organs, such as between the lungs and gut, which has drawn the attention of modern scientific research only recently. Finally, this article highlights the peculiar approach of ancient Chinese medicine to prevention and treatment, called yang sheng, which shows strong concordance with the model proposed by Psychoneuroendocrineimmunology.}

abstract = {Background
Ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease. Integrated Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine (ITCMWM) therapy has been widely used on UC, but limited number of literatures analyzed the efficacy and safety of ITCMWM treatment.
Aim of the study
This review directed attention towards the assessment of the curative effect and safety of ITCMWM in treating UC.
Materials and methods
As per the protocol registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021233605), this systematic review was conducted. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data (WAN FANG). Additionally, this meta-analysis comprised randomized controlled trials comparing ITCMWM vs. Western medicine (WM), and combined the risk ratio (RR). Ultimately, quality assessment of this study was dependent on two reviewers.
Results
Totaling 3957 patients in 38 studies were included, which stochastically fell into ITCMWM group (1979 cases) and control group (1978 cases). Compared with the control subjects, UC patients receiving ITCMWM showed a significantly higher clinical effect (RR = 1.26, 95%CI: [1.22,1.29], p < 0.00001) and fewer adverse events (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: [1.19,1.29], p < 0.00001).
Conclusion
ITCMWM outperforms WM alone in treating UC, and the two therapies have essentially the same safety degree. There is still a necessity to work out the long-term curative effect of ITCMWM in treating UC.}

abstract = {The manifestations of chronic insomnia undergo age-related changes. In younger infants and children, behavioral insomnia emerges as the most prevalent form and typically responds to behavioral interventions. However, distinct clusters of clinical presentations suggest the presence of various phenotypes, potentially implicating the primary involvement of specific neurotransmitters. These conceptualizations, coupled with genetic studies on pleiotropy and polygenicity, may aid in identifying individuals at risk of persistent insomnia into adulthood and shed light on novel treatment options. In school-age children, the predominant presentation is sleep-onset insomnia, often linked with nighttime fears, anxiety symptoms, poor sleep hygiene, limit-setting issues, and inadequate sleep duration. The manifestations of insomnia in adolescence correlate with the profound changes occurring in sleep architecture, circadian rhythms, and homeostatic processes. The primary symptoms during adolescence include delayed sleep onset, sleep misperception, persistent negative thoughts about sleep, and physiological hyperarousal—paralleling features observed in adult insomnia. An approach centered on distinct presentations may provide a framework for precision-based treatment options. Enhanced comprehension of insomnia’s manifestations across diverse developmental stages can facilitate accurate assessment. Efforts to subtype insomnia in childhood align with this objective, potentially guiding the selection of appropriate treatments tailored to individual neurobiological, clinical, and familial features.}
