abstract = {Introduction
The present review aims to gather all available information on the importance of biodiversity, ethnic people, lifestyle, healthcare, and traditional use of herbal medicine in the North Eastern Regions of India (NER-I), emphasising the use of plants that heal cuts, injuries, bleeding, open wounds, boils, and ulcers.
Methods
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was employed as the major tool for conducting the systematic search strategy. Data were retrieved from online electronic resources, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and others. Keywords such as North East India, biodiversity, ethnic/tribal people, traditional practice, medicinal plants, and wound healing were used for developing strategy search.
Results
The results of the present study revealed that the NER-I tribes have traditionally employed over 800 plant species from 527 genera for wound care. Aerial parts, especially the leaf, were frequently used parts of the plants for healing, which were prepared by crushing into pastes and applied topically or consumed orally as decoction juice. Plants from various genera such as Ageratum, Albizia, Alstonia, Artemisia, Bambusa, Bauhinia, Centella, Colocasia, Commelina, Costus, Curcuma, Eupatorium, Ficus, Litsea, Mikania, Ocimum, and Tagetes were commonly used for healing purposes. The majority of these plant species belonged to important families such as the Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, and Zingiberaceae.
Conclusions
The current study includes up-to-date information on the traditional remedies and usage of herbal medicine for wound healing. This article will encourage researchers all around the world to investigate the ethnopharmacological potential of the plants covered in this study.}

abstract = {Background
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to a significant social burden. East Asian herbal medicine (EAHM) has long been used to treat RA. Therefore, a systematic study of how EAHM treatments can be developed into new drugs using specific materials is needed.
Methods
Eleven databases containing literature in English, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing EAHM with conventional medicine (CM). A meta-analysis was performed on the variable data to assess their effects on inflammatory pain. Subsequently, we searched for core materials and combinations of core material-based data mining methods.
Results
A total of 186 trials involving 19,716 patients with RA met the inclusion criteria. According to the meta-analysis, EAHM had a significantly superior effect on continuous pain intensity, tender joint count, and response rate. Patients treated with EAHM had a significantly reduced incidence of adverse events compared with those treated with CM. Based on additional analysis of the EAHM formula data included in this meta-analysis, 21 core materials and five core herbal combinations were identified.
Conclusion
EAHM remedies for RA have the adequate potential for use as candidate materials for treating inflammatory pain in RA. The candidate core herbs evaluated in this study act on multiple pathways and are expected to provide pain relief, sustained inflammation suppression, immune regulation, and prevention of joint destruction. It seems worthwhile to conduct follow-up research on drug development using the core materials derived from this review.}

abstract = {Background
Drug-induced liver injury, particularly from acetaminophen (APAP), has emerged as a significant public health concern. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment strategy available. Qiwei Tiexie pills (QWTX), a traditional Tibetan medicine, have demonstrated considerable clinical efficacy in treating various liver diseases. Nevertheless, the protective effect of QWTX against drug-induced liver injury and its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
Purpose
This study aimed to assess the therapeutic potential of QWTX, a Tibetan medicine, in an animal model of APAP-induced liver injury. Additionally, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism through which QWTX exerts its effects.
Methods
We employed LC-MS and network pharmacology to predict the potential targets of QWTX in drug-induced liver injury. Subsequently, we employed HE staining, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and qRT-PCR to analyze the mechanism underlying QWTX treatment in drug-induced liver injury.
Results
Network pharmacology analysis revealed that the active components of QWTX are involved in inflammatory and drug metabolism-related pathways. In mouse models, pretreatment with QWTX effectively mitigated the elevated levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) induced by APAP overdose. Moreover, APAP inhibited 1459 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 874 differential accumulation metabolites (DAMs), while QWTX promoted their expression. Conversely, APAP promoted 874 genes and 119 metabolites, which were inhibited by QWTX. Further analysis demonstrated that QWTX ameliorated the metabolic disorders induced by APAP overdose and potentially exerted a protective effect by inhibiting the expression of critical genes in crucial inflammatory pathways. QWTX also up-regulated antioxidant enzymes, thereby mitigating the oxidative stress resulting from APAP overdose.
Conclusion
QWTX treatment effectively protects against APAP-induced liver damage in mice. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses further revealed that QWTX ameliorated hepatic metabolic disorders induced by APAP overdose while significantly suppressing the inflammatory response and oxidative stress associated with drug-induced liver injury. This study provides a new insight into the treatment of drug-induced liver injury by the TCM system and provides a basis for the development of new therapies for drug-induced liver injury by QWTX and its active ingredients.}

abstract = {Background
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are an established research method to investigate the effects of an intervention. Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs with homeopathic interventions have identified shortcomings in design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of trials. Guidelines for RCTs in homeopathic medicine are lacking.
Objectives
This paper aims to fill this gap in order to enhance the quality of RCTs in the field of homeopathy.
Methods
Identification of the homeopathy-specific requirements for RCTs by reviewing literature and experts’ communications. Systematization of the findings using a suitable checklist for planning, conducting, and reporting RCTs, namely the SPIRIT statement, and high-quality homeopathy RCTs as examples. Cross-checking of the created checklist with the RedHot-criteria, the PRECIS criteria, and a qualitative evaluation checklist. Consideration of the REFLECT statement and the ARRIVE Guidelines 2.0 for veterinary homeopathy.
Results
Recommendations for future implementation of RCTs in homeopathy are summarized in a checklist. Alongside, identified useful solutions to the issues encountered when designing and conducting homeopathy RCTs are presented.
Conclusions
The formulated recommendations present guidelines additional to those in the SPIRIT checklist, on how to better plan, design, conduct, and report RCTs in homeopathy.}

abstract = {Objective
The purpose of this work is to describe the opportunities and challenges faced by health advocates in Kingdon of Saudi Arabia (KSA) regarding traditional medicine practices, which commonly result in health issues affecting children in the community.
Method
A literature review was conducted of all articles identified in PubMed with the following keywords: alternative medicine, traditional medicine, KSA, and advocacy. No articles from other countries with similar cultural backgrounds were excluded, and recommendation from authors were listed at the end of the article.
Results
Traditional medicine, traditional herbal medications, and spiritual treatments, which are common practices in the community, present major opportunities for advocacy in KSA. Because these practices are conducted without appropriate supervision, many adverse events result, thus affecting children and families. Many challenges are described herein, such as use of these practices in treating benign self-limited conditions; the surrounding culture and beliefs; and the dilemma of achieving child protection. At the system level, national policies and legislation, as well as research, are lacking. Moreover, health care facilities have longer waiting lists than traditional medicine facilities.
Conclusion
Recommendations include improving knowledge, facilitating behavioral changes, data collection, bylaw enactment, and providing better access to health care facilities, all of which are supported by Saudi Vision 2030.}

However, existing medicine recommendation algorithms aim to maximize the overall accuracy while ignoring individual fairness. It is of great importance to ensure that medicine recommendation algorithms fairly treat every patient. To ensure individual fairness, we propose individual fairness-based medicine recommendation systems (IFMR). In fairness scenario, similar patients can get similar performance of recommendation. Specifically, we first adopt dual-pipeline gate recurrent units to capture the health condition with electrical health records. IFMR then utilizes the molecular graph encoder and molecular substructure encoder to capture medicine features at the molecular level. Finally, IFMR maintains the spatial distance of similar patients by utilizing multi-similarity individual fairness loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that IFMR is more effective and fairer than all strong baselines.}

Despite the prevalence of over-the-counter medicine advertising (OTCA) in electronic and print media, scholarly focus has tended to concentrate on direct-to-consumer prescription medicine advertising (DTCA).
Objectives
The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms through which attitudes toward OTCA in general and OTCA prompted behaviors are formed based on a consumer socialization framework.
Methods
An online survey was conducted as part of a larger medicine and pharmaceutical advertising project using the Qualtrics online panel. A total of 819 individuals who had taken a prescription medicine in the last six months participated in the survey and yielded 539 completed questionnaires (Completion rate: 65.8%). Of those, 304 responses from U.S. adults who had taken an OTC medicine and had seen an advertisement for OTC medicines in the past six months were analyzed to test the proposed model. A series of structural equation modeling analyses of the survey data was performed.
Results
The study results showed that consumers' use of mass media and professional interpersonal channels directly influenced attitudes toward OTCA and OTCA prompted behaviors. On the other hand, consumers’ use of non-professional interpersonal channels indirectly influenced OTCA outcomes through their use of mass media and professional interpersonal channels. Younger respondents were more likely to obtain OTC medicine information from non-professional interpersonal and mass media sources whereas older respondents were more likely to obtain OTC medicine information from physicians and pharmacists.
Conclusions
Application of the consumer socialization framework in the context of OTCA provides expanded understanding of the mechanisms through which responses to OTCA are formed. The findings of this study provide implications for pharmaceutical marketers, health professionals, and consumers of OTC medicines.}

A review conducted in 2015 reported community pharmacists are willing to adopt a professional role in counselling consumers about the appropriate and safe use of traditional and complementary medicines (T&CM) but faced multiple barriers in doing so; including the role being poorly defined. This current review aimed to update and extend these findings, by identifying studies published since 2015 that reported on pharmacists across any setting.
Methods
Eligible studies published between January 01, 2016 and December 31, 2021 were identified across six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and MEDLINE). A grounded theory approach was used to thematically synthesize the data extracted.
Findings
A total 64 studies representing pharmacists across 30 countries were included for review. Study designs varied including cross-sectional surveys (n = 36), qualitative studies (n = 14), and pseudo-patient studies (n = 3). Eight studies reported on practice and/or bioethical responsibilities and 19 studies reported on factors that would enable pharmacists to fulfill these responsibilities, while 37 studies reported about both.
Conclusion
These findings indicate research about pharmacists’ responsibilities associated with T&CM is evolving from gap analysis towards research that is proactive in advocating for change in multiple areas. These findings can be used to inform a consensus discussion among pharmacists and key stakeholders regarding a set of professional responsibilities that would serve in the development of: a clearly defined role and associated practice standards, and competency requirements that inform educational learning objectives for inclusion in undergraduate, post-graduate and continuing professional pharmacy education.}

Complications like scarring, keloid formation, and contractures are the main challenges for the treating surgeon. The Ayurvedic classics explain different treatment modalities for the management of burn wounds, like oral medicines, topical applications prepared with herbal medicines, ghee, oil, and typical wound dressing techniques like Patraadaana (wound covering with medicinal leaves), and fumigation therapy, etc. Here we report a case of accidental burn injury with a TBSA of 27% First degree (superficial) and 15% second degree (deep partial-thickness) burns with complaints of fever and burning sensation at the burn site. On the basis of the symptoms listed in the classical texts of Ayurveda, the case was diagnosed as Pramadadagdha (accidental burn). To properly manage the burn wound, an integrated therapy strategy was designed. Ropanaghrita (medicated ghee) was applied locally, followed by the application of Tinospora cordifolia leaves to cover the wound, fumigation therapy, and oral medications to hasten wound healing and reduce infection. In the first seven days, modern medicine was used as emergency care in addition to Ayurvedic management. Within 60 days of receiving treatment, the burn wound had entirely healed, and the patient was able to resume her regular work activities. In the current situation, the combined strategy produced encouraging burn management outcomes.}

Although additive manufacturing allows flexible patient-specific treatments by modifying topological properties with various materials, the development of ideal bone implants that aid new tissue regeneration and reduce post-implantation bone disorders has been limited. Natural biomolecules are gaining the attention of the health industry due to their excellent safety profiles, providing equivalent or superior performances when compared to more expensive growth factors and synthetic drugs. Supplementing additive manufacturing with natural biomolecules enables the design of novel multifunctional bone implants that provide controlled biochemical delivery for bone tissue engineering applications.

It can occur in a variety of species, including humans, dogs, cats, and horses. To date, PAH has a high mortality rate in both veterinary and human medicine, often due to complications such as heart failure. The complex pathological mechanisms of PAH involve multiple cellular signalling pathways at various levels. IL-6 is a powerful pleiotropic cytokine that regulates several phases of immune response, inflammation, and tissue remodelling. The hypothesis of this study was that the use of an IL-6 antagonist in PAH could interrupt or mitigate the cascade of events that leads to the progression of the disease and the worsening of clinical outcome, as well as tissue remodelling. In this study, we used two pharmacological protocols with an IL-6 receptor antagonist in a monocrotaline-induced PAH model in rats. Our results showed that the use of an IL-6 receptor antagonist had a significant protective effect, ameliorating both haemodynamic parameters, lung and cardiac function, tissue remodelling, and the inflammation associated with PAH. The results of this study suggest that the inhibition IL-6 could be a useful pharmacological strategy in PAH, in both human and veterinary medicine.}

abstract = {Introduction
There are increasing concerns on the safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) worldwide. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), an important type of TCM, may be contaminated by exogenous harmful substances, including heavy metals during planting, collecting, and processing. The consumption of CHM polluted with heavy metals may lead to a serious hazard to users. Though effective strategies to minimize the risks related to heavy metals is challenging, it is of great significance for optimizing health.
Result
This review deals with the characteristics of heavy metals in Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), in terms of heavy metal distribution, speciation, bioavailability, detection methods, risk assessment and limit standards. Especially, the development process of the consistent limit guidance values of heavy metals in CHM in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition) were discussed. Finally, strategies to limit the health implications of heavy metal in CHM were highlighted, involving strictly controlling the pollution of heavy metals in CHM, encouraging the innovation of speciation and bioavailability techniques, and formulating international guideline and standards for heavy metals in CHM.
Conclusion
All in all, this review will help researchers to explore fresh methodologies to the issue of heavy metals in CHM, thereby proposing approaches towards safe use of TCM in the clinic and promoting the sustainable and healthy development of TCM industry.}

abstract = {Background
Atherosclerosis is a deadly consequence of cardiovascular disease and has very high mortality rate worldwide. The epigenetic modifications can regulate the pervasiveness and progression of atherosclerosis through its involvement in regulation of inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and several other factors. Specific non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications are key regulatory factors of atherosclerosis. Natural products from traditional Chinese medicine have shown promising therapeutic potential against atherosclerosis by means of regulating the expression of specific genes, stabilizing arterial plaques and protecting vascular endothelial cells.
Objective
Our study is focusing to explore the pathophysiology and probability of traditional Chinese medicine and natural medicinal active ingredients to treat atherosclerosis.
Methods
Comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and China National Knowledge Infrastructure with a core focus on natural medicinal active ingredients and traditional Chinese medicine prying in epigenetic modification related to atherosclerosis.
Results
Accumulated evidence demonstrated that natural medicinal active ingredients and traditional Chinese medicine have been widely studied as substances that can regulate epigenetic modification. They can participate in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis through inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, cell proliferation and migration, macrophage polarization and autophagy respectively.
Conclusion
The function of natural medicinal active ingredients and traditional Chinese medicine in regulating epigenetic modification may provide a new potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. However, more extensive research is essential to determine the potential of these natural medicinal active ingredients to treat atherosclerosis because of least clinical data.}

Purpose
Patients with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) now have improved health outcomes and increased survival into adulthood. There is scant evidence on managing adults with IMDs. We present an analysis of current care practices for adults with IMDs in the United States.
Methods
We created and distributed an online survey to US members of the Society of Inherited Metabolic Disorders. The survey addressed ambulatory care, acute management, and health care transition (HCT) practices of adults with IMDs.
Results
The survey was completed by 91 providers from 73 institutions. Most adult patients with IMDs receive lifelong care from a single metabolic clinician, predominantly in pediatric clinic settings. Adults receive comprehensive ambulatory metabolic care, but fewer trainees participate compared with pediatric visits. Most acute IMD management occurs in pediatric hospitals. Clinician comfort with HCT increased the frequency of HCT planning. Overall, all respondents felt that providing specialized care to adults with IMDs is high value.
Conclusion
Our survey demonstrates the paucity of clinical resources dedicated to adult metabolic medicine. Care is fragmented and varies by medical system. Interest in HCT is robust but would benefit from standardized practices. Our findings reinforce the need for greater focus on adult metabolic medicine in the United States.}

We investigated whether the use of adjuvant traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy, a form of complementary and alternative medicine, is associated with long-term mortality after stroke.
Study design
We conducted a retrospective cohort study and used claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance program linked to the National Registry of Death. The cohort included patients aged ≥18 years who were hospitalized for their first stroke event between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2013. Adjuvant TCM therapy was defined as additional treatments with TCM, which included acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, and Tuina, during hospitalization for up to six months.
Main outcome measure
The mortality rate was measured through to December 31, 2014.
Results
Of 321,157 patients with stroke, 14,579 received adjuvant TCM therapy. Propensity score matching resulted in 13,918 matched pairs of patients who did and did not receive adjuvant TCM care. Both multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.69) and propensity score-matching analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60–0.66) revealed a reduced mortality risk associated with the use of adjuvant TCM therapy, as compared with routine inpatient care only. Acupuncture was the most commonly used TCM therapy. Patients treated with acupuncture only, which accounted for 41.3% of TCM users, had a reduced risk of mortality compared with those treated with routine inpatient care.
Conclusions
The use of TCM therapy adjuvant to Western inpatient care in the acute and subacute stages of stroke recovery is associated with a reduced risk of long-term mortality.}

abstract = {Introduction
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a highly infectious bacterium that can aggravate upper gastrointestinal diseases. With the increasingly serious problem of H. pylori drug resistance, it is important to identify new treatment methods. In recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies on the treatment of H. pylori infection and related diseases with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). The effectiveness of CHM has also emerged. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review was to systematically identify and summarize the characteristics of randomized controlled trails (RCTs) evaluating CHM for treating H. pylori infection.
Methods
Three Chinese and two English language databases were comprehensively searched. Included studies were RCTs of H. pylori-positive patients evaluating oral CHM with or without Western Medicine (WM) compared to WM alone. A descriptive analysis of study characteristics and association rule mining in R Studio software were used to identify frequent herbal combinations. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool was used to assess study quality.
Results
Included were 165 RCTs, with 168 comparisons, involving 16,817 participants. All the RCTs were conducted in China and 68% were published after 2012. The quality of included studies was moderate. The RCTs evaluated 187 herbs that were used in various combinations in 91 types of CHM formulas. Most RCTs compared CHM plus WM to WM only (n = 103 comparisons). Only 68% of the RCTs evaluated a recommended WM triple or quadruple therapy. Results showed that Banxia Xiexin Decoction, Huangqi Jianzhong Decoction, Huanglian Wendan Decoction and Jinghua Weikang Capsule were commonly used. The association rules showed that golden thread (Coptis chinensis Franch.), debark peony root (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.), milkvetch root (Astragalus mongholicus Bunge), dandelion (Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz.), dried tangerine peel (Citrus reticulata Blanco), tangshen (Codonopsis pilosula (Franch.) Nannf.), largehead atractylodes rhizome (Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.), processing liquorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.), pinellia tuber (Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino) were commonly used clinically.
Conclusion
The findings from this review highlight the potential role of CHM formulas for treating H. Pylori and can be used to inform further clinical trials and systematic reviews.}

The results uncover that 3-DG is the major component among the α-DCs, being detectable in all the selected herbs in concentrations ranging from 22.80 μg/g in the seeds of Alpinia katsumadai to 7032.75 μg/g in the fruit of Siraitia grosuenorii. The contents of the other three compounds are much lower than those of 3-DG, with GO being up to 22.65 μg/g, MGO being up to 55.50 μg/g, and DA to 18.75 μg/g, respectively.

Integrated Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and Western Medicine (WM) treatments have been used for primary hypertension (PHTN) patients in China. Currently, there are many randomized control trials (RCTs) published regarding the effect of CHM and WM on PHTN, which indicated that combining Chinese with WM was effective and safe for PHTN when compared with WM alone, but the quality of evidence was insufficient, and there is no clear information and summary are available for these RCTs assessing the effectiveness of CHM with WM versus WM in patients with PHTN.
Objectives
This systematic study and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CHM combined with WM in comparison with WM in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure for patients with PHTN.
Methods
The information of this study was searched from electronic databases (PubMed, COCHRANE, EMBASE, Ovid, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM). The markedly effective and effective terms were according to Guiding Principles for Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicines. Two investigators independently reviewed each trial. The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used for quality assessment, and RevMan 5.4 was used for meta-analysis.
Results
In this study, a total of 29 studies that included 2623 patients were recorded. The study results displayed that the clinical effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension patients from the integrated medicines was considerably higher than that with WM alone, clinical effective (RR 1.23, 95% CI [1.17, 1.30], P < 0.00001), and markedly effective (ME) in the patients (RR 1.66, 95% CI [1.52, 1.80], and P < 0.00001). Random effect in SBP (MD 7.91 mmHg,[6.00, 983], P < 0.00001) and DBP (MD 5.46 mmHg, [3.88, 6.43], P < 0.00001), a subgroup analysis was carried out based on the type of intervention, duration of treatment, and CHM formulas that showed significance. Furthermore, no severe side effects were reported, and no patients stopped treatment or withdrawal due to any severe adverse events.
Conclusion
Compared to WM alone, the therapeutic effectiveness of CHM combined with WM is significantly improved in the treatment of hypertension. Additionally, CHM with WM may safely and efficiently lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in individuals with PHTN. However, rigorous randomized controlled trials with a large sample, high quality, long duration of treatment, and follow-up are recommended to strengthen this clinical evidence.}

There is a lack of consensus regarding clinician- and patient-reported oral lichen planus (OLP) outcomes. The World Workshop on Oral Medicine Outcomes Initiative for the Direction of Research (WONDER) Project aims to develop a core outcome set (COS) for OLP, which would inform the design of clinical trials and, importantly, facilitate meta-analysis, leading to the establishment of more robust evidence for the management of this condition and hence improved patient care.
Study Design
Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for interventional studies (randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and case series including ≥5 participants) on OLP and oral lichenoid reactions published between January 2001 and March 2022 without language restriction. All reported primary and secondary outcomes were extracted.
Results
The searches yielded 9,135 records, and 291 studies were included after applying the inclusion criteria. A total of 422 outcomes were identified. These were then grouped based on semantic similarity, condensing the list to 69 outcomes. The most frequently measured outcomes were pain (51.9%), clinical grading of the lesions (29.6%), lesion size/extension/area (27.5%), and adverse events (17.5%).

abstract = {For the sake of fully laying stress on the advantages of multi-component cocrystals in ameliorating limitations of poor pharmaceutical peculiarities, and further offering fresh insights for the application of salt-type cocrystals in the optimization of anti-heart failure medication milrinone (MIL), the present project exploits the structural characteristic and property preponderance of gallic acid (GLC) and 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (HBA) to design and assemble MIL ternary salt cocrystal via a combination tactic of cocrystallization and salification. This strategy organizes the ternary salt-cocrystal by fashioning a salt portion to foster solubility enhancement and shaping a cocrystal moiety to achieve permeability advancement. Following this thread, the MIL ternary salt-cocrystal, namely [HMIL+-BA−]-GLCH2O (indicated as TSC there-in-after), is accurately authenticated by comprehensive characterization means. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction affirms that the asymmetric unit of TSC comprises a [HMIL+-BA−] salt, one neutral GLC molecule along with three water molecules, all of which build a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network containing electrostatic forces and π-π stacking interactions. Such unique structural feature and aggregation motif make MIL in TSC achieve a coinstantaneous elevation of 10.59 times in permeability and 4.76−5.15 folds in solubility versus the parent medicine itself at different physiological pH, which supports well agreement with the DFT-based theoretical investigations including reduced density gradient, molecular electrostatic potential surface, topology, Hirshfeld surface analysis, together with Gibbs free energy of solvation. All of these not only contribute a completely new cocrystalline model for MIL with synchronously optimizing dissolubility and permeability, but demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of ternary salt cocrystals in modifying the properties of anti-heart failure medicines.}

keywords = {Pharmacovigilance, Medicine risk communication, Patient safety, Medication safety},
abstract = {Background
Regulatory medicines risk communications aim to prevent patient harm through the dissemination of safety information to healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients, and the public. Evidence suggests that in addition to implementing the required changes, HCPs also respond to these communications through unintended and unwarranted actions and behaviours such as stopping medicine courses unnecessarily, and blanket actions spilling over to unintended patients' populations. Misunderstanding and mis-implementation of medicines risk communications could jeopardise patients’ safety and clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants that affect HCPs responses to medicines risk communications. This systematic review aims to identify the factors that affect the implementation of risk communications by healthcare professionals.
Methods
Fifteen databases, including EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, CINAHL PLUS were searched in April–May 2018, and the search was updated again in June 2021 to identify studies reporting on factors influencing HCPs' uptake of medicine risk alerts. We used keywords such as risk communication, safety update, and safety regulation. Studies were excluded if they did not involve pharmacovigilance or patient safety alerts; or if they only focused on measuring HCPs' practice after alerts; or evaluating the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures without reporting on factors affecting HCPs’ actions. Studies relating to occupational hazards, case reports, interventional studies, and studies not involving HCPs were also excluded. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of the included studies. A Narrative synthesis approach was undertaken using thematic analysis and concept mapping, followed by a critical reflection of the synthesis.
Results
Twenty-eight studies met our criteria and were included in the synthesis. We identified four themes summarising the factors influencing HCPs’ implementation of risk communications. These include HCPs: knowledge of medicine alerts; perceptions of alerts; attitudes, and concerns regarding medicine alerts; and the self-reported impact of these alerts. Our concept mapping exercise identified key interactions between different stakeholders, and these interactions determine HCPs' implementation of medicine risk communications. These stakeholders comprise of alert developers, including the sources and senders of safety information, and the receivers of safety information including health care institutions, HCPs, patients and their carers.
Conclusions
Healthcare professionals are crucial to translating risk communication messages into clinical practice. However, if they have inadequate information about the content of the alert, and have inaccurate perceptions about the alert, they may not implement the required clinical changes as intended. Communication of medicine risk alerts does not always translate into improved patient care, due to a complex interaction between stakeholders involved in the creation and implementation of these alerts. These complex interactions should be the subject of future research efforts to understand the alert-implementation trajectory and identify the mediators for change and interventions to improve implementation.}

Background
The number of cancer patients using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasing worldwide. CAM is a holistic approach and has the potential to enrich patient lives both physically and mentally. Clarifying the factors associated with CAM-related nursing practice (CRNP) can help develop nursing that contributes to quality-of-life in cancer patients.
Aim
To quantitatively clarify the CRNP for cancer patients and the factors associated with CRNP.
Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive anonymous survey on 17 previously developed CRNPs was distributed to nurses working at cancer district hospitals in Japan. Nurses evaluated the CRNP items by a four-point Likert scale, and the total item mean score was compared among background variables by t-test and ANOVA.
Findings
In total, 451 valid responses were collated; 17 CRNP items were rated as agree/somewhat agree by over 49.6%. The most commonly practiced item was confirming with the primary physician before responding to patients about CAM use. Conversely, nurses failed to take on the role of explaining to patients the CAM-use decisions made by the healthcare team. CRNP scores were significantly higher for nurses with CAM-related learning experience (p = 0.001), nurses with advanced professional qualifications (p = 0.002), and nurses in occupational environments with good workplace communication (p = 0.043) or managers/colleagues with sound understanding of CAM (p = 0.001).
Discussion
Nurses should be aware that support for CAM use is an important issue that nurses can contribute to. Securing opportunities for CAM learning and deepening understanding of CAM throughout the workplace are useful in promoting further practice.
Conclusion
Nurses should deepen the understanding and value of CAM across their organisation to meet the needs of patients using CAM.}

Introduction
There is currently no clear consensus on the standards for using large language models such as ChatGPT in academic medicine. Hence, we performed a scoping review of available literature to understand the current state of LLM use in medicine and to provide a guideline for future utilization in academia.
Materials and methods
A scoping review of the literature was performed through a Medline search on February 16, 2023 using a combination of keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, generative pre-trained transformer, ChatGPT, and large language model. There were no restrictions to language or date of publication. Records not pertaining to LLMs were excluded. Records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT were identified and evaluated separately. Among the records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT, those that suggest recommendations for ChatGPT use in academia were utilized to create guideline statements for ChatGPT and LLM use in academic medicine.
Results
A total of 87 records were identified. 30 records were not pertaining to large language models and were excluded. 54 records underwent a full-text review for evaluation. There were 33 records related to LLM ChatBots or ChatGPT.
Discussion
From assessing these texts, five guideline statements for LLM use was developed: (1) ChatGPT/LLM cannot be cited as an author in scientific manuscripts; (2) If use of ChatGPT/LLM are considered for use in academic work, author(s) should have at least a basic understanding of what ChatGPT/LLM is; (3) Do not use ChatGPT/LLM to produce entirety of text in manuscripts; humans must be held accountable for use of ChatGPT/LLM and contents created by ChatGPT/LLM should be meticulously verified by humans; (4) ChatGPT/LLMs may be used for editing and refining of text; (5) Any use of ChatGPT/LLM should be transparent and should be clearly outlined in scientific manuscripts and acknowledged.
Conclusion
Future authors should remain mindful of the potential impact their academic work may have on healthcare and continue to uphold the highest ethical standards and integrity when utilizing ChatGPT/LLM.}

With the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the growing attention of people around the world to the use of traditional and complementary medicines to control of the disease, evaluating the effectiveness of these treatments has received special attention.
Aim
This study aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of a barley-based (Hordeum vulgare) remedy combined with conventional medicine in comparison to the conventional therapy in confirmed COVID-19 patients.
Materials and methods
Seventy COVID-19 patients were randomly divided into barley-based remedy plus conventional medicine (barley-based remedy group) and conventional therapy (control group). Both groups were treated for 5 days. The outcomes were oxygen saturation, main symptoms (fever, respiratory rate, cough, and fatigue), and laboratory data (lymphocytic count, and CRP); they were measured for 6 days.
Results
In comparison to the control group, the oxygen saturation level in the barley-based remedy group significantly increased, from the second day of the intervention (P < 0.05). The herbal remedy significantly improved fatigue from the third day (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the severity and frequency of cough between the groups were not significantly different. The herbal remedy had no significant effect on the CRP and the lymphocytic count of every time points of measurement. The average of respiratory rate and temperature of patients were in the normal range in both groups during the intervention.
Conclusion
Barley-based remedy could significantly enhance the blood oxygen saturation and reduce fatigue. However, it needs to be confirmed by large sample size trials.}

The ultimate goal of precision medicine is to provide personalized medicine, which requires tailoring medical decisions to each patient based on their projected disease response. In this study, we propose a cluster-applied deep reinforcement learning-based type 2 diabetes treatment recommendation model based on the electronic health records of South Koreans. The purpose of applying a clustering algorithm is to group patients who are in a similar state, to boost the performance of deep reinforcement learning, build a more realistic treatment recommendation model to support clinicians, and develop expert systems in the field of healthcare. The proposed model demonstrated significant performance by decreasing diabetes-related medical checkup measurements. Furthermore, the proposed model delivered high-quality performance when compared with existing reinforcement-learning methods.

Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch (RC) and Coptis chinensis Franch (RG) are traditional Chinese medicines, which are classic drug pair in prescriptions to treat gastrointestinal diseases. Multi-herb therapy is one of the most important features of traditional Chinese medicine, but due to the complex components of herbal decoctions, the substances that actually exert their medicinal effects have not been fully elucidated. The discovery of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch and Coptis chinensis Franch supramolecular parts (RC-RG SA) can provide a new perspective for explaining the mechanism of drug-pair compatibility.
Aim of the study
The purpose of this study was to explore the active composition and identification of chemical constituents of RC-RG SA, and to explore the inhibitory effects of supramolecular parts on S. aureus and biofilm.
Materials and methods
The micromorphology of RC-RG SA was characterized by SEM and DLS. Intermolecular forces between Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch and Coptis chinensis Franch determined by ITC. The chemical constituents of RC-RG SA were systematically analyzed by UPLC-ESI-MSn. The inhibitory effect of RC-RG SA on S. aureus was determined by turbidimetric method and plate coating method. The scavenging effect of RC-RG SA supramolecular parts on S. aureus biofilm were observed by MTT method, SEM and LSCM, respectively.
Results
The microstructure of RC-RG SA was spherical with a particle size of 161.6 nm. ITC proved that the reaction between decoction of RC and RG was exothermic. A total of 70 compounds were preliminarily identified in RC-RG SA, including 34 flavonoids, 34 alkaloids and 2 triterpenoids. The inhibitory effect of RC-RG supramolecular parts on S. aureus proliferation and the ability to clear S. aureus biofilm were better than RC-RG co-decoction and RC-RG non-supramolecular parts.
Conclusions
The Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch and Coptis chinensis Franch co-decoctions’ supramolecular components were an important substance that exerts its medicinal effect. Current study provided supramolecular strategies to reveal the active ingredients and the medicinal effect of the traditional Chinese medicine decoction.}

abstract = {Background
Non-prescription medicines (NPMs), while relatively safe, are responsible for a small but significant proportion of medication misadventure and inappropriate use may lead to avoidable healthcare cost. Some consumers vary their use of NPMs from the directions provided on packaging or advice from healthcare professionals. Consumers may use NPMs at lower doses or less frequently than directed because of the risk of side effects.
Purpose
This study aimed to develop and validate a self-report measure for the extent to which consumers’ follow directions (FDs) for NPMs. Secondly, it aimed to explore the relationship between risk perception towards NPMs and following directions.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was administered online to participants who belong to an Australian agency which conducts consumer research. Participants were Australian adults who had used NPMs within the last month. Items for the FD-NPM scale were developed and validated. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to validate the FD-NPM scale. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to explore the relationships between risk perception, covariates, and FDs.
Results
There were 403 participants recruited. Less than 20% “always” or “often” self-reported following directions for dose, frequency, or duration of use. Factor analyses confirmed that there are two moderately positively correlated dimensions of FD-NPM (r = 0.46), which were named underuse and overuse. That is, consumers who self-reported underuse of non-prescription medicines were also more likely to self-report overuse. Consumers with high-risk perception towards NPMs, those who were younger and those who were more educated had a greater tendency to not follow directions.
Conclusion
A new self-report measure, the FD-NPM scale was developed and validated. That people who perceives NPMs to be harmful, tend to underuse and more concerningly, overuse them, is of great interest to clinicians and policymakers who are required to manage risk communications.}

Studies have shown that waste medicines generate a significant cost for the national health system (NHS) in many countries. No data are available on costs and therapeutic classes of unused medicines in Italy. Objective: Conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of unused medicines returned for disposal to selected pharmacies in Rome, Italy, as well as to estimate the related costs for the NHS.
Methods
Medicines returned to 4 pharmacies were collected for 8 months. Therapeutic class, number of remaining dosage units, remaining validity, and reimbursement by the NHS were analysed. The cost of reimbursed medicines was estimated on the prices provided by the Italian regulatory agency (AIFA).
Results
The study sample consisted of 3219 medicine packages containing remaining dosage units, of which 72.4% had expired while 27.6% had not. The average remaining validity of unexpired medicines was 13 months. Medicines reimbursed by the NHS accounted for 73% of the total. Cardiovascular drugs and anti-infectives were the main therapeutic classes (17.2% and 15.2% of total packages, respectively), followed by gastrointestinal drugs, central nervous system (CNS) drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids. The average of remaining dosage units found in the examined packages was 68% of the initial number of units. In terms of cost, antibiotics were the most relevant therapeutic class, followed by cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, corticosteroids, and NSAIDs. The estimated cost for the Italian NHS was € 200,656,780 per year.
Conclusion
Waste medicines constitute a significant, but reducible cost for the NHS. The high prevalence of anti-infectives in the study sample appears to be a distinctive Italian characteristic and may be due to inappropriate prescribing. Policies aimed at reducing waste should improve prescriptive appropriateness and increase the variety of packaging size.}

abstract = {Background
Trauma is a significant public health problem. Therefore, many injury scores have been created to predict mortality and triage patients. This study aims to validate the modified Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (mREMS) for in-hospital mortality prediction in road traffic injuries and compare the mREMS with the revised trauma score (RTS) and the mechanisms, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), age, and arterial pressure (MGAP) score.
Methods
Data were retrospectively collected from the Vajira Hospital (1,033 cases). The mREMS was calculated from six predictors: age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oxygen saturation, and GCS. The receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The AUC and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mREMS were compared with the AUCs of other scores. Model calibration was assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
Results
The mREMS was significantly better than the RTS at predicting death in road traffic injury patients [mREMS: AUCs, 0.909 (95% CI, 0.866–0.951); RTS: AUCs, 0.859 (95% CI, 0.791–0.927] (p = 0.023). However, the difference between the AUCs of the mREMS and MGAP score was not statistically significant (p = 0.150). The mREMS’ calibration performance was also satisfactory in this dataset based on the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (p = 0.277).
Conclusion
In the road traffic injury population, the mREMS is an excellent predictor of in-hospital mortality. These results can be applied to improve triage. However, this score should be further validated in other trauma centers before nationwide implementation.}

[Objective]
To analyze the main syndrome types, medication rules, and core prescription characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of metabolism-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and to predict the anti-MAFLD mechanism of core formula, so as to provide references for the clinical application of TCM and the development of new drugs.
[Methods]
Literature research on TCM in treating MAFLD was retrieved from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and Wanfang Database since the establishment of the database to July 2022. Excel 2019 and Chinese Medicine Inheritance Computing Platform (V3.0) were used for frequency analysis, association rule analysis, and cluster analysis of effective prescriptions. The key components, targets, and action pathways of anti-MAFLD core formulas were predicted by network pharmacology. Finally, the interactions between the obtained core components and their core targets were verified reversely by molecular docking technology.
[Results]
A total of 218 articles were screened and selected, including 352 prescriptions, involving 270 traditional Chinese herbs. The drugs were used a total of 3 901 times, and a total of 10 915 cases were collected, among which the prevalence rate was higher in males. The main types of TCM syndrome included intermingled phlegm and blood stasis syndrome, liver depression and spleen deficiency syndrome, and damp-heat in liver and gallbladder syndrome, among which Shanzha (Crataegi Fructus), Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma), Fuling (Poria), Zexie (Alismatis Rhizoma), Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix), and Baizhu (Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma) were the most frequently used. The properties of Chinese medicine primarily encompassed thermal characteristics, with a predominant emphasis on cold and warm; the flavors of herbs were predominantly characterized by bitterness and sweetness, while the majority exhibited tropism towards the spleen and liver meridians. The drugs were primarily classified based on their efficacy in tonifying deficiencies, promoting diuresis and moistening, enhancing blood circulation and removing blood stasis, heat-clearing, etc. The association rules were employed to derive a set of 20 core drug pairs, while cluster analysis was utilized to identify three distinct groups of core drug combinations. Network pharmacological showed that the main components of the core formula “Shanzha (Crataegi Fructus) - Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) - Zexie (Alismatis Rhizoma) - Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix) - Fuling (Poria)” in the treatment of MAFLD were quercetin, apigenin, puerarin, luteolin, ursolic acid, kaempferol, tanshinone IIA, emodin, paeonol, etc., which involved RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (AKT1), cellular tumor antigen p53 (TP53), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma (PPARG), and other key targets. The molecular docking results showed that the core components had good binding to lipid and atherosclerosis, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway-associated proteins.
[Conclusion]
The main principles of TCM for the treatment of MAFLD involve soothing the liver and strengthening the spleen, eliminating phlegm and dampness, clearing heat and dampness, as well as promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. The core formula may exert anti-MAFLD effects mediated through multiple components, targets, and signaling pathways. This study establishes a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of TCM in the treatment of MAFLD, and serves as a reference for further exploration of new drugs against MAFLD.}

abstract = {Purpose
To study the prevalence and quality of application of minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), patient-acceptable symptomatic state (PASS), and maximum outcome improvement (MOI), reported in the orthopaedic sports medicine knee and shoulder literature in recent years and to bring awareness of proper use of such metrics.
Methods
A literature review of all shoulder and knee articles published from the American Journal of Sports Medicine (AJSM), Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (JSES), and Arthroscopy from 2016 to 2020 was performed, specifically investigating whether MCID, SCB, PASS, or MOI were used or reported. Additionally, the way these metrics were reported and interpreted was recorded.
Results
Out of 5,039 studies, 889 shoulder and knee studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 16.7% reported either MCID, PASS, or SCB. MCID was the most reported across all 3 journals. MCID was reported 12.4% of the time throughout the 5 years. PASS was reported 3.2% and SCB 1.1% of the time over the 5 years. MOI was not reported by any of the journals during this period. There was a statistically significant increase in MCID reporting in 2 of the 3 journals over the 5-year course, Arthroscopy (P = .02) and AJSM (P = .05). There was no statistically significant increase in PASS or SCB reporting rates in all 3 journals. Only 39.1% of studies reported MCID correctly (i.e., defined as the number of individual patients meeting MCID/total patients in the study).
Conclusions
This study shows an increasing trend in the use of clinically significant outcome metrics, such as MCID, for interpretation of patient-reported outcomes; however, these individual metrics are often not being used on the individual level and subsequently not reported accurately. We recommend determining whether the specific metric met the threshold per individual patient and then reporting those as a percentage of the sample population to achieve the full potential of these metrics and translate them accurately across various studies.
Clinical Relevance
As the usage of clinically significant outcome metrics rises, so does the need for accurate reporting. These findings will encourage future studies to follow a more standardized format.}

abstract = {There are still some doubts about the safety of neurostimulant medications in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Traditional Chinese medicine is a safe and effective alternative therapy that has been confirmed in animal experiments. This study aimed to evaluate whether traditional Chinese medicine can improve the behavioral performance and brain tissue dopamine and cAMP contents of ADHD model animals using a network meta-analysis. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal, and China Biomedical Literature databases were searched from their inception to October 23, 2021. The SYRCLE tool was used to assess the quality of the literature, and Stata 16 and GeMTC 0.14.3 were used to create network diagrams and perform Bayesian network meta-analysis. Twenty-four eligible randomized controlled animal experimental studies were included for the network meta-analysis. The results of the analysis of behavioral performance showed Jingning Granules [-11.72 (-22.03, -1.89)] could significantly reduce the moving distance of the ADHD animals in the OFT, compared with model group. In the MWM Test, Yizhi Ningshen Granules [-44.79(-66.46,-22.28)], Radix Rehmanniae Praeparata [-22.01(-35.23,-8.25)], and Baicalin [-7.34(-20.63, 4.99)] could significantly shorten the day-3 escape latency in ADHD animals, and Anshen Dingzhi Ling [7.02 (1.54, 12.56))] and Baicalin [5.88 (0.84, 10.20)] could significantly increase the time spent in the target in the ADHD animals, compared with model group. The results of the network meta-analysis of brain tissue dopamine and cAMP contents revealed that Ginsenoside Rg1 [162.46 (47.24, 273.42)] could increase the dopamine content of the striatum, while Baicalein [23.78 (15.39, 31.44)] and Anshen Dingzhi Ling [18.04 (12.26, 23.29)] could raise cAMP levels in the prefrontal lobe compared with model group. Baicalein [40.57 (14.57, 62.46)], Anshen Dingzhi Ling [56.16 (34.46, 76.69)], and Jingning Granules [27.11 (8.39, 46.03)] were found to raise cAMP levels in the striatum in comparison with atomoxetine treatment. Accordingly, we consider that traditional Chinese medicine intervention can increase the contents of dopamine and cAMP in the prefrontal lobe and striatum, thereby improving hyperactivity, impulsivity, and learning difficulties in ADHD animals. In addition, the SHR rat appears to be an ideal ADHD animal model.}

In this article, we discuss urine ammonium not only in the evaluation of metabolic acidosis but also in other clinical conditions such as chronic kidney disease. Different methods to measure urine NH4+ that have been employed over the years are discussed. The enzymatic method used by clinical laboratories in the United States to measure plasma ammonia via the glutamate dehydrogenase can be used for urine ammonium. The urine anion gap calculation can be used as a rough marker of urine ammonium in the initial bedside evaluation of metabolic acidosis such as in distal renal tubular acidosis. Urine ammonium measurements, however, should be made more available in clinical medicine for a precise evaluation of this important component of urinary acid excretion.}

abstract = {Background
: Hemiparesis is a serious motor impairment following stroke and affecting around 65% of stroke patients. This trial attempts to study the efficacy of individualized homeopathic medicines (IHMs) in comparison with identical-looking placebos in treatment of post-stroke hemiparesis (PSH) in the mutual context of standard physiotherapy (SP).
Methods
: A 3-months, open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 60) was conducted at the Organon of Medicine outpatient departments of National Institute of Homoeopathy, West Bengal, India. Patients were randomized to receive IHMs plus SP (n = 30) or identical-looking placebos plus SP (n = 30). Primary outcome measure was Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength grading scale; secondary outcomes were Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) version 2.0, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and stroke recovery 0–100 visual analogue scale (VAS) scores; all measured at baseline and 3 months after intervention. Group differences and effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated on intention-to-treat sample.
Results
: Although overall improvements were higher in the IHMs group than placebos with small to medium effect sizes, the group differences were statistically non-significant (all P>0.05, unpaired t-tests). Improvement in SIS physical problems was significantly higher in IHMs than placebos (mean difference 2.0, 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 3.8, P = 0.025, unpaired t-test). Causticum, Lachesis mutus, and Nux vomica were the most frequently prescribed medicines. No harms, unintended effects, homeopathic aggravations or any serious adverse events were reported from either group.
Conclusion
: There was a small, but non-significant direction of effect favoring homeopathy against placebos in treatment of post-stroke hemiparesis.

Especially in the medical domain, where validation of methodologies and outcomes is as important as the adoption rate of such systems, the requirements of the depth and the level of abstraction of the explainability are particularly important and necessitate a systemic approach to ensure a proper definition. Explainability and interpretability are important usability and trustworthiness properties of AI-empowered systems and, as such, constitute important factors for technology acceptance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for explainability requirements in AI-empowered systems using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This framework employs targeted ML (hierarchical clustering, k-means or other) to acquire a user model for personalised, multi-layered explainability. Our novel framework integrates a rule-based system, which guides the degree of trustworthiness to be achieved based on user perception and AI literacy level. We test this methodology in the case of AI-empowered medical systems to (1) assess and quantify the doctors’ abilities and familiarisation with technology and AI, (2) generate layers of personalised explainability based on user ability and user needs in terms of trustworthiness and (3) provide the necessary environment for transparency and validation. To assess and quantify the doctors’ abilities we have considered Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) a tool commonly used in the medical domain to bridge the communication gap between patients and doctors.}

A steering committee reviewed the literature and selected the relevant references. A draft was prepared, and all items with missing or conflicting data were submitted to a Delphi consensus. The final document was discussed and approved by all participants. The principles of DUS evaluation of AV access consist of examination of the afferent artery, the anastomosis and the entire venous drainage system. DUS uses B-mode ultrasound, color flow, pulsed wave and power Doppler analysis. DUS can be used in a variety of clinical situations, which can directly influence the methodology of the examination and the interpretation of the results. Blood flow should be assessed as it correlates with the risk of thrombosis. The measurement should be adapted to the different anatomical and hemodynamic conditions encountered. Characterization of stenosis should take into account the residual diameter of the drainage vein and its hemodynamic consequences. Other complications can be assessed with a standardized DUS examination. When performed according to a rigorous methodology, DUS of the AV access allows a comprehensive assessment of its functionality and eliminates the need for further invasive diagnostic procedures.}

Cell-free therapies primarily involve the use of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles/exosomes. MSCs are isolated from various tissues, such as fat, bone marrow, umbilical cord, menstrual blood, and foetal skin, and expanded ex vivo before transplantation. In cell-free therapies, MSC exosomes, MSC-derived cultured media, and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles are collected from MSC-conditioned media or supernatant.

Arsenic exposure is closely related to keratosis and cutaneous carcinoma, but a few studies have focused on patients with psoriasis presenting carcinoma after long-term medication of arsenic-containing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
Case description
We presented a psoriasis patient showing multiple cutaneous carcinoma arising from arsenic containing TCM. A 60-year-old gentleman with psoriasis for nearly 30 years presented to our department with severe keratosis in hands, trunk and feet. He received oral administration of realgar (with As4S4 as the major component) for at least 15 years. There were keratotic plaques, ulcer and exudate in the middle finger and forefinger of left hand, and middle finger, forefinger and ring finger of the right hand. Moreover, brown papule was seen in right sole, together with keratotic plaques and ulcer in the left heel. Pathological analysis revealed basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in the anterior chest, right hand and right foot, Bowen disease in left hand and right hand, as well as squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in right hand.
Conclusion
This is a rare arsenic-exposure psoriasis patient showed coexistence of Bowen disease in left hand and right hand, BCC in the thoracic site, right hand and right foot, as well as SCC in right hand.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause a considerable burden of morbidity and mortality in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Access to safe, effective, quality-assured, and affordable essential medicines is variable. We aimed to review the existing literature relating to the availability, cost, and affordability of WHO's essential medicines for asthma and COPD in LMICs.
Methods
A systematic review of the literature was done by searching seven databases to identify research articles published between Jan 1, 2010, and June 30, 2022. Studies on named essential medicines for asthma and COPD in LMICs were included and review articles were excluded. Two authors (MS and HT) screened and extracted data independently, and assessed bias using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. The main outcome measures were availability (WHO target of 80%), cost (compared with median price ratio [MPR]), and affordability (number of days of work of the lowest paid government worker). The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021281069.
Findings
Of 4742 studies identified, 29 met the inclusion criteria providing data from 60 LMICs. All studies had a low risk of bias. Six of 58 countries met the 80% availability target for short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs), three of 48 countries for inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and zero of four for inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta-agonist (ICS–LABA) combination inhalers. Costs were reported by 12 studies: the range of MPRs was 1·1–351 for SABAs, 2·6–340 for ICSs, and 24 for ICS–LABAs in the single study reporting this. Affordability was calculated in ten studies: SABA inhalers typically cost around 1–4 days’ wages, ICSs 2–7 days, and ICS–LABAs at least 6 days. The included studies showed heterogeneity.
Interpretation
Essential medicines for treating asthma and COPD were largely unavailable and unaffordable in LMICs. This was particularly true for inhalers containing corticosteroids.

Objectives: The primary purpose of this study was to assess the potential applicability of the Typology, previously tested in mental health settings, to a family medicine setting. The secondary objective was to verify the complementarity of the concept of interpreter stance. Method: A deductive thematic analysis and co-occurrence analyses were conducted following focus groups with 89 experienced and trainee family physicians. Results: The potential of the Typology for family physicians was confirmed. Although the concept of stance was found to be complementary, it could not be integrated directly into the Typology. Conclusions: The Typology is applicable in both family medicine and mental health settings. The Typology provides conceptual guidance that the clinician and interpreter can use with confidence to deepen their collaboration.}

Previous research overstated the arsenic toxicity of realgar-containing Chinese prescription medications because little thought was given to the influence of arsenic bioaccessibility by gut microbiota. In light of this, this study examined the total content, bioaccessibility and speciation of targeted medications while also examining intestinal epithelial transit utilizing the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT). All samples contained arsenic, and the bioaccessibilities of the colon, intestine and gastric regions ranged from 0.19% to 1.73%, 0.25–1.88% and 0.21–1.70% respectively. The range of DGT-bioaccessibility is 0.01–0.0018%. Three steps of analysis were conducted on inorganic As(III) and As(V). In health risk assessment, the ADDs and HQs of DGT-bioaccessibility were below the threshold levels when compared to computing average daily intake dose (ADD) and hazard quotient (HQ) by bioaccessibility of gastric, intestinal and colon. Additionally, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were discovered to be the two predominant kinds of gut microbes in this study. Under arsenic exposure, the abundance of Christensenellaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae and Akkermansiaceae increased, but the quantity of Rikenellaceae decreased. These findings revealed that alterations in gut microbiota had an impact on host metabolism.}

Environmental factors epigenetically affect gene expression, and the disease is driven by a multidimensional dynamic network involving RNA and protein molecules derived from gene expression, as well as various metabolic products. In other words, specific pathophysiological mechanisms or endotypes are dynamic networks that arise in response to individual genotypes and the various environmental factors to which individuals have been exposed since before birth, such as diet, infection, air pollution, smoking, antibiotic use, and the bacterial flora of the intestinal tract, skin, and lungs. A key feature of asthma genome scans is their potential to reveal the molecular pathways that lead to pathogenesis. Endotypes that drive the disease have a significant impact on the phenotypes of asthma patients, including their drug responsiveness. Understanding endotypes will lead to not only the implementation of therapies that are tailored to the specific molecular network(s) underlying the patient's condition, but also to the development of therapeutic strategies that target individual endotypes, as well as to precision health, which will enable the prediction of disease onset with high accuracy from an early stage and the implementation of preventive strategies based on endotypes. Understanding of endotypes will pave the way for the practice of precision medicine in asthma care, moving away from ‘one-size-fits-all’ medicine and population-based prevention approaches that do not take individuals' susceptibility into account.}

Paper 2 of the paediatric regenerative medicine Series focuses on recent advances in postnatal approaches. New gene, cell, and niche-based technologies and their combinations allow structural and functional reconstitution and simulation of complex postnatal cell, tissue, and organ hierarchies. Organoid and tissue engineering advances provide human disease models and novel treatments for both rare paediatric diseases and common diseases affecting all ages, such as COVID-19. Preclinical studies for gastrointestinal disorders are directed towards oesophageal replacement, short bowel syndrome, enteric neuropathy, biliary atresia, and chronic end-stage liver failure. For respiratory diseases, beside the first human tracheal replacement, more complex tissue engineering represents a promising solution to generate transplantable lungs. Genitourinary tissue replacement and expansion usually involve application of biocompatible scaffolds seeded with patient-derived cells. Gene and cell therapy approaches seem appropriate for rare paediatric diseases of the musculoskeletal system such as spinal muscular dystrophy, whereas congenital diseases of complex organs, such as the heart, continue to challenge new frontiers of regenerative medicine.}

abstract = {Summary
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Understanding of the complex pathways involved in lung injury pathogenesis, resolution, and repair has grown considerably in recent decades. Nevertheless, to date, only therapies targeting ventilation-induced lung injury have consistently proven beneficial, and despite these gains, ARDS morbidity and mortality remain high. Many candidate therapies with promise in preclinical studies have been ineffective in human trials, probably at least in part due to clinical and biological heterogeneity that modifies treatment responsiveness in human ARDS. A precision medicine approach to ARDS seeks to better account for this heterogeneity by matching therapies to subgroups of patients that are anticipated to be most likely to benefit, which initially might be identified in part by assessing for heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials. In October 2019, the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop of multidisciplinary experts to explore research opportunities and challenges for accelerating precision medicine in ARDS. Topics of discussion included the rationale and challenges for a precision medicine approach in ARDS, the roles of preclinical ARDS models in precision medicine, essential features of cohort studies to advance precision medicine, and novel approaches to clinical trials to support development and validation of a precision medicine strategy. In this Position Paper, we summarise workshop discussions, recommendations, and unresolved questions for advancing precision medicine in ARDS. Although the workshop took place before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for precision therapies for ARDS as the global scientific community grapples with many of the key concepts, innovations, and challenges discussed at this workshop.}

abstract = {Introduction
Pharmacogenetics evaluates how genetic variations influence drug responses. Nowadays, genetic tests have advanced, becoming more affordable, and its integration is supported by stronger clinical evidence. Guidelines such as those from CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium) and resources like PharmGKB facilitate genotype-based prescribing; and organizations like the FDA promote genetic testing before initiating certain medications. Preventive pharmacogenetic panels seem promising, but further research on biomarkers and diverse populations is needed. The aim of this review is to analyze recent evidence on the genotype–drug response relationship to examine how the genetic profile of patients influences the clinical response to treatments, and analyze the areas of research that need further study to advance towards a genetic-based precision medicine.
Materials and methods
A systematic search was conducted on PubMed to identify articles investigating the genotype–drug response relationship. The search strategy included terms such as “pharmacogenetics”, “personalized treatment”, “precision medicine”, “dose adjustment”, “individualizing dosing”, “clinical routine”, and “clinical practice.” Clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses published in English or Spanish between 2013 and 2023 were included. The initial search resulted in a total of 136 articles for analysis.
Results
49 articles were included for the final analysis following review by 2 investigators. A relationship between genetic polymorphisms and drug response or toxicity was found for drugs such as opioids, GLP-1 agonists, tacrolimus, oral anticoagulants, antineoplastics, atypical antipsychotics, efavirenz, clopidogrel, lamotrigine, anti-TNFα agents, voriconazole, antidepressants, or statins. However, for drugs like metformin, quetiapine, irinotecan, bisoprolol, and anti-VEGF agents, no statistically significant association between genotype and response was found.
Conclusion
The studies analyzed in this review suggest a strong correlation between genetic variability and individual drug responses, supporting the use of pharmacogenetics for treatment optimization. However, for certain drugs like metformin or quetiapine, the influence of genotype on their response remains unclear. More studies with larger sample sizes, greater ethnic diversity, and consideration of non-genetic factors are needed. The lack of standardization in analysis methods and accessibility to genetic testing are significant challenges in this field. As a conclusion, pharmacogenetics shows immense potential in personalized medicine, but further research is required.
Resumen
Introducción
La farmacogenética evalúa cómo variantes genéticas influyen en la respuesta a medicamentos. En la actualidad las pruebas genéticas han avanzado, son más asequibles y su integración se respalda con evidencia clínica más sólida. Guías como las del CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium) y recursos como PharmGKB facilitan la prescripción basada en genética; y organizaciones como la FDA promueven realizar determinaciones genéticas previo inicio de ciertos medicamentos. Los paneles farmacogenéticos preventivos se muestran prometedores, pero se requiere investigar más biomarcadores y poblaciones diversas. El objetivo de esta revisión es analizar la evidencia reciente en la relación genotipo-respuesta para examinar cómo influye el perfil genético de los pacientes en la respuesta a tratamientos, y analizar las áreas de investigación que necesitan más estudios para avanzar hacia una medicina de precisión basada en genética.
Materiales y métodos
Se realizó una búsqueda sistemática en PubMed para identificar artículos que investigaran la relación genotipo-respuesta a fármacos. La estrategia de búsqueda incluyó términos como «pharmacogenetics», «personalized treatment», «precision medicine», «dose adjustment», «individualized dosing», «clinical routine», and «clinical practice». Se incluyeron ensayos clínicos, estudios observacionales y metaanálisis en inglés o español entre 2013–2023. La búsqueda inicial resultó en 136 artículos.
Resultados
Se incluyeron 49 artículos para su análisis final tras la revisión de dos investigadores. Se encontró relación entre polimorfismos genéticos y respuesta/toxicidad para fármacos como: opioides, agonistas GLP-1, tacrólimus, anticoagulantes orales, antineoplasicos, antipsicóticos atípicos, efavirenz, clopidogrel, lamotrigina, anti-TNFα, voriconazol, antidepresivos o estatinas. Sin embargo, para fármacos como metformina, quetiapina, irinotecán, bisoprolol y anti-VEGF no se encontró asociación estadísticamente significativa.
Conclusión
Los estudios analizados en esta revisión sugieren una fuerte correlación entre la variabilidad genética y la respuesta individual a fármacos, respaldando la importancia de usar la farmacogenética para la optimización de tratamientos. Sin embargo, para ciertos fármacos como metformina o quetiapina la influencia del genotipo sigue siendo poco clara. Son necesarios más estudios con mayor tamaño de muestra, más diversidad étnica y contemplando factores no genéticos. La falta de estandarización en los métodos de análisis y la accesibilidad a las pruebas genéticas son desafíos importantes en este campo. En resumen, la farmacogenética muestra un potencial enorme en la medicina personalizada, pero se requiere aún más investigación.}

Hosta plantaginea (Lam.) Aschers flower is an important Mongolian medicine beneficial in the treatment of chronic prostatitis (CP) in the absence of scientific evidence.
Aim of the study
The aim of this study was to reveal the therapeutical effects and potential mechanisms of H. plantaginea flowers extract (HP) and its different polarity fractions (HPA∼D) on autoimmune CP (ACP) model rats.
Materials and methods
Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly assigned to 13 groups (n = 6/group). Except the sham group, all rats were injected with a mixture of prostate antigen and complete Freund's adjuvant on days 0, 7, and 21 to establish ACP model rats. Afterwards, ACP model rats were orally gavaged with HP or HPA∼D (1 and 4 g/kg of raw herbal material) or positive drug (Prostat, 200 mg/kg) daily from day 21 to day 50 for 30 days, while the sham and model groups were treated simultaneously with isopyknic of 0.3% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. Histopathological analysis, biochemical parameters, and protein expression of prostate tissues were investigated.
Results
In comparison with the model group, all fraction groups experienced improved CP effects, including restored body weight, reduced prostate gland edema and prostate index, decreased prostatic leukocytes, increased prostatic lecithin bodies, and alleviated histopathological damage to prostate tissue. Furthermore, all fraction groups markedly inhibited the phosphorylated protein of nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-κB p65), NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), just another kinase 1 (JAK1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt) than the model group.
Conclusion
All fractions of HP exerted significant anti-CP effects by inhibiting NF-κB, MAPKs, JAK-STAT and PI3K-Akt pathways in ACP model rats. These findings provide scientific evidence that H. plantaginea flowers can be used as a pivotal Mongolian medicine in clinical applications for the treatment of CP.}

Serious complications of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include subcutaneous emphysema (SE) and pneumomediastinum, which are complicated to treat with conventional Western medicine. We report how combining Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) with Western medicine quickly resolved a patient's COVID-19-associated pulmonary complications, shortened hospital stay and improved quality of life.
Clinical features and outcome
A 59-year-old male with a history of smoking and tumors was diagnosed with COVID-19 in May 2021. At hospitalization, his oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 80%, he had a continuous severe cough, rapid shallow breathing, spontaneous SE and pneumomediastinum. By Day 4 of hospitalization, his condition was worsening despite standard care, so CHM was added. After 3–5 days, his coughing had lessened and supplementary oxygen therapy was de-escalated. Nine days after starting CHM, the SE had completely resolved and the patient avoided intubation. His WHO OS 10-point Scale score had fallen from 6 to 3 points and the modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale score from 4 to 2 points. He was hospitalized for 19 days. At 1 week post-discharge, the patient could handle most of his daily activities and experienced minor shortness of breath only when performing labor-intensive tasks. At 1 month, his work output was restored to pre-COVID-19 levels.
Conclusion
CHM combined with standard Western medicine improved pulmonary function, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation and shortened the hospital stay of a patient with severe COVID-19 complicated by SE and pneumomediastinum.}

abstract = {Background
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a well-known medical science that uses a variety of therapeutic strategies and approaches to effectively prevent and treat a wide range of human ailments. Determining graduating medical and health science students' knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding CAM can help in the integration of these systems into the health care system at large in a healthy manner. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) of CAM among the University of Gondar (UOG) graduating medical and health science students.
Methods
An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 13 to July 26, 2021, at the University of Gondar, college of medicine and health science, Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics were calculated for baseline characteristics. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the association between dependent and independent variables.
Results
The study included 302 students, making the response rate 98.05%. The mean age of the participants was 23.5 ± 1.4 years. About 80(26.5%) of respondents appeared to have good knowledge. Knowledge about CAM was significantly greater among pharmacy students compared to medical students at 4.852(95% CI-1.831, 12.859). About 86% of students had a positive attitude toward CAM. This study revealed that females had 0.042 times less likely positive attitude towards CAM than male students (95%CI-0.008, 0.210). The most common CAM modality amongst all was nutritional therapy, at 35.8%. Regarding to students' overall practice, 101(33.5%) of students had good practice. pharmacy students had 2.527 times more good practice than medical students (95% CI-1.001, 6.379). Whereas, nursing students were 0.375 times less likely to have good practice than medical students (95% CI-0.141, 0.999).
Conclusion
As the finding of this study indicates, despite students' positive attitudes towards CAM, their knowledge and practice are poor.}

abstract = {Advances in neuroscience have suggested that addiction is not only an ongoing dynamic transaction between the person, their behavior, and the environment, but a disturbance of neurotransmitters in neurons involved in reward, memory, and cognitive control. Although the neural mechanism of addiction is complex and heterogeneous, previous addiction recovery and treatment studies have proven that addiction is amenable to treatment and recovery. At present, addiction treatment faces great challenges as well as many opportunities. The field of biomedical engineering is and will be at the forefront of these accelerating disciplines based on advances in imaging, genomics, systems medicine, molecular and cellular engineering, and other biomedical sciences. Thus, we propose several perspectives to accelerate the development of advanced and scientific approaches for addiction treatment: early prevention is better than cure and addiction treatment should focus on individualized regulation, whole-body interaction and the translation of effective animal models to human.}

abstract = {Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) was the first discovered plant virus with genomic DNA that uses reverse transcriptase for replication. The CaMV 35S promoter is a constitutive promoter and thus, an attractive driver of gene expression in plant biotechnology. It is used in most transgenic crops to activate foreign genes which have been artificially inserted into the host plant. In the last century, producing food for the world's population while preserving the environment and human health is the main topic of agriculture. The damage caused by viral diseases has a significant negative economic impact on agriculture, and disease control is based on two strategies: immunization and prevention to contain virus spread, so correct identification of plant viruses is important for disease management. Here, we discuss CaMV from different aspects: taxonomy, structure and genome, host plants and symptoms, transmission and pathogenicity, prevention, control and application in biotechnology as well as in medicine. Also, we calculated the CAI index for three ORFs IV, V, and VI of the CaMV virus in host plants, the results of which can be used in the discussion of gene transfer or antibody production to identify the CaMV.}

abstract = {Objective
To study the safety and feasibility of virtual consultations in reproductive medicine.
Design
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving subfertile patients attending a video consultation between September 2021 and August 2022. Clinicians conducting virtual consultations during the same period responded to a parallel survey for healthcare professionals.
Setting
University Hospital in Manchester, UK.
Participants
Subfertile patients attending a virtual consultation. Healthcare professionals conducting virtual consultations.
Intervention
The survey link was offered in 4,932 consultations. A total of 577 (11.69%) patients responded and 510 completed the questionnaire (88.3%).
Main outcome measures
Patient satisfaction measured as the percentage of patients preferring virtual to in person consultations.
Results
The majority of the patients (475, 91.70%) had a positive experience with the video consultation and just under half of the patients (152, 48.65%) preferred a video consultation to an in person consultation due to cost and time savings. Most patients (375, 72.68%) felt safer and less exposed to COVID-19. When the risk of COVID-19 subsides, 242 patients (47%) would still prefer to attend video consultations, while 169 (32.82%) had no preference. Analysis of the responses from patients reporting a negative experience identified technical problems as a possible cause. The virtual consultations appeared to be suitable for patients with disabilities. The clinicians’ survey identified potential legal and ethical concerns.
Conclusion
Virtual consultations are a safe and feasible alternative to in person consultations for subfertile patients. This large cross-sectional study revealed a high rate of patient satisfaction. Appropriate patient selection accounting for IT literacy, English language understanding and preference is crucial for successful virtual consultations. Further consideration should be given to ethical and legal challenges of virtual consultations. Trial registration: Research Registry, UIN 6912, https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry}

Distinguishing a suicide from a homicide or accidental event is essential to define whether third parties are involved in death. Suicides are most frequently performed using a single method; therefore, they can be defined as simple. The term “complex suicide” refers to a form of suicide in which two or more methods are applied by the victim, simultaneously or in chronological succession, to achieve the death. The different methods may have been planned in advance to prevent failure of the first method or may occur because the first method was not effective or was too painful, so the victim quickly seeks another way to complete the suicide. “Complicated suicides”, on the other hand, are characterised by an unintentional secondary trauma following the suicidal act. This study analyses 35 complex suicides and 4 complicated suicides investigated at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Brescia (Italy) during the period 1983–2022. Some data about the cases are discussed. This study aims to demonstrate how multiple lesions on the victim's body are not in themselves indicative of the intervention of third parties in their production, but complex and complicated suicides must always be considered.}

Promising results have led to PCa EV biomarker validation studies which are currently underway with the next challenge being translation to robust clinical assays. However, EV research studies generally use low throughput EV isolation methods and costly molecular profiling technologies that are not suitable for clinical assays.

abstract = {Background
Jin-Zhen oral liquid (JZOL), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine prescription (TCMp), has extensively been used to treat acute bronchitis in children more than four hundred years in China. However, the current quality control standard of JZOL is inadequate, posing challenges for its internationalization.
Purpose
In this study, a Q-marker screening strategy based on multi-factor analysis was proposed to comprehensively evaluate anti-inflammatory Q-markers of Jin-Zhen oral liquid (JZOL).
Methods
Firstly, the chemical profile and the pharmacokinetics properties of multiple components in JZOL were characterized by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS and UPLC-QqQ-MS. By integrating the measurable and absorbed components, twenty-two components with structures accurately defined, were selected as candidate Q-markers of JZOL. Following that, a network connecting 22 components and targets closely associated with bronchitis was established. Afterwards, a multi-factor analysis mode was developed to balance the components’ multiple characteristics, and screen out the anti-inflammatory Q-markers in JZOL. Finally, the anti-inflammatory activity evaluation was conducted by LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages to prove the representativeness of anti-inflammatory Q-markers in JZOL.
Results
As a result, a total of 92 components were characterized in JZOL and the pharmacokinetics properties of 11 bioactive components in vivo were further characterized. Then, an overlapping of 46 targets involved in the interactions of selected 22 candidate Q-markers and the regulation of bronchitis inflammation were collected. Subsequently, a multi-factor analysis was developed on 22 candidate anti-inflammatory Q-markers covering five factors, with the statistic KMO values of 0.645, and the P values of Bartlett's Test equal to 0.000. A total of seven ingredients (aloeemodin-8-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, baicalin, chrysin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, oroxylin A 7-O-β-d-glucuronide, wogonoside, chrysophanol-8-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, and skullcapflavone II) were selected as Q-markers of JZOL, and the inhibitory effects of these candidate Q-markers on the secretion of inflammatory cytokes (NO, IL-6, IL-1β, and PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells were evaluated and confirmed.
Conclusion
This study not only offers a fresh approach to uncovering Q-markers in the quality control research of TCMps but also identifies the suitable anti-inflammatory Q-markers for JZOL for the first time, with the potential to serve as a reference for existing quality control standards of JZOL.}

abstract = {Background
The global supply chains of essential medicines faced frequent disruptions over the past five years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different causes of prescription drug supply interruptions have been identified in Saudi Arabia. However, studies have yet to explore the views of pharmaceutical supply chain personnel regarding the causes of these interruptions. Therefore, this study aimed to survey individuals working in the pharmaceutical supply chains about their views on the observed interruptions in the supply of some essential drugs.
Methods
This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. The 10-item questionnaire was created based on the findings of previously published research that investigated the root causes of essential drug shortages and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chains of essential drugs in Saudi Arabia. Purposive sampling was used to identify individuals with at least one year of experience in the area of the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the data collection occurred between April 19th, 2022 and October 23rd, 2022. In addition, descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies and percentages) were conducted to present the views of the respondents.
Results
Seventy-nine pharmaceutical supply chain specialists accepted the invitation and completed the questionnaire. About two-thirds (69.62%) of the respondents reported that centralized pharmaceutical procurement negatively affected the supply chain of essential drugs. Procurement of unregistered medications by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA), as well as generic drugs with a history of recalls, and failure to supply requested quantities were the three most commonly reported reasons behind the observed interruptions in the supply of some essential drugs according to those respondents with a negative view of the centralized procurement. Furthermore, failure of pharmaceutical companies to inform SFDA of potential drug shortages, manufacturing issues, poor demand forecasting, unpredictable increase in demand, and low prices of essential drugs were also believed to be behind the observed interruptions in the supply of some essential medicines.
Conclusion
The majority of surveyed pharmaceutical supply chain professionals held negative views about the role of centralized pharmaceutical procurement in exacerbating the issues with essential medicines supply chain. Future research should examine different strategies to improve purchasing and procurement practices in Saudi Arabia.}

Inflammation is a double-edged sword in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The global rise in the prevalence of T2DM in one hand, and poor disease control with currently-available treatments on the other hand, along with an increased tendency towards the use of natural products make scientists seek herbal medicines for the management of diabetes and its complications by reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker.
Purpose
To systematically review the literature to identify the efficacy of various medicinal plants with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties considering their effect on CRP in animal models of T2DM.
Study design
systematic review.
Methods
Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochran Library were searched using the search terms “herbal medicine”, “diabetes”, “c-reactive protein”, “antioxidants” till August 2021. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE's) tool. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO with an ID number CRD42020207190. A manual search to detect any articles not found in the databases was also made. The identified studies were then critically reviewed and relevant data were extracted and summarized.
Results
Among total of 9904 primarily-retrieved articles, twenty-three experimental studies were finally included. Our data indicated that numerous herbal medicines, compared to placebo or hypoglycemic medications, are effective in treatment of diabetes and its complications through decreasing CRP concentrations and oxidative stresses levels. Medicinal plants including Psidium guajava L., Punica granatum L., Ginkgo biloba L., Punica granatum L., Dianthus superbusn L.. Moreover, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, Curcuma longa L., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Morus alba L., and Ficus racemosa L. demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in animal models of diabetes.
Conclusion
Hypoglycemic medicinal plants discussed in this review seem to be promising regulators of CRP, and oxidative stress. Thus, these plants are suitable candidates for management of diabetes’ complications. Nevertheless, further high-quality in vivo studies and clinical trials are required to confirm these effects.}

abstract = {Human flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) is a drug-metabolizing enzyme (DME) which is known to be highly polymorphic. Some of its polymorphic variants are associated with inter-individual differences that contribute to drug response. In order to measure these differences, the implementation of a quick and efficient in vitro assay is highly desirable. To this end, in this work a microfluidic immobilized enzyme reactor (μ-IMER) was developed with four separate serpentines where FMO3 and its two common polymorphic variants (V257M and E158K) were covalently immobilized via glutaraldehyde cross-linking in the presence of a polylysine coating. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to calculate the selected substrate retention time in serpentines with different surface areas at various flow rates. The oxidation of tamoxifen, an anti-breast cancer drug, was used as a model reaction to characterize the new device in terms of available surface area for immobilization, channel coating, and applied flow rate. The highest amount of product was obtained when applying a 10 μL min−1 flow rate on polylysine-coated serpentines with a surface area of 90 mm2 each. Moreover, these conditions were used to test the device as a multi-enzymatic platform by simultaneously assessing the conversion of tamoxifen by FMO3 and its two polymorphic variants immobilized on different serpentines of the same chip. The results obtained demonstrate that the differences observed in the conversion of tamoxifen within the chip are similar to those already published (E158K > WT > V257M). Therefore, this microfluidic platform provides a feasible option for fabricating devices for personalised medicine.}

Qualitative semistructured group interviews were utilized to identify the medication-related needs of sports medicine organizations in the U.S. Organizations, including orthopedic centers, sports medicine clinics, training centers, and athletic departments were recruited via email. A survey and a set of sample questions were sent to each participant to gather demographic information and allow time for the participant to reflect on their specific organization’s medication-related needs in preparation for the interviews. A discussion guide was created to explore each organization’s overarching medication-related functions and the challenges and successes related to their current policies and procedures regarding their medication-related needs. Each interview was conducted virtually, recorded, and transcribed into text. A thematic analysis was conducted by a primary and secondary coder. Themes and subthemes were identified from the codes and defined.
Results
Nine organizations were recruited for participation. Of these, individuals from 3 Division 1 university-based athletic programs were interviewed. Twenty-one individuals participated across all 3 organizations including 16 athletic trainers, 4 physicians, and 1 dietitian. The thematic analysis revealed the following themes: Medication-Related Responsibilities, Barriers to Optimizing Medication Use, Contributions to Successful Implementation of the Medication-Related Services, and Opportunities to Improve Medication-Related Needs. Themes were reduced to subthemes to further describe the medication-related needs within each organization.
Conclusion
Division 1 university-based athletic programs have medication-related needs and challenges that have the potential to be enhanced by services provided by pharmacists.}
