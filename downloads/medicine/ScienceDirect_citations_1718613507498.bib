1. Understand the need for formalized curriculum for palliative medicine elective. 2. Apply skills related to conducting family meetings and being familiar with signs and symptoms at end of life.
Key Message
With an expanding geriatric population, principles of Palliative Medicine are becoming an integral part of Primary Care education. A survey was conducted to help understand how confidence levels with primary Palliative topics (addressing code status, conducting family meetings, and providing end-of-life symptom management) were perceived within an urban, community hospital Internal Medicine Program.
Introduction
Internal Medicine residents benefit from being able to provide primary palliative care to their patients.
Objectives
Assess Internal Medicine Residents confidence levels in addressing code status, leading family meetings, and providing end-of-life symptom management.
Methods
An anonymous survey was conducted at an urban, community-based hospital in which questions regarding Primary Palliative Medicine were asked of IM residents in PGY1, 2, and 3.
Results
The survey was completed by 14 IM residents (58% response rate). Of those 14 residents, 11 had not had a Palliative Medicine rotation during residency. Residents’ confidence level with addressing code status included 5 extremely, 2 very, 6 somewhat and 1 not so confident. No resident felt extremely confident in leading family meetings, though 5 felt very confident, 5 were somewhat confident, 3 not so, and 1 not at all. For symptom management, only 1 felt extremely confident, 5 felt very, 6 somewhat, and 1 not so confident.
Conclusion
Survey results reveal that IM residents within an urban, community-based hospital are least confident in leading family meetings and providing end-of-life symptom management. Beginning academic year 2023-24, PGY2 IM residents will have a mandatory 2-week Palliative Medicine rotation. Following the changes in curriculum, another survey will be sent out at the end of this academic year to reassess confidence. Since the Palliative team actively works with Psychiatry and Family Medicine residents, future directions would include inviting their participation in this study as well.

This study constructs a multi-relational medicine-attribute network, which refers to three different types of relationships: inter-medicine, inter-attribute, and medicine-attribute. Then, a multi-relation-based graph attention network (GAT) model combined with the spectral clustering (SC) algorithm, termed MGAT-SC, is presented to train the medicine embeddings and explore the regularity of medicine combinations. Based on real-world clinical data, the GAT model realizes the information aggregation of neighbor nodes and generates the embeddings of medicines and their attributes via a multi-head attention mechanism. Then, the SC method is utilized to divide the medicines and their embeddings. We design and conduct a series of experiments to verify the model’s performance. The experimental results show that the MGAT-SC outperforms the representative baselines and their variants in terms of five evaluation metrics and achieves around 6.0% improvement in accuracy compared to the SC algorithm.}

Currently, the common therapeutic drugs in the clinic have disadvantages such as obvious adverse effects and high prices. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) has great potential for the treatment of cAD. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of different doses of the TCHM product (Dihuang Guiqin capsule) and oclacitinib in the treatment of cAD through a randomized, double-blind trial. Sixty dogs diagnosed with AD were randomly and evenly divided into four groups (n = 15). The TCHM treatment group consisted of three subgroups that received three different oral doses (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg BW), while the control group received 0.5 mg/kg BW of oclacitinib. Each group was administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days. The results showed that both TCHM and oclacitinib significantly improved cAD-induced itching (evaluated by pVAS) and skin lesions (evaluated by CADESI-04), while interleukin 31 (IL-31) concentrations decreased significantly (P < 0.05) and serum biochemical indicators returned to normal. In particular, The therapeutic effects of TCHM medium- and high-dose groups were similar to those of oclacitinib (P > 0.05). The preliminary recommended dose of Dihuang Guiqin capsule for the treatment of cAD has been determined to be 40–60 mg/kg BW twice daily for 14 consecutive days, which can be reduced to once daily as appropriate. Dihuang Guiqin capsule was safe and well tolerated, which may be a new option for the treatment of cAD.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has rendered it more challenging to treat bacterial pneumonia. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has superior efficacy in the treatment of pneumonia, and it has the unique advantage of antibacterial resistance against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, but the medication rule and pharmacological mechanism of its antibacterial activity are not clear.
Aim of the study
This study aims to reveal Chinese medication patterns in treating bacterial pneumonia to select bioactive constituents in core herbs, predict their pharmacological mechanisms and further explore their antibacterial ability against clinically isolated MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and their antibacterial mechanisms.
Materials and methods
The high-frequency medicinal herbs to treat lung diseases were first screened from Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (ChP.), and then bioactive compounds in core herbs and targets for compounds and disease were collected. Potential targets, signaling pathways, and drugs' core components were determined by constructing protein-protein interaction network, enrichment analysis and "component-target-pathway-disease" network were mapped by Cytoscape 3.8.2, and the potential therapeutic value of selected core components was verified by comparing the disease targets in the GEO database with the herbal component targets in the ITCM database. The clinically isolated KP were screened by drug sensitivity tests with meropenem (MEM), polymyxin E (PE), and tigecycline and biofilm-forming assay; broth microdilution, chessboard methods and biofilm morphology and permeability experiments were employed to determine the antibacterial, bactericidal and biofilm inhibition ability of selected bioactive constituents alone and in combination with antibiotics; The mechanism of bioactive components on quorum sensing (QS) genes LuxS and LuxR was predicted by molecular docking and tested by RT-PCR.
Results
The 13 core Chinese medicines were obtained by mining ChP., and 615 potential targets of core herbal medicine were screened, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway might play crucial roles in the therapeutic process. In-vitro experiments revealed that the selected core compounds, including forsythoside B, baicalin, baicalein, and forsythin, all have antibacterial activity, in which baicalein had the strongest ability and a synergistic effect in combination with MEM or PE. Their synergy exhibited a stronger effect on biofilms of MDR KP, inhibiting biofilm formation, disrupting formed biofilms, and removing the residual structures of dead bacteria. Baicalein was predicted to have stable binding capacity to LuxS and LuxR genes by molecular docking, and RT-PCR results verified that the combination of baicalein with MEM or PE was effective in inhibiting the expression of QS genes (LuxS and LuxR) and consequently suppressing biofilm formation.
Conclusion
The core Chinese herbal medicine in the ChP. to treat lung diseases has a multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway synergy to improve bacterial pneumonia. Experimental studies have confirmed that the bioactive compound baicalein was able to combat MDR KP alone and synergistic with MEM or PE, inhibited and disrupted biofilms via regulating LuxS and LuxR genes, and further disturbed quorum sensing system to promote the therapeutic efficacy, which provides a new pathway and rationale for treating MDR KP-induced bacterial pneumonia.}

We propose a methodology to bridge this gap by fostering critical thinking skills through interdisciplinary dialogue and mind mapping. A critical thinking mindset amongst students could be successfully developed through the use of interdisciplinary dialogue. Our objective is to equip students from diverse academic backgrounds with the ability to effectively evaluate medical and life science information. Our study employs Socratic questioning, interdisciplinary dialogue, and the implementation of structural and relational mind-mapping techniques. Through Socratic questioning, students engage in-depth discussions that challenge their existing knowledge and encourage them to explore different perspectives. This approach facilitates the integration of multiple viewpoints and enhances students' ability to think critically about medical concepts and their implications. To organize and visualize complex information, mind mapping techniques are employed. Structural and relational mind maps help students comprehend the relationships between various concepts and to identify patterns within the subject matter. By visually representing information, students gain a deeper understanding of medical and life science topics and can effectively analyse and synthesize information from a holistic perspective. The findings of the study reveal that the interdisciplinary dialogue approach, coupled with mind-mapping techniques, significantly contributed to the development of critical thinking skills amongst students. Through active participation in discussions and the application of Socratic questioning, students demonstrated improved comprehension of medical concepts and the ability to construct well-informed arguments. This teaching method emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in liberal education. Our findings demonstrate that involving students with different academic majors fosters a collaborative learning environment, where diverse perspectives are valued. This approach not only enhances knowledge exchange but also encourages creativity and innovation in the field of medicine. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of interdisciplinary dialogue and mind mapping as effective tools to bridge the gap between humanities and medicine. The findings indicate that students who engage in interdisciplinary dialogue and utilize mind-mapping techniques develop a critical thinking mindset, enabling them to proficiently evaluate medical and life science information. By incorporating these approaches into liberal education, students are equipped with the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of the medical field and to contribute to the evolving healthcare challenges of our society.}

Introduction
Classic formulas of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been used for digestive diseases for more than 1 000 years. To determine whether TCM formulas used in modern clinical activities were effective to treat chronic gastritis (CG), we assessed the clinical evidence and potential mechanisms of TCM supplemental treatment on stable CG patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.
Methods
Relevant studies were identified by searching for papers published from January 2005 to August 2022 in the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan Fang Database, and Chinese Scientific Journals Database, without language restrictions. The authors of the identified papers were contacted for additional information if necessary.
Results
A total of 2 215 CG participants from 30 clinical randomised controlled trials of chronic superficial gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, chronic bile reflux gastritis, and chronic erosion gastritis were published in recent years. This meta-analysis showed that TCM could significantly alleviate the clinical symptoms and curative effects of chronic gastritis patients. Furthermore, the mechanisms of single- and two-medicinal combinations and the formula of the included studies are also summarised.
Conclusions
The methodological quality of the included randomised controlled trials may limit the conclusions that indicate that TCM could alleviate the clinical symptoms and promising curative effect of CG patients; some further rigorous designed and well-conducted research should be needed.}

However, the clinical application of TCM prescriptions is limited due to the difficulty in elucidating the effective substances and the lack of current scientific evidence on the mechanisms of action. In recent years, the development of network pharmacology based on drug systems research has provided a new approach for understanding the complex systems represented by TCM. The determination of drug targets is the core of TCM network pharmacology research. Over the past years, many web tools for drug targets with various features have been developed to facilitate target prediction, significantly promoting drug discovery. Therefore, this review introduces the widely used web tools for compound-target interaction prediction databases and web resources in TCM pharmacology research, and it compares and analyzes each web tool based on their basic properties, including the underlying theory, algorithms, datasets, and search results. Finally, we present the remaining challenges for the promising future of compound-target interaction prediction in TCM pharmacology research. This work may guide researchers in choosing web tools for target prediction and may also help develop more TCM tools based on these existing resources.}

Furthermore, based on the TCM-drug target interaction network, we predicted the TCM corresponding to the common pneumoconiosis-related genes obtained by multiple methods, and combined them with the high-frequency TCM for its treatment obtained through literature mining to form a new TCM formula for it. After feeding it to pneumoconiosis modeling mice for two months, compared with the untreated group, the coat color, mental state and tissue sections of the mice in the treated group were markedly improved, indicating that the new TCM formula has a certain efficacy. Our study provides new insights into method development for series transcriptomic data analysis and treatment of pneumoconiosis.}

The overuse of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities has become an issue in the field of emergency medicine. The health care system of Japan aims to provide the most appropriate quality and quantity of care at the right price, while focusing on patient value. The Choosing Wisely® campaign was launched in Japan and other countries.
Objective
In this article, recommendations were discussed to improve the field of emergency medicine based on the state of the Japanese health care system.
Methods
The modified Delphi method, a consensus-building method, was used in this study. The final recommendations were developed by a working group of 20 medical professionals, students, and patients, consisting of members of the emergency physician electronic mailing list.
Results
From the 80 candidates recommended and excessive actions gathered, nine recommendations were formulated after two Delphi rounds. The recommendations included the suppression of excessive behavior and the implementation of appropriate medical treatment, like rapid pain relief and the application of ultrasonography during central venous catheter placement.
Conclusions
This study formulated recommendations to improve the field of Japanese emergency medicine, based on the feedback of patients and health care professionals. The nine recommendations will be helpful for all people involved in emergency care in Japan because they have the potential to prevent the overuse of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, while maintaining the appropriate quality of patient care.}

In this review, we performed an extensive search of lung cancer PDO-based ex vivo drug screening studies. Lung cancer PDOs were successfully established from fresh or bio-banked sections and/or biopsies, pleural effusions and PDX mouse models. PDOs were subject to ex vivo drug screening with chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy. PDOs consistently recapitulated the genomic alterations and drug sensitivity of primary tumors. Although sample sizes of the previous studies were limited and some technical challenges remain, PDOs showed great promise in the screening of novel therapy drugs. With the technical advances of high throughput, tumor-on-chip, and combined microenvironment, the drug screening process using PDOs will enhance precision care of lung cancer patients.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Access to essential childhood cancer medicines is a core determinant of childhood cancer outcomes. Available evidence, although scarce, suggests that access to these medicines is highly variable across countries, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, where the burden of childhood cancer is greatest. To support evidence-informed national and regional policies for improved childhood cancer outcomes, we aimed to analyse access to essential childhood cancer medicines in four east African countries—Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda—by determining the availability and price of these medicines and the health system determinants of access.
Methods
In this comparative analysis, we used prospective mixed-method analyses to track and analyse the availability and price of essential childhood cancer medicines, investigate contextual determinants of access to childhood cancer medicines within and across included countries, and assess the potential effects of medicine stockouts on treatment. Eight tertiary care hospitals were included, seven were public sites (Kenyatta National Hospital [KNH; Nairobi, Kenya], Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral and Teaching Hospital [JOORTH; Kisumu, Kenya], Moi University Teaching and Referral Hospital [MTRH; Eldoret, Kenya], Bugando Medical Centre [BMC; Mwanza, Tanzania], Muhimbili National Hospital [MNH; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania], Butaro Cancer Centre of Excellence [BCCE; Butaro Sector, Rwanda], and Uganda Cancer Institute [UCI; Kampala, Uganda]) and one was a private site (Aga Khan University Hospital [AKU; Nairobi, Kenya]). We catalogued prices and stockouts for 37 essential drugs from each of the eight study siteson the basis of 52 weeks of prospective data that was collected across sites from May 1, 2020, to Jan 31, 2022. We analysed determinants of medicine access using thematic analysis of academic literature, policy documents, and semi-structured interviews from a purposive sample of health system stakeholders.
Findings
Recurrent stockouts of a wide range of cytotoxic and supportive care medicines were observed across sites, with highest mean unavailability in Kenya (JOORTH; 48·5%), Rwanda (BCCE; 39·0%), and Tanzania (BMC; 32·2%). Drugs that had frequent stockouts across at least four sites included methotrexate, bleomycin, etoposide, ifosfamide, oral morphine, and allopurinol. Average median price ratio of medicines at each site was within WHO's internationally accepted threshold for efficient procurement (median price ratio ≤1·5). The effect of stockouts on treatment was noted across most sites, with the greatest potential for treatment interruptions in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, retinoblastoma, and acute lymphocytic leukaemia. Policy prioritisation of childhood cancers, health financing and coverage, medicine procurement and supply chain management, and health system infrastructure emerged as four prominent determinants of access when the stratified purposive sample of key informants (n=64) across all four countries (Kenya n=19, Rwanda n=15, Tanzania n=13, and Uganda n=17) was interviewed.
Interpretation
Access to childhood cancer medicines across east Africa is marked by gaps in availability that have implications for effective treatment delivery for a range of childhood cancers. Our findings provide detailed evidence of barriers to access to childhood cancer medicine at multiple points in the pharmaceutical value chain. These data could inform national and regional policy makers to optimise cancer medicine availability and affordability as part of efforts to improve childhood cancer outcomes specific regions and internationally.

abstract = {Pharmaceutical equivalence studies are critical for determining the interchangeability between test and reference medicines by ensuring that their chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological properties are identical. Typically, this equivalence is evaluated by comparing a single batch of generic medicine to a single batch of the reference medicine. However, regulatory authorities may mandate continuous monitoring of the medicine's quality to maintain compliance with standards. The objective of this study was to assess the total combined global risk of making false decisions regarding the pharmaceutical equivalence of test and reference medicines. To achieve this, ofloxacin ophthalmic solutions and ofloxacin tablets were subjected to pharmacopeial tests and assays. Particular and total global risks were estimated using the Monte Carlo method (MCM) implemented in a MS-Excel spreadsheet. Consumers' risk values were calculated based on the historical mean and standard deviation for quantitative tests or the probability of a compliant batch for qualitative tests. The risk values differed depending on whether the tests had interval specification limits or only minimum or maximum specification limits. Lower risk values were observed when historical means were far from the specification limits, the probability of a compliant batch was high, or when the standard deviation values were low. Similarly, for qualitative analysis, higher probabilities of a compliant batch led to lower consumers' risk values. Reduced risk values were also associated with historical means being distant from the specification limits and with a high probability of a compliant batch, or when standard deviation values were low. The total combined global risk of a false pharmaceutical equivalence decision was found to be significantly high (above 5%) under certain simulated conditions. These conditions include historical mean values close to the specification limits and/or an increased standard deviation of the manufacturing process. As a result, there is an increased risk of failing to establish pharmaceutical equivalence between test and reference medicines manufactured under such conditions.}

abstract = {Introduction
In long-term illnesses, monitoring is an essential part of successful pharmacotherapy. Medicine users' experiences on monitoring have not been widely studied even though they have an important role in the implementation of pharmacotherapy.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate the medicine users' experiences on the implementation of pharmacotherapy monitoring. The focus was on the instructions received regarding the frequency of follow-up visits in health care, the actual frequency of the visits, and the experienced sufficiency of monitoring. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the characteristics of respondents and pharmacotherapy that were associated with implementation of pharmacotherapy monitoring.
Methods
We conducted an online survey targeted at Finnish people ≥18 years who have requested a prescription renewal in MyKanta patient portal in October 2021. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression in the analyses.
Results
1723 individuals completed the questionnaire. Of them, 97.9% (n = 1687) were using prescription medicines and were included in the study. Of the study population, 57.1% had received instructions regarding follow-up visits in health care related to pharmacotherapy monitoring, 70.3% had an annual follow-up visit, and 64.3% felt monitoring was sufficient with all their pharmacotherapies. Several respondents and pharmacotherapy related characteristics were associated with the implementation of pharmacotherapy monitoring. Having diabetes and a designated health care unit responsible for monitoring were associated with well-implemented monitoring, while unfamiliarity with the goals set for pharmacotherapy was strongly associated with poorly implemented monitoring.
Conclusions
In most cases, the medicine users experienced that the monitoring of pharmacotherapies was well-implemented. Having diabetes, a designated health care unit and familiarity with the goals set for pharmacotherapy were associated with well-implemented monitoring. These findings indicate that monitoring practices are well-implemented for diabetes. Furthermore, centralized monitoring in health care unit and understanding of goals set for pharmacotherapy would enhance individual's monitoring of pharmacotherapy.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore the effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nursing on relieving postoperative pain in patients with anorectal diseases.
Method
Three English and three Chinese databases (PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Internet, Wanfang Data and the China Science and Technology Journal Database) were systematically searched for case-controlled or prospective studies evaluating the impact of TCM nursing on postoperative pain in patients with anorectal diseases from the date of library construction until June 20, 2022. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was adopted to evaluate the quality of the observational studies. The effect of TCM care on pain based on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the effective pain relief rate, the wound healing time and the length of hospital stay were systematically analysed.
Result
After a systematic search and screening, a total of 15 documents were included in this study. The systematic evaluation showed that TCM care reduced the VAS score (mean difference (MD): 1.15（95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 1.96, −1.06; P < 0.00001) compared with conventional postoperative care methods. As TCM nursing time increased, there was a trend towards decreased VAS scores. Furthermore, TCM care was effective in providing pain relief (OR: 4.78; 95 % CI: 2.93,7.79; P < 0.00001) and reducing wound healing time (MD: 4.44; 95 % CI: 5.60, −3.27; P < 0.00001) and length of hospital stay (MD: 4.87; 95 % CI: 5.93, −3.82; P < 0.00001).
Conclusion
Traditional Chinese medicine nursing has a positive effect on the postoperative clinical results of patients with anorectal diseases, especially in relieving postoperative pain. The effect of traditional Chinese medicine nursing in relieving short-term postoperative pain in patients with anorectal diseases is obvious. However, there is no uniform standard for TCM nursing projects, which may lead to heterogeneity.}

1. Appreciate the value of an objective mortality index score to trigger earlier palliative medicine consult. 2. Understand the positive impact on hospital metrics with earlier palliative medicine involvement.
Key Message
Timing of inpatient palliative medicine consultation is still variable among providers without an objective data point that signals palliative needs. We implemented a one year mortality risk predictive score in EPIC to prompt providers for a palliative medicine consult within the first 48 hours of admission if patients met the agreed upon criteria.
Introduction
Our system has a well-integrated palliative medicine presence, however, patients are often seen at the end stages of their disease where their prognosis becomes synonymous with hospice. We incorporated a validated mortality index score in our EMR to alert the provider for palliative medicine needs within the first 48 hours of admission.
Objectives
Determine the impact of a mortality risk score to prompt earlier inpatient palliative medicine consult.
Methods
In collaboration with hospital medicine, we implemented the End of Life Index (EOL index) into our EMR for 4 pilot units at two hospital sites. We set a cutoff score >75 plus three or more admissions in the past year to prompt a consult via a best practice alert. The alert gave the option to accept, defer, or decline a consult order.
Results
We measured 8 months of data before and 8 months after the intervention. Average time from admission to consult decreased from 5.43 days to 3.95 days; corresponding average LOS decreased from 14.58 to 12.25 days. Inpatient mortality declined from 18% to 9% of patients consulted by palliative medicine. Hospice as a discharge disposition decreased from 25% to 20% between the pre and post groups, with an increase in home or home health discharges from 30% to 42%.
Conclusion
It can be challenging to determine when the right time is to involve palliative medicine. By incorporating this objective mortality risk score at admission, we showed a positive impact on consult behaviors with identification of patients sooner than prior to the intervention. Our data suggests we were able to capture patients earlier in their course before they qualified for hospice, thereby increasing our opportunity to follow them longitudinally by our outpatient palliative medicine team.

abstract = {Introduction
The phenomenon of Financial Medicine is a wide spread practice within the South African prehospital domain, which remains poorly researched. Similarly the impact of this phenomenon is not well understood, with many healthcare providers grappling with the moral dilemmas introduced into the work systems through the effects of the practice of Financial Medicine. Persisting, repetitive moral dilemmas can lead to instances of Moral Distress and Moral Injury. The practice of Financial Medicine in the South African prehospital domain proves to introduce many moral dilemmas and subsequently can serve as a source of Moral Distress and Moral Injury.
Methods
This study used a qualitative research methodology in the form of a constructivist grounded theory design. Participants voluntarily consented to be enrolled into one-on-one in-depth interviews, and were selected using purposive and theoretical sampling techniques. Data was subjected to validated coding procedures and analysed using the constant comparative analysis approach, analytical diagramming, and supported by researcher theoretical sensitivity.
Results
The sub-category presented in this study stems from the development of 6 final analytical labels that were abstracted in the process of a theory construction, not presented in this article. This sub-category is nested under 1 of the final analytical labels, and comprised of 3 preliminary analytical labels and an associated code and proposition list.
Conclusion
Understanding the sources of Moral Distress and Moral Injury within the South African prehospital domain are key steps in promoting and supporting the adoption and sustainability of ethical practices. This article presents a key finding that demonstrates a link between the experience of the phenomenon of Financial Medicine and the suffering of a Moral Injury by South African prehospital personnel.}

India's AYUSH systems of medicine, Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Sowa-Rigpa, and Homeopathy, use natural self-healing abilities of body and mind. Their ways to treat non-communicable diseases reduce use of modern drugs with their side-effects. Scientific acceptance requires them to be explained from a modern biological perspective. This paper indicates how to achieve such an integrative approach, using aspects of biology not yet taught in medical schools.
Methods
A new, ‘Sandwich Model’ of biology is introduced that includes holistic epigenetic regulation; also, complexity biology's concept of self-organized criticality; a systems treatment of organism function from Ayurveda; and Ayurveda's six stages of etiology, Shadkriyakala.
Results
Molecular biology is upgraded by the sandwich model's layer of epigenetics, leading to a new, scientific definition of health as optimized regulation. Fractal Physiology then expands this to explain self-healing, used in all AYUSH systems. Ayurveda contributes in two ways: its systems approach yields a holistic understanding of organism functioning, while Shadkriyakala improves our understanding of pathophysiology.
Discussion
These additions create an integrative biology; modern biology expands to include AYUSH systems' concepts. It provides a scientific basis for India's plan for integrative medical education, with AYUSH systems treated as equal to modern medicine.}

abstract = {Precision oncology has made remarkable strides in improving clinical outcomes, offering hope to patients with historically difficult-to-treat, as well as rare or neglected cancers. However, despite rapid advancement, precision oncology has reached a critical juncture, where patient access to these life-saving medicines may be hampered by strict requirements by Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for assessing new medicines against appropriate comparator. The very nature of precision oncology—matching a tumour’s unique molecular alterations to targeted therapies predicted to elicit response—can make the use of RCTs very difficult, as only a very small number of patients might qualify for a given therapy within a traditional clinical trial setting. Real-world evidence (RWE) has been accepted for regulatory decision-making but has yet to reach widespread acceptance by HTA bodies. As the oncology treatment landscape has evolved towards favouring the concept of precision oncology, there is a growing need for flexibility in the way HTA bodies evaluate new medicines. We must acknowledge that current assessment methodologies can limit access to life-changing medicines for many patients who have no alternative options and that a growing number of precision oncology medicines with proven clinical benefits in rare tumours cannot be reasonably evaluated using traditional methodologies. The objectives of this paper are to advocate a change in mindset regarding best practices in drug assessment models and to propose alternative approaches when considering indications for which RWE is the most compelling data source available.}

abstract = {Purpose
To (1) characterize the various forms of wearable sensor devices (WSDs) and (2) review the peer-reviewed literature of applied wearable technology within sports medicine.
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases, from inception through 2023, was conducted to identify eligible studies using WSDs within sports medicine. Data extraction was performed of study demographics and sensor specifications. Included studies were categorized by application: athletic training, rehabilitation, and research.
Results
In total, 43 studies met criteria for inclusion in this review. Forms of WSDs include pedometers, accelerometers, encoders (consisting of magnetometers and gyroscopes), force sensors, global positioning system trackers, and inertial measurement units. Outcome metrics include step counts; gait, limb motion, and angular positioning; foot and skin pressure; change of direction and inclination, including analysis of both body parts and athletes on a field; displacement and velocity of body segments and joints; heart rate; plethysmography; sport-specific kinematics; range of motion, symmetry, and alignment; head impact; sleep; throwing biomechanics; and kinetic and spatiotemporal running metrics. WSDs are used in athletic training to assess sport-specific biomechanics and workload with a goal of injury prevention and training optimization, as well as for rehabilitation monitoring and research such as for risk predicting and aiding diagnosis.
Conclusions
WSDs enable real-time monitoring of human performance across a variety of implementations and settings, allowing collection of metrics otherwise not achievable. WSDs are powerful tools with multiple applications within athletic training, patient rehabilitation, and orthopaedic and sports medicine research.
Clinical Relevance
Wearable technology may represent the missing link to quantitatively addressing return to play and previous performance. WSDs are commercially available and portable adjuncts that allow clinicians, trainers, and individual athletes to monitor biomechanical parameters, workload, and recovery status to better contextualize personalized training, injury risk, and rehabilitation.}

Sanchen powder is a traditional Tibetan medicine comprising Bambusae Concretio Silicea, Carthami Flos, and Bovis Calculus Artifactus. Bambusae Concretio Silicea is the dried mass of secreted fluid in the stalks of Gramineae plants such as Bambusa textilis McClure or Schizostachyum chinense Rendle. Carthami Flos is the dried flower of Carthamus tinctorius L. in the Compositae plant. Bovis Calculus Artifactus is made from ox bile powder, cholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid, taurine, bilirubin, cholesterol, and trace elements. Research has evidenced the antibacterial efficacy of Sanchen powder, albeit its active constituents for this effect are yet to be established.
Aim of the study
To investigate effective compounds, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of Sanchen powder for its antibacterial properties by using network pharmacology combined with in vitro validation, with the aims of observing the action of effective compounds in Sanchen powder and exploring new therapeutic strategies for antibacterial.
Materials and methods
In this study, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was utilized to identify the chemical composition in Sanchen powder and its blood-borne chemical ingredients post-oral intake. A network pharmacology analysis was used to establish the chemical compound in the blood following oral administration-target-disease network. The study aimed to identify antibacterial active ingredients, which were then subjected to molecular docking and pharmacodynamic experiments to verify their efficacy.
Results
The findings demonstrate that following oral administration, the blood contains seven key components of Sanchen powder, including bilirubin, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, taurocholic acid, phenylalanine, safflomin A, and tryptophan. Additionally, the network pharmacology and molecular docking study results indicate the potential antibacterial effects of bilirubin, glycocholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid. In vitro antibacterial experiments revealed that bilirubin, glycocholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid could restrict the growth of the Staphylococcus aureus cell membrane at a certain concentration. Moreover, they exhibited antibacterial effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli.
Conclusions
Bilirubin, glycocholic acid, and glycochenodeoxycholic acid could be effective therapeutic ingredients for the antibacterial effects of Sanchen powder. These results offer a foundation for further clinical application and research on the antibacterial effect of Sanchen powder, a Traditional Tibetan Medicine.}

abstract = {Introduction
Neuropathic pain (NP) is a common form of chronic pain that severely affects patients' physical and mental health. The pathogenesis of NP is complex, with peripheral and central sensitization as the main mechanisms. Neuroinflammation mediated by peripheral glial cells (Schwann cells and satellite glial cells) and central glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) is the main factor driving peripheral sensitization and central sensitization. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can prevent and treat NP and is becoming a popular area of research for novel analgesics. However, the mechanism of TCM in treating NP by regulating glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation is unclear.
Methods
Online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, were searched using different keywords: “glial cells and neuropathic pain”, “traditional Chinese medicine and neuropathic pain”. The purpose of this review is to summarize the mechanism of TCM's anti-NP effect from the perspective of glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation.
Results
Neuroinflammation mediated by glial cells promotes the occurrence and development of NP. TCM can inhibit inflammatory responses mediated by glial cells mainly through inhibition of purinergic signaling, the MAPK pathway, the TLR pathway, the NF-κB pathway, and chemokine signaling, thereby alleviating NP.
Discussion
TCM is a valuable candidate for the treatment of NP. This review will provide a reference for further scientific development and application of anti-NP therapeutic drugs.}

TCMs, in “multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway” paradigm, show satisfactory clinical results in complex diseases. New ideas and methods are urgently needed to explain the complex interactions between TCMs and diseases. Network pharmacology (NP) provides a novel paradigm to uncover and visualize the underlying interaction networks of TCMs against multifactorial diseases. The development and application of NP has promoted the safety, efficacy, and mechanism investigations of TCMs, which then reinforces the credibility and popularity of TCMs. The current organ-centricity of medicine and the “one disease-one target-one drug” dogma obstruct the understanding of complex diseases and the development of effective drugs. Therefore, more attentions should be paid to shift from “phenotype and symptom” to “endotype and cause” in understanding and redefining current diseases. In the past two decades, with the advent of advanced and intelligent technologies (such as metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, single-cell omics, and artificial intelligence), NP has been improved and deeply implemented, and presented its great value and potential as the next drug-discovery paradigm. NP is developed to cure causal mechanisms instead of treating symptoms. This review briefly summarizes the recent research progress on NP application in TCMs for efficacy research, mechanism elucidation, target prediction, safety evaluation, drug repurposing, and drug design.}

However, there is tremendous heterogeneity among DME patients, and 30%–50% of DME patients do not respond well to anti-VEGF agents. In addition, there is no evidence-based and universally accepted administration regimen. The identification of DME patients not responding to anti-VEGF agents and the determination of the optimal administration interval are the 2 major challenges of DME, which are difficult to achieve with the coarse granularity of conventional health care modality. Therefore, more and more retina specialists have pointed out the necessity of introducing precision medicine into the management of DME and have conducted related studies in recent years. One of the most frontier methods is the targeted extraction of individualized disease features from optical coherence tomography images based on artificial intelligence technology, which provides precise evaluation and risk classification of DME. This review aims to provide an overview of the progress of artificial intelligence-enabled precision medicine in automated screening, precise evaluation, prognosis prediction, and follow-up monitoring of DME.

Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a central subunit of MCU complex that regulate the levels of calcium ions within mitochondria. A comprehensive understanding the implications of MCU in clinical prognostication, biological understandings and therapeutic opportunity of breast cancer (BC) is yet to be determined.
Objectives
This study aims to investigate the role of MCU in predictive performance, tumor progression, epigenetic regulation, shaping of tumor immune microenvironment, and pharmacogenetics and the development of anti-tumor therapy for BC.
Methods
The downloaded TCGA datasets were used to identify predictive ability of MCU expressions via supervised learning principle. Functional enrichment, mutation landscape, immunological profile, drug sensitivity were examined using bioinformatics analysis and confirmed by experiments exploiting human specimens, in vitro and in vivo models.
Results
MCU copy numbers increase with MCU gene expression. MCU expression, but not MCU genetic alterations, had a positive correlation with known BC prognostic markers. Higher MCU levels in BC showed modest efficacy in predicting overall survival. In addition, high MCU expression was associated with known BC prognostic markers and with malignancy. In BC tumor and sgRNA-treated cell lines, enrichment pathways identified the involvement of cell cycle and immunity. miR-29a was recognized as a negative epigenetic regulator of MCU. High MCU levels were associated with increased mutation levels in oncogene TP53 and tumor suppression gene CDH1, as well as with an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Sigle-cell sequencing indicated that MCU mostly mapped on to tumor cell and CD8 T-cells. Inter-databases verification further confirmed the aforementioned observation. miR-29a-mediated knockdown of MCU resulted in tumor suppression and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as diminished metastasis. Furthermore, MCU present pharmacogenetic significance in cellular docetaxel sensitivity and in prediction of patients’ response to chemotherapeutic regimen.
Conclusion
MCU shows significant implication in prognosis, outcome prediction, microenvironmental shaping and precision medicine for BC. miR-29a-mediated MCU inhibition exerts therapeutic effect in tumor growth and metastasis.}

While numerous studies have demonstrated the antibacterial and antiviral effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the potential of a complex mixture of traditional Chinese Medicine with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial property remains underexplored. This study aimed to develop a complex mixture of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), JY-1, and investigate its antimicrobial properties, along with its potential mechanism of action against pathogenic microorganisms. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using a zone of inhibition assay and the drop plate method. Hyphal induction of Candida albicans was conducted using RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS, followed by microscopic visualization. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was employed to quantify the transcript levels of hyphal-specific genes such as HWP1 and ALS3. The impact of JY-1 on biofilm formation was evaluated using both the XTT reduction assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the cell membrane integrity was assessed by protein and nucleic acid leakage assays. Our results clearly showed that JY-1 significantly inhibits the vegetative growth of Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp. In addition, this complex mixture is effectively against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. More interestingly, JY-1 plays a direct anti-viral role against the mammalian viral pathogen vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Further mechanistic studies indicate that JY-1 acts to reduce the expression of hyphal specific genes HWP1 and ALS3, resulting in the suppression of the hyphal formation of C. albicans. The antimicrobial property of JY-1 could be attributed to its ability to reduce biofilm formation and disrupt the cell membrane permeability, a process resulting in microbial cell death and the release of cellular contents. Taken together, our work identified a potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, a complex mixture of TCM which might be developed as a potential antimicrobial drug.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Criticisms have emerged that cancer medicines offer modest benefits at increasingly high prices. Reimbursement decisions made by health technology assessment (HTA) agencies have become a complex endeavour for cancer medicines. Most high-income countries (HICs) use HTA criteria to identify high-value medicines for reimbursement under public drug coverage plans. We compared HTA criteria specific for cancer medicines in economically similar HICs, to understand how these criteria contribute to reimbursement decisions.
Methods
We did an international, cross-sectional analysis in collaboration with author investigators across eight HICs, from the Group of Seven (known as G7; Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan) and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand). Publicly available data from HTA agency reports and official documentation were extracted and analysed between Aug 15, 2021, and July 31, 2022. We collected data pertaining to the decision-making criteria used by the national HTA agency; HTA reimbursement status for 34 medicine–indication pairs corresponding to 15 unique US top-selling cancer medicines; and HTA reimbursement status for 18 cancer medicine–indication pairs (13 unique medicines) with minimal clinical benefit (score of 1 on the European Society of Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale). Descriptive statistics were used to compare HTA decision criteria and drug reimbursement recommendations (or for Germany and Japan, final reimbursement status) across the eight countries.
Findings
Therapeutic impact related to clinical outcomes of the new medicine was a uniform criterion across the eight countries, whereas quality of evidence (under the remit of therapeutic impact assessment) and equity were infrequently cited criteria. Only the German HTA agency mandated that surrogate endpoints be validated in therapeutic impact assessment. All countries except Germany included formal cost-effectiveness analyses within HTA reports. England and Japan were the only countries that specified a cost-effectiveness threshold. Of the 34 medicine–indication pairs corresponding to US top-selling cancer medicines, Germany reimbursed the maximum (34 [100%]), followed by Italy (32 [94%] recommended for reimbursement), Japan (28 [82%] reimbursed), Australia, Canada, England, and France (27 [79%] recommended for reimbursement), and New Zealand (12 [35%] recommended for reimbursement). Of the 18 cancer medicine–indication pairs with marginal clinical benefit, Germany reimbursed 15 (83%) and Japan reimbursed 12 (67%). France recommended nine (50%) for reimbursement, followed by Italy (seven [39%]), Canada (five [28%]), and Australia and England (three [17%] each). New Zealand did not recommend any medicine–indications with marginal clinical benefit for reimbursement. Considering the overall cumulative proportion across the eight countries, 58 (21%) of 272 indications for the US top-selling medicines and 90 (63%) of 144 marginally beneficial medicine–indications were not recommended for reimbursement or reimbursed.
Interpretation
Our findings indicate discordance in public reimbursement decisions across economically similar countries, despite overlapping HTA decision criteria. This suggests a need for improved transparency around the nuances of the criteria to ensure improved access to high-value cancer medicines, and deprioritisation of low-value cancer medicines. Health systems have opportunities to improve their HTA decision-making processes by learning from the systems in other countries.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia and poses a serious threat to the health of the elderly. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) presents as a promising novel therapeutic therapy for preventing and treating dementia. Studies have shown that natural products derived from kidney-tonifying herbs can effectively inhibit AD. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a critical factor in the pathology of AD. Regulation of ER stress is a crucial approach to prevent and treat AD. Thus, in this study, we first collected kidney-tonifying herbs, integrated chemical ingredients from multiple TCM databases, and constructed a comprehensive drug-target network. Subsequently, we employed the endophenotype network (network proximity) method to identify potential active ingredients in kidney-tonifying herbs that prevented AD via regulating ER stress. By combining the predicted outcomes, we discovered that 32 natural products could ameliorate AD pathology via regulating ER stress. After a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-network model and systematic pharmacological analyses, we further selected several promising compounds for in vitro testing in the APP-SH-SY5Y cell model. Experimental results showed that echinacoside and danthron were able to effectively reduce ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the expression levels of BIP, p-PERK, ATF6, and CHOP in APP-SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, this study utilized the endophenotype network to preliminarily decipher the effective material basis and potential molecular mechanism of kidney-tonifying Chinese medicine for prevention and treatment of AD.}

abstract = {Background
Heart failure (HF) is the terminal stage of multiple cardiovascular diseases, with high mortality and morbidity. More and more studies have proved that gut microbiota may play a role in the process of HF, which is expected to become a new therapeutic target. The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine has vast therapeutic potential of complementation against HF.
Purpose
This manuscript expounds on the research progress of mechanisms of gut microbiota participating in the occurrence and prognosis of HF and the role of integrative traditional Chinese and Western medicine from 1987 to 2022. The combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the prevention and treatment of HF from the perspective of gut microbiota has been discussed.
Methods
Studies focusing on the effects and their mechanisms of gut microbiota in HF and the role of integrative traditional Chinese and Western medicine were identified and summarized, including contributions from February 1987 until August 2022. The investigation was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases up to April 2023 by using the relevant keywords and operators.
Results
A total of 34 articles were finally included in this review.16 RCTs and 13 basic researches, and 3 clinical research studies involving 7 relevant outcome indicators(cardiac function evaluation index, changes in gut microbiota, inflammatory factors, metabolites of gut microbiota, serum nutritional index protein, quality of life score, intestinal permeability and all-cause mortality). Compared with healthy controls, serum TNF-α and TMAO levels were significantly higher in patients with heart failure [MD = 5.77, 95%CI(4.97, 6.56), p < 0.0001; SMD = 1.92, 95%CI(1.70, 2.14), p < 0.0001]. Escherichia coli and Thick-walled bacteria increased significantly [SMD = -0.99, 95%CI(-1.38, -0.61), p < 0.0001, SMD = 2.58, 95%CI(2.23, 2.93), p < 0.0001];The number of bacteroides and lactobacillus decreased [SMD = -2.29, 95%CI(-2.54, -2.04), p < 0.0001; SMD = -1.55, 95%CI(-1.8, -1.3), p < 0.0001]. There was no difference in bifidobacterium [SMD = 0.16, 95%CI(-0.22, 0.54), p = 0.42]. In the published literature, it is not difficult to see that most of the results are studied and proved based on animal experiments or clinical trials, involving the cellular level, while the mechanism and mode of action of the molecular biology of traditional Chinese medicine are less elaborated, which is related to the characteristics of multi-components and multi-targets of traditional Chinese medicine. The above are the shortcomings of published literature, which can also be the direction of future research.
Conclusion
Heart failure patients have decreased beneficial bacteria such as Bacillus mimics and Lactobacillus in the intestinal flora and increased harmful flora like thick-walled flora. And increase the inflammatory response of the body and the expression of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) in the serum. And The prevention and treatment of integrative traditional Chinese and Western medicine against heart failure based on gut microbiota and its metabolites is a promising research direction.}

abstract = {Background
Ginkgo biloba L. preparations (GBLPs) are a class of Chinese herbal medicine used in the adjuvant treatment of ischemic stroke (IS). Recently, several systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) of GBLPs for IS have been published.
Objective
This overview aims to assess the quality of related SRs and MAs.
Search strategy
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese Biological Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Chinese Science and Technology Journals databases were searched from their inception to December 31, 2022.
Inclusion criteria
SRs and MAs of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that explored the efficacy of GBLPs for patients with IS were included.
Data extraction and analysis
Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the methodological quality, risk of bias (ROB), reporting quality, and credibility of evidence of the included SRs and MAs using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS), the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA), and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), respectively. Additionally, descriptive analysis and data synthesis were conducted.
Results
Twenty-nine SRs/MAs involving 119 outcomes were included in this review. The overall methodological quality of all SRs/MAs was critically low based on AMSTAR 2, and 28 had a high ROB based on the ROBIS. According to the PRISMA statement, the reporting items of the included SRs/MAs are relatively complete. The results based on GRADE showed that of the 119 outcomes, 8 were rated as moderate quality, 24 as low quality, and 87 as very low quality. Based on the data synthesis, GBLPs used in conjunction with conventional treatment were superior to conventional treatment alone for decreasing neurological function scores.
Conclusion
GBLPs can be considered a beneficial supplemental therapy for IS. However, because of the low quality of the existing evidence, high-quality RCTs and SRs/MAs are warranted to further evaluate the benefits of GBLPs for treating IS.

abstract = {Objective
To explore the value of ear morphological inspection in identifying the nine constitutions of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by analyzing the correlation between these two research objects.
Methods
A cross-sectional research design was employed. The participants' ear morphology was determined using the Ear Morphology Inspection Information Evaluation Form, while constitution was assessed using the Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire. Data were statistically analyzed, and one-way and multi-factor logistic regression analyses were conducted.
Results
Among 888 participants, 270 (30.41%) had a balanced constitution, and 618 (69.59%) had different biased constitution types. The analysis revealed that thick auricles (P < .05) and a moderately sized left earlobe (P = .010) were protective factors, while obtuse earlobes (P < .05) were risk factor for balanced constitution. Auricles close to the temple (P < .05) was a protective factor, while no Frank's sign in earlobes (P < .05) and obtuse earlobes (P < .05) were risk factors for qi-deficiency constitution. Clear structure of the helix (P < .05), no Frank's sign (P < .05), and a visible half left helix (P = .024) were risk factors, while auricles close to the temple (P < .05) and a triangular right ear apex (P = .029) were protective factors for phlegm-dampness constitution. No Frank's sign (P < .05) and moderate tragus shape (P < .05) were risk factors for qi stagnation constitution. Triangular ear apexes (P < .05), a left auricle close to the temple (P = .002), and moderate position of auricles (upper edge of the auricle levels with the top of eyebrows, P < .05) were protective factors for qi stagnation constitution.
Conclusion
A correlation between ear morphology and TCM constitutions may exist. Ear morphology may be used as reference values for the identification of TCM constitutions.}

As the treatment of diseases using HM is characterized by multi-components and multi-targets, it is difficult to determine the bio-active components, explore the molecular targets and reveal the mechanisms of action. Metabolomics is frequently used to characterize the effect of external disturbances on organisms because of its unique advantages on detecting changes in endogenous small-molecule metabolites. Its systematicity and integrity are consistent with the effective characteristics of HM. After HM intervention, metabolomics can accurately capture and describe the behavior of endogenous metabolites under the disturbance of functional compounds, which will be used to decode the bioactive ingredients of HM and expound the molecular targets. Metabolomics can provide an approach for explaining HM, addressing unclear clinical efficacy and undefined mechanisms of action. In this review, the metabolomics strategy and its applications in HM are systematically introduced, which offers valuable insights for metabolomics methods to characterizing the pharmacological effects and molecular targets of HM.}

We approach this subject through a dual perspective: one being a clinical data-focused approach that incorporates biomedical informatics with syntactic and semantic methods of interoperability (Garde et al., 2007; Strasberg et al., 2021), as well as human-interpretable decision algorithm and the other being a bottom-up approach rooted in genomics, biophysical and multiscale methods that increasingly employ robust yet human-opaque ML analytics (Lussier and Li, 2012). We conclude with an exploration of the remaining challenges, prospective opportunities, and future directions that arise at the confluence of these multifaceted methodologies inclusive of artificial intelligence and large language models in medicine (Shehab et al., 2022).}

abstract = {Background
Eunkyosan (EKS) and Samsoeum (SSE), which are called Yin qiao san and Shen su yin in Chinese, are commonly used herbal medicines for the common cold in East Asian countries. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EKS and SSE for treating the common cold.
Methods
A randomized, patient-assessor-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, and multicenter clinical trial was conducted. Adult participants who had one or more cold within 48 h before screening, were randomly allocated to EKS, SSE, or placebo groups. The recruitment goal was planned to be 375 participants. They took an EKS, SSE, or placebo, thrice daily for up to 8 days. The primary outcome was the change in the total score of the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Scale-21-Korean version (WURSS-21-K) on day 6 compared to the baseline. The secondary outcomes included visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the duration of symptoms was assessed throughout the trial.
Results
A total of 128 participants were enrolled and 44, 42, and 42 were allocated to the EKS, SSE, and placebo groups, respectively. This study was prematurely terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we were unable to recruit all the planned participants (n = 375). EKS showed significant clinical effectiveness over the placebo group in the treatment of the common cold, as assessed by the total, symptom, and quality of life scores of WURSS-21-K and VAS, whereas SSE showed significant improvement over the placebo group in terms of WURSS-21-K symptom score. No severe adverse events were reported.
Conclusions
Although EKS and SSE demonstrated statistically significant clinical effectiveness and safety in patients with the common cold, we failed to recruit our pre-planned number of participants. Future definitive full-scale studies are needed to confirm these results.

abstract = {Background and Objectives
The World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines has led to at least 137 national lists. Essential medicines should be grounded in evidence-based guideline recommendations and explicit decision criteria. Essential medicines should be available, accessible, affordable, and the supporting evidence should be accompanied by a rating of the certainty one can place in it. Our objectives were to identify criteria and considerations that should be addressed in moving from a guideline recommendation regarding a medicine to the decision of whether to add, maintain, or remove a medicine from an essential medicines list. We also seek to explore opportunities to improve organizational processes to support evidence-based health decision-making more broadly.
Methods
We conducted a qualitative study with semistructured interviews of key informant stakeholders in the development and use of guidelines and essential medicine lists (EMLs). We used an interpretive descriptive analysis approach and thematic analysis of interview transcripts in NVIVO v12.
Results
We interviewed 16 key informants working at national and global levels across all WHO regions. We identified five themes: three descriptive/explanatory themes 1) EMLs and guidelines, the same, but different; 2) EMLs can drive price reductions and improve affordability and access; 3) Time lag and disconnect between guidelines and EMLs; and two prescriptive themes 4) An “evidence pipeline” could improve coordination between guidelines and EMLs; 5) Facilitating the link between the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (WHO EML) and national EMLs could increase alignment.
Conclusion
We found significant overlap and opportunities for alignment between guideline and essential medicine decision processes. This finding presents opportunities for guideline and EML developers to enhance strategies for collaboration. Future research should assess and evaluate these strategies in practice to support the shared goal of guidelines and EMLs: improvements in health.}

In the last years, a number of studies have highlighted that relapse is often associated to specific genomic and non-genomic mechanisms of immune escape. In the present review, we will summarize current knowledge about these modalities of immune evasion, focusing in particular on mechanisms that leverage on antigen presentation and on pathologic rewiring of the bone marrow microenvironment. We will present examples of how this biological information can be translated into specific approaches to treat relapse, discuss the status of the clinical trials for patients who relapsed after transplant, and show how dissecting the complex immunobiology of allo-HCT represents a crucial step to develop new personalized approaches to improve clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Previous studies have shown that the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) called “compound healthy ear agent” (CHEA) had anti-apoptosis effects in cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons, and could protect mice hearing against presbycusis or age-related hearing loss (AHL), as well as aminoglycoside antibiotic-induced ototoxicity. Because its mechanisms of action are still unclear, we investigated the mechanism of action of CHEA against AHL in mice using proteomics techniques.
Methods
Eighteen C57BL/6J mice at 1 month of age were randomly divided into three groups: (A) drinking water until 2 months of age, K2M); (B) drinking water until 7 months of age to induce AHL, K7M; (C) drinking water containing CHEA daily until 7 months of age as treatment group, Z7M. At 2 or 7 months mice were sacrificed and their cochleae were removed for proteomics analysis.
Results
The numbers of proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% were respectively 5873 for qualitative and 5492 for quantitative statistics. The numbers of proteins with differential enrichment at least 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) were respectively 351 for K7M vs K2M groups, 52 for Z7M vs K7M groups, 264 for Z7M vs K2M groups. The differentially expressed proteins in the Z7M group were involved in synaptic molecular transmission, energy metabolism, immune response, antioxidant defenses, and anti-apoptosis.
Conclusion
The TCM CHEA played a protective role against AHL in mice by regulating the expression of specific proteins and genes in cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Besides the pathways expected to be involved (antioxidant and anti-apoptosis), proteins related to immune response is a new finding of the present study.}

abstract = {Context
Despite clinical benefits of early palliative care, little is known about Medicare physician workforce specialized in Hospice and Palliative Medicine (HPM) and their service delivery settings.
Objectives
To examine changes in Medicare HPM physician workforce and their service delivery settings in 2008–2020.
Methods
Using the Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty from 2008 to 2020, we identified 2375 unique Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) physicians (15,565 physician-year observations) with self-reported specialty in “Palliative Care and Hospice”. We examined changes in the annual number of HPM physicians, average number of Medicare services overall and by care setting, total number of Medicare FFS beneficiaries, and total Medicare allowed charges billed by the physician.
Results
The number of Medicare HPM physicians increased 2.32 times from 771 in 2008 to 1790 in 2020. The percent of HPM physicians practicing in metropolitan areas increased from 90% to 96% in 2008–2020. Faster growth was also observed in female physicians (52.4% to 60.1%). Between 2008 and 2020, we observed decreased average annual Medicare FFS beneficiaries (170 to 123), number of FFS services (467 to 335), and Medicare allowed charges billed by the physician ($47,230 to $37,323). The share of palliative care delivered in inpatient settings increased from 47% to 68% in 2008–2020; whereas the share of services delivered in outpatient settings decreased from 37% to 19%.
Conclusion
Despite growth in Medicare HPM physician workforce, access is disproportionately concentrated in metropolitan and inpatient settings. This may limit receipt of early outpatient specialized palliative care, especially in nonmetropolitan areas.}

abstract = {Background
Xiaoyao pills (XYP) is a commercial Chinese patent medicine used in the treatment of depression. However, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects, as well as the patients who can benefit from XYP, have not been evaluated so far.
Objectives
To this end, we conducted a double-blinded, random, and placebo-controlled clinical trial of orally administered XYP in patients with depression.
Methods
The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) scores were recorded at baseline, and every 2 weeks after the start of treatment. To further elucidate the epigenetic mechanism of XYP, we performed mRNA sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing using peripheral blood leukocytes of patients and healthy.
Results
XYP effectively alleviated the symptoms in patients with mild or moderate depressive disorders, particularly that of psychomotor retardation. XYP restored aberrant gene expression and DNA methylation patterns associated with depression, and the normalization of DNA methylation correlated with downregulation of several genes. In addition, altered DNA methylation levels in the XYP-treated samples were attributed to increased expression of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1.
Conclusions
Our study provides new insights into the epigenetic mechanism underlying depression and the therapeutic effects of XYP, along with an experimental basis for using XYP in the treatment of depression.

abstract = {Objective
Public health medicine specialists have unique roles in disaster risk management through prevention, preparedness, response and recovery for all kinds of disasters. A well structured and designed “disaster medicine training curriculum” would improve the efficacy and quality of playing these forementioned roles. In this study, it was aimed to determine the disaster medicine curriculum topics which should be addressed in public health medicine specialty education and training in Türkiye.
Methods
All faculty members from public health departments of medical faculties in Türkiye (238 experts) were invited to a three round Delphi study aiming to evaluate disaster medicine topics of the curriculum prepared by the International Society of Disaster Medicine (ISDM) as it is the most comprehensive curriculum ever developed. All items were rated by using a seven-point Likert scale in consecutive online questionnaires. The final consensus was determined at the end of the third round according to the consensus criteria.
Findings
The response rate for the first round was 37.8% (90 experts), with a dropout of 34.4% (59 experts) and 35.5% (38 experts) for the following rounds. For the “Medical Care” division, 35.3% of items were agreed to be included in the curriculum, while this rate was 93.2% for “Disaster Management” division, 100.0% for “Public Health” and “Education and Training in Disaster Medicine” divisions. Among all, 62.5% of items reached consensus to be included in the curriculum.
Conclusion
In the end of three rounds, disaster medicine topics were evaluated with a public health perspective and the curriculum was enriched with original contributions from the experts. This agreed national curriculum for the major workforce of public health services in the country will strengthen the health workforce capacity for building disaster resilient communities and health services.}

The need to stem poor lifestyle habits has led to the development of a new field of Lifestyle Medicine, whose mission is to prevent, treat, and even reverse chronic diseases through lifestyle interventions. Three fields within Cardiology relate to this mission: Cardiac Rehabilitation, Preventive Cardiology, and Behavioral Cardiology. Each of these three fields have contributed substantially to the reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The historic contributions of these three cardiac fields are reviewed as well as the challenges each of these fields has faced in optimizing the application of lifestyle medicine practices. A shared agenda between Cardiology and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine could further the utilization of behavioral interventions. This review suggests seven steps that could be shared by these organizations and other medical societies. First, there is a need to develop and promulgate the assessment of lifestyle factors as “vital signs” during patient visits. Second, developing a strong partnership between the fields of Cardiology and Physiatry could improve important aspects of cardiac care, including a potential redesign of cardiac stress testing. Third, behavioral evaluations should be optimized at patients' entrée points into medical care since these may be considered “windows of opportunity”. Fourth, there is a need to broaden cardiac rehabilitation into inexpensive programs and make this program eligible for patients with risk factors but no known CVD. Fifth, lifestyle medicine education should be integrated into the core competencies for relevant specialties. Sixth, there is a need for inter-societal advocacy to promote lifestyle medicine practices. Seventh, the well-being effects of healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as their impact on one's sense of vitality, should be emphasized.}

This study proposes a novel approach to monitor the prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) by selecting nine medicines to serve as biomarkers, including three antipyretics, three antivirals, and three cough suppressants. To verify our approach, wastewater samples were collected from seventeen urban and five rural wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in a Chinese city over a period of one year. The use of antipyretics increased notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the consumption of antivirals for influenza A (H1N1) rose in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period, indicating a minor spike in the occurrence of influenza A (H1N1) after the COVID-19 pandemic. Fever is a significant symptom of COVID-19 and can serve as a reliable indicator of disease prevalence. Our research found that the prevalence of COVID-19 in urban areas was significantly higher (at 78.5 %, 95 % CI: 73.4 % - 83.9 %) than in rural areas (with a prevalence of 48.1 %, 95 % CI: 42.4 % - 53.8 %). The prevalence of COVID-19 in urban areas in this study was consistent with the data reported by the Chinese center for Disease Control and Prevention (82.4 %). Continuous monitoring of WWTPs in urban areas with fluctuating populations and complex demographics can provide early disease warning. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of evaluating community disease prevalence by selecting major therapeutic medicines as biomarkers in wastewater.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore the efficacy of long-term traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment on the occurrence of extra-articular lesions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
Methods
Our retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with RA between January 2018 to December 2019. Patients were divided into TCM treatment group and control group according to whether they received TCM treatment for more than three months. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance covariates between groups. The occurrence time of extra-articular lesions, including interstitial lung disease, Sjögren's syndrome, and anemia, was calculated for both groups after PSM. Additionally, clinical indicators that may affect the occurrence of extra-articular lesions in RA were included in Cox multivariate regression analysis to explore prognostic factors related to RA.
Results
A total of 883 RA patients were initially included in our study, with 481 in the TCM treatment group and 279 in the control group. TCM treatment improved all clinical indicators of RA patients, and there was a higher degree of support, confidence, and lift between TCM treatment and the improvement of clinical indicators. There was no significant difference in the rate of extra-articular lesions occurrence between the two groups. After PSM, the median occurrence time of interstitial lung disease, Sjögren's syndrome and anemia in the TCM treatment group were 30.767, 21.370 and 31.970 months, respectively. While in the control group, it was 15.911, 14.667 and 11.825 months, respectively. Cox multivariate regression analysis indicated that TCM treatment was a protective factor for the occurrence of extra-articular lesions in RA, while abnormally high level of IgG was an independent factor for interstitial lung disease and C4 was an independent factor for Sjögren's syndrome. Moreover, a longer duration of TCM usage was associated with a later occurrence of extra-articular lesions.
Conclusion
Long-term TCM treatment not only positively affects the occurrence time of extra-articular lesions in RA patients, but also helps reduce the risk of extra-articular lesions occurrence. TCM can be applied flexibly throughout the treatment process for RA patients.}

Acute tonsillitis (including tonsillopharyngitis) in childhood is a common disease with a peak of illness in school-age. Most of these cases have a viral origin and antibiotic therapy is not indicated, therefore, effective symptomatic therapy is required. For this reason, complementary, alternative and integrative medicine therapies might be a solution.
Objective
The aim of this review is to demonstrate study status of such therapies.
Methods
The databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, OVID, CAMbase, CAM-QUEST® and Anthromedics were systematically screened for studies investigating complementary, alternative and integrative therapy approaches in paediatric cohorts. Studies were analyzed by therapy approach, study design, cohort and outcome, using the PRISMA 2020 checklist.
Results
The systematic literature search resulted in 321 articles. Five publications corresponded to the search criteria and were assigned to the following specific therapeutic categories: herbal medicine (3), homeopathy (1) and ayurvedic medicine (1). Clinical trials were found for the herbal compounds BNO 1030 (Impupret®) and EPs® 7630 (Umckaloabo), the homeopathic complex Tonzolyt® and the ayurvedic medicine Kanchnara-Guggulu and Pratisarana of Tankana‑Madhu. Antimicrobial effects of essential oils and carvacrol as single agents as well as in combination with erythromycin were analysed in an in vitro study.
Conclusion
Clinical studies indicate an improvement of symptoms and a good tolerability of all investigated remedies of complementary, alternative and integrative medicine in the treatment of tonsillitis in childhood. Nevertheless, quality and quantity of the studies were insufficient to make a reliable conclusion regarding effectiveness. Therefore, more clinical trials are urgently needed to achieve a meaningful result.}

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has emerged as a global epidemic, and conventional treatment approaches often face limitations in achieving long-term glycemic control and preventing complications. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a valuable alternative for managing T2D, with a long history of effectively using herbal formulations in clinical practice. However, the modular characteristics of these herbs and their specific mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. To comprehensively investigate the modular characteristics and mechanisms of Chinese herbs in treating T2D, as well as explore the synergistic interactions among different herbs and their modular components, we employed data mining, systematic pharmacology, and molecular docking. Our aim was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential therapeutic targets and pathways involved in herbal T2D treatment. In this study, a total of 1114 studies investigating the effects of TCM interventions in the treatment of T2D in adults were included. The analysis revealed 170 distinct types of Chinese herbs, 118 active components, and 238 common targets shared between the medicine and T2D. Additionally, this study identified six hub proteins (TNF, MMP2, PTGS, CASP3, CASP8, and CASP9) and two key chemicals (Diosgenin and Formononetin) found in TCM-mediated T2D suppression. It was observed that these proteins could bind with the ingredients. The MMP2-Diosgenin interaction exhibited the lowest binding free energy (−13.05 kJ/mol) and was primarily driven by hydrogen bonds with ALA-165. TNF-Diosgenin (−10.5 kcal/mol) showed three hydrogen bonds with LEU-37, ARG-82, and ASN-30. PTGS2 and Diosgenin (−8.71 kJ/mol) demonstrated a hydrogen bond with HIS-214. Furthermore, CASP9-Formononetin (−6.53 kcal/mol) exhibited the lowest binding free energy and hydrogen bonds with GLU-261 and SER-339 as the primary forces involved. CASP3-Formononetin (−6.07 kcal/mol) displayed three hydrogen bonds with ASN-342, TRP-348, and GLU-379. Lastly, CASP8 and Formononetin (−6.06 kJ/mol) formed a hydrogen bond with THR-390, TYR-392, and TYR-334. Moreover, critical therapeutic pathways, such as the immune inflammatory response, AGE-RAGE, and IL-17 signaling pathway, were found to be associated with T2D Chinese herb therapy. In conclusion, this study sheded light on the modular characteristics and mechanism of action of herbs used in Chinese Medicine for the treatment of T2D, which provided valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the field of Chinese Medicine, offering potential avenues for improved treatment strategies and personalized approaches to address the complex nature of T2D.}

Clinical practices have shown that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment can improve the quality of life of patients with advanced lung cancer and prolong the postoperative survival time. However, the mechanism of the synergistic effect of Chinese medicine and cryotherapy, and the optimal treatment plan have not been clarified so far. Therefore, the effect of TCM particles on ice crystal growth and phase transition during cooling was investigated. In addition, we explored the optimized concentration and combination treatment sequence of TCM (lung care formula) and validated the optimal treatment protocol by establishing a mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Traditional herbal medicine (THM) has a long history of promoting wound healing, making them culturally accepted and trusted by a great number of people in the world. However, for a long time, the understanding of herbal medicine has been limited and incomplete, particularly in the allopathic medicine-dominated research system. The therapeutic effects of individual components isolated from THM are found less pronounced compared to synthetic chemical medicine, and the clinical efficacy is always inferior to herbs. In the present article, we review and discuss underlying mechanisms of the skin microbiome involved in the wound healing process; THM in regulating immune responses and commensal microbiome. We additionally propose few pioneer ideas and studies in the development of therapeutic strategies for controlled delivery of herbal medicine. This review aims to promote wound care with a focus on wound microbiome, immune response, and topical drug delivery systems. Finally, future development trends, challenges, and research directions are discussed.}

abstract = {Purpose
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic disease that affects 1%–6% of children. Our study aims to explore the effectiveness and clinical characteristics of integrative Traditional Chinese Medicine (ITCM) for pediatric OSA.
Materials and methods
In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed differences of polysomnography (PSG) parameters and clinical characteristics between 2009 and 2020. Children <12 years old diagnosed with OSA (n = 508) were included and were categorized into ITCM cohort, western medicine (WM) cohort ,and surgery cohort. Outcomes were apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), and body mass index (BMI).
Results
There were 56 (11%), 324 (63.8%), and 128 (25.2%) patients in the ITCM, WM, and surgery cohorts. Among 17, 26, and 33 patients in the ITCM, WM, and surgery cohorts underwent follow-up PSG studies, respectively. In the ITCM follow-up cohort, AHI were significantly reduced (9.59 to 5.71, p < 0.05). BMI significantly increased in the WM follow-up cohort (19.46 to 20.50, p < 0.05) and the surgery follow-up cohort (18.04 to 18.85, p < 0.01). Comparing ITCM to WM cohort, a significant difference was found between the changes in RDI (ITCM: −6.78, WM: 0.51, p < 0.05) after treatment. Among ITCM follow-up cohort, the most prescribed TCM formula was Forsythia and Laminaria Combination. The most prescribed TCM herb was Ephedrae Herba.
Conclusions
ITCM therapy can significantly reduce RDI and control BMI. We identified potential TCM treatments for pediatric OSA. Further study of the pharmacological mechanisms and clinical efficacy is warranted.}

The need to assess and protect the nervous system demands enhancement of biomarker development and the application of precision medicine approaches. Although strategies for safety assessment and precision medicine to protect the nervous system have been evolving over many years, each new approach needs to be rigorously evaluated to determine its readiness for incorporation into the assessment process. Although some of the experimental approaches reviewed here including imaging, omics, behavioral assessment, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) have been proposed and/or incorporated into routine nervous system assessment, many of them will require more evaluation before regulatory acceptance. Critical features of these new approaches including reproducibility, reliability and robustness will need to be validated. To expedite this validation process, it is recommended that a teamwork approach including product developers, academic researchers, and regulators provide biomarker and precision medicine strategies to protect the nervous system.}

To investigate the current evidence on traditional medicine in managing bruxism and its clinical efficacy.
Methods
A search was conducted in nine databases to identify potential eligible articles published from the date of inception until August 3, 2022. All clinical studies that used traditional medicine of any type in treating bruxism were eligible for inclusion. Two authors performed data extraction and quality assessments independently. Retrieved data were tabulated and discussed narratively.
Results
A total of 16 clinical studies were included in this scoping review. Of the 16 studies, three studies were randomized controlled trials, one was a case–control study, 10 were case series, and two were case reports. Our review identified studies of interventions based on herbal medicine and acupuncture-related therapies. Most studies reported positive results, but the overall quality of the included studies was typically fair to poor.
Conclusions
This study is the first scoping review on traditional medicine for bruxism despite the limited evidence. More research on traditional medicine in bruxism management should be conducted for better clarification and application in daily practice.}

abstract = {Background
Medication counselling provided by pharmacists is important for ensuring the safe use of medicines.
Objective
To assess the quality of non-prescription medicines counselling in Finnish pharmacies.
Methods
Three scenarios using simulated patient methodology were conducted: the patient requesting a specific brand name Burana® (ibuprofen, OTC medicine), Pronaxen® (naproxen, behind-the-counter (BTC) medicine) and a nasal spray. The visits were conducted in 146 pharmacies by trained simulated patients. Each pharmacy was visited twice. The quality of counselling was defined as poor (1–2 points), moderate (3–4 points), or high (5–6 points) based on developed scenario-based scoring criteria.
Results
The total number of conducted visits was 292, of which only 29 received high quality counselling. The quality was high in 20% of the cases for Pronaxen® and in 7% of the cases for Nasal spray scenarios. In the Burana® scenario, counselling quality was high only in 2% of the cases. Patients who requested a nasal spray were often asked questions about their symptoms (93%). In the Pronaxen®-scenario, the most frequently asked questions were related to contraindications and drug interactions (56%). The most often given instructions varied between the scenarios, being follow-up in the Burana® and Nasal spray scenarios (17% and 70%, respectively) and how to use the medicine in the Pronaxen®-scenario (63%).
Conclusions
Non-prescription medicine counselling is rarely performed with high quality. However, the quality of counselling depends on the medication in question. There is room to improve medication counselling and the assessment of the necessity and suitability of treatment, especially when a patient requests an OTC pain medicine by its brand name.}

The most obvious diagnosis is the most likely and should be addressed first. Ockham’s razor, or parsimonious medicine, should be applied because plurality of diagnoses is less likely than a single explanation. Component-resolved diagnostics and biological therapies for allergy/immune-mediated diseases have been highly effective when used by specialist allergy services. However, they are accessed too easily and frequently, either before diagnostically appropriate allergy skin testing and challenge have been employed or before the reasons for poor disease control have been investigated. The current fashion to test for vitamin D insufficiency in patients with poorly controlled allergic diseases has rarely achieved benefit but significantly increased costs. There are considerable health/economic benefits from following the proven value of a thorough clinical history, examination, focused allergy/immunology testing, and the judicious use of Ockham’s razor.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore the current status and development trend of research on external therapies in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for insomnia over the past 10 years through bibliometrics and visual analysis, to provide references for further research on the topic.
Methods
Literature relating to TCM external therapies for insomnia from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2021 was retrieved from Chinese databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) for English articles. CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, and NoteExpress software were used to analyze publication volumes of the papers and how they were distributed in different journals, as well as to visualize the data of the countries, authors, institutions, and keywords.
Results
A total of 6 085 papers were obtained, of which 5 592 were from the Chinese databases and 493 were from the English database, with their publication volumes growing steadily year on year. Approximately 45 countries and regions were found to have published research on the topic. In terms of Chinese publications, the author with the most papers published was CHEN Yunfei from Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The closest collaboration was between LIU Chengyong from the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine and YUE Zenghui from Hunan University of Chinese Medicine. In terms of English publications, the author with the most papers published was MAO Junj from Sloan-Kettering Cancer Research Center, USA, and LAO Lixing from the University of Hong Kong was his closest partner in collaboration. Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine was the institution with the most Chinese publications, and Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine was the one with the most English papers published. Studies on the topic were published in 386 Chinese journals and 205 English journals, respectively. Nowadays, the clinical application of TCM external treatments for insomnia, the selection of meridians and acupoints, therapies for insomnia and its related diseases are research hotspots. The combined use of different TCM external therapies is a trend in the treatment of insomnia and its concomitant diseases, especially in the fields of oncology, nursing, and psychiatric disorders. The exploration of mechanisms of TCM external therapies for insomnia is also a key direction for future research. In clinical practice, the commonly used external therapies for insomnia include acupuncture, ear-acupressure with beans, acupoint application, etc. The commonly selected acupoints are auricular points, Sishencong (EX-HN1), Shenmen (HT7), etc. The frequently studied meridians are Ren, Du, Qiao, etc. The insomnia concomitant diseases are depression, stroke, anxiety, etc.
Conclusion
A wealth of research results have been accumulated in the treatment of insomnia by TCM external therapies, but authoritative research results are not so many. Therefore, institutions in different countries should strengthen communications and cooperation, and researchers should be encouraged to make innovations and breakthroughs on the basis of inherited TCM external therapies, so as to produce more valuable research results and improve TCM external therapies for providing better treatments for patients with sleep disorders.}

Scholars have argued the need for critical discussions about some of the assumptions underlying the gender minority stress model and how it has been used and discussed. Drawing on a pluralistic understanding of theories and employing a Foucauldian understanding of critique, we discuss implicit assumptions and epistemological standpoints of the gender minority stress model and the connected limitations. We also ask what the concept of cisnormativity can give rise to in comparison with the minority stress framework. We make four arguments: 1) the calls for extensions to the model could be seen as a desire to understand and analyse TGD people's health from an all-encompassing perspective, resulting in theoretical vagueness and the silencing of excluded aspects; 2) in the gender minority stress literature, identity is largely taken for granted and there is no consideration of how power is constitutive for all subjects; 3) the model risks individualising the effects of social norms, and internalisation could be further theoretically developed in relation to the repression hypothesis; 4) in the translation process from LGB minorities to TGD, as well as in thinking about cisnormativity, the issue of gender-affirming care has largely been neglected. By initiating a critical discussion around these issues and illustrating how different theories and frameworks can illuminate different possibilities for thinking and knowing, we aim to open up new routes for thinking about TGD health and medicine.}

The active components against COVID-19 were screened by molecular docking with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and angiotensin-converting enzyme II as targets. Furthermore, the common target dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of diabetes and COVID-19 was used as a screening protein, and molecular docking was used to obtain potential components for the treatment of diabetes and COVID-19. Finally, the mechanism of potential ingredients in the treatment of diabetes and COVID-19 was explored with bioinformatics. More than 80 kinds of Miao medicine were obtained, and 584 compounds were obtained. Further, 110 compounds against COVID-19 were screened, and top 6 potential ingredients for the treatment of diabetes and COVID-19 were screened, including 3-O-β-D-Xylopyranosyl-(1-6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl oleanolic acid 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester, Glycyrrhizic acid, Sequoiaflavone, 2-O-Caffeoyl maslinic acid, Pholidotin, and Ambewelamide A. Bioinformatics analysis found that their mechanism of action in treating diabetes and COVID-19 may be related to regulating the expression of DPP4, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, vitamin D receptor, plasminogen, chemokine C–C-motif receptor 6, and interleukin 2. We believe that Guizhou Miao medicine is rich in potential ingredients for the treatment of diabetes and COVID-19.}

abstract = {Background
Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) bath is commonly used in China as an adjuvant therapy for managing psoriasis vulgaris. Previous systematic reviews showed that CHM bath therapy was effective and safe for psoriasis vulgaris, however, without exploration of the specifics of CHM bath therapy such as the optimal temperature, duration of each session, and the total treatment duration.
Purpose
To evaluate the add-on effects of CHM bath therapy to conventional therapies for adult psoriasis vulgaris.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search in nine medical databases from inception to September 2022 to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in Chinese or English. The included studies compared the combination of CHM bath therapy and conventional therapies to conventional therapies alone for adult psoriasis vulgaris. Methodological quality assessment of the included RCTs was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2 (RoB 2). Statistical analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.4, R 4.2.3 and Stata 12.0 software. The certainty of evidence of outcome measures was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) system.
Results
A total of 23 RCTs involving 2,183 participants were included in this systematic review. Findings suggested that the combination of CHM bath therapy and conventional therapies was more effective in reducing Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and itch visual analogue scale, compared to using conventional therapies alone. These enhanced effects were notably observed when the CHM bath was set above 38 °C and had a duration of 20 and 30 min, as assessed by DLQI. Moreover, an eight-week treatment duration resulted in better effects for PASI compared to shorter durations. Additionally, the top ten frequently used herbs in the included studies were identified. Despite the findings, the certainty of evidence was rated as ‘low’ or ‘moderate’ based on the GRADE assessment, and significant heterogeneity was detected in subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
Conclusion
The CHM bath therapy combined with conventional therapies is more effective and safer than conventional therapies alone for adult psoriasis vulgaris. The results suggest a potential correlation between treatment effects and factors such as extended treatment duration, increased bath temperature, and longer bath sessions. However, the certainty of evidence was downgraded due to methodological limitations of the included studies. To confirm the findings of this systematic review, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCT is needed in the future.}

This study aims to explore patients’ with acute myeloid leukemia perceptions about precision medicine and their preferences for involvement in this new area of shared decision-making.
Methods
Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted in Finland, Italy and Germany (n = 16). The study population included patients aged 24–79 years. Interviews were analyzed with thematic content analysis.
Results
Patient’s perceived lack of knowledge as a barrier for their involvement in decision-making. Treatment decisions were often made rapidly based on the patient’s intuition and trust for the physician rather than on information, in situations that decrease the patient’s decision capacity. The patients emphasized that they are in a desperate situation that makes them willing to accept treatment with low probabilities of being cured.
Conclusions
The study raised important issues regarding patients’ understanding of precision medicine and challenges concerning how to involve patients in medical decision-making. Although technical advances were viewed positively, the role of the physician as an expert and person-of-trust cannot be replaced.
Practice implications
Regardless of patients’ preferences for involvement in decision-making, information plays a crucial role for patients’ perceived involvement in their care. The concepts related to precision medicine are complex and will imply challenges to patient education.}

abstract = {Introduction
In order to establish the role of Korean Medicine in the field of occupational medicine, basic research on its use by occupation is necessary. This study aimed to identify who uses Korean Medicine and whether this depends on occupation.
Methods
The Korea Health Panel (2016) based on census data was used to extract information on 14,260 individuals regarding their occupation, household income, health status, quality of life, and medical utilization. The two dependent variables were whether Korean Medicine was used and the medical expenses incurred by Korean Medicine use. Logistic regression and generalized linear models were used for analysis. The independent variables, along with occupation, were identified as predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need factors based on Andersen's behavioral model.
Results
Logistic regression analysis determined that the use of Korean Medicine by office workers, experts, and managers was significantly higher than that by those classified as ‘economically inactive’ (OR = 1.23). In the generalized linear model analysis, the average expenditure on Korean Medicine for ‘office workers, experts, and managers' was significantly higher, by $43.12 per year, than that for those classified as ‘economically inactive.’
Conclusions
The results of this study demonstrated that the probability of using Korean Medicine and medical expenses vary by occupational level. However, it is unclear whether this result is due to different availability and geographical accessibility for each job. Studies on the utilization of Korean Medicine are needed to further assess its application and use in occupational medicine.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to examine the performance of early warning scoring systems regarding adverse events of unanticipated clinical deterioration in complementary and alternative medicine hospitals.
Methods
A medical record review of 500 patients from 5-year patient data in two traditional Korean medicine hospitals was conducted. Unanticipated clinical deterioration events included unexpected in-hospital mortality, cardiac arrest, and unplanned transfers to acute-care conventional medicine hospitals. Scores of the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were calculated. Their performance was evaluated by calculating areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the event occurrence. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with event occurrence.
Results
The incidence of unanticipated clinical deterioration events was 1.1% (225/21101). The area under the curve of MEWS, NEWS, and NEWS2 was .68, .72, and .72 at 24 hours before the events, respectively. NEWS and NEWS2, with almost the same performance, were superior to MEWS (p = .009). After adjusting for other variables, patients at low-medium risk (OR = 3.28; 95% CI = 1.02–10.55) and those at medium and high risk (OR = 25.03; 95% CI = 2.78–225.46) on NEWS2 scores were more likely to experience unanticipated clinical deterioration than those at low risk. Other factors associated with the event occurrence included frailty risk scores, clinical worry scores, primary medical diagnosis, prescribed medicine administration, acupuncture treatment, and clinical department.
Conclusions
The three early warning scores demonstrated moderate-to-fair performance for clinical deterioration events. NEWS2 can be used for early identification of patients at high risk of deterioration in complementary and alternative medicine hospitals. Additionally, patient, care, and system factors need to be considered to improve patient safety.}

Implants such as suture anchors, interference screws, and endo-buttons are commonly used in these procedures. However, traditional implants made of metal or inert materials are not absorbable, leading to complications that affect treatment outcomes. To address this issue, absorbable materials with excellent mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, and controlled degradation rates have been developed and applied in clinical practice. These materials include absorbable polymers, absorbable bioceramics, and absorbable metals. In this paper, we will provide a comprehensive summary of these absorbable materials from the perspective of clinicians, and discuss their clinical applications and related research in sport medicine.}

abstract = {Diagnosis and management of fungal infections are challenging in both animals and humans, especially in immunologically weakened hosts. Due to its broad spectrum and safety profile when compared to other antifungals, itraconazole (ITZ) has been widely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections, both in human and veterinary medicine. The dose and duration of management depend on factors such as the type of fungal pathogen, the site of infection, sensitivity to ITZ, chronic stages of the disease, the health status of the hosts, pharmacological interactions with other medications and the therapeutic protocol used. In veterinary practice, ITZ doses generally vary between 3 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, once or twice a day. In humans, doses usually vary between 100 and 400 mg/day. As human and veterinary fungal infections are increasingly associated, and ITZ is one of the main medications used, this review addresses relevant aspects related to the use of this drug in both clinics, including case reports and different clinical aspects available in the literature.}

Fear of cancer recurrence is a significant psychosocial concern impacting the recovery and quality of life of cancer survivors. Many survivors turn to complementary and alternative medicine to manage drug side effects and alleviate anxiety and fear of cancer recurrence. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the use of complementary and alternative medicine and the fear of cancer recurrence in cancer survivors.
Methods
This cross-sectional descriptive correlational study involved 280 cancer survivors selected through convenience sampling from oncology centers and medical offices in Kerman. Research instruments included a questionnaire on complementary and alternative medicine usage and the fear of cancer recurrence inventory. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.
Results
The study revealed that 78.2% of participants had used at least one form of complementary and alternative medicine in the past year. Among these, 71.8% used medicinal herbs, 19.6% used nutritional supplements, 7.5% practiced relaxation and meditation, 7.1% utilized dry cupping, and 5.7% tried wet cupping. The mean score for the fear of cancer recurrence was 80.72 ± 18.46, which was close to the midpoint of the inventory score (84). Notably, fear of cancer recurrence and its associated dimensions did not exhibit significant differences between users and non-users of complementary and alternative medicine.
Conclusions
The results indicate that a substantial number of cancer survivors have utilized at least one form of complementary and alternative medicine in the past year, with medicinal herbs and nutritional supplements being the most common choices. It is essential for cancer patients to be informed about the potential effects of various complementary and alternative medicine approaches. The study found a moderate level of fear of cancer recurrence, with no discernible difference between users and non-users of complementary and alternative medicine. As a result, health managers and planners should implement effective psychological interventions and strategies to mitigate the fear of cancer recurrence among cancer survivors.}

abstract = {Background
Safety and toxicity have become major challenges in the internationalization of Chinese medicine. Inspite of its wide application, security problems of Chinese medicine still occur from time to time, raising widespread concerns about its safety. Most of the studies either only partially discussed the intrinsic toxicities or extrinsic harmful residues in Chinese medicine, or briefly described detoxification and attenuation methods. It is necessary to systematically discuss Chinese medicine's extrinsic and intrinsic toxic components and corresponding toxicity detoxification or detection methods as a whole.
Purpose
This review comprehensively summarizes various toxic components in Chinese medicine from intrinsic and extrinsic. Then the corresponding methods for detoxification or detection of toxicity are highlighted. It is expected to provide a reference for safeguards for developing and using Chinese medicine.
Methods
A literature search was conducted in the databases, including PubMed, Web of Science,Wan-fang database, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Keywords used were safety, toxicity, intrinsic toxicities, extrinsic harmful residues, alkaloids, terpene and macrolides, saponins, toxic proteins, toxic crystals, minerals, heavy metals, pesticides, mycotoxins, sulfur dioxide, detoxification, detection, processing (Paozhi), compatibility (Peiwu), Chinese medicine, etc., and combinations of these keywords. All selected articles were from 2006 to 2022, and each was assessed critically for our exclusion criteria. Studies describe the classification of toxic components of Chinese medicine, the toxic effects and mechanisms of Chinese medicine, and the corresponding methods for detoxification or detection of toxicity.
Results
The toxic components of Chinese medicines can be classified as intrinsic toxicities and extrinsic harmful residues. Firstly, we summarized the intrinsic toxicities of Chinese medicine, the adverse effects and toxicity mechanisms caused by these components. Next, we focused on the detoxification or attenuation methods for intrinsic toxicities of Chinese medicine. The other main part discussed the latest progress in analytical strategies for exogenous hazardous substances, including heavy metals, pesticides, and mycotoxins. Beyond reviewing mainstream instrumental methods, we also introduced the emerging biochip, biosensor and immuno-based techniques.
Conclusion
In this review, we provide an overall assessment of the recent progress in endogenous toxins and exogenous hazardous substances concerning Chinese medicine, which is expected to render deeper insights into the safety of Chinese medicine.}
