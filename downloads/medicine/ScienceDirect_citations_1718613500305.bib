abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a unique medical system of historic significance, holding substantial influence within China and beyond. In recent years, the efficacy of TCM in treating acute pancreatitis has been substantiated. Despite over two decades of development in this domain, a bibliometric analysis illustrating TCM's role in acute pancreatitis remains scarce. Objective: This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of findings in the field of acute pancreatitis and TCM using machine learning and text-analyzing methodologies. The intent is to provide scientific and intuitive support to researchers and clinicians. Methods: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection database for publications and related literature from 2007 to mid-2023. Tools such as Excel, Citespace V, and Vosviewer were utilized for bibliometric analysis. That included assessing published and cited counts, co-authorship mapping, co-citation analysis, burst detection, and keyword analysis. Results: The study revealed a fluctuating growth trend in the number of publications and citations since 2007. As many as 147 institutions from 13 countries, with a total of 756 authors, have published 202 papers in 76 academic journals. Sichuan University in China and Tang Wenfu have been recognized as the most influential national institution and author. The most frequently published journal is “Pancreas”, while the most cited is the “World Journal of Gastroenterology”. Commonly used single herbs in this field include Baicalin, Emodin, Rhubarb, and Salvia miltiorrhizae. Frequently used herbal formulations include Da chengqi decoction, Chaiqin chengqi decoction, and Qing yi decoction. Current research hotspots primarily surround concepts like hmgb1, nf-kappab, nfr2, oxidative stress, exosomes, nlrp3, pyroptosis, etc. Potential future research themes could relate to pharmacology, reducing hmgb1, inflammatory response, cell activation, Qing Yi-decoction, etc. This review holds significant guiding importance for clinical and scientific research into TCM treatment for acute pancreatitis in the future.}

abstract = {Objective
In traditional medicine, certain herbs are used for the treatment of oral ulcerative diseases, which are considered highly debilitating conditions. In this study, we aimed to review these treatment options in topical form and compared them with chemical ones. This study aims to review the treatment options of these herbs in topical form and compare them with chemical alternatives. Additionally, we examine whether researchers have consulted traditional medicine experts and explored the reasons behind their choice of medicinal plants.
Method
Two oral medicine specialists conducted a search of five databases, including Cochrane, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the keywords "herbal and oral ulcer" from 2011 to 2021. The extracted data were also evaluated and screened by a traditional medicine practitioner.
Result
Out of 2656 articles reviewed in this study, sixteen clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Researchers were motivated to prescribe herbs for oral ulcerative diseases because of their significant therapeutic actions, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immune system regulation. Seven articles reported significant results. The herbs Aloe vera, turmeric, chamomile, and pomegranate received more research attention. The most prevalent oral ulcerative diseases were oral mucositis (OM), recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), and oral lichen planus (OLP). Iran and China had the highest number of studies conducted.
Conclusion
Over the past ten years, topical herbal treatments have attracted attention for oral ulcer treatment. About half of the high-quality articles reported significant effects of herbal medicine. Future research should consider consulting with experts in the field when evaluating the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines.}

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has few modifiable risk factors. There is evidence that some antihypertensive medicines may have cancer preventive and/or therapeutic actions; therefore, we assessed the associations between use of different antihypertensive medicines and risk of specific EOC histotypes.
Methods
Our nested case-control study of linked administrative health data included 6070 Australian women aged over 50 years diagnosed with EOC from 2004 to 2013, and 30,337 matched controls. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between ever use of each antihypertensive medicine group, including beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and alpha blockers, and the risk of EOC overall and separately for the serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell and other histotypes.
Results
We found that most antihypertensive medicines were not associated with risk of EOC. However, women who used calcium channel blockers had a reduced risk of serous EOC (OR= 0.89, 95 % CI:0.81,0.98) and use of combination thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretics was associated with an increased risk of endometroid EOC (OR= 2.09, 95 % CI:1.15,3.82).
Conclusion
Our results provide little support for a chemo-preventive role for most antihypertensives, however, the histotype-specific associations we found warrant further investigation.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Access to essential cancer medicines is a key determinant of childhood cancer survival. WHO published the Model List of Essential Medicine for Children (EMLc) and updated it every two years since 2007 to promote better access to medicines for children. This study aimed to assess whether the inclusion of essential anticancer medicines for respective indications for children was based on evidence of significant clinical benefit between 2011 and 2021.
Methods
We identified all anticancer medicine indications added to the WHO EMLc Section 8 since 2011 and extracted evidence of benefit documented in the corresponding technical reports. Evidence in children was defined as evidence that included participants under 12, and graded into five levels, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. We analyzed whether each anticancer medicine indication was listed with documented OS benefit or improvements in surrogate measures based on the highest level of documented evidence in children.
Findings
A total of 115 anticancer medicine indications were added to the EMLc from 2011 to 2021, of which 101 (87.8%) had some clinical evidence in children and 4 (3.5%) were added without any clinical evidence. Among the 101 medicine indications, none were added with level-1 evidence in children, and 43 (42.6%), 11 (10.9%), 41 (40.6%), and 6 (5.9%) were listed with level-2, level-3, level-4, and level-5 evidence in children, respectively. Only eight (7.9%) medicine indications were reported to have OS benefit, another 12 (11.9%) were reported to have improvements on surrogate measures, and 81 (80.2%) were listed in the EMLc without documented improvements in either OS or surrogate measures.
Interpretation
Most anticancer medicine indications of the WHO EMLc were added based on limited evidence of statistically significant clinical benefit in children. Our results suggest that WHO should refine requirements for clinical benefit criteria and permissible forms, quality, and reporting of evidence of essential anticancer medicines for children, specify whether anticancer medicine indications have required evidence of clinical benefit in children, and provide further details in its technical reports that summarise the available evidence.

To determine the proportion of faculty members at the top orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs who completed a fellowship at one of these programs themselves, how many remained at their fellowship training programs as an attending (institutional loyalty), where they most commonly completed residency and medical school, and to characterize their research productivity.
Methods
The fellowship programs of current orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship faculty members at each of the top 10 orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs (based on a recent study) were determined by searching program websites or contacting program coordinators. For each program, we determined the proportion of faculty members who completed fellowship at one of these top 10 programs and the proportion who remained at their fellowship program as an attending. Residency and medical school information was found for faculty members on their professional websites. To determine research output, each faculty member’s name was searched within the Scopus database and the number of publications was recorded.
Results
Data were obtained from each of the top 10 sports medicine fellowship programs. Fifty-eight of 82 (70.7%) fellowship faculty members completed fellowship at a top 10 program. Regarding institutional loyalty, 36 of 82 (43.9%) fellowship faculty members remained at the program where they trained, with one program led entirely by alumni. The average number of publications per faculty member was 130.6, with a range among the 10 programs of 23-355.8.
Conclusions
Most orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship faculty at the top perceived training programs completed a fellowship at one of these same programs and maintain high research productivity.

The association between Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and the risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with dialysis hypotension is unclear and has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to determine whether CMH intervention could reduce the risk of MACEs in patients with dialysis hypotension.
Methods
The study data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were analyzed to clarify this association. For this study, a case-control design with a cohort of patients who received hemodialysis (HD) from 2008 to 2018, 20 295 HD patients who had received blood pressure (BP) raising drugs were identified. After 1:1 frequency-matching, 730 patients were identified as CHM users and CHM non-users. Vascular access revision/reconstruction and MACEs were observed as the main outcomes during the follow-up period.
Results
The occurrence of vascular access revision/reconstruction in HD patients receiving BP raising drugs was associated with a 0.34-fold lower risk in CHM users than in CHM non-users [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26, 0.45]. The occurrences of MACEs in HD patients receiving BP raising drugs was associated with a 0.41-fold lower risk in CHM users than in CHM non-users (aHR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.51). A markedly predominant effect was observed in those receiving CHM for more than 180 days (aHR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.22, 0.45).
Conclusion
The findings revealed lower vascular access dysfunction and MACEs risk correlated with the use of CHM treatment among HD patients who received BP raising drugs.}

abstract = {Gynecologic malignancies, consisting of endometrial, cervical, ovarian, vulvar, and vaginal cancers, pose significant diagnostic and management challenges due to their complex anatomic location and potential for rapid progression. These tumors cause substantial morbidity and mortality, often because of their delayed diagnosis and treatment. An estimated 19% of newly diagnosed cancers among women are gynecologic in origin. In recent years, there has been growing evidence supporting the integration of nuclear medicine imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up and management of gynecologic cancers. The sensitivity of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) combined with the anatomical specificity of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the hybrid evaluation of metabolic activity and structural abnormalities that has become an indispensable tool in oncologic imaging. Lymphoscintigraphy, using technetium 99m (99mTc) based radiotracers along with single photon emission computed tomography/ computed tomography (SPECT/CT), holds a vital role in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes to minimize the surgical morbidity from extensive lymph node dissections. While not yet standard for gynecologic malignancies, promising therapeutic nuclear medicine agents serve as specialized treatment options for patients with advanced or recurrent disease. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review on the nuclear medicine applications in gynecologic malignancies through the following objectives: 1) To describe the role of nuclear medicine in the initial staging, lymph node mapping, response assessment, and recurrence/surveillance imaging of common gynecologic cancers, 2) To review the limitations of 18F-FDG PET/CT and promising applications of 18F-FDG PET/MRI in gynecologic malignancy, 3) To underscore the promising theragnostic applications of nuclear medicine, 4) To highlight the current role of nuclear medicine imaging in gynecologic cancers as per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Society of Surgical Oncology (ESGO), and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines.}

To describe the prevalence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in orthopaedic sports medicine–related journals reporting on the social determinants of health (SDOH) of their patient cohorts, including factors receiving less attention, such as education level, employment status, insurance status, and socioeconomic status.
Methods
The PubMed/MEDLINE database was used to search for RCTs between 2020 and 2022 from 3 high-impact orthopaedic sports medicine–related journals: American Journal of Sports Medicine, Arthroscopy, and Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery. The following information was extracted from each article: age, sex/gender, body mass index, year published, corresponding author country, and self-reported SDOH factors (race, ethnicity, education level, employment status, insurance status, and socioeconomic status).
Results
A total of 189 articles were analyzed. Articles originated from 34 different countries, with the United States (n = 66) producing the greatest number of articles. Overall, age (n = 186; 98.4%) and sex/gender (n = 184; 97.4%) were the factors most commonly reported, followed by body mass index (n = 112; 59.3%), race (n = 17; 9.0%), ethnicity (n = 10; 5.3%), employment status (n = 9; 4.8%), insurance status (n = 7; 3.7%), and education level (n = 5; 2.6%). Socioeconomic status was not reported in any of the articles analyzed. Articles from the United States report on SDOH factors more frequently than international articles, most notably race (24.2% vs 0.8%, respectively) and ethnicity (15.2% and 0%, respectively).
Conclusions
RCTs from 3 high-impact orthopaedic sports medicine journals infrequently report on SDOH.
Clinical Relevance
Better understanding patient SDOH factors in RCTs is important to help orthopaedic surgeons and other practitioners best apply study results to their patients, as well as help researchers and our field ensure that research is being done transparently with relevance to as many patients as possible.}

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases arise due to slow and gradual loss of structure and/or function of neurons and glial cells and cause different degrees of loss of cognition abilities and sensation. The little success in developing effective treatments imposes a high and regressive economic impact on society, patients and their families. In recent years, regenerative medicine has provided a great opportunity to research new innovative strategies with strong potential to treatleva these diseases. These effects are due to the ability of suitable cells and biomaterials to regenerate damaged nerves with differentiated cells, creating an appropriate environment for recovering or preserving existing healthy neurons and glial cells from destruction and damage. Ultimately, a better understanding and thus a further investigation of stem cell technology, tissue engineering, gene therapy, and exosomes allows progress towards practical and effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, in this review, advances currently being developed in regenerative medicine using animal models and human clinical trials in neurological disorders are summarized.}

In the last five decades, bioglass has been extensively used in the field of therapeutic and tissue engineering. The doping of metal components into bioglass and the synthesizing of nano bioglass particles have found remarkable implications, both in vivo and in vitro. These include various medical and biological applications such as rejuvenating tissues, facilitating regeneration, and delivering biomolecules into cells and therapy, etc. Therefore, the current review discusses the various techniques used in synthesizing bioglass particles, trends of various ion-doped nano bioglass, and their applications in therapy as well as in regenerative medicine, specifically in the fields of dentistry, cardiovascular, skin, nervous, and respiratory systems. Apart from these, this review also emphasizes the bioglass combined with diverse natural polymers (like collagen, chitosan, etc.) and their applications. Furthermore, we discuss the effectiveness of bioglass properties such as antibacterial effects, biomolecular delivery systems, tissue compatibility, and regenerative material.

To understand the opinions of both orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship program directors (PDs) and applicants regarding the utility of virtual interviews in comparison to in-person interviews following the 2022-2023 application cycle.
Methods
An anonymous online survey was distributed through the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine to applicants and PDs of orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs. Questions in the survey included how the virtual format affected the applicants’ personal connection to the program, the interview day structure, and costs associated with the interview process.
Results
Responses were received from 69 of 93 PDs (74%) and 97 of 266 applicants (36%). Ninety-five percent of PDs (59 of 62) preferred in-person interviews, compared to 79% of applicants (70 of 89). Ninety-eight percent of PDs (60 of 61) and 82% of applicants (72 of 88) thought it was important/very important to interview in-person. Sixty-one percent of PDs (35 of 57) and 49% of applicants agreed/strongly agreed that conducting virtual interviews negatively affected their personal connection with the fellowship interviewee/program. The presence of virtual interviews allowed 50% (43 of 86) of applicants to go on more interviews. Thirty-two percent (18 of 57) of fellowship programs saved up to $5,000 conducting virtual interviews, and 85% (69 of 81) of applicants saved up to $5,000 on travel expenses by attending virtual interviews.
Conclusions
Virtual interviews allow fellowship applicants to complete more interviews and presented financial savings for both programs and applicants. However, both PDs and applicants stated that interviewing in-person is essential for applicants to meet faculty and tour the facilities.
Clinical Relevance
This study may be valuable to fellowship programs considering continued use of virtual interviews.}

abstract = {Introduction
Cinnabar is a commonly utilized mineral traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China. It has the functions of clearing the heart and calming the mind. However, there remains a dearth of pharmacological experiments on the metal elements of cinnabar on animal models. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of cinnabar on neurotransmitter levels in p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) induced insomnia rats and the content of metal elements in plasma, heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of rats.
Methods
Tissue hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were used to assess the histological changes. The 5-HT and GABA in plasma and hypothalamus of rats were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent to evaluate the therapeutic effect. The content of metal elements in plasma, heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of rats was determined by ICP-MS.
Results
After cured with cinnabar and its processed for fourteen days, the level of 5-HT in the plasma and hypothalamus increased (P<0.05), and the level of GABA decreased (P<0.05). Furthermore, both low dose (1 mg/kg) and high dose (10 mg/kg) of cinnabar resulted in an increase in plasma 5-HT levels;, however, the high dose of cinnabar increased the level of 5-HT more than low dose of cinnabar. The content of metal elements in plasma, hemocyte and heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of rats ranged from less than 1 µg.g−1 to hundreds of µg.g−1, among which the highest content was Fe in rat's spleen of cinnabar sedative pill group, and the content is 919 µg.g−1. The content of most metal elements in plasma and hemocyte of rats was significantly lower than that in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. There is no obvious difference of Hg in plasma and tissue of rats between the control group fed normally and rats fed with drugs.
Discussion
Cinnabar and its products can improve insomnia symptoms in rats by regulating the neurotransmitters 5-HT and GABA. Cinnabar is basically non-toxic in short-term (less than 14 days) use accordance with the dosage prescribed by pharmacopoeia.}

These physicians undergo extensive training in holistic models of care and apply a systematic approach called the Therapeutic Order, which focuses on addressing the underlying cause of symptoms and using the least force necessary for treatment. Improved outcomes are realized with multifactorial personalized treatment plans including lifestyle, nutrition, stress management, and physical activity. Integrative medicine is on the rise and we support the shift to the inclusion of a patient-centered approach in the management of chronic pain and disease. Nothing in the practice of natural, holistic medicine precludes respect for science, and the reliance on evidence.

The aerial parts of Mosla chinensis Maxim. and Mosla chinensis cv. ‘Jiangxiangru’ (MCJ) are widely utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), known collectively as Xiang-ru. However, due to clinical effectiveness concerns and frequent misidentification, the original plants have increasingly been substituted by various species within the genera Elsholtzia and Mosla. The challenge in distinguishing between these genera arises from their similar morphological and metabolic profiles. To address this issue, our study introduced a rapid method for metabolic characterization, employing high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Through detailed biosynthetic and chemometric analyses, we pinpointed five phenolic compounds—salviaflaside, cynaroside, scutellarein-7-O-D-glucoside, rutin, and vicenin-2—among 203 identified compounds, as reliable chemical markers for distinguishing Xiang-ru from closely related Elsholtzia species. This methodology holds promise for broad application in the analysis of plant aerial parts, especially in verifying the authenticity of aromatic traditional medicinal plants. Our findings underscore the importance of non-volatile compounds as dependable chemical markers in the authentication process of aromatic traditional medicinal plants.}

As a "silent killer" that threatens women's lives and health, ovarian cancer (OC) has the clinical characteristics of being difficult to detect, difficult to treat, and high recurrence. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can be utilized as a long-term complementary and alternative therapy since it has shown benefits in alleviating clinical symptoms of OC, decreasing toxic side effects of radiation and chemotherapy, as well as enhancing patients' quality of life.
Aim of the review
This paper reviews how TCM contributes to the apoptosis of OC cells through signaling pathways, including active constituents, extracts, and herbal formulas, with the aim of providing a basis for the development and clinical application of therapeutic strategies for TCM in OC.
Methods
The search was conducted from scientific databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases aiming to elucidate the apoptosis signaling pathways in OC cells by TCM. The articles were searched by the keywords "ovarian cancer", "apoptosis", "signaling pathway", "traditional Chinese medicine", "Chinese herbal monomer", "Chinese herbal extract", and "herbal formula". The search was conducted from January 2013 to June 2023. A total of 97 potentially relevant articles were included, including 93 articles on Chinese medicine active constituents or extracts and 4 articles on Chinese herbal compound prescriptions.
Results
TCM can induce apoptosis in OC cells by regulating signaling pathways with obvious advantages, including STAT3, PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK, NF-κB, Nrf2, HIF-1α, Fas/Fas L signaling pathway, etc.
Conclusion
Chinese medicine can induce apoptosis in OC cells through multiple pathways, targets, and routes. TCM has special advantages for treating OC, providing more reasonable evidence for the research and development of new apoptosis inducers.}

To explore the clinical efficacy and safety of Xuanfei Touxie Fang (XFTXF) as a complementary medicine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.
Methods
A retrospective study of 317 patients with ordinary symptoms admitted to our hospital from December 2022 to February 2023 were divided into the observation group (n = 224) and the control group (n = 93). The observation group was treated with Xuanfei Touxie Fang combined with conventional treatment and the control group treated with conventional treatment alone. Recovery time of symptoms, length of hospital stay, clinical cure rate and recovery rate of chest CT manifestations were compared between the two groups.
Results
The time to recover from fever (median: 1 vs 3 days) and the length of hospital stay (median: 7 vs 9 days) of the observation group after treatment were significantly shorter than the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The clinical cure rate (68.3% vs 54.84 %) and the recovery rate of chest CT manifestations (87.95% vs 66.67 %) of the observation group after treatment were higher than the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no adverse reactions during the treatment for two groups. The difference was no statistically significant (P > 0.05).
Discussion
Numerous studies have demonstrated that Xuanfei Touxie Fang, which is frequently used in respiratory diseases, has anti-coronavirus effects by inhibiting viral replication, release, penetration, and RNA synthesis. Therefore, we treated COVID-19 with it and evaluated its safety and effectiveness.
Conclusions
Xuanfei Touxie Fang as a complementary medicine has a significant effect in the treatment of COVID-19, which can reduce the duration of fever and the length of hospital stay, improve the clinical cure rate and recovery rate of chest CT manifestations.}

Despite increased insight into the harmful effects medicines have on the environment, research is scarce on how this awareness affect consumer behaviour and how people would react to environmental policies that could influence individual treatment options.
Objectives
To investigate if information about environmental harm would affect people's medicine choices and the support of policies to reduce pharmaceutical pollution.
Methods
A web survey was completed by a representative sample of the Swedish adult population (n=1,583). The survey included a choice task with three disease scenarios (common cold, rheumatoid arthritis, and stroke) and fictitious medicines with different therapeutic effect and environmental harm. There were also items asking for support of possible policies (eco-labelling of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, higher prices for environmentally harmful medicines, and green prescribing requirements).
Results
The most environmentally friendly and least effective options were preferred by 68% of the participants in the common cold scenario, 36% in the rheumatoid arthritis scenario, and 23% in the stroke scenario. These were rated highest in satisfaction with treatment option for the common cold (large effect) and rheumatoid arthritis (small effect) scenarios. Regarding stroke, the most effective and least environmentally friendly options were most preferred. Reported support of policies were consistently high. The highest was the support of eco-labelling of OTC medicines, followed by higher prices for environmentally harmful medicines, and green prescribing requirements (in that order). Female sex, age ≥ 60 years, higher education and having no children were associated with being positively inclined towards the most intrusive regulation (green prescribing requirements).
Conclusion
There is a willingness among people in Sweden to take environmental considerations into account for minor ailments, which gradually disappears when faced with more serious diseases. Swedes support policies that could lead to more environmentally friendly medicine use, including those that affect individual treatment options.}

abstract = {Background
Expansion of pharmaceutical industries and improved availability of pharmaceuticals across the world have contributed to an increase in drug usage and accumulation in homes. Improper disposal of expired and unused medications has several consequences such as environmental pollution, and childhood poisoning.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge on disposal as well as disposal practices of unused and expired household medicines in the Parker Corner Road Community in Brewerville, Liberia.
Methods
This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted among 162 residents of Parker Corner Road Community using face-to-face interviews. Outcomes measured were knowledge of disposal as well as disposal practices of unused and expired household medicines. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics.
Results
Majority of respondents (55.6%) were female and 23.5% had university education. 71% of the respondents reported that they had not received any information on safe disposal practices while 64.2% admitted that they often did not read and follow disposal instructions. The most popular disposal practices were disposal of the drugs along with household waste (61.1%) and flushing them down the toilets or sinks (25.3%). Majority of the respondents (82.1%) were aware of the health effects arising from improper disposal of unused and expired medicines while 64.2% usually read medicine disposal instruction on the package. Only about 3% of them knew of expired medication take-back system and 33.3% knew nothing about medication expiration date.
Conclusion
The study revealed insufficient knowledge as well as inappropriate disposal practices of unused and expired medicines among residents of Parker Corner Road Community in Brewerville. There is need to organize a public enlightenment programme on safe, appropriate use, as well as disposal of unused and expired medicines.}

Precision medicine initiatives across the globe have led to a revolution of repositories linking large-scale genomic data with electronic health records, enabling genomic analyses across the entire phenome. Many of these initiatives focus solely on research insights, leading to limited direct benefit to patients. We describe the biobank at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM Biobank) that was jointly developed by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and UCHealth to serve as a unique, dual-purpose research and clinical resource accelerating personalized medicine. This living resource currently has more than 200,000 participants with ongoing recruitment. We highlight the clinical, laboratory, regulatory, and HIPAA-compliant informatics infrastructure along with our stakeholder engagement, consent, recontact, and participant engagement strategies. We characterize aspects of genetic and geographic diversity unique to the Rocky Mountain region, the primary catchment area for CCPM Biobank participants. We leverage linked health and demographic information of the CCPM Biobank participant population to demonstrate the utility of the CCPM Biobank to replicate complex trait associations in the first 33,674 genotyped individuals across multiple disease domains. Finally, we describe our current efforts toward return of clinical genetic test results, including high-impact pathogenic variants and pharmacogenetic information, and our broader goals as the CCPM Biobank continues to grow. Bringing clinical and research interests together fosters unique clinical and translational questions that can be addressed from the large EHR-linked CCPM Biobank resource within a HIPAA- and CLIA-certified environment.}

The Guidelines for the Management of Cough and Sputum (2019) of the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) were the first internationally published guidelines for the management of sputum. However, the data used to determine the causative diseases of bloody sputum and hemoptysis in these guidelines were not obtained in Japan.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed using the clinical information of patients with bloody sputum or hemoptysis who visited the department of respiratory medicine at a university or core hospital in Japan.
Results
Included in the study were 556 patients (median age, 73 years; age range, 21–98 years; 302 males (54.3%)). The main causative diseases were bronchiectasis (102 patients (18.3%)), lung cancer (97 patients (17.4%)), and non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease (89 patients (16%)). Sex and age differences were observed in the frequency of causative diseases of bloody sputum and hemoptysis. The most common cause was lung cancer in males (26%), bronchiectasis in females (29%), lung cancer in patients aged <65 years (19%), and bronchiectasis in those aged >65 years (20%).
Conclusions
The present study is the first to investigate the causative diseases of bloody sputum and hemoptysis using data obtained in Japan. When investigating the causative diseases of bloody sputum and hemoptysis, it is important to take the sex and age of the patients into account.}

We found five CHM formulas and six single CHM extracts as well as 12 CHM-derived compounds, which showed induction of apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycle arrest, suppression of angiogenesis, proliferation, and migration of prostate cancer cells, reversal of drug resistance, and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. The mechanisms of action include the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, AR, EGFR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, which are commonly implicated in the development of prostate cancer. We also summarized the advantages of CHMs in patients with hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer and provided ideas for their further experimental design and application.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Tangchong (ཐང་ཕྲོམ།), a term in the Tibetan language, encompasses a diverse group of plants belonging to different genera of the Solanaceae family. These plants have been utilized in traditional Tibetan medicine for centuries and are currently still employed to treat a variety of ailments, including acute and severe abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, epilepsy, ascariasis, lung abscess, and other diseases. The therapeutic properties of tangchong are attributed to the presence of tropane alkaloids (TAs), although recent research has also revealed their toxicity.
Aim of this review
The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the traditional uses of tangchong, as well as the phytochemical and pharmacological studies conducted on this plant. The review aims to offer a critical update on the current state of knowledge of tangchong and to identify new opportunities for exploring its therapeutic potential.
Materials and methods
To gather information on tangchong, we conducted a thorough search of several scientific databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scifinder, Baidu Scholar, PubMed, and CNKI.
Results
This review summarizes the traditional usage of 11 plants, 168 chemical components, including alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, amides, coumarins, etc., describes the pharmacological activities of these medicinal plants and their mechanisms of action, provides an elaboration of toxicology, and provides new plant-derived drugs and herbal preparations from tangchong.
Conclusions
Clarity regarding the source of the drug is crucial to ensure the safety and efficacy of clinical applications of Tibetan medicine. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of tangchong, including its traditional medicinal uses, chemical composition, pharmacology, toxicology, and quality control measures. Our analysis highlights the significant value of tangchong as an ethnomedicinal resource, with pharmacological activities primarily linked to its alkaloid content. Furthermore, this review serves as a valuable reference for future research on alkaloid-containing ethnomedicines.}

abstract = {Background
Unlicensed medicines are used across the UK to treat an individual's clinical needs when there are no appropriate licensed alternatives. Patients, carers and parents have reported facing challenges with unlicensed medicines at the points of transfer of care between settings, a key time when medication errors may occur. There is little known about the patient journey as a whole, or the factors affecting patient care when receiving an unlicensed medicine.
Objective
A systematic review of UK literature to better understand factors that affect the entire patient journey from the decision to initiate treatment with an unlicensed medicine to the point at which treatment is supplied through a community pharmacy or ends.
Methods
Scopus, OVID EMCARE, EMBASE, OVID Medline ALL, CINAHL, Web of Science and Joanna Briggs Institute were searched from 1968 (introduction of the Medicines Act) until November 2020, using the PRISMA guidelines. Narrative synthesis of UK studies was employed to analyse descriptive and qualitative data on any reported findings that would impact the patient journey or care related to the use of unlicensed medicines, and any described barriers or enablers.
Results
Forty-five studies met criteria for final inclusion, with high levels of heterogeneity in terms of designs and methods. Specific challenges that were seen to impact the continuity of care across care settings, patient safety and provision of patient-centred care included diversity of clinical needs and impact of patient population age; healthcare professional awareness and acceptability of the use of unlicensed medicines; the hierarchical structure of the NHS; inconsistent doses and formulations with varying bioequivalence; patient/parent/carer/public awareness of unlicensed medicines use and perceived acceptability.
Conclusions
This review identified a clear need for consistent information to be provided to healthcare professional and patients alike to support the safe and effective use of unlicensed medicines across care settings.}

Orthopaedic surgeons who are fellowship-trained in adult reconstruction (AR) specialize specifically in total joint arthroplasty, including total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, TKA procedures are not only performed by AR surgeons. The purpose of this study was to compare the patient demographics and postoperative outcomes of patients who had a TKA procedure performed by an AR surgeon vs a sports medicine (SM) surgeon.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a national insurance database. Patients who underwent a primary elective TKA procedure by an AR surgeon (n = 56,570) and an SM surgeon (n = 72,888) were identified. Patient demographics, rates of joint complications within 2 years, and medical complications within 90 days postoperatively were compared using multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Compared to the cohort of patients undergoing TKA by SM surgeons, the patient cohort of AR surgeons had a higher mean Elixhauser comorbidity index (4.2 vs 4.0, P < .001), and had significantly higher rates of several comorbidities. Within 90 days, patients of AR surgeons demonstrated significantly lower rates of acute kidney injury and transfusions. When compared to patients of SM surgeons, patients of AR surgeons demonstrated significantly lower rate of manipulation under anesthesia or lysis of adhesions within 2 years. Rates of all other joint-related complications were statistically comparable between the 2 cohorts.
Conclusions
As a cohort, AR surgeons perform TKA on a higher-risk cohort of patients compared to sports medicine surgeons. Despite the higher-risk patient population, outcomes of TKA by AR surgeons appear equivalent compared to their SM colleagues.}

The median score for accuracy of information was rated 4.8 on a 6-point scale and the median score for completeness of information was 2.2 on a 3-point scale for the 5 patient information leaflets generated by ChatGPT. Concerns raised included the omission of clinically important information for patient counseling in some patient information leaflets and the inability to verify the source of information because ChatGPT does not provide references. ChatGPT is a powerful tool that has the potential to enhance patient care, but such a tool requires extensive validation and is perhaps best considered as an adjunct to clinical practice rather than as a tool to be used freely by the public for healthcare information.}

Structural and functional explorations on bio-soft matter such as micelles, vesicles, nanoparticles, aggregates or polymers derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has emerged as a new topic in the field of TCM. The discovery of such cross-scaled bio-soft matter may provide a unique perspective for unraveling the new effective material basis of TCM as well as developing innovative medicine and biomaterials. Despite the rapid rise of TCM-derived bio-soft matter, their hierarchical structure and assembly mechanism must be unambiguously probed for a further in-depth understanding of their pharmacological activity. In this review, the current emerged TCM-derived bio-soft matter assembled from either small molecules or macromolecules will be introduced, and particularly the unambiguous elucidation of their hierarchical structure and assembly mechanism with combined electron microscopic and spectroscopic techniques will be depicted. The pros and cons of each technique are also discussed. The future challenges and perspective of TCM-derived bio-soft matter are outlined, particularly the requirement for their precise in situ structural determination is highlighted.}

Road traffic crashes due to impaired driving are a leading cause of preventable injuries and deaths. The purpose of this study was adaptation of a European categorization system for driving-impairing medicines in Iran.
Methods
DRUID categorization system was used as a leading model to classify medicines. Medicines that were compatible with DRUID categorization system were identified and classified accordingly. Medicines that were not compatible with DRUID categorization system were assessed in an expert panel in terms of possiblity of classification. Instructions for health care providers and advice for patients were prepared based on the medicine’s influence on fitness to drive.
Results
Of the 1255 medicines in Iranian pharmacopeia, 488 medicines were classified in four categories. Among classified medicines 43.85% and 25.41% belonged to Category 0 and Category 1. About 13.94%, 10.04%, and 6.76% pertained to Category 2, Category 3, and Multiple categories respectively. Majority of the medicines with moderate and severe adverse influences on driving fitness belonged to the nervous system medicines (72.65%). Most of the medicines with non-existing or minor adverse influences on driving fitness pertained to cardiovascular medicines (16.56%). Majority of uncategorized medicines belonged to Iranian herbal medicines.
Conclusion
The current study disclosed that DRUID categorization system was implementable for most of the commonly prescribed medicines. Experimental studies are needed to determine the influence of uncategorized medicines of Iranian pharmacopeia. Other countries with similar settings can adapt DRUID categorization system until they develop their own model using original studies.}

So far, VM has remained largely unexplored with the exception of Durrant's (2009) limited coverage of VM texts. The analysis was conducted using LancsBox 6.0, prompted to yield a list of PoS-tagged lemmas (P-lemmas) sorted by frequency (Coxhead, 2000; Yang, 2015) and dispersion (Arndt, 2022). The most frequent 1,000 lemmas for each content word category were collated into a candidate list. We then manually eliminated proper nouns and GSL (West, 1953) words. The final list, the Veterinary Medicine Academic Word List (VMAWL), contains 835 PoS-tagged lemmas (P-lemmas), a reiteration of which was produced by adding the types in Bauer and Nation’s (1993) taxonomy at the second level to test coverage. The VMAWL was profiled and validated against the four parent categories independently on AntWordProfiler (Anthony, 2022a) with analysis showing the VMAWL comprises 13.75 % of the VMC and diverges greatly from generic word lists like the AWL, NGSL, new-GSL, and AVL.

abstract = {Purpose
Radiation therapy has been described as both precise and personalized. Radiotheranostics is a novel treatment involving the use of radioisotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes to bind to receptors on the tumor cells. Recent examples of radiotheranostics are Lutetium 177 DOTATATE that targets somatostatin receptors on neuroendocrine tumors and Lutetium 177 PSMA which attaches to prostate-specific membrane antigen [PSMA] in prostate cancer. The purpose of this review was to define personalized medicine, precision medicine, and to relate these concepts to radiotherapy and radiotheranostics for cancer treatment.
Methodology
Papers with the title terms precision medicine, personalized medicine and radiation or (Radio)theranostics were searched for in MEDLINE. There were no limitations on years, full-text availability or language. The most relevant papers were read and synthesized.
Results
Personalized medicine is defined as the use of an individual's genetic profile to guide decisions made about the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. It is also suggested that shared decision making, patient satisfaction, engagement, compliance and patient centered outcomes reflect the ideals of personalized medicine. Precision medicine is defined as an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that accounts for individual variability in genes, but also the environment and lifestyle for each person. Both definitions include the use of genetics in the decisions for treatment. Personalized medicine may also refer to patient centered approaches. External beam radiation therapy is considered precise medicine for several reasons; however, the reasons are unrelated to genetics. In radiation medicine, there are two forms of precision, physical and biological. Biological precision or individual patient genetics are less frequently the dominant factor in the context of external beam radiation therapy, as volume and dose fractionation is guided by prognostic groupings rather than tailored to individual cancer features. Radiation therapy is considered precise from a physical point of view. Patient-specific tumor and normal tissue anatomy are contoured, and treatment plans are designed to maximize the therapeutic ratio. Also, advances in image guidance improve the technical precision of radiation treatment delivery. Radiotheranostics involves radiopharmaceuticals that are designed to bind to receptors on tumour cells to treat cancer after using diagnostic imaging to identify the target receptors. Compared with radiation therapy, radiotheranostics more closely fits the definition of precision medicine. Radiotheranostics adds precision medicine into the armamentarium of Radiation Medicine. One approach to personalization has been to modify dose (escalation or reduction) based on kidney sensitivity.
Conclusions
Personalized medicine and precision medicine are often used interchangeably; however, by understanding the definitions of precision medicine and personalized medicine, we can work on focusing our practices on both concepts. In the context of radiotheranostics, as treatment workflows and programs are developed, we seek to understand how the precise treatment of radiotheranostics can be more personalized. Opportunities for personalization lie in dose modification based on patient characteristics and in focusing on the patient experience.}

Current and future healthcare professionals are generally not trained to cope with the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare. To design a curriculum that caters to variable baseline knowledge and skills, clinicians may be conceptualized as “consumers”, “translators”, or “developers”. The changes required of medical education because of AI innovation are linked to those brought about by evidence-based medicine (EBM). We outline a core curriculum for AI education of future consumers, translators, and developers, emphasizing the links between AI and EBM, with suggestions for how teaching may be integrated into existing curricula. We consider the key barriers to implementation of AI in the medical curriculum: time, resources, variable interest, and knowledge retention. By improving AI literacy rates and fostering a translator- and developer-enriched workforce, innovation may be accelerated for the benefit of patients and practitioners.}

abstract = {Objective
The efficacy of medications for Parkinson’s disease (PD) tend to decline over time, which has a serious impact on patients’ health and quality of life. To some extent, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can resolve the distressing problem of ineffective dopaminergic medication in PD patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitude, acceptance, and independent predictors of TCM in PD patients admitted to the outpatient department of a tertiary hospital.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of PD patients was conducted in the outpatient department of a large tertiary hospital in Beijing from March 2022 to June 2023. A self-report questionnaire was developed to investigate PD patients’ attitudes and acceptance of TCM based on the questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were also performed to further clarify the independent predictors influencing patients’ adoption of TCM therapy.
Results
A total of 397 patients completed the questionnaire, of which 78.09% were willing to be treated with TCM and 21.91% indicated that they were not willing to use TCM. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that several parameters were correlated with a patient’s willingness to include TCM in their therapeutic regime. These included education level of a bachelor’s degree (odds ratio [OR) = 8.554; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.112–17.794; P < 0.001, vs junior high school education), living in an urban setting (OR = 8.022; 95% CI: 4.577–14.060; P < 0.001, vs rural), having other underlying diseases (OR = 5.126; 95% CI: 3.078–8.537; P < 0.001, vs none), having previously used TCM (OR = 3.083; 95% CI: 1.852–5.134; P < 0.001, vs not used), believing that TCM therapy is safe (OR = 3.530; 95% CI: 1.446–8.616; P = 0.006, vs not thought), believing that TCM therapy is effective (OR = 3.859; 95% CI: 1.482–10.047; P = 0.006, vs not understood), and being willing to discuss ongoing TCM therapy with an attending physician (OR = 62.468; 95% CI: 30.350–128.574; P < 0.001, vs not informed).
Conclusion
This study initially investigated the acceptance, attitude, and independent predictors of TCM use among PD patients. To expand the prevalence of TCM use among patients with PD, we recommend to broadening the public outreach for TCM via contemporary means of Internet and broadcast communication, enhancing access to TCM services in rural communities, and strengthening the communication between doctors and patients.

abstract = {Background
Considering the limitations of Western medicine (WM) in treating Insomnia among adults, and the extensive use of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs), a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Different CPMs used in combination with WM for Insomnia in adults is necessary. To this end, a systematic investigation was conducted to scrutinize the effectiveness and safety of using 16 different CPMs in conjunction with WM in treating Insomnia in adults. The present study employed a network meta-analysis technique to compare and evaluate the combined therapeutic potential of these 16 CPMs and WM in treating adults with Insomnia.
Methods
Literary databases were scrupulously combed through from their commencement until November 2022 to collect all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that centered on adult patients afflicted with insomnia and treated with a blend of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) and Western medicine (WM). The investigation analyzed diverse outcomes, comprising total effective rate, Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), occurrence of somnolence, occurrence of dry mouth, and occurrence of dizziness. The examination utilized advanced statistical tools such as RevMan (5.3), Stata/MP17, and R software, and also calculated the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probability values, which were employed to rank the examined treatments. In addition, the inquiry executed clustering analysis to contrast the effects and safety of CPMs on distinct outcomes.
Results
A total of 283studies involving 27,151patients and 16 CMPs were included. The 16 CMPs were: Wulingjiaonang (WLJN), Anshenbunaoye (ASBNY), Baileminjiaonang (BLWJN), Shenqiwuweizi (SQWWZ), Shensongyangxinjiaonang (SSYXJN), Jiaotaiwan (JTW), Yangxinanshengwan (YXASW), Tianwangbuxindan (TWBXD), Zhushaanshenwan (ZSASW), Yangdanxinnaotong (YDXNT), Yangxueqingnaokeli (YXQNKL), Tianmengjiaonang (TMJN), Zaorenanshenjiaonang (ZRASJN), Shuganjieyujiaonang (SGJYJN), Xiaoyaosan (XYS), Shumianjiaonang (SMJN). The results of the network meta-analysis showed that, with WM treatment as a co-intervention, SSYXJN was most likely to improve the total efficiency rate (SUCRA= 84.70%), ASBNY had the highest probability of being the best option for improving the Sleep quality (SUCRA= 99.20%), JTW had the highest probability of reducing the incidence of somnolence (SUCRA= 94.10%), ZSASW had the highest probability of reducing the incidence of dry mouth (SUCRA= 74.70%), while WLJN had the highest probability of reducing the incidence of dizziness (SUCRA= 73.10%).
Conclusions
CPMs combined with WM is proved to be more effective and safer than WM alone, which may be beneficial to adults with Insomnia patients. SQWWZ+WM(Level of evidence, moderate) and ZSASW+WM(Level of evidence, moderate) are most likely the optimal CPM to improve total efficiency rates, Sleep quality, and reduce adverse effects. This study, however, has some limitations as discussed in this article; therefore, higher quality RCTs and real-world evidence are required to support our conclusions.}

Prehospital blood gas analysis (BGA) is an evolving field that offers the potential for early identification and management of critically ill patients. However, the utility and accuracy of prehospital BGA are subjects of ongoing debate.
Objectives
We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature on prehospital BGA, including its indications, methods, and feasibility.
Methods
We performed a scoping review of prehospital BGA. A thorough search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify relevant studies focusing on prehospital BGA in adult patients.
Results
Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Prehospital BGA was most frequently performed in patients in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, followed by traumatic and nontraumatic cases. The parameters most commonly analyzed were pH, pCO2, pO2, and lactate. Various sampling methods, including arterial, venous, and intraosseous, were reported for prehospital BGA. While prehospital BGA shows promise in facilitating early identification of critical patients and guiding resuscitation efforts, logistical challenges are to be considered. The handling of preclinical BGA is described as feasible and useful in most of the included studies.
Conclusion
Prehospital BGA holds significant potential for enhancing patient care in the prehospital setting, though technical challenges need to be considered. However, further research is required to establish optimal indications and demonstrate the benefits for prehospital BGA in specific clinical contexts.}

We examine the role of gap years among college graduates interested in medicine and how they might contribute to academic research productivity within clinical environments. Recently, academic faculty have struggled to balance increasing clinical responsibilities with their scholarly endeavors. Academic medical departments may have incentives to hire pre-medical students to help ease the research burden on faculty. Properly motivated pre-medical students may view research positions in academic medical departments as ideal opportunities to learn in areas that will broaden their scientific knowledge and help prepare them for medical school, while greatly enhancing their medical school applications through distinguishing themselves as co-authors published in medical journals. Our experience, with two co-authors working as research associates while preparing for their medical school applications and careers, suggests that pre-medical students can strengthen their medical school applications during their gap year(s) while proving instrumental in enhancing research output thus alleviating the workload of clinical faculty.}

Upon successful completion of the information provided, participants will be able to list options and resources for creating a longitudinal program to re-educate learners on HPM.
Key Message
Hospice & palliative medicine (HPM) has evolved in the US and globally. We studied the perceived competency and importance of HPM and created a curriculum based on a gap analysis to re-educate our clinicians. Our results highlight the need for longitudinal HPM education which is important for the provision of HPM services to patient populations.
Introduction
Hospice & palliative medicine (HPM) has evolved. Though HPM is part of Family Medicine graduate medical education, there is a deficit in the comfort level and perceived competencies of practicing physicians.
Objectives
We did a gap analysis on HPM education and competency and implemented a year long program to re-educate clinicians. We surveyed members of the Northwell Health FM Department, the NY State Academy of Family Physicians (NYSAFP) 2017 meeting and 2018 World Conference of Family Doctors (WONCA). Pre- and Post-session surveys were done for educational programs.
Methods
IRB approved surveys were completed by our family medicine department and the NYSAFP/WONCA. Educational sessions were implemented over one year with ∼100 participants. The HPM 101 curriculum centered around topics raised in the survey.
Results
Data showed a gap in perceived competency and comfort level of family medicine physicians regardless of prior HPM education in medical school or residency. Of 56 participants in the NYSAFP session, 57% had no prior HPM training and 80% wanted more training. For the WONCA cohort (N=18) it was 33% and 67% respectively. Using a Likert Scale of 1-5 (5 "essential"), asked if hospice care is an important competence for family physicians, NYSAFP rated it 4.41 and WONCA 4.72. Asked the importance of advance directives discussions with patients WONCA rated it 4.72 and NYSAFP 4.39. The 2018 educational sessions demonstrated an increased level of perceived competencies by 1 point for participants.
Conclusions
Longitudinal education of HPM competencies is important for family physicians to continue to practice this part of medicine and ensure patients are adequately cared for along the health continuum.

People align their beliefs and behaviors, including those related to health, increasingly along politically ideological lines.
Objective
We investigated whether individual political orientation (PO) predicts the use of conventional (CM) and complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) across Europe.
Methods
We used cross-sectional samples representative of persons aged 15 and over from 19 European countries (ESS 2015; round 7; N = 35,572). We assessed PO based on participants’ vote choice in the most recent national election, using expert ratings of party positioning along five political-ideological dimensions: left-right general; left-right economic; Green/alternative/libertarian vs. Traditional/authoritarian/nationalist; anti-elite; and anti-corruption. Use of CM was defined as having consulted a general practitioner or specialist, and use of CAM as having used acupuncture, acupressure, Chinese medicine, homeopathy, herbal treatment, hypnotherapy, or spiritual healing.
Results
Participants with an anti-corruption PO were less likely to use CM and more likely to use CAM than other Europeans. Participants with a Green/alternative/libertarian PO were more likely to use CAM than others. Poorer health moderated the association between anti-corruption PO and CM, such that people in poor health tended to use CM regardless of their political leanings, but health status did not moderate the association between PO and CAM use.
Conclusions
The results show that political and socio-cultural views are associated with how the European lay public engages with healthcare and complementary/alternative services, but the relevant boundary lines do not lie along the left-right dimension. People who preferred parties favoring expanded freedoms were more likely to use complementary/alternative services, but likely for other reasons than to seek cures for diseases in a traditional biomedical sense. Concerns about corruption among the lay public may be more relevant for conventional healthcare than has been recognized.}

With the emergence of endocrine resistance, the survival and good prognosis of HR-positive breast cancer (HR + BC) patients are threatened. As a common complementary and alternative therapy in cancer treatment, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used, and its internal mechanisms have been increasingly explored.
Aim of the review
In this review, the development status and achievements in understanding of the mechanisms related to the anti-invasion and anti-metastasis effects of TCM against HR + BC and the reversal of endocrine drug resistance by TCM in recent years have been summarized to provide ideas for antitumour research on the active components of TCM/natural medicine.
Methods
We searched the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) (from inception to July 2023) with the key words “HR-positive breast cancer” or “HR-positive breast carcinoma”, “HR + BC” and “traditional Chinese medicine”, “TCM”, or “natural plant”, “herb”, etc., with the aim of elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine and natural medicine in the treatment of HR + BC.
Results
TCM/natural medicine monomers and formulas can regulate the expression of related genes and proteins through the PI3K/AKT, JAK2/STAT3, MAPK, Wnt and other signalling pathways, inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of HR + BC tumours, play a synergistic role in combination with endocrine drugs, and reverse endocrine drug resistance.
Conclusion
The wide variety of TCM/natural medicine components makes the research and development of new methods of TCM for BC treatments more selective and innovative. Although progress has been made on research on TCM/natural medicine, there are still many problems in clinical and basic experimental designs, and more in-depth scientific explorations and research are still needed.}

abstract = {Bioprinting is an annex of additive manufacturing, as defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, characterized by the automated deposition of living cells and biomaterials. The tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TE&RM) community has eagerly adopted bioprinting, while review articles regularly herald its imminent translation to the clinic as functional tissues and organs. Here we argue that such proclamations are premature and counterproductive; they place emphasis on technological progress while typically ignoring the critical stage-gates that must be passed through to bring a technology to market. We suggest the technology readiness level (TRL) scale as a valuable metric for gauging the relative maturity of a bioprinting technology in relation to how it has passed a series of key milestones. We suggest guidelines for a bioprinting-oriented scale and use this to discuss the state-of-the-art of bioprinting in regenerative medicine (BRM) today. Finally, we make corresponding recommendations for improvements to BRM research that would support its progression to clinical translation.}

In this article, we first describe the recent advances in RF treatment by several natural products and clarify their mechanisms of action. They can ameliorate the RF disease phenotype, which includes apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and EMT, by affecting relevant signaling pathways and molecular targets, thereby delaying or reversing fibrosis. We also present the roles of nanodrug delivery systems, which have been explored to address the drawback of low oral bioavailability of natural products.

abstract = {Background
Metabolomics is an emerging and powerful technology that offers a comprehensive view of an organism's physiological status. Although widely applied in human medicine, it is only recently making its introduction in veterinary medicine. As a result, validated metabolomics protocols in feline medicine are lacking at the moment. Since biological interpretation of metabolomics data can be misled by the extraction method used, species and matrix-specific optimized and validated metabolomic protocols are sorely needed.
Results
Systematic optimization was performed using fractional factorial experiments for both serum (n = 57) and urine (n = 24), evaluating dilution for both matrices, and aliquot and solvent volume, protein precipitation time and temperature for serum. For the targeted (n = 76) and untargeted (n = 1949) validation of serum respectively, excellent instrumental, intra-assay and inter-day precision were observed (CV ≤ 15% or 30%, respectively). Linearity deemed sufficient both targeted and untargeted (R2 ≥ 0.99 or 0.90, respectively). An appropriate targeted recovery between 70 and 130% was achieved. For the targeted (n = 69) and untargeted (n = 2348) validation of the urinary protocol, excellent instrumental and intra-assay precision were obtained (CV ≤ 15% or 30%, respectively). Subsequently, the discriminative ability of our metabolomics methods was confirmed for feline chronic kidney disease (CKD) by univariate statistics (n = 41 significant metabolites for serum, and n = 55 for urine, p-value<0.05) and validated OPLS-DA models (R2(Y) > 0.95, Q2(Y) > 0.65, p-value<0.001 for both matrices).
Significance
This study is the first to present an optimized and validated wholistic metabolomics methods for feline serum and urine using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. This robust methodology opens avenues for biomarker panel selection and a deeper understanding of feline CKD pathophysiology and other feline applications.}

The active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), such as naringin (NG), Eucommiol, isopsoralen, icariin, Astragalus polysaccharides, and chondroitin sulfate, contained in Drynariae Rhizoma, Eucommiae Cortex, Psoralea corylifolia, Herba Epimedii, Astragalus radix and deer antler, are considered promising candidates for enhancing the healing of osteoporotic defects due to their outstanding bone homeostasis regulating properties. They are commonly used to activate bone repair scaffolds.
Aim of the review
Bone repair scaffolds are inadequate to meet the demands of osteoporotic defect healing due to the lack of regulation of bone homeostasis. Therefore, selecting bone scaffolds activated with TCM to improve the therapeutic effect of repairing osteoporotic bone defects.
Materials and methods
To gather information on bone scaffold activated by traditional Chinese medicine, we conducted a thorough search of several scientific databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scifinder, Baidu Scholar, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI).
Results
This review discusses the mechanism of TCM active ingredients in regulating bone homeostasis, including stimulating bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption process and the healing mechanism of traditional bone repair scaffolds activated by them for osteoporotic defect healing.
Conclusion
In general, the introduction of TCM active ingredients provides a novel therapeutic approach for modulating bone homeostasis and facilitating osteoporotic defect healing, and also offers a new strategy for design of other unconventional bone defect healing materials.}

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease with intestinal tract as the main site. The pathogenic of UC has not yet been clarified, and multiple mechanisms can lead to the pathogenesis of UC. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers an opportunity for UC treatment. TCM has become the preferred treatment for UC with characteristics of multiple targets, multiple pathways and high safety. This review attempted to summarize the characteristics of TCM (compound prescriptions, single Chinese herbs, and active ingredients) for UC treatment and discussed their pathogenesis based on analyzing the UC-related gut microbiota, signaling pathway and cytokine. In order to provide more systematic and diverse reference for TCM in the prevention and treatment of UC, and provide theoretical reference for clinical treatment of UC.
Materials and methods
The information was acquired from different databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases. We then focused on the recent research progress in UC treatment by TCM. Finally, the deficiencies and future perspectives are proposed.
Results
Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the compound prescriptions (strengthening spleen, clearing heat and removing dampness, clearing heat and removing toxin), single Chinese herbs (replenishing Qi, clearing heat, tonifying blood, etc.), and active ingredients (alkaloids, polysaccharides, flavonoids, polyphenols, terpenes, etc.) have an efficiency in UC treatment by regulating gut microbiota, signaling pathway and cytokine.
Conclusions
TCM can achieve its purpose of UC prevention and treatment by acting in multiple ways, and TCM deserves further research and development in this field.}

Introduction
Climate change's severe impact on human health is becoming increasingly evident, particularly for vulnerable populations with serious illnesses. Climate-related extreme weather events are expected to increase demand for hospice and palliative care due to rising respiratory illnesses, heat-related issues, waterborne diseases, and aggravated chronic conditions. Our scoping review aimed to investigate the existing literature on climate change's impact on hospice and palliative medicine (HPM).
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search across various databases (e.g., Medline, EMbase, Web of Science, and Cochrane) using predefined climate change and HPM terms, resulting in 382 records. Following predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 44 articles were selected for full-text review, and 20 were included for final analysis. In light of the limited literature on climate change's impact on HPM, we also sought narratives from HPM practitioners from across the world on their experiences in a changing climate.
Results
Six major themes emerged: 1) The impact of climate change on HPM in low-income countries, 2) Descriptive pieces on climate change, climate disasters, and HPM, 3) Morbidity and mortality after climate disasters in the seriously ill population, 4) Discussion of euthanasia during climate disasters, 5) Recommendations and frameworks for disaster response in the field of HPM, 6) Carbon footprint of hospices. Additionally, narratives from HPM practitioners highlighted the disruptive effects of climate disasters on seriously ill patients and their caregivers as disasters caused care interruptions, reduced access to crucial health infrastructure, exacerbations of illness, accelerated disease progression, and increased morbidity and mortality.
Conclusion
Existing research on climate change's impact on HPM is primarily anecdotal and descriptive, with a focus on climate-related disasters. Narratives from HPM practitioners worldwide underscore the disproportionate impact of climate disasters on seriously ill patients. Further research is necessary to comprehensively understand climate's intricate effects on HPM and to assess adaptable, mitigative, and resilient solutions against its adverse impacts.}

In the first level of health care, the timely detection of breast cancer is essential to prevent the progression of the disease, obtain optimal treatment and improve the prognosis and survival of patients. The objective of this study was to analyze the opportunity in referral to the Preventive Medicine Modules offered to women aged 40 to 69 years of the Family Medicine Unit 1, of the Mexican Social Security Institute, Decentralized Administrative Operation Body, Aguascalientes, Mexico, by their family physician, and its impact in the findings of mammographic screening according to the BI-RADS classification. Methods This was a cross-sectional comparative study of 412 mammograms performed on women aged 40 to 69, who were treated in the preventive medicine modules from January 2019 to June 2021. Data collection was carried out by simple random sampling using a checklist. Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age were applied.
Results
A total of 90.29% of the patients who underwent screening mammography were not referred in a timely manner to the preventive medicine modules by the family physician, this delay in diagnosis and treatment increased by 3.01 times the probability of having a classification BI-RADS suspected of malignancy compared to those women whose referral was timely (OR adj = 3.01, 95% CI 1.04–8.72, p = 0.041).

Now, we see another revolution—the advancement from percutaneous procedures to minimally invasive surgical procedures. Despite these changes, Pain Medicine fellowships have consistently been recognized as a competitive subspecialty with more applicants than the number of available positions – until now. The most recent pain fellowship match suggests an abrupt change to the popularity of the specialty (with over 61 unmatched positions and over 35 unfilled programs) for applicants expected to matriculate in the year 2024 [1]. Unfilled positions have risen from 5% to 15% in the past three years. Similarly, unfilled programs have risen from 10% to 30% in the past three years. Several reasons for this sudden change in popularity have been proposed, including a lucrative general anesthesiology market, increasing difficulties with insurance coverage and reimbursement for procedures, and a dearth of advanced pain procedures performed at academic medicine programs. The field is at a critical juncture, necessitating ongoing discussions and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure that trainees are attracted to this dynamic field and are ultimately equipped to meet the evolving needs of patients.}

abstract = {By a comparison between the definition of life and death in Modern Medicine and Avicenna's view, it is perceived that each of them has looked at the above concepts from their special perspective. The topic of Avicenna's view is the being of life and the topic of Modern Medicine is the origin, appearance, and impressions of life. In his philosophical and medical works, Avicenna described the separation of the soul from the body as the ultimate reason for ceasing life. On the other, with the accepted medical standards, death is attributed to the organs in the human body and relies on the function or lack of function in the body's organs. Despite the differences between these two fields of knowledge, there can be collaboration between science and philosophy to achieve significant results in this regard to make useful contributions to the clarification of the concept of life and death. The findings of the study demonstrate that although the question of life and death is investigated in Avicenna's philosophy as a transcendental issue and in modern medicine as a material one, a general-specific relationship can be made between science and philosophy in defining the concept of life and death in the natural world domain.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine together play an important value in the modern medicine system that is different from that of chemical drugs. Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine with hemostatic effect have unique advantages and development potential in the prevention and treatment of clinical hemorrhagic diseases, reflecting multi-component, multi-target and multi-pathway effects.
Aim of the study
In this paper, the active ingredients related to the hemostatic effect of traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine are taken as the starting point, and the traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine with traditional hemostatic purposes are reviewed, and the existing research progress on the active ingredients and their mechanism of action of these drugs is systematically expounded, aiming to provide theoretical reference for the development of traditional hemostatic drugs, the discovery of hemostatic active ingredients and the research of new hemostatic methods.
Materials and methods
Hemostatic chinese medicine and ethnic medicine were collected and summarized from the classic books of Materia Medica, public literature database and doctoral or master's thesis repositories. At the same time, we discussed the classification of various types of hemostatic active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine according to the different mechanisms of hemostasis.
Results
A total of 436 traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicine with hemostatic effects have been collected, and their hemostatic active ingredients include alkaloids, quinones, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, organic acids, amino acids, terpenoids, steroids, phenols, tannins, esters, polysaccharides and herbal extracts, etc. These active ingredients accelerate the formation of hemostasis by improving endogenous and exogenous hemostatic pathways mainly through enhancing vascular wall contraction, increasing platelet aggregation, promoting coagulation system activation and inhibiting fibrinolysis.
Conclusions
This article reviews the previous data on various aspects of the hemostatic effect of traditional Chinese medicine and ethnomedicine. Many traditional hemostatic drugs have been discovered and many active ingredients and mechanisms have been reported. However, although there are a large number of drugs with traditional hemostatic effects, there are still few developed and applied. At the same time, the hemostatic components of many drugs still remain in the study of the activity of their total extracts, and the potential link between some drug components achieving hemostatic effects through different mechanisms remains to be elucidated.}

1. Through a review of exam outlines, participants will realize the lack of consistency in the end-of-life ethics content between residencies that lead into HPM fellowship. 2. Participants will recognize the relevance of standardizing ethics education across HPM fellowship programs.
Key Message
Ethics training is essential to hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) training. Ten residencies feed into HPM fellowship, but clinical ethics tested on board certification exams vary in content and weight across specialties. Given this variance, standardizing end of life ethics training for HPM fellowship programs presents an opportunity for educational improvement.
Introduction
The essence of end-of-life (EOL) communication stems from understanding modern bioethical principles and how they relate to topics such as informed consent, advance directives, DNR, surrogate decision-making, decision-making capacity, artificial nutrition and hydration, advance care planning/goal setting, and withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.1 Hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) training involves teaching fellows relevant ethics topics, acclimating them with discussing and handling ethical dilemmas with cultural humility and gaining the perspectives of involved stakeholders.2 There are ten residency programs (Anesthesiology, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, OBGYN, Pediatrics, PMR, Psychiatry and Neurology, Radiology, and Surgery) which can lead into HPM fellowship. However, EOL ethics tested on board certification exams vary in content and weight across specialties.
Objectives
This study reviewed EOL ethics content tested by board certification exams from residencies that lead into HPM fellowship across specialties.
Methods
This study analyzed relative frequencies of EOL ethics categories across and within specialties from the respective board certification exam content outline.
Results
The relative frequencies of categories across specialties were 23.5% informed consent; 17.6% advance directives; 11.8% DNR; 11.8% surrogate decision-making; 11.8% decision-making capacity; 11.8% advance care planning/goal setting; and 11.8% withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. The relative frequencies of categories within specialties were 28.1% Surgery; 15.6% Emergency Medicine; 12.5% Anesthesiology; 12.5% Internal Medicine; 9.4% Psychiatry and Neurology; 6.3% Family Medicine; 6.3% Obstetrics and Gynecology; 6.3% Pediatrics; 3.1% PMR; and 0% Radiology.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that end-of-life ethics content tested on these board certification exams vary across specialties. Given this variance, standardizing end-of-life ethics training for HPM fellowship programs presents an opportunity for educational improvement.

Given the adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes associated with RhD alloimmunization, prevention of maternal sensitization is essential in RhD–negative patients who may experience subsequent pregnancies. In care settings in which RhD testing and RhIg administration are logistically and financially feasible and do not hinder access to abortion care, we recommend offering both RhD testing and RhIg administration for spontaneous and induced abortion at <12 weeks of gestation in unsensitized, RhD–negative individuals. Guidelines for RhD testing and RhIg administration in the first trimester must balance the prevention of alloimmunization with the individual- and population-level harms of restricted access to abortion.}

abstract = {Background
The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) has not been translated into Bosnian, nor has a study been conducted employing a sample of family medicine physicians and nurses to examine the instrument's reliability, validity, and factorial structure. Thus, the goal of this study was to investigate the reliability and construct validity of the Bosnian version of the PSS-10 among family medicine professionals.
Study design
Cross-sectional descriptive study provided among healthcare professionals in family medicine, using Google forms questionnaire (PSS-10) in Bosnian language.
Methods
Translation of PSS-10 in Bosnian is performed according to the proposed set of standardized guidelines. The questionnaire was sent on the email addresses of family physicians and nurses in whole Bosnia and Herzegovina. The collected data were subjected to reliability testing, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, which tested three alternative plausible models suggested by the extant literature: single factor, correlated two-factor and bifactor.
Results
A total of 272 out of 440 (RR = 61.3) nurses and physician working in family medicine in Bosnia and Herzegovina completed the PSS-10 Bosnia and Herzegovina version (BH). Participants were aged 25 to 69, with a mean age of 44.7 (±10.55). Most participants were women (86.8%) and physicians (58.8%) with specialisation in family medicine (43%). The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.87 and the test–retest reliability coefficient was 0.88. Exploratory Factor Analysis yielded 2 factors with eigenvalues of 4.77 and 1.35, accounting for 61.2% of variance. Factor 1 consisted of 6 items representing ‘’perceived distress'’, whereas Factor 2 consisted of 4 items representing ‘’perceived coping’’. The Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a very good fit of this bifactor model to this sample.
Conclusions
Our results implies that the PSS-10-BH, as a bifactor model with good reliability and validity, may accurately measure the stress levels of family medicine physicians and nurses.}

This paper explores the historical development of standardised dosages in Western herbal medicine, highlighting the contributions of Eclectic physicians, the role of the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia of 1983, and the influence of prominent figures such as Scudder and Lloyd. The paper also highlights the progress made by China and India to establish universal dosage guidelines. However, for African Traditional Medicine, determining herbal medicine dosages remains a challenge primarily due to the extensive array of indigenous healing practices, limited resources for clinical research, and the absence of well-documented traditional medical knowledge. To address this challenge, a comprehensive strategy is proposed that encourages collaboration between traditional healers and scientists, ethnopharmacological and ethnobotanical research, and supports culturally sensitive clinical trials. This holistic approach emphasises the fusion of age-old wisdom with cutting-edge science to ensure the safety and efficacy of herbal medicine, as well as bridge the global gap in herbal medicine dosages while respecting diverse indigenous healing traditions.}

Suicide attempts by consuming poisonous native plants are more frequent in Asia than in the West. In East Asian traditional medicine (EATM), herbal materials are routinely used as the primary treatment method; however, some medicinal herbs are toxic and can cause death. This review investigated the herbal materials used in EATM for suicide.
Methods
Fourteen databases were searched for articles published on suicidal use of EATM until September 7, 2022. Observational studies reporting the suicidal use of EATM herbal medicines were included. Study Quality Assessment Tools developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute were used to assess methodological quality of included studies. Due to substantial heterogeneity a meta-analysis was not conducted and the results are narrated.
Results
Nine case reports and one retrospective cohort study involving 81 patients were included in the analysis. One suicide attempt resulted in death, but all the other patients survived. The suicide attempts involved the use of topical medications, such as Red Flower Oil; herbal compositions, such as Kyushin and Niuhuang-Jiedu-Pian; and single herbs, such as Mylabris, Aconiti Tuber, Pruni Semen, and Ephedrae Herba. In most cases, gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in the blood concentration of a specific substance, or an abnormal electrocardiography finding were reported. The methodological quality of included studies was generally poor.
Conclusion
Access to toxic herbs that can be consumed to attempt suicide should be regulated through government-level management. Further research should be conducted to properly monitor and strategize safe use of herbal materials.}

abstract = {Introduction
Ischaemic stroke often leaves serious sequelae affecting patients' daily activities and quality of life, especially shoulder pain. Shoulder pain after stroke often occurs in the first 3 months with an occurrence rate of 25–72% due to the strong natural neurological mechanism during the time, interferes with the recovery of motor function, increases hospital stay, is associated with depression, and limits mobility as well as inhibits treatment results. In Vietnam, Traditional Medicine (TM) has played an essential role in treating and rehabilitating shoulder pain after stroke for quite a long time. Studies on the pathology of shoulder pain (Jian Tong) after stroke in TM in Vietnam are still inadequate. Therefore, this study evaluated the severity and characteristics of post-stroke Jian Tong in patients with ischaemic stroke.
Methods
The study was conducted from January 1, 2023–May 1, 2023. The study consisted of two phases: Phase 1: Searching TM documents and selecting the characteristics that appear in the documents as components for the questionnaire of phase 2. Phase 2: Conduct a cross-sectional study to investigate the characteristics of Jian Tong in 65 patients after ischaemic stroke in the early rehabilitation phase.
Results
In phase 1, the study encoded 17 features of Jian Tong from 10 literary documents. In phase 2, we surveyed over 65 patients, and the result was that shoulder pain aggravated by exertion had the highest rate, whereas shoulder pain alleviated by cold and distended shoulder had the fewest. Pain level measured by Number Rating Scale (NRS) points and gender was significantly related to the characteristics of TM shoulder pain – Jian Tong (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
The study demonstrated the pain level and the characteristics of Jian Tong in patients with ischaemic stroke in the early rehabilitation phase to contribute to the process of personalized diagnosing and treating Jian Tong after stroke for each patient, especially based on the theoretical basis and reasoning methods of Traditional Medicine.}

Study Objective
To identify knowledge gaps in business education among obstetrics and gynecology fellows
Methods
An online anonymous survey was distributed to obstetrics and gynecology subspecialty fellows, including pediatric and adolescent gynecology, minimally invasive gynecologic surgery, and reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellows.
Results
Of the 483 fellows who received the questionnaire, 159 completed the surveys, resulting in a response rate of 32.9%. A total of 80 reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellows (50.3%), 47 minimally invasive gynecologic surgery fellows (29.6%), and 32 pediatric and adolescent gynecology (20.1%) fellows completed the survey. Over half reported debt from either undergraduate or medical school (52.2%). Over half (58.5%) reported 0 hours of finance education in their residency or fellowship training. In general, fellows reported relatively higher levels of confidence in nonmedical aspects of business, such as purchasing a home (63.9%), life and disability insurance (57.2%), and making financial plans for the future (57.9%). Conversely, a large portion of fellows reported feeling “not at all confident” in business topics related to the field of medicine, including contract negotiation (24.7%), non-competes (27.1%), relative value units system–based pay (32.0%), general office practice management (58.2%), legal aspects of business (71.8%), accounting and billing (54.4%), and marketing (55.7%).
Conclusion
Our survey demonstrates an unmet demand among obstetrics and gynecology fellows to learn topics related to the business of medicine. Knowledge of these topics is critical for those pursuing private practice or academic medicine. Future initiatives should evaluate other subspecialties and prioritize creating a standardized education tool to better prepare trainees entering medical practice.}

abstract = {Background
More than half of all heart failure (HF) patients have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). The combination of traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs) with Western medicine treatment (WMT) has been reported to have better efficacy than using WMT alone. However, the positive effects of TCMIs combined with WMT on HFrEF and HFmrEF require more comprehensive and systematic evidence and warrant further investigation.
Methods
The NMA searched eight databases, including four English and four Chinese, from database creation to November 10, 2022. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (ROB 2) to assess the selected studies' quality. OpenBUGS and STATA 17.0 were used for network meta-analysis.
Results
The 101 RCTs were included in the systematic review. Studies have shown that when combined with any of the five TCMIs, WMT was more efficient than WMT alone. Shenmai injection (SMI) + WMT may be the best treatment for clinical effectiveness rate (CER) improvement and b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) reduction. Huangqi injection (HQI) + WMT was the best treatment for improving left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Danhong injection (DHI) + WMT may be the best treatment for lowering left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD). Xinmailong injection (XMLI) + WMT was likely the best treatment for increasing the 6-min walking test (6MWT). In addition, XMLI had the lowest incidence of adverse reactions (3.38%).
Conclusions
Shenfu injection (SFI), SMI, DHI, XMLI, and HQI combined with WMT have stronger efficiency in treating HFrEF and HFmrEF. However, as all studies were conducted in China, this review is limited by the inevitable selection bias, and further high-quality multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required.}

Wilderness medicine education is one of the fastest growing facets of both graduate and undergraduate medical education. Currently, there are curriculum guidelines for both student electives and fellowships in wilderness medicine. However, there are no guidelines for resident elective curricula. The student/resident education committee of the Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) convened a task force to develop curriculum guidelines for these electives.
Methods
A survey of previously described core wilderness medicine topics was sent to a cohort of educators involved in wilderness medicine resident electives. They were asked to rank topics on the basis of their importance of being included on a Likert scale. Multivariate analysis of medians was used to distinguish among topics to determine which topics were voted most and least necessary for a curriculum.
Results
Of the database members contacted, 35 responded to the survey. The described current state of residency electives was that 16 institutions offered their own elective (46%). For subject preferences, multivariate analysis of scoring distribution medians demonstrated a significantly higher pattern of responses (P<0.01) for subjects with a median of 3 (must include) than for the lowest-scoring subjects that had a median of 1 (can include). Every topic was rated “must” by at least 1 respondent. Topics were further subdivided into an educational framework reflecting a common approach to education of wilderness medicine fellows focusing on education, leadership, knowledge, and skills.
Conclusions
There was a wide variety in the ranking of topics; however, there were multiple topics on which a consensus for inclusion was reached. These topics are organized and presented here as a suggested curriculum by the student/resident education committee of the WMS.}

abstract = {This study focuses on hospital doctors' experiences of work during the pandemic. The context is the Irish health system, under considerable strain due to the pandemic and a legacy of austerity/under-funding. Although medicine is considered a prestigious job, hospital doctors often endure challenging working conditions and work-life imbalance. In this paper we consider how a narrative of ‘medicine-as-vocation’ is used to excuse challenging working conditions and to impede change. West and Coia (2019) proposed a set of core work needs required to support doctor wellbeing and minimise work-related stress, i.e. autonomy/control, belonging and competence and these are applied as a lens to examine the everyday work experiences of respondent hospital doctors. Data collection was conducted in 2021 using a remote ethnographic method – Mobile Instant Messaging Ethnography (MIME) - developed by the research team to enable data collection at a time of pandemic restrictions (Humphries, Byrne, et al, 2022). Twenty-eight hospital doctors were recruited for the study. Each respondent was interviewed twice and engaged in a 12-week conversation with the research team via WhatsApp. We report hospital doctors' experiences of heavy workloads, weak line management and the challenges of influencing change at work. Overall, the findings presented demonstrate the myriad ways that Ireland is failing to meet the core work needs of its hospital doctors and how ‘medicine-as-vocation’ is used to justify organisational neglect.}

abstract = {Background
Cancer is a global public health problem, requiring efficient health system investments to deliver sustainable impact on population health. Access to medicines is a critical component of health systems, having a crucial role in delivering therapeutic benefits. Since 1977, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) that includes key health interventions for the prevention and control of conditions of public health relevance. Essential medicines are selected for inclusion in the EML based on the evidence of efficacy, safety, therapeutic value, and the potential to impact population health. With the rapid changes in the therapeutic landscape of cancer treatment with new medicine approvals, there is a critical need to select and prioritise specific cancer interventions based on their intrinsic value.
Materials and methods
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has developed a decisional methodology based on a threshold with a minimum set of technical specifications and a consensus-based procedure for decisions to select candidate cancer medicines to be submitted to the WHO for consideration for the WHO EML.
Results
ESMO recognises the WHO EML as an important reference guide for medicines that all countries should include in their national EMLs. Cancer medicines on the WHO EML are used in the treatment of the majority of cancers, and are recommended in the evidence-based ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines that medical oncologists use to treat patients. ESMO’s submissions to the WHO EML in 2019 and 2021 and their respective outcomes are presented in the manuscript.
Conclusion
Due to the rising costs associated with newly available therapies, structured, reproducible, and field-tested tools to evaluate the added clinical benefit from these therapies need to be implemented in pre-selecting potential candidate medicines to be included in the WHO EML. ESMO is proud to collaborate closely with WHO on this important global public health initiative.}

abstract = {Due to its complex composition, herbal medicine requires unique strategies and techniques to verify its integrity and quality. Hence, various instrumental methods have been employed in recent years to analyze medicinal plants. One of the most imperative techniques for studying medicinal plants is thermal analysis (TA) methods. TA characterizes the chemical and physical properties of substances as the sample's temperature increases or decreases. TA techniques find application in an increasingly wide range of areas, including qualitative and quantitative analysis, the characterization of physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of herbal medicines, and the acquisition of additional information about their structure. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are the main thermoanalytical approaches in analyzing herbal medicine. This review demonstrates the applications of TA methods in analyzing herbal medicine. The highlights of this investigation bring appreciated insight into the indication of the capability of TA methods to inspect the chemical and physical properties of herbal medicines.}
