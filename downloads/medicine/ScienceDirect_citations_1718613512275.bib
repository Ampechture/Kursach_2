abstract = {Quantum dots (QDs) have attracted attention for their application and commercialization in all industrial fields, including communications, displays, and solar cells, due to their excellent optical properties based on the quantum size effect. In recent years, the development of QDs that do not contain cadmium which is toxic to cells and living organisms, has progressed, and they have attracted considerable attention in the bio-imaging field for targeting molecules and cells. Furthermore, recently, the need for diagnostics and treatment at the single molecule and single cell level in the medical field has been increasing, and the application of QDs in the medical field is also accelerating. Therefore, this paper outlines the frontiers of diagnostic and therapeutic applications (theranostics) of QDs, especially in advanced medical fields such as regenerative medicine, oncology, and infectious diseases.}

FIM researchers are working urgently to build evidence for FIM programs’ cost-effectiveness by showing improvements in health outcomes and health care utilization. However, primary collection of this data is costly, difficult to implement, and burdensome to participants. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer a promising alternative to primary data collection because they provide already-collected information from existing clinical care. A few FIM studies have leveraged EHRs to demonstrate positive impacts on biomarkers or health care utilization, but many FIM studies run into insurmountable difficulties in their attempts to use EHRs. The authors of this commentary serve as evaluators and/or technical assistance providers with the United States Department of Agriculture’s Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program National Training, Technical Assistance, Evaluation, and Information Center. They work closely with over 100 Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program Produce Prescription FIM projects, which, as of 2023, span 34 US states and territories. In this commentary, we describe recurring challenges related to using EHRs in FIM evaluation, particularly in relation to biomarkers and health care utilization. We also outline potential opportunities and reasonable expectations for what can be learned from EHR data and describe other (non-EHR) data sources to consider for evaluation of long-term health outcomes and health care utilization. Large integrated health systems may be best positioned to use their own data to examine outcomes of interest to the broader field.}

Progress in the use of positron emission tomography (PET) in children with cancer has been relatively restrained compared to adults due to radiation concerns, limited research, availability, and the practical challenges associated with imaging young children. However, there have been several developments in the last decade and the role of molecular imaging in paediatric oncology will only broaden with forthcoming novel tracers and molecular radiotherapy. This review article summarises the practical aspects of nuclear imaging in paediatric oncology, discusses the main imaging methods including PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), appraises the available established and novel tracers, and summarises the evidence behind molecular imaging in paediatric lymphoma, neuroblastoma, sarcomas, thyroid cancer and other tumours. 18F-FDG PET/CT is the established method for staging and response assessment after induction chemotherapy in paediatric Hodgkin lymphoma and has high sensitivity for the detection of bone marrow disease, reducing the need for bone marrow biopsy in some cases. 123I-mIBG planar with SPECT imaging remains the mainstay for neuroblastoma imaging, however there is a well-established role for 18F-FDG PET/CT in mIBG non-avid disease, and 18F-DOPA and 68Ga-DOTA PET tracers have shown promising results as upcoming alternatives. 18F-FDG PET/CT is advocated in the staging assessment of rhabdomyosarcoma and has been shown to have excellent sensitivity in the detection of bone metastases in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, although standard chest CT is still recommended for the detection of lung metastases. The role of PET in germ cell tumours, hepatoblastoma, Wilms tumour and Langerhans cell histiocytosis is complementary to standard techniques.}

As a result, research in the field of genomic sequencing is currently underway to improve survival rates by identifying actionable genetic sequences and tailoring treatments for specific types of PDAC. The advancement of scientific and technological tools has led to the discovery of more than 300 PDAC genomes/exomes through various sequencing techniques. Due to this discovery, there is a drive to utilize precision medicine techniques. Precision medicine is the personalization of medicine or the customization of medical treatments to meet the specific needs of individual patients. More specifically, in PDAC, there are many targets currently being identified that may serve as areas for future treatments. Although there is some overlap, these targets can be divided into whether they are targets of chemotherapy treatments, targets of immunotherapy treatments, or a combination of the two. This chapter will focus on the targets of immunotherapy treatments. This includes but is not limited to targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, targeting extracellular matrix, vaccine therapy, and immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy.}

abstract = {Background
To meet the growing global demand for rehabilitation services, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched Rehabilitation 2030. This study was commissioned by the WHO to investigate the integration degree of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in Chinese health system rehabilitation services and the demand for TCM rehabilitation in China.
Methods
Twenty TCM rehabilitation experts and relevant government administrators were invited to complete the questionnaire between September 2019 and January 2022. The development of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCI) rehabilitation in China was assessed primarily based on six different health system components.
Results
26 policies, regulations, and national strategic plans related to TCI rehabilitation were issued by relevant government departments since 2002; notably, 14 policies related to TCI rehabilitation development were intensively introduced from 2016 to 2021. These policies cover the three main areas of financing, infrastructure development, and service delivery. The National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine's investment in TCM clinical capacity infrastructure and scientific research in 2019–2021 increased by 66% compared to 2010–2012, and the average number of TCM hospitals with rehabilitation departments in 2020 increased by 6.5% compared to 2018. The proportion of community health service centers providing TCM services in primary medical and health institutions has increased by 30.8% over the past 10 years.
Conclusion
Long-term continuous policies, substantial financial investment, and expansion of the scope of TCI rehabilitation services in primary care institutions have effectively contributed to the rapid development of TCI rehabilitation. However, human resources and financing mechanisms for TCI rehabilitation need further improvement.}

abstract = {Background
Food insecurity is associated with poor glycemic control and increased risk for diabetes-related complications. The clinical benefit of addressing these challenges through a medically supportive grocery prescription (GRx) program in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) remains unclear. We report the aims and design of a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-month GRx intervention on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels among low-income adults with T2D.
Methods
The Kaiser Permanente Evaluating Nutritional Interventions in Food-Insecure High-Risk Adults (KP ENRICH) Study is a pragmatic randomized trial enrolling 1100 participants within Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Southern California, two integrated health care delivery systems serving >9 million members. Medicaid-insured adults with T2D and baseline HbA1c ≥7.5% will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to either GRx, delivered as $100 per month for select items from among a curated list of healthful food groups in an online grocery ordering and home-delivery platform along with biweekly digital nutrition educational materials, or control, consisting of free membership and deliveries from the online grocery platform but without curated food groups or purchasing dollars. The primary outcome is 6-month change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes include 12-month change in HbA1c, and 6- and 12-month change in medical resource utilization, food security, nutrition security, dietary habits, diabetes-related quality of life, and dietary self-efficacy.
Conclusions
The results of this large randomized clinical trial of GRx will help inform future policy and health system-based initiatives to improve food and nutrition security, disease management, and health equity among patients with T2D.}

abstract = {Introduction
Healthcare facilities and medical providers are not immune to aggression and threat from terrorists, criminals and rogue states. The concept of Hybrid Warfare is often described as a mix of conventional warfare, irregular warfare, terrorism, criminality and different types of other hybrid threats such as cyberattacks and drone technology. Healthcare systems can either be primary or secondary targets of hybrid warfare with potentially devastating consequences.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to serve as a primer for clinicians, researchers and emergency managers in understanding the basic aspects of hybrid warfare, how healthcare can be affected, and to provide a framework for mitigation and resilience, especially in an emergency medicine setting. Different hybrid threats and their effect on emergency medicine, and healthcare in general, is discussed.
Discussion
Hybrid warfare is an increasing, multimodal, threat for all segments of healthcare, particularly prehospital care and emergency medicine. Disrupting the healthcare system in a country using hybrid warfare has the ultimate aim of destabilizing organizations and society as well as directly reducing the effectiveness and capabilities of healthcare as a key strategic resource. In this aspect prehospital care and emergency medicine are main targets of aggression.
Conclusion
Clinicians and healthcare managers of all levels should have a basic knowledge of the different components of hybrid warfare so as to mitigate effects of an attack. It is suggested that an emergency department do not aim to create totally new solutions for hybrid threats but use an all hazards approach and the available guidelines for handling generic threats. However, there must be a preparedness for the different ways hybrid warfare can play out, how the threats can be combined in synergistic ways and the potential compounding effects on healthcare and society.}

This study employs Geodetector models to analyze the factors affecting TCM service utilization, providing the first examination of spatial distribution patterns and influencing factors for both TCM outpatient (TCMOSU) and inpatient services (TCMISU). The findings of this study reveal spatial disparities across China's provinces, showing a prevalence of TCMOSU in the east and TCMISU decreasing from southwest to northeast. Global Moran's I autocorrelation analysis revealed a positive spatial correlation between TCMOSU and TCMISU across Chinese provinces, suggesting spatial clustering and the potential for interregional collaboration in the development of TCM services. Local Moran's I autocorrelation analysis revealed clusters of TCMOSU in wealthier eastern provinces, such as Jiangsu and Tianjin, and clusters of TCMISU in the southwest. Factor detector analysis revealed that disposable income per capita was the most significant factor linking higher incomes with increased TCMOSU. In contrast, TCMISU was primarily influenced by demographic factors, such as the illiteracy rate and population urbanization rate, emphasizing traditional practices in lower education regions. Interaction detector analysis revealed the joint effects of these factors, demonstrating how regional economic status, health status, and healthcare resource indicators interact with other factors for TCMOSU and how demographic factors significantly influence the prevalence of TCMISU. This study highlights the importance of considering health status together with regional economic, demographic, and healthcare resources when formulating TCM healthcare policies and allocating such resources in China. Promoting the balanced and coordinated regional development of TCM services across the country requires the development of strategies that account for these varied regional characteristics.}

Polysaccharides, predominantly extracted from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs such as Lycium barbarum, Angelica sinensis, Astragalus membranaceus, Dendrobium officinale, Ganoderma lucidum, and Poria cocos, represent principal bioactive constituents extensively utilized in Chinese medicine. These compounds have demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory capabilities, especially anti-liver injury activities, while exhibiting minimal adverse effects. This review summarized recent studies to elucidate the hepatoprotective efficacy and underlying molecular mechanisms of these herbal polysaccharides. It underscored the role of these polysaccharides in regulating hepatic function, enhancing immunological responses, and improving antioxidant capacities, thus contributing to the attenuation of hepatocyte apoptosis and liver protection. Analyses of molecular pathways in these studies revealed the intricate and indispensable functions of traditional Chinese herbal polysaccharides in liver injury management. Therefore, this review provides a thorough examination of the hepatoprotective attributes and molecular mechanisms of these medicinal polysaccharides, thereby offering valuable insights for the advancement of polysaccharide-based therapeutic research and their potential clinical applications in liver disease treatment.}

abstract = {Background
Despite improvements in health insurance coverage, out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending remains a public health issue in Peru, and OOP payment has implications for disease treatment in ethnic minorities. We aimed to analyze the ethnic disparities in the OOP payment and estimate the gaps related to observable risk factors in the OOP payment on medicines by ethnic conditions during 2014–2016 in Peru.
Study design
cross-sectional study.
Methods
We conducted a secondary data analysis using the National Health User Satisfaction Survey. The outcome was the participants' OOP payment in self-reported medications. Ethnic minorities were considered participants who habitually spoke a language other than Spanish at home. Crude and adjusted linear regression models were performed, and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method was used to assess the OPP payment differential by ethnic minority condition, explained by their individual and sociodemographic characteristics.
Results
We analyzed 11,346 surveyed, the mean age was 40.78 years, and 57.67 % were women. There was lower OOP payment in medications among ethnic minorities in the adjusted analysis (Beta coefficient [β]: −0.11; 95 % confidence interval [95%CI]: −0.21 to −0.01; p = 0.043). In the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis, a gap of 0.19 USD in the OOP payment in medicines among ethnic minorities was found (p < 0.001), and the explained component by the variables measured in this research only represents 40.5 % of the gap (p = 0.001).
Conclusion
There was less OOP expenditure on medicines in ethnic minorities. However, the measured variables explain only 40.5 % of these gaps. Therefore, we recommend future research that measures other variables that explain aspects of OOP spending on medicines not identified in this research. Likewise, our findings can be used to establish policies with an intercultural approach that adapt health documents to native languages or are disseminated by trained people from their communities.}

abstract = {Liver fibrosis is a pathological condition characterized by replacement of normal liver tissue with scar tissue, and also the leading cause of liver-related death worldwide. During the treatment of liver fibrosis, in addition to antiviral therapy or removal of inducers, there remains a lack of specific and effective treatment strategies. For thousands of years, Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have been widely used to treat liver fibrosis in clinical setting. CHMs are effective for liver fibrosis, though its mechanisms of action are unclear. In recent years, many studies have attempted to determine the possible mechanisms of action of CHMs in treating liver fibrosis. There have been substantial improvements in the experimental investigation of CHMs which have greatly promoted the understanding of anti-liver fibrosis mechanisms. In this review, the role of CHMs in the treatment of liver fibrosis is described, based on studies over the past decade, which has addressed the various mechanisms and signaling pathways that mediate therapeutic efficacy. Among them, inhibition of stellate cell activation is identified as the most common mechanism. This article provides insights into the research direction of CHMs, in order to expand its clinical application range and improve its effectiveness.}

This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is intended to provide clinicians with an overview on obesity, thrombosis, venous disease, lymphatic disease, and lipedema.
Methods
The scientific support for this CPS is based upon published citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by the Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
Topics in this CPS include obesity, thrombosis, venous disease, lymphatic disease, and lipedema. Obesity increases the risk of thrombosis and cardiovascular disease via fat mass and adiposopathic mechanisms. Treatment of thrombosis or thrombotic risk includes healthful nutrition, physical activity, and the requisite knowledge of how body weight affects anti-thrombotic medications. In addition to obesity-related thrombotic considerations of acute coronary syndrome and ischemic non-hemorrhagic stroke, this Clinical Practice Statement briefly reviews the diagnosis and management of clinically relevant presentations of deep vein thromboses, pulmonary embolism, chronic venous stasis, varicose veins, superficial thrombophlebitis, lipodermatosclerosis, corona phlebectatica, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, iliofemoral venous obstruction, pelvic venous disorder, post-thrombotic syndrome, as well as lymphedema and lipedema – which should be included in the differential diagnosis of other edematous or enlargement disorders of the lower extremities.
Conclusions
This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) on obesity, thrombosis, and venous/lymphatic disease is one of a series of OMA CPSs designed to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of obesity.}

abstract = {Introduction
Bulgaria has healing traditions now classified as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which is gaining popularity but is not yet considered part of the national healthcare system. Integrating CAM with conventional treatments at a primary care (PC) level could provide cost-effective solutions to the rising inpatient expenditures and the increasing misuse of antibiotics in the country. However, there is no national agreement on how CAM should be integrated into medical and pharmacy education. The study aimed to conduct a needs assessment for CAM education identifying the knowledge, attitudes and practices among university students and PC professionals.
Methods
The cross-sectional online self-administered survey took part from April to October 2021 among students and PC professionals. Four instruments were developed with identical structures specifically targeting general practitioners and pharmacists, medical and pharmaceutical students. They were invited to participate through their official, professional and academic platforms. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data.
Results
Overall, 393 volunteers participated, 185 professionals and 208 students. Although, 24% of the professionals and 28% of the students knew about CAM, more than 50% of the participants would like to know more about CAM and the different CAM modalities like anthroposophic medicine, Tibetan medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine, osteopathy, yoga and Ayurveda. The study found that a high percentage of participants reported using CAM to maintain their health. Homeopathy, folk medicine, phytotherapy, apitherapy, aromatherapy, Schussler therapy, and Flower therapy were among the most commonly practiced modalities. The results suggest that CAM education is necessary but should be evidence-based.
Conclusions
This survey has identified deficiencies in training on CAM education. The inclusion of CAM into the education curriculum can broaden professional perspectives and address the needs of consumers. Therefore, this study advocates for the establishment of a national consensus on integrating CAM education into both graduate and postgraduate programs within the framework of integrative medicine and One Health philosophy, fostering effective partnerships among all healthcare professionals and facilitating harmonious and impactful collaborations between all therapeutic and preventive modalities.

abstract = {Purpose
This study examines the rates and trends of faculty promotions within the field of ophthalmology, with comparative emphasis on the rates of promotion among underrepresented in medicine (URiM) faculty.
Design
A retrospective panel study was conducted using the Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster database.
Methods
We used the Association of American Medical Colleges Faculty Roster data to assess trends in academic faculty promotions within U.S. ophthalmology departments. Full-time assistant and associate professors appointed between 2000 and 2010 were included in the analysis, and tracked until November 2021 to determine promotion rates. Pearson χ2 and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate differences in promotion and retention rates based on gender, race and ethnicity, advanced degree, and tenure status.
Results
The demographics of 1436 assistant and 680 associate faculty members were obtained for analysis through the Association of American Medical Colleges. Black faculty had lower promotion rates when compared with White faculty (20% vs 37%, P < .001). Faculty with MD and PhD degrees demonstrated higher promotion rates than faculty with MD degrees alone (59% vs 36%, P < .001). In addition, faculty not on tenure track had lower rates of promotion than those on tenure track (35% vs 48%, P < .001). With respect to faculty retention, among assistant and associate professors combined, Black faculty and faculty without tenure track appointments were more likely to leave academic medicine (46% vs 33%, P < .001) and (36% vs 27%, P < .001), respectively.
Conclusion
In this study, promotion rates varied significantly by race/ethnicity. Specifically, Black faculty had lower rates of promotion and retention in academic medicine. These findings underscore the need to explore and implement strategies and policies to address equity in promotion rates and retention of URiM faculty within academic ophthalmology.}

abstract = {Summary
Background & aims
Although the risks and opportunities of nutrition in health trajectories are well known, it is rarely addressed in doctors' daily routine. This is partly related to physicians’ lack of confidence in their ability to provide nutritional counselling, possibly due to insufficient training in medical school. Our study aimed at assessing the status quo of nutrition in the German medical curricula and the impact of a recently implemented, student-initiated online teaching initiative on perceived competence, knowledge and attitudes.
Methods
“Eat This!” was the first Germany-wide initiative for online nutritional medicine (NM) education, consisting of 11 digital lectures on nutrition basics, nutrition medicine and public health nutrition. The contact time with NM during studies as well as the effects on students' attitudes towards NM, their self-perceived competence in NM and their nutrition knowledge were assessed from October 2020 to February 2021 in a cross-sectional as well as a prospective study using online questionnaires.
Results
Over 1500 medical students from 42 German faculties participated in the lecture series and the online survey. One hundred and twenty-two students formed a control group. Although considering the topic relevant, students rated their training in NM as insufficient, in terms of both quality and quantity. Initially, they did not feel able to counsel patients and rated their knowledge as low. However, self-ratings and the score in a 33-item multiple-choice test knowledge improved by participating in Eat This! as did their attitude towards nutrition and planetary health. No such changes were observed in the control group of 122 students not attending the course.
Conclusion
Our results show that education in NM at German medical schools is perceived insufficient despite high student interest. But even low-threshold educational options like “Eat This!” can improve students' perceived competence, knowledge, and attitudes, and thus be an efficient and cost-effective way to address related deficits.}

However, the onset and progression of complex human diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, are often multifactorial and multi-trajectory, leading to cellular heterogeneity and molecular complexity that increase drug tolerance and resistance. Effective precision medicine requires the characterization and quantification of molecular variations at single-cell resolution to account for such heterogeneity. In the last few years, the rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology has made it possible to obtain high throughput profiling of the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome of individual cells, enabling the classification and quantification of cell subpopulations and revealing cellular variations of molecular levels and interactions. Thus, combinatory drug treatment can be designed based on the knowledge of heterogeneous cellular compositions and molecular events, ensuring effectively personalized therapy. Nevertheless, as developing technology, single-cell sequencing has technical difficulties and informatics challenges that prevent it from the widespread utility in precision medicine. Accounting for the diversity of genomic information across cells requires rigorous experimental design, the successful harvest of viable cells, enrichment of genomic information, and robust bioinformatic analysis. This chapter introduces the recent technical advancement of single-cell sequencing, discusses its utility and limitations for single-cell research, and presents its promises and challenges for applications in precision medicine in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, birth defects, metabolic syndrome, and immune disorders.}

Healthcare workers increasingly use Electronic Health Information Resources (EHIRs) to make evidence-based decisions. Our study was intended to assess the perception, attitude, and practice of healthcare professionals in medicine, pharmacy, and nursing regarding their perceived value and use of EHIRs.
Methods
We conducted an observational cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire among healthcare professionals in Jazan province from September 2022 to February 2023. We included healthcare professionals and interns with medical, pharmacy, or nursing degrees and excluded those who refused informed consent.
Results
We included fully completed data from 294 participants, with an actual response rate of just 80.1 %. Almost 87.41 % utilized the health information resources at their workplace, with UpToDate [39.45 %] and Medscape [67.01 %] being the most frequently used medical databases. The health facilities' access to electronic health resources significantly impacted healthcare professionals' [p = 0.04] and medical interns' [p = 0.02] roles. Faculty members felt the need to access electronic health information at their workplace [p = 0.00]. Lack of time to access electronic health information due to a busy schedule was a significant reason that impacted the attitude of medical professionals [p = 0.008] and nursing staff [p = 0.025]. An excessive amount of clinically unrelated data was the primary obstacle (181/294, p < 0.0001) in using electronic health information resources.
Conclusion
Our study showed the pattern of healthcare professionals using EHIRs in the Jazan province, Saudi Arabia. We believe the study's outcome can help increase the calibre of electronic health information services available to healthcare professionals and raise awareness of different EHIRs in improving clinical care.}

abstract = {Background
There has been a significant increase in the utilization of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in recent years. Cardiothoracic surgery teams have historically led VA-ECMO care teams, with little data available on alternative care models.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of a cardiovascular medicine inclusive VA-ECMO service, analyzing patients treated with peripheral VA-ECMO at a large quaternary care center from 2018 to 2022. The primary outcome was death while on VA-ECMO or within 24 hours of decannulation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of the primary outcome.
Results
Two hundred forty-four patients were included in the analysis (median age 61 years; 28.7% female), of whom 91.8% were cannulated by interventional cardiologists, and 84.4% were managed by a cardiology service comprised of interventional cardiologists, cardiac intensivists or advanced heart failure cardiologists. Indications for VA-ECMO included acute myocardial infarction (34.8%), decompensated heart failure (30.3%), and refractory cardiac arrest (10.2%). VA-ECMO was utilized during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 26.6% of cases, 48% of which were peri-procedural arrest. Of the patients, 46% survived to decannulation, the majority of whom were decannulated percutaneously in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. There was no difference in survival following cannulation by a cardiac surgeon vs interventional cardiologist (50% vs 45%; P = .90). Complications included arterial injury (3.7%), compartment syndrome (4.1%), cannulation site infection (1.2%), stroke (14.8%), acute kidney injury (52.5%), access site bleeding (16%) and need for blood transfusion (83.2%). Elevated baseline lactate (odds ratio [OR], 1.13 per unit increase) and sequential organ failure assessment score (OR, 1.27 per unit increase) were independently associated with the primary outcome. Conversely, an elevated baseline survival after VA ECMO score (OR, 0.92 per unit increase) and 8-hour serum lactate clearance (OR, 0.98 per % increase) were independently associated with survival.
Conclusions
The use of a cardiovascular medicine inclusive ECMO service is feasible and may be practical in select centers as indications for VA-ECMO expand.}

abstract = {Introduction
Off-label use of medicines is generally discouraged. However, several off-patent, low-cost cancer medicines remain off-label for indications in which they are commonly used in daily practice, supported by high-level evidence based on results of phase III clinical trials. This discrepancy may generate prescription and reimbursement obstacles as well as impaired access to established therapies.
Methods
A list of cancer medicines that remain off-label in specific indications despite the presence of high-level evidence was generated and subjected to European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) expert peer review to assess for accountability of reasonableness. These medicines were then surveyed on approval procedures and workflow impact. The most illustrative examples of these medicines were reviewed by experts from the European Medicines Agency to ascertain the apparent robustness of the supporting phase III trial evidence from a regulatory perspective.
Results
A total of 47 ESMO experts reviewed 17 cancer medicines commonly used off-label in six disease groups. Overall, high levels of agreement were recorded on the off-label status and the high quality of data supporting the efficacy in the off-label indications, often achieving high ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) scores. When prescribing these medicines, 51% of the reviewers had to implement a time-consuming process associated with additional workload, in the presence of litigation risks and patient anxiety. Finally, the informal regulatory expert review identified only 2 out of 18 (11%) studies with significant limitations that would be difficult to overcome in the context of a potential marketing authorisation application without additional studies.
Conclusions
We highlight the common use of off-patent essential cancer medicines in indications that remain off-label despite solid supporting data as well as generate evidence on the adverse impact on patient access and clinic workflows. In the current regulatory framework, incentives to promote the extension of indications of off-patent cancer medicines are needed for all stakeholders.}

abstract = {Long viewed as an intermediary in protein translation, there is a growing awareness that tRNAs are capable of myriad other biological functions linked to human health and disease. These emerging roles could be tapped to leverage tRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, or even as novel medicines. Furthermore, the growing array of tRNA-derived fragments, which modulate an increasingly broad spectrum of cellular pathways, is expanding this opportunity. Together, these molecules offer drug developers the chance to modulate the impact of mutations and to alter cell homeostasis. Moreover, because a single therapeutic tRNA can facilitate readthrough of a genetic mutation shared across multiple genes, such medicines afford the opportunity to define patient populations not based on their clinical presentation or mutated gene but rather on the mutation itself. This approach could potentially transform the treatment of patients with rare and ultrarare diseases. In this review, we explore the diverse biology of tRNA and its fragments, examining the past and present challenges to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecules and their therapeutic potential.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Functional dyspepsia (FD), a chronic upper gastrointestinal syndrome, seriously affects the quality of life of patients and poses a significant economic burden. Since the pathological mechanisms of FD have not been fully elucidated, conventional therapies such as prokinetics, proton pump inhibitors, and antidepressants have some limitations. Siho-sogan-san (SHS) is commonly used as a therapeutic alternative in traditional medicine; however, scientific and clinical evidence supporting its application in FD remains insufficient.
Aim of the study
This review aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of SHS and in combined with Western medicine (WM) for the treatment of FD.
Methods
Eleven databases, including EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library, were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on FD published before December 31, 2022. After two independent reveiwers sceened and selected studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical data was pooled and synthesized via Review Manager software. The outcome parameters included total clinical effectiveness rate (TCE), time for symptom improvement, levels of motilin and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and adverse events. Cochrane's risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment.
Results
A total of 12 studies that included 867 participants comparing WM with SHS or combination therapy (SHS plus WM) were identified. Through a meta-analysis of five studies including 363 patients, SHS compared with WM showed a positive result in safely increasing TCE [risk ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.51, P < 0.00001]. The time for symptom improvement, including abdominal pain, belching, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension, was significantly more shortened in the combination therapy than WM group. Furthermore, combination therapy resulted in greater secretion of motilin than WM alone [mean difference = 67.95, 95% CI 39.52 to 96.39, P < 0.00001]. No remarkable difference was observed in CRH levels between the combination therapy and WM groups. For a subgroup analysis, the administration of SHS based on the type of pattern identification (PI) showed larger effect size than in the group that do not consider PI.
Conclusions
These results suggest that SHS and combination therapy can be considered effective and safe options for the treatment of FD. However, owing to the low quality of the included studies, more well-designed investigational studies and RCTs with longer treatment and follow-up period are needed.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huanglian Wendan Decoction (黄连温胆汤, HLWDD) alone or combined with western medicine in treating insomnia caused by phlegm-heat internal disturbance in recent 10 years.
Methods
The randomized controlled trials of HLWDD alone or combined with western medicine in treating insomnia caused by phlegm-heat internal disturbance from January 1, 2012 to April 1, 2022 were searched in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, China BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. After being screening, the included literature was analyzed to evaluate the effective rate, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score, and adverse reactions of HLWDD on insomnia caused by phlegm-heat internal disturbance. The subgroup analyzed the effect of HLWDD after different treatment courses, and compared the therapeutic effects of HLWDD alone and HLWDD combined with western medicine.
Results
Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials were finally included, with a total of 2 395 patients. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the curative effect of HLWDD alone or combined with the western medicine group was better than that of the western medicine group [RR = 1.14, 95% CI (1.06, 1.22), P = 0.000]. The PSQI score [SMD = – 0.31, 95% CI (– 0.42, – 0.20), P = 0.000], TCM syndrome score [SMD = – 0.40, 95% CI (– 0.67, – 0.12), P = 0.005], and adverse reaction rate [RR = 0.21, 95% CI (0.15, 0.29), P = 0.000] of HLWDD alone or combined with western medicine group were significantly reduced compared with the western medicine group. The subgroup’s analysis showed that the curative effect of HLWDD alone or combined with western medicine group of 4 weeks treatment course was better than that of the western medicine group [RR = 1.14, 95% CI (1.03, 1.26), P < 0.05]. The TCM syndrome score of HLWDD alone or combined with the western medicine group of 4 weeks treatment course decreased more obviously than that of the western medicine group [SMD = – 0.60, 95% CI (– 0.96, – 0.25), P < 0.05]. There were no significant differences between HLWDD alone or combined with western medicine group and western medicine group with different treatment courses based on PSQI score and adverse reaction rate. Based on the effective rate, the comparison between the HLWDD alone group and the western medicine group [RR = 1.09, 95% CI (1.00, – 1.20) P < 0.05], and between the HLWDD combined with western medicine group and the western medicine group [RR = 1.15, 95% CI (1.03, 1.29), P < 0.05] was the same. PSQI score [SMD = – 0.44, 95% CI (– 0.59, – 0.30), P < 0.05] and TCM syndrome score [SMD = – 1.10, 95% CI (– 1.59, – 0.61), P < 0.05] of HLWDD combined with western medicine group were significantly lower than those of the western medicine group. There were no significant differences of adverse reaction rate between HLWDD alone group [RR = 0.08, 95% CI (0.04, 0.17), P < 0.05] and HLWDD combined with western medicine group [RR = 0.36, 95% CI (0.24, 0.53), P < 0.05].
Conclusion
HLWDD alone or combined with western medicine is an effective treatment for insomnia caused by phlegm-heat internal disturbance, which has a high effective rate, significantly reduced PSQI score and TCM syndrome score, and favorable safety. The best course of treatment is 4 weeks.}

This iteration of the curriculum was piloted with the 2019–2020 PGY-1 anesthesiology residents of the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. Pre-course and post-course surveys, which assessed trainee understanding of course topics, were used to subjectively evaluate the usefulness of the curriculum. Results of the surveys demonstrated post-test mean scores were significantly increased when compared with the equivalent pre-course questions.

Family presence during resuscitation is a growing topic in the field of prehospital emergency medicine. Emergency medicine service (EMS) providers interact with the relatives of acutely critically ill patients daily. Previous studies have found varying preferences towards family presence during resuscitation. Some EMS providers experience family presence affects patient treatment. The study aimed to gain insight into how EMS providers experience relatives of critically ill patients influence patient treatment.
Methods
We used semi-structured individual interviews of specially trained paramedics and anaesthetists specialised in prehospital emergency medicine. A total of 11 interviews were conducted at a University Hospital in Copenhagen. Inductive qualitative contents analysis was used to analyse the data.
Results
Relatives were defined as family, spouses, children, partners, close friends or colleagues, and, for some participants, more peripheral relationships such as schoolmates or acquaintances. We identified four themes, describing how EMS providers experience relatives’ influence on patient treatment: ‘supporting optimal patient treatment’, ‘futile resuscitation’, ‘negative impact on patient treatment’, and ‘the paediatric patient’.
Conclusions
Our study illustrates how EMS providers experience that treatment is influenced by relatives of acutely critically ill patients in the prehospital emergency medicine setting. Relatives can help or challenge treatment, and also influence EMS providers’ clinical decision-making. Our findings can guide those working in prehospital emergency medicine towards utilising relatives of critically ill patients and increasing our understanding of how relatives can influence EMS providers’ treatment and their clinical decision-making. Future studies should seek to quantify relatives’ effect on treatment and investigate the clinical and ethical aspects of futile resuscitation.}

The core of our framework lies in developing specialized prompts, which act as guiding instructions for the models during the prediction process. MED-Prompt develops prompts that help models interpret and extract medical information from clinical corpus. The clinical text was derived from the widely known MIMIC-III 11https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/. dataset. The study performs a comparative analysis and evaluates the performance of Manual-Prompt and GPT-Prompts. Further, a fine-tuned approach is developed within MED-Prompt, leveraging transfer learning to achieve prompt-guided medicine predictions. The proposed method achieved a maximum F1-score of 96.8%, which is more than 40% F1-score higher than the pretrained model. In addition, the fine-tuned also showed an average of 2.38 times better processing performance. These results revealed that MED-Prompt is scalable regarding the number of training records and input prompts. These results not only demonstrate the proficiency and effectiveness of the framework but also significantly reduce computational requirements. This also indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve patient care, reduce resource requirements, and increase the overall effectiveness of AI-driven medical prediction systems.}

This study determines whether traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment is associated with the risk of recurrent exacerbation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Materials and methods
In this retrospective study, we selected 1383 patients who were diagnosed with RA between 2013 and 2021 from the medical record information management system of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Then, patients were classified into TCM users and non-TCM users. Gender, age, recurrent exacerbation, TCM, death, surgery, organ lesions, Chinese patent medicine, external medicine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were adjusted one TCM user-to-one non-TCM user with propensity score matching to reduce selection bias and confusion using propensity score matching (PSM). A Cox regression model was used to compare the hazard ratio of the risk of recurrent exacerbation and the Kaplan Meier curve of recurrent exacerbation proportion between the two groups.
Results
Most of the tested clinical indicators in this study improved in patients, which was correlated with the use of TCM, with a statistical significance. TCM was preferred in female and younger (<58 years old) patients with RA. Of note, recurrent exacerbation was observed in more than 850 (61.461%) RA patients. The results of the Cox proportional hazard model showed TCM as a protective factor for the recurrent exacerbation of RA patients (HR = 50%, 95% CI = 0.65–0.92, P < 0.01). Kaplan Meier curves demonstrated that the survival rate of TCM users was higher than that of non-TCM users (log-rank P < 0.01).
Conclusion
Conclusively, the use of TCM may be related to a lower risk of recurrent exacerbation in RA patients. These findings provide evidence for the recommendation of TCM treatment for RA patients.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a therapeutic system which has been practiced for thousands of years. Although for much of its history the decoction of medicinal herbs was the most common method of consuming the herbal treatments, TCM prescriptions are now primarily prepared using concentrated Chinese herbal extracts (CCHE) in powder or granular form. However, determining the precise dose of each single Chinese herbal constituent within a prescription creates a challenge in clinical practice due to the potential risk of toxicity. To alleviate this, we invented the Chinese Intelligence Prescription System (CIPS) to calculate the exact dose of each single herb within an individual prescription.
Methods
In this study, we applied CIPS in a real-world setting to analyze clinical prescriptions collected and prepared at the TCM Pharmacy of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH).
Results
Our investigation revealed that 3% of all prescriptions filled in a 1-month period contained inexact dosages, suggesting that more than 170,000 prescriptions filled in Taiwan in a given month may contain potentially toxic components. We further analyzed the data to determine the excess dosages and outline the possible associated side effects.
Conclusions
In conclusion, CIPS offers TCM practitioners the ability to prepare exact Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) prescriptions in order to avoid toxic effects, thereby ensuring patient safety.}

abstract = {Introduction
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has become a global public health problem with a significant disease burden. A number of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) are widely used in the treatment of DKD in China. An overview of systematic reviews (SRs) can summarize the overall evidence of its effectiveness and safety for both practice and research.
Methods
SRs and/or meta-analyses based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of oral CPMs for DKD were identified. Eight databases were searched from their inception to October 2021. The AMSTAR 2 tool was applied to appraise the methodological quality of the included SRs by two authors. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to summarize the certainty of evidence of the included reviews.
Results
A total of 88 SRs were included, of which three were published as abstracts only (quality not assessed). The methodological quality using the AMSTAR 2 approach was assessed as "low" for five SRs and "critically low" for 80 SRs. Renal end-point events and quality of life were not reported in all SRs. Most of the reviews reported surrogate outcomes. Serum creatinine and 24 h urinary total protein were the two most commonly reported indicators, and regrettably, no high-quality evidence with GRADE assessment was found. Regarding safety, except for Tripterygium glycosides tablet which had several adverse effects, other CPMs had only mild adverse effects.
Conclusion
Due to the lack of end-point outcomes and high-quality evidence, the effectiveness and safety of oral CPMs for DKD remain uncertain. Future studies with more critical methodological designs are needed to provide robust evidence. A core outcome set for adults with DKD could help improve the consistency and relevance of outcomes from clinical trials.}

The Gu Yan Xiao tincture, a blend of traditional Chinese herbs, is traditionally used for osteoarthritis and related pain. This study investigated its mechanism of action in order to rationalize and validate its therapeutic use.
Aim of the study
This study analyzed, in a rabbit model of knee osteoarthritis, whether and how Gu Yan Xiao tincture exerts therapeutic benefits by modulating chondrocyte autophagy.
Materials and methods
The active constituents within the GYX tincture were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The rabbit model was established by injecting animals with type II collagenase intra-articularly, and the effects of topically applied tincture were examined on osteoarthritis lesions of the knee using histopathology, micro-computed tomography and x-ray imaging. Effects of the tincture were also evaluated on levels of inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteases, and autophagy in chondrocytes. As a positive control, animals were treated with sodium diclofenac.
Results
The tincture mitigated the reduction in joint space, hyperplasia of the synovium and matrix metalloproteases in serum that occurred after injection of type II collagenase in rabbits. These therapeutic effects were associated with inhibition of mTOR and activation of autophagy in articular chondrocytes. Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin potentiated the therapeutic effects of the tincture, while inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine antagonized them.
Conclusions
Gu Yan Xiao tincture mitigates tissue injury in a rabbit model of osteoarthritis, at least in part by inhibiting mTOR and thereby promoting autophagy in chondrocytes. These results rationalize the use of the tincture not only against osteoarthritis but also potentially other diseases involving inhibition of autophagy in bones and joints.}

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have experienced rapid development over the last decade and are gaining increasing popularity as assistive models in academic writing. However, the ability of AI to generate reliable and accurate research articles is a topic of debate. Major scientific journals have issued policies regarding the contribution of AI tools in scientific writing.
Methods
We conducted a review of the author and peer reviewer guidelines of the top 25 Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine journals as per the 2023 SCImago rankings. Data were obtained though reviewing journal websites and directly emailing the editorial office. Descriptive data regarding journal characteristics were coded on SPSS. Subgroup analyses of the journal guidelines were conducted based on the publishing company policies.
Results
Our analysis revealed that all scientific journals in our study permitted the documented use of AI in scientific writing with certain limitations as per ICMJE recommendations. We found that AI tools cannot be included in the authorship or be used for image generation, and that all authors are required to assume full responsibility of their submitted and published work. The use of generative AI tools in the peer review process is strictly prohibited.
Conclusion
Guidelines regarding the use of generative AI in scientific writing are standardized, detailed, and unanimously followed by all journals in our study according to the recommendations set forth by international forums. It is imperative to ensure that these policies are carefully followed and updated to maintain scientific integrity.}

To assess outcome indicators in clinical trials and provide a reference for establishing a core outcome set to treat hyperplasia of mammary gland (HMG) with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
Methods
Eight online databases were searched from their inception to December 31, 2022, to assess outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of HMG treated with TCM. The quality of the included studies was assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. All outcomes were extracted, classified, and described.
Results
A total of 8249 articles were initially retrieved. Of these, 70 articles were eligible and involved 10 618 participants with HMG. A total of 17 outcome indicators with a frequency of 271 times were involved and were collected according to six outcome domains.
Conclusions
The core outcomes of RCTs of HMG treated with TCM are large and divergent. There are problems in evaluation standards, primary and secondary outcomes, TCM characteristic indicators, long-term prognosis, and standardization of reporting. It is recommended to strengthen the trial design and actively construct the core outcome sets with TCM characteristics for HMG.}

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine-metabolic disorders in women of reproductive age worldwide. Previous studies using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have revealed that Xiao Yao San (XYS), a classic Chinese patent medicine formula, can effectively treat PCOS. However, the entire evidence has yet to be systematically summarized.
Aim of the study
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials was to assess the effect of XYS for the treatment of PCOS.
Materials and methods
7 databases were thoroughly reviewed for RCTs published from inception to July 2022, assessing the effect of XYS in treating PCOS, including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Wan Fang Database, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and China Science and Technology Journal Database. Outcome measures included ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, hormonal levels, and glycemic parameters. Either a random-effects model or a fixed-effect models was used to pool data. Pooled effect sizes were reported as odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results
A total of 9 trials including 736 PCOS patients met the selection criteria. Our results indicate that XYS plus conventional medicines for PCOS significantly improved ovulation rate (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.94 to 3.08, P < 0.001) and pregnancy rate (OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.87 to 3.75, P < 0.001), meanwhile decreased levels of fasting insulin (FINS) (SMD = - 0.46, 95% CI: 0.65 to - 0.27, P < 0.001) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD = - 0.65, 95% CI = - 0.93 to - 0.37, P < 0.001). XYS plus conventional medicines for PCOS did not have a significant impact on levels of total testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). No serious adverse reactions were observed.
Conclusion
XYS combined with conventional medicines can improve ovulation and pregnancy rates, decrease FINS and HOMA-IR in PCOS patients, indicating that XYS treatment may be used as a promising adjuvant therapy to the conventional medicines of PCOS. However, due to significant heterogeneity and methodological shortcomings, these results should be interpreted with great caution. Larger, higher quality RCTs are needed to rigorously assess the effect of XYS as a complementary therapy in managing PCOS.}

The modifiable properties of hydrogels and the structure resembling living tissue allow their versatile application. Therefore, increasing attention is focused on the use of hydrogels as bioinks for three-dimensional (3D) printing in tissue engineering. Bioprinting involves the fabrication of complex structures from several types of materials, cells, and bioactive compounds. Stem cells (SC), such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are frequently employed in 3D constructs. SCs have desirable biological properties such as the ability to differentiate into various types of tissue and high proliferative capacity. Encapsulating SCs in 3D hydrogel constructs enhances their reparative abilities and improves the likelihood of reaching target tissues. In addition, created constructs can simulate the tissue environment and mimic biological signals. Importantly, the immunogenicity of scaffolds is minimized through the use of patient-specific cells and the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the employed biopolymers. Regenerative medicine is taking advantage of the aforementioned capabilities in regenerating various tissues- muscle, bones, nerves, heart, skin, and cartilage.}

An awareness of Professional Identity (PI), an individual's identity in relation to their professional group, and Role Perception (RP), an individual's view of their specific role, may enable safe and effective practice by providing an understanding of professional boundaries, behaviours and activities. This research aimed to explore and gain an understanding of the PI and RP of Radiographers and Clinical Technologists working as Nuclear Medicine Technologists (NMT's).
Methods
10 NMT's were recruited from a large National Health Service (NHS) Trust. Utilising the established methodology of Qualitative Description, data was obtained using semi-structured interviews and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.
Results
Four themes were identified: “Becoming the Unexpected” which detailed various training pathways; “Caring with Science” which described the NMT's role and defined their PI; “Same View, Different Lens” which portrayed how Radiographers and Clinical Technologists practise as team of NMT's; and “Confirmation of Professional Self” which presented how individuals view their professional status.
Conclusion
The study showed that the NMT role is highly specialised, multi-faceted and patient-centred. Their professional status is based on the nature of their role and their university level education and training. They work together under the umbrella title of NMT with a dual professional identity of “provider of care” and “user of science and technology”. However, they may have an individual identity of Radiographer or Clinical Technologist that is determined by their training pathway.
Implications for practice
This research has provided valuable understanding of the PI and RP of NMT's. By highlighting the differences in the regulatory status of this workforce, an insight into the future implications in the context of national healthcare planning has been provided, highlighting potentially significant issues that may impact on the manner in which NMT's can practice.}

Alongside industrial and private applications, the significance of 3D printing in the clinical context is also growing. For instance, 3D printing processes enable the production of individual anatomical models that can be used to support patient communication or aid in surgical planning. While filament 3D printing is common, stereolithography (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS) printing processes offer higher precision. For the use of 3D printing materials in radiology, understanding their attenuation properties concerning ionizing radiation is crucial. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) serves as an important reference material for radiological applications in this regard. In this research, linear- and mass attenuation coefficients of 38 SLA-/SLS-materials from Formlabs (Somerville, Massachusetts, USA) and PMMA will be determined through intensity measurements in nuclear medicine for the radionuclides technetium-99 m and iodine-131, as well as for X-ray imaging in the range of 60 kVp - 110 kVp tube voltage. Based on the mass attenuation coefficients, correction factors in respect to PMMA will be calculated for each material. A significant number of materials exhibit a deviance within approximately ±5% in respect to PMMA regardless of radiation energy. However, certain materials from the dental and industrial application show deviances up to +500% at the lower end of radiation energy spectrum. In conclusion, most materials can be considered equivalent to PMMA with only minor adjustments required. Materials with high deviances can be utilized as high-contrast materials in custom X-ray phantoms.}

The resurgence of Western psychedelic research and practice has led to increasing concerns from many Indigenous Nations regarding cultural appropriation, lack of recognition of the sacred cultural positioning of these medicines, exclusionary practices in research and praxis, and patenting of traditional medicines. Indigenous voices and leadership have been notably absent from the Western psychedelic field currently widely represented by Westerners. An Indigenous-led globally represented group of practitioners, activists, scholars, lawyers, and human rights defenders came together with the purpose of formulating a set of ethical guidelines concerning traditional Indigenous medicines current use in Western psychedelic research and practice. A global Indigenous consensus process of knowledge-gathering was engaged which identified eight interconnected ethical principles, including: Reverence, Respect, Responsibility, Relevance, Regulation, Reparation, Restoration, and Reconciliation. A summary of the work is presented here with suggested ethical actions for moving forward within Western psychedelic research and practice spaces.}

Culturally and medically constructed as a ‘lifestyle-related disease’, prostate cancer incidence is directly proportional to the ‘Westernisation of eating habits’, and societal ageing. Nevertheless, campaigns to advocate routine testing for prostate cancer remain non-existent. Based on an adaptation of the ‘sexual scripts’ theorising (Gagnon and Simon, 2005), 21 Japanese urologists from Osaka, Kobe and Tokyo, recruited through snowball sampling, were interviewed from 2021 to 2022, to explore how banal nationalisms in medicine—daily medical practice grounded in cultural scripts concerning the Japanese ethnic-self, rather than in medical ‘biological causation to explain illness’ (Barry and Yuill, 2008, 20), influence their onco-practice. ‘Systemic networks’ (Bliss et al., 1983) underpinned the analysis of interviews, which indicates that the physicians tend to (re)produce banal nationalisms in medicine through an understanding of an onco-self, who embodies an ‘essentialised’ version of the Japanese-self concerning rational-thinking, medical-compliancy, and a dependency on familialism and the feminisation of care to cope with cancer. In grappling with prostate cancer, onco-biopedagogy built on the consumption of traditional Japanese food comprehends banal nationalisms in medicine entrenched in prostate onco-practice. Lastly, endorsing and subsidising Traditional Japanese Medicine encompass an element of onco-economics that involves banal nationalisms in medicine. Nonetheless, emotionality underneath decision-making processes, and an onco-self demanding a robotic surgery challenge the validity of banal nationalisms in medicine when grasping onco-practice.}

abstract = {Precision medicine is an emerging field to maximize therapeutic benefits by stratifying the treatment of patient groups based on parameters such as demographics and different omics-based molecular profiling data obtained from patient specimens before, during, and after the treatment. Precision medicine may also entail validating population-wide data to develop and validate actionable molecular targets and matching them to available targeted therapies. The process of precision medicine may involve machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to design a drug based on a patient’s data. Unfortunately, not every patient will benefit from a specific precision medicine strategy. Recent evidence indicates that precision medicine is not effective in 93% of patients, mostly due to the pathogenesis of the disease, patient and tumor heterogeneity, the quality and timing of the specimen collection, the stage of the disease, and the lack of predictive biomarkers preventing patients’ stratification to targeted treatments. The lack of predictive tumor biomarkers and the resistance to targeted therapies together with treatment-associated toxicities remain obstacles to therapeutic success of precision medicine. In brief, precision medicine aims to improve diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic strategies using large data sets. Incorporation and expansion of real-world data along with implementing of advanced computing and AI capabilities can help predict risk assessment by multidimensional biological and clinical data sets. A better understanding of the disease pathogenesis allows for rapid identification of new and more specific therapeutic interventions. Last but not least, the successful application of precision medicine requires the availability of significant resources such as comprehensive data sets, computational resources, and collaboration among stakeholders (e.g., academia, pharmaceutical industry, healthcare providers, and regulatory agencies).}

Despite the unique barriers of the ED environment, potential solutions include the use of ED-validated patient-reported outcome measures when available; adapting existing short-form, multidimensional patient-reported outcome measures previously validated in diverse populations, ideally using computer-adapted testing; and collecting responses during anticipated wait times. With this work, we aim to inform barriers and best practices to the use of patient-reported outcome measures in emergency medicine research and clinical care to support future, more widespread implementation of patient-reported outcome measures within emergency care.

This chapter explores the current applications of personalized medicine in healthcare and highlights the transformative impact it has had on various medical disciplines. From a historical perspective, this chapter illustrates how scientific knowledge derived from the understanding of genetics has overcome barriers in clinical medicine over time. The integration of personalized medicine into the existing healthcare paradigm has posed challenges, necessitating new approaches for its widespread implementation. This acknowledges the importance of understanding these challenges and the need for innovative solutions to ensure that all patients can benefit from personalized medicine without limitations. During the early stages of personalized medicine, a strong “call to action” emerged, urging Congress, government agencies, investors, researchers, and patients to support and advocate for this healthcare concept. The advent of targeted molecular therapy in the late 20th century marked a pivotal shift from uniform treatment regimens to tailored therapies based on individual genetic characteristics. The 21st-century healthcare paradigm emphasizes value over volume, equitable access to novel therapies, and continuous and connected care strategies. Precision and individualization are the core principles underlying this new model of care, aiming to provide more effective, preventative, and safer healthcare. The human genome era has transformed disease characterization, shifting from symptom-based diagnoses to molecular and genetic understandings. These advancements have led to the development of clinical reference resources that guide treatment pathways based on a patient’s biological presentation. Consequently, all aspects of healthcare are undergoing changes to embrace this new diagnostic and treatment approach, requiring the education and training of clinicians to effectively utilize genomic information in clinical settings. This chapter also presents the future of personalized medicine from the perspective of an advocacy organization deeply involved in shaping its history in the United States. It explores key historical milestones, actions taken to pave the way for personalized medicine, and the cultivation of a roadmap for its future success. Overall, personalized medicine has transformed healthcare by incorporating genomic information, enabling individualized treatments for common and rare diseases.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
In Asian countries, herbal medicines have been used to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) as an adjunctive therapy. This review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicines for the treatment of DPN.
Methods
A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, CINAHL, CNKI, DBPIA, and OASIS for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of herbal medicines on DPN. The oral methylcobalamin administered group was selected as the control. The primary outcome measure was nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and the secondary outcome measure was the total efficacy rate (TER). The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4.1 software.
Results
Seventy-two RCTs with a total of 6260 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that herbal medicine and co-administration of herbal medicine and methylcobalamin (CHM) treatment for DPN significantly increased the sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of the median and common peroneal nerves than methylcobalamin treatment alone. Herbal medicine and CHM treatment for DPN also significantly improved the TER compared to the control group. Herbal medicine and CHM treatment was found to be relatively safe.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that herbal medicine and CHM might be more effective than methylcobalamin alone in the management of DPN. Further rigorous studies should be conducted to make more definite conclusions.}

Despite 10 years of prescribing scheduled medicines by Endorsed Midwives, little is known about prescribing practices.
Background
Endorsed Midwives can prescribe scheduled medicines and have access to Medicare rebates to support service provision. Endorsed Midwives have the potential to improve access to medications for women, however, are met with barriers, including inconsistencies in state and national legislation.
Aim
To search for what is published regarding Endorsed Midwife prescribing of scheduled medicines in Australia, report on the literature, synthesise the findings and discuss the results.
Methods
A scoping review utilising the Joanna Brigg’s Institute methodology. A search of CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct and Medline databases was conducted. Seven peer-reviewed articles were identified; three discussion papers, one literature review and three research papers, published between 2016 and 2023 in English. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify topic areas.
Findings
Four topic areas were identified: 1) Endorsed Midwives increase women’s access to prescribed medications; 2) the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is restrictive and diminishes midwifery prescribing; 3) medication prescribing depends on internal and external structures; 4) professional relationships support prescribing.
Discussion
The authority to prescribe augments Endorsed Midwives’ practice, improves timely access to medications and enhances role satisfaction. The effective use of midwifery prescribing is hampered by barriers such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, inappropriate medication formularies, and poorly designed health service policy.
Conclusion
To fully utilise Endorsed Midwife prescribing in all settings of maternity care, further work is required to develop education, remove barriers, and demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of midwifery prescribing.}

Thus, establishment of a dual-signal output mode is necessary for acquiring dependable and durable performance. This work described an Fe doped noradrenaline-based carbon dots and Prussian blue (Fe,NA-CDs/PB) nanocomposite as a POD-like nanozyme and modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the colorimetric and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) dual-mode sensor of Pb(II) in traditional Chinese medicine samples. With 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrates, it was found that the addition of Pb(II) inhibited the POD-like activity of Fe,NA-CDs/PB and AuNPs, so it was used for colorimetric and SERS dual-mode assays. The POD-like activity was shown to be a “ping-pong” catalytic mechanism, whereas the addition of Pb(II) produced noncompetitive inhibition with modulatory effects on Fe,NA-CDs/PB. The linear response range for colorimetric and SERS sensor detection of Pb(II) was 0.01–1.00 mg/L with the detection limit of 5 μg/L and 8 μg/L, respectively. This dual-mode detection system shows excellent selectivity. More importantly, the Pb(II) in traditional Chinese medicine samples have successfully assayed with good recovery from 90.4 to 108.9 %.}

abstract = {Introduction
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) plus acupuncture for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
Methods
We searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in nine Chinese and English databases from their inception to May 7, 2023. The Cochrane “Risk of bias” tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods were used to assess the methodological quality and the certainty of the evidence. Effectiveness is presented as the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
A total of 52 studies were included in this systematic review (n = 4180 participants). The overall quality of the RCTs was reduced by unclear or high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low certainty to moderate certainty. None of the included studies reported the live birth rate. Among women with PCOS seeking fertility treatment, both CHM and acupuncture had a beneficial effect on the clinical pregnancy rate (CHM plus acupuncture (Intervention A), 9 RCTs, n = 754 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10, 1.49; moderate certainty evidence; CHM plus acupuncture plus CMT (Intervention B), 16 RCTs, n = 1269 participants, RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.50, 1.94; moderate certainty evidence) and ovulation rate (Intervention A, 5 RCTs, n = 395 participants, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.15, 1.49; low certainty evidence; Intervention B, 7 RCTs, n = 729 participants, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16, 1.48; low certainty evidence) compared to the control group.
Conclusions
There is currently very low to moderate certainty evidence that CHM plus acupuncture can improve the fertility and clinical symptoms of PCOS patients. Further rigorous, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of complex interventions of CHM plus acupuncture for treating PCOS.}

Malaria is a potentially fatal parasitic disease transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. A resurgence in locally acquired infections has been reported in the U.S.
Objective
This narrative review provides a focused overview of malaria for the emergency clinician, including the epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management of the disease.
Discussion
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium and is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Disease severity can range from mild to severe. Malaria should be considered in any returning traveler from an endemic region, as well as those with unexplained cyclical, paroxysms of symptoms or unexplained fever. Patients most commonly present with fever and rigors but may also experience cough, myalgias, abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pallor, and jaundice are findings associated with malaria. Although less common, severe malaria is precipitated by microvascular obstruction with complications of anemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, multiorgan failure, and cerebral malaria. Peripheral blood smears remain the gold standard for diagnosis, but rapid diagnostic tests are available. Treatment includes specialist consultation and antimalarial drugs tailored depending on chloroquine resistance, geographic region of travel, and patient comorbidities. Supportive care may be required, and patients with severe malaria will require resuscitation. Most patients will require admission for treatment and further monitoring.
Conclusion
Emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the presentation, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of malaria to ensure optimal outcomes.}

1. Describe the street medicine model of care, how it differentiates from other models, and where it sits on the continuum of care. 2. Identify the unique challenges faced by people experiencing unsheltered homelessness as they age and manage serious illness while living outside.
Key Message
This study elicited the street medicine clinician and patient perspective on aging and managing serious illness while experiencing unsheltered homelessness. Results highlight constraints placed on clinicians and patients by the rigid healthcare system and incompatibility with the unique circumstances of unhoused people and the street medicine model of care.
Introduction
Older adults experiencing homelessness constitute the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population in the US. Research has found older homeless adults to have more chronic conditions, greater odds of physical disability, and experience accelerated aging. Little is known about the role of street medicine in providing care and support to aged and aging unsheltered homeless patients.
Objective
To elicit the perspective of clinicians and unsheltered homeless patients on aging and managing serious illness.
Methods
Individual interviews with street medicine clinicians and patients receiving street medicine. Interviews were guided by a semi-structured research protocol developed by the team, audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts and field notes were analyzed by two independent coders following a thematic analysis approach.
Results
Eight clinicians from street medicine and eight patients were interviewed. On average, clinicians were 41 years old and identified as white (50%) females (50%) with varying experience in street medicine (1-16 years). Clinicians were multidisciplinary. Patients identified as male (63%), having 3+ chronic health conditions (100%), and aged on average 56 years. Thematic analysis of clinician interviews revealed four major themes: characteristics of older homeless adults, challenges, end-of-life conversations, and recommendations for improved support of older homeless adults. Overriding themes from the patient interviews were related to aging, illness, and the street medicine model of care.
Conclusions
Clinician and patient perspectives on aging and serious illness while living outside offer insight into significant challenges faced when balancing the restrictive healthcare system with the needs of their patients/self. Results highlight constraints placed on clinicians and patients by the rigid healthcare system and incompatibility with the unique circumstances of unhoused people and the street medicine model of care. Findings from this study suggest actionable strategies that hold implications for policy and practice to better meet the needs of unsheltered homeless older adults.

AI systems use models learned from large amounts of data to offer insights to clinicians to consider in the process of making clinical care decisions. While the development of AI systems for medicine is advancing rapidly, their integration into clinical workflows is limited, with few examples of widespread and effective use. Unless clinicians perceive AI systems as useful, easy to use, and trustworthy, they are unlikely to adopt them. This chapter examines ways to support the adoption and effective use of AI systems in clinical practice from a human-machine interaction perspective. Explainable AI techniques can help overcome algorithm aversion, develop trust, and deliver timely justifications when clinician expectations are violated by the AI system's output. The success of AI-assisted medicine hinges on our ability to address the sociotechnical challenge of designing AI systems that are embedded in current clinical workflows instead of disrupting them. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of framing the AI system as a member of the clinical team to develop a useful heuristic to guide the design and integration of AI in medicine.}

A total of 916 studies were included, among which Beijing University Chinese Medicine was the largest number of advantageous research institutions, followed by Shanghai University Traditional Chinese Medicine and Guangzhou University Chinese Medicine.The keywords of literature research primarily comprise apoptosis, activation, inhibition, pathway, mechanism, oxidative stress, proliferation, NF-κB, cancer, mtor, etc. At present, the research on autophagy in the field of TCM is increasing on a year-to-year basis. The research has focused on the role played by TCM in malignant tumors, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease through autophagy, and the regulation of autophagy signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, TLR4 signaling pathway,nrf2 signaling pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway). In the future, the therapeutic effect of TCM on chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells through autophagy pathway, the role of TCM mediating mitophagy and activating autophagy function, and the therapeutic effect of TCM components represented by luteolin on tumors, asthma, myocardial injury and other diseases through autophagy mechanism will be the research hotspots in the future.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-derived intestinal organoids (PDIOs) show great potential as in vitro drug testing platform for personalised medicine in Cystic Fibrosis and oncology. PDIOs can be generated by culturing adult stem cells obtained through rectal forceps biopsy or suction biopsy, but the safety of these procedures and the success rates of generating organoids after shipment to a centralized lab using these procedures has not been studied in this context. We here report the safety and success rates of both biopsy procedures and the subsequent generation of PDIOs in the international multicentre HIT-CF Organoid Study.
Methods
502 biopsy procedures were conducted, on 489 adult people with Cystic Fibrosis from 33 different hospitals across 12 countries. Depending on the preference of the hospital, either rectal forceps biopsies or suction biopsies were obtained and internationally shipped to a central laboratory for organoid generation.
Results
No adverse events were reported for 280 forceps biopsy procedures, while 222 rectal suction biopsy procedures resulted in 2 adverse events, namely continued bleeding and a probably nonrelated gastroenteritis. The success rate of organoid generation from all biopsies was 95%, and the main reason for failure was insufficient sample viability (3.2%).
Conclusion
Our results indicate that both rectal suction biopsy and forceps biopsy procedures are safe procedures. The high success rates of PDIO generation from the obtained tissue samples demonstrate the feasibility of the organoid technology for personalised in vitro testing in an international setting.}

abstract = {Cervical cancer (CC), as the most common malignant tumor of the female reproductive system, is infamous for its high morbidity and mortality rates. Its development and metastasis are intricate because numerous signaling pathways are involved. Since the cancer and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway are closely intertwined, direct inhibition of either the PI3K/Akt pathway or its target genes and molecules may be remarkably constructive for treatment. Albeit remarkable advances in the treatment of CC, existing common anti-cancer medications are not without problems. These problems include myelotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, genotoxicity, and vasospasm, which are the most common and well-recognized toxicities associated with these medications. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to develop novel, potent, secure, and more reasonably priced anticancer medications that are void of the above problems. Against this backdrop, Chinese medicine monomers have received more attention in recent years owing to their safety, low toxicity, few side effects, and anti-tumor properties. By regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, Chinese medicine monomers are effective not only in inhibiting CC growth, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and reversing drug resistance but also in a variety of targets. Most previous earlier studies focused on the use of a single traditional Chinese medicine monomer to treat CC by regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway rather than a combination of several such monomers. More importantly, to our knowledge, there has hardly been any study providing an exhaustive and comprehensive review of all the Chinese medicine monomers at CC. In response to this scarcity, we attempt in this paper to provide a comprehensive review of all the literature to date on traditional Chinese medicine monomers at cervical cancer, highlight the mechanisms and future prospects for their use in the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a nonspecific intestinal inflammation with complex pathogenesis. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula consists of several TCM herbs following the principle of herbal property and compatibility. Our previous studies found that Huanglian Ganjiang decoction (HGD) exhibited anti-colitis capacity and the compatibility between hot-natured medicine and cold-natured medicine was main compatibility. However, the association between compatibility mechanism of HGD and its anti-colitis effect has not been fully illustrated yet.
Aim of study
Here, we would explore whether cold-natured medicine Coptis chinensis Franch. plus Phellodendron chinense C.K.Schneid. (CP) and hot-natured medicine Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels plus Zingiber officinale Roscoe (AZ) in HGD respectively produce different impacts on UC, and exert synergistic effect on UC together.
Materials and methods
UPLC/MS-MS was used to qualitatively analyze chemical profiles of CP, AZ and CPAZ extracts. CPAZ-UC target network was constructed using network pharmacology. Colitis mice was induced by 3% DSS for 7 days and treated with CP, AZ and CPAZ for another 7 days. The levels of multiple cytokines and proportions of innate and adaptive immune cells were determined to assess inflammatory profiles. The leakage of FITC-dextran, expressions of tight junction proteins were detected for evaluation of gut barrier function.
Results
CP, AZ and CPAZ could improve symptoms of colitis mice. CP showed superiority in reducing proportions of pro-inflammatory immune cells M1 cells, neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 cells, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α. In the contrast, AZ had advantage of elevating ratios of anti-inflammatory immune cells M2 and Treg cells as well as the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β. In addition, CP and AZ synergistically regulated M1/M2 macrophage polarization and the following IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ production, thereby restoring intestinal mucosal barrier.
Conclusion
Taken together, our study first demonstrated that cold-natured medicine CP and hot-natured medicine AZ took on different functions in treatment of colitis mice. Meanwhile, they exhibited synergistic effect on the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and reinforcement of gut barrier function and integrity.}

In this article, we summarize recent progress in DNA barcoding for herbal medicine to provide ideas for the further development and application of this technology. Most importantly, the standard DNA barcode has been extended in two ways. First, while conventional DNA barcodes have been widely promoted for their versatility in the identification of fresh or well-preserved samples, super-barcodes based on plastid genomes have rapidly developed and have shown advantages in species identification at low taxonomic levels. Second, mini-barcodes are attractive because they perform better in cases of degraded DNA from herbal materials. In addition, some molecular techniques, such as high-throughput sequencing and isothermal amplification, are combined with DNA barcodes for species identification, which has expanded the applications of herb identification based on DNA barcoding and brought about the post-DNA-barcoding era. Furthermore, standard and high-species coverage DNA barcode reference libraries have been constructed to provide reference sequences for species identification, which increases the accuracy and credibility of species discrimination based on DNA barcodes. In summary, DNA barcoding should play a key role in the quality control of traditional herbal medicine and in the international herb trade.}

In this study, we propose a facile and economical protocol for selectively extracting MCC from CMRs via one-step direct peroxymonosulfate (PMS) oxidation without the need for intricate steps. Importantly, our proposed protocol has been verified to be versatile and can be applied to various solid waste sources rich in cellulose, with an average extraction rate of 75%. Analysis using the Fukui index revealed that the β-O-4 bond, the aromatic ring in lignin, specific O sites in hemicellulose, and the amorphous region of cellulose are more susceptible to electrophilic attack by PMS than to reactions involving HO•, SO4•−, or 1O2. Leveraging this distinct mechanism, the extracted MCC demonstrated ultrahigh purity (∼95%) and crystallinity (∼85.36%). Overall, our work involves transforming solid waste into high-value products through the provision of a technical solution, with the potential for onsite application. This represents a significant advancement to the valorization of CMRs, particularly in providing theoretical guidance for accelerating the recycling of waste materials.}

With the rapid growth of interest in and use of large language models (LLMs) across various industries, we are facing some crucial and profound ethical concerns, especially in the medical field. The unique technical architecture and purported emergent abilities of LLMs differentiate them substantially from other artificial intelligence (AI) models and natural language processing techniques used, necessitating a nuanced understanding of LLM ethics. In this Viewpoint, we highlight ethical concerns stemming from the perspectives of users, developers, and regulators, notably focusing on data privacy and rights of use, data provenance, intellectual property contamination, and broad applications and plasticity of LLMs. A comprehensive framework and mitigating strategies will be imperative for the responsible integration of LLMs into medical practice, ensuring alignment with ethical principles and safeguarding against potential societal risks.}

A translational approach, involving a more comprehensive characterization of GABA receptors and their neuroscience-based mechanisms allows for a more precise use of this medication class. By adopting a precision person-centered approach, instead of a categorical approach, supports the prescribing of GABA enhancers when a cross-cutting transdiagnostic assessment shows anxiety symptoms associated with clinical impairment.}

The WSS Work Group endorsed the AASM strong recommendation for Multicomponent Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as the treatment of choice for Insomnia Disorder and conditional endorsement for its single-therapy components (sleep restriction, stimulus control, relaxation); use of sleep hygiene education as single therapy was not endorsed due to lack of evidence for its efficacy. The strong recommendation for multicomponent CBT-I applied to patients with chronic insomnia disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions. Main caveats with regard to CBT-I remains the lack of adequately trained therapists and variability in terms of training available in different parts of the world. Unanswered questions about the applicability, availability, accessibility and potential sociodemographic (age, sex, ethnicity, regions) moderators of treatment outcomes were discussed. Despite growing evidence documenting the benefits of digital CBT-I, individual, in-person CBT-I delivered by a trained professional (mental health) provider is regarded as the optimal method to deliver CBT-I.}

Comics can be seen as a way to introduce complex human narratives and as an exploratory tool to ask broader social-contextual and ethical questions about health and medicine. This piece is also constructed through the lens of queer scholarship, which, together with the comics format, provides opportunities to build more embodied, complicated narratives about gender, sexuality and health. Most importantly, comics are used as a modality to tell compelling narratives about how individuals, rather than populations, may be impacted by biomedical conceptualizations of gender and health. The commentary includes a series of graphic narratives containing hypothetical stories and cases: stories of how individuals may be harmed within healthcare systems by rigid framings of gender, sex and sexuality, and stories about how gender socialization may impact health in subtle ways. These narratives furthermore examine the inextricable link between gender and power, illustrating how overt and covert manifestations of power may shape a person's health over the life course. Finally, the piece explores how expansive views of gender may contribute to positive health care experiences. The intention of this piece is to nudge scientific researchers and clinicians alike to approach the topic of gender, sexuality and health with nuance and curiosity.}
