abstract = {Introduction
The present study was conducted to ascertain fatalism perceptions, attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine, and medication adherence in patients with epilepsy, as well as to examine the effects of patients’ fatalism perceptions and attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine on their medication adherence.
Method
This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with 150 people with epilepsy admitted to the Fırat University Hospital, Neurology Outpatient Clinic in Elazığ, in the eastern region of Turkey. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using the “Patient Information Form,” “Fatalism Scale (FS),” “Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (HCAMQ),” and the “Eight-Item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8).”
Results
Of the participants, 45.3% had 5 or more seizures during the past year, 30% had simple partial seizures, 26.7% also had another chronic disease, 79.8% were receiving polytherapy, 86% used their medication regularly, 65.3% had been hospitalized during the past year, and 82% used complementary medicine both for the treatment of epilepsy and during seizures. For the FS and its subscale, the mean scores of the participants were found to be 3.39±0.71 for the overall scale, 3.26±0.71 for predetermination, 3.33±0.97 for luck, and 3.59±0.89 for pessimism. The mean scores for the HCAMQ and its subscale were 32.05±9.94 for the overall questionnaire, 12.99±6.01 for holistic medicine, and 19.07±4.75 for complementary and alternative medicine. The MMAS-8 mean score was 2.14±2.04. The FS variable was found to have a negative and significant effect on MMAS-8 scores.
Conclusion
Patients with epilepsy had a high level of fatalistic perception, positive attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine, and a low level of treatment adherence. It was found that patients’ treatment adherence increased as their fatalistic perceptions decreased. It can be said that the use of CAM in patients with epilepsy may be affected by fatalism.}

abstract = {Evidence-based practices (EBPs) provide strategies to improve the health, welfare and productivity of animal species. However, ensuring implementation and uptake into routine practice of these EBPs is often challenging. In human health research, one approach used to improve uptake of EBPs is the use of theories, models and/or frameworks (TMFs), however the extent of the use of this approach in veterinary medicine is unknown. The aim of this scoping review was to identify existing veterinary uses of TMFs to inform the uptake of EBPs, and to understand the focus of these applications. Searches were conducted in CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus, alongside grey literature, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. The search strategy consisted of a list of known existing TMFs that have been used to improve uptake of EBPs in human health, alongside more generic terminology for implementation and terminology relevant to veterinary medicine. Peer reviewed journal articles and grey literature detailing the use of a TMF to inform uptake of EBP(s) in a veterinary context were included. The search identified 68 studies that met the eligibility criteria. Included studies represented a diverse spread of countries, areas of veterinary concern and EBP. A range of 28 different TMFs were used, although the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) predominated, featuring in 46% of included studies (n = 31). The majority of studies (n = 65, 96%) utilised a TMF with the aim to understand and/or explain what influences implementation outcomes. Only 8 studies (12%) reported the use of a TMF alongside/in conjunction with the actual implementation of an intervention. It is clear there has been some use to date of TMFs to inform uptake of EBPs in veterinary medicine, however it has been sporadic. There has been a heavy reliance on usage of the TPB and other similar classic theories. This has typically been to inform the understanding of factors, such as barriers and facilitators, that may influence the outcome of an implementation effort without then applying this knowledge to the actual implementation of an intervention. Furthermore, there has been a lack of acknowledgement of wider contextual factors and consideration of sustainability of interventions. There is clear potential to increase and expand the usage of TMFs to improve uptake of EBPs in veterinary medicine, including utilising a wider range of TMFs and developing interdisciplinary collaborations with human implementation experts.}

abstract = {Background and aim
Platelet-derived thrombosis is important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. HTB is an optimized herbal medicine including Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Alisma orientale Juzepzuk, and Atractylodes japonica Koidzumi. It is widely used in traditional medicine due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. However, its antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities have not been completely validated. The current study aimed to examine the inhibitory effect of the novel herb formula HTB against platelet activation and thrombus formation.
Experimental procedure
The antiplatelet activities of HTB via platelet aggregation, granule secretion, reactive oxygen species generation, and intracellular calcium mobilization were evaluated. Moreover, the antithrombotic effect of HTB via FeCl3-induced arterial thrombus formation in vivo in mice was assessed. The inhibitory effect of HTB against primary hemostasis was investigated based on transection tail bleeding time.
Results and conclusion
HTB treatment significantly inhibited glycoprotein VI-mediated platelet aggregation, granule secretion, reactive oxygen species generation, and intracellular calcium mobilization. Biochemical studies revealed that HTB inhibited glycoprotein VI-mediated platelet signal transduction during cell activation. Further, its antioxidant effect might be derived by reducing the phosphorylation of the p47phox/Hic5 axis signalosome. Oral HTB treatment was effective in decreasing FeCl3-induced arterial thrombus formation without prolonging the tail bleeding time. HTB can be an effective therapeutic agent against thrombotic diseases.}

abstract = {Summary
The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E7, the guidance for the conduct of clinical trials in people older than age 65 years, dates from 1994. Since then, the inclusion of older people in clinical trials has hardly improved, particularly for the oldest old age group (individuals older than age 75 years), which is the fastest growing demographic bracket in the EU. Even though most medications are taken by this group, relevant endpoints and safety outcomes for this cohort are rarely included and reported, both in clinical trials and regulatory approval documents. To improve the critical appraisal and the regulatory review of medicines taken by frail older adults, eight recommendations are presented and discussed in this Health Policy. These recommendations are brought together from different perspectives and experience of the treatment of older patients. On one side, the perspective of medical practitioners from various clinical disciplines, with their direct experience of clinical decision making; on the other, the perspective of regulators assessing the data submitted in medicine registration dossiers, their relevance to the risk–benefit balance for older patients, and the communication of the findings in the product information. Efforts to improve the participation of older people in clinical trials have been in place for more than a decade, with little success. The recommendations presented here are relevant for stakeholders, authorities, pharmaceutical companies, and researchers alike, as the implementation of these measures is not under the capacity of a single entity. Improving the inclusion of frail older adults requires awareness, focus, and action on the part of those who can effect a much needed change.}

Classification systems concerning driving-impairing medicines can help healthcare providers identify medicinal drugs with no or the least impairing effects and inform patients of the potential risks of certain medicines to safe driving. This study aimed to comprehensively assess the characteristics of classifications and labeling systems regarding driving-impairing medicines.
Methods
Google Scholar and several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, safetylit.org, and TRID were searched to identify the relevant published material. The retrieved material was assessed for eligibility. Data extraction was done to compare the categorization/labeling systems concerning driving-impairing medicines in terms of characteristics such as the number of categories, description of each category, and description of pictograms.
Results
After screening 5,852 records, 20 studies were selected for inclusion in the review. This review identified 22 categorization/labeling systems regarding medicines and driving. Classification systems had different characteristics, but most of them were designed based on the graded categorization system described by Wolschrijn. Initially, categorization systems had seven levels, but later the medicine impacts were summarized into 3 or 4 levels.
Conclusions
Although different categorization/labeling systems regarding driving-impairing medicines are available, the most effective systems in changing driver’s behavior are the simple and understandable ones. Besides, health care providers should consider patient’s socio-demographic features when informing them about driving under the influence.}

The chatbots’ answers were evaluated by board-certified specialists using a modified version of the global quality score on a 5-point Likert scale. The quality and validity of chatbot citations were evaluated.
Results
Claude had the highest mean score of 4.341 ± 0.582 for oral pathology and medicine. Bing had the lowest scores of 3.447 ± 0.566. In oral radiology, GPT-4 had the highest mean score of 3.621 ± 1.009 and Bing the lowest score of 2.379 ± 0.978. GPT-4 achieved the highest mean score of 4.066 ± 0.825 for performance across all disciplines. 82 out of 349 (23.50%) of generated citations from chatbots were fake.
Conclusions
The most superior chatbot in providing high-quality information for controversial topics in various dental disciplines was GPT-4. Although the majority of chatbots performed well, it is suggested that developers of AI medical chatbots incorporate scientific citation authenticators to validate the outputted citations given the relatively high number of fabricated citations.}

abstract = {Background
The decoction form of herbal medicine (D-HM) is mainly prescribed to patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) in Korean Medicine (KM) clinics in the Republic of Korea; however, it is difficult to conduct clinical trials of D-HM due to regulatory issues. This study investigated the clinical safety and effectiveness of D-HM combination therapy for the treatment of AR by analyzing the AR outpatient data from 17 KM clinics.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included patients who visited KM clinics for AR treatment from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. Cases were collated using structured case report forms and divided into the D-HM with KM usual care group (D-HM group) and the KM usual care group (UC group). Since D-HM therapy could not be randomly assigned to the study population, we used optimal propensity score (PS) matching to investigate the effectiveness and safety of D-HM combination therapy in the treatment of AR.
Results
Data from 228 patients were collected. After PS matching, 144 patients were finally analyzed. The total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and mini-rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (mini-RQLQ) were significantly improved in the D-HM group compared with those in the UC group (TNSS: p=0.02; mini-RQLQ: p=0.04). Four patients in the D-HM group experienced minor adverse events that were mild and resolved within 15 days.
Conclusions
D-HM combination therapy may be beneficial in the management of symptoms and rhinitis-associated quality of life and potentially useful in clinical practice. However, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials are required to confirm their effectiveness.

abstract = {Objective
To describe medicines regimens used by older people living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs).
Materials and methods
This cross-sectional study presents baseline data from a randomised controlled trial in seventeen Australian RACFs that recruited residents aged 65 years and older at the participating facilities. The main outcome measures were to evaluation of medicines utilisation, including the number of medicines, medicine regimen complexity, potential under-prescribing and high-risk prescribing (prescribing cascades, anticholinergic or sedative medicines or other potentially inappropriate medicines) with data analysed descriptively.
Results
Medicines regimens were analysed for 303 residents (76% female) with a mean age of 85.0 ± 7.5 years, of whom the majority were living with dementia (72%). Residents were prescribed an average of 10.3 ± 4.5 regular medicines daily. Most participants (85%) had highly complex regimens. Most residents (92%) were exposed to polypharmacy (five or more medicines). Nearly all, 302 (98%) residents had at least one marker of potentially suboptimal prescribing. At least one instance of potential under-prescribing was identified in 86% of residents. At least one instance of high-risk prescribing was identified in 81% of residents including 16% of participants with at least one potential prescribing cascade.
Conclusion(s)
Potentially suboptimal prescribing affected almost all residents in this study, and most had highly complex medicines regimens. If generalisable, these findings indicate most older people in RACFs may be at risk of medicines-related harm from suboptimal prescribing, in addition to the burden of administration of complex medicines regimens for facility staff and residents.}

After eight years of the Act on the Safety of Regenerative Medicine (RM Act), discussions have been underway in the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan to revise the law owing to numerous novel technologies and inappropriate case reports not anticipated when the law was enacted. Therefore, in this review article, we have reviewed the regenerative medicine provision plans and the contribution of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, a regenerative medicine technique widely used in Japan post RM Act implementation, to these plans. As of January 2022, 97.2% of the regenerative medicine provided under the RM Act had been for private practice, and most of them were Class Ⅲ regenerative medicine. Notably, PRP was the most used processed cell under the RM Act. PRP therapy accounted for approximately 66% of the regenerative medicine provision plans in clinical research or private practice and was the most provided regenerative medicine technology in Japan. PRP therapy was primarily used in dentistry to regenerate periodontal tissue (approximately 50%), followed by orthopedics, where it is used to treat osteoarthritis. We suggest that further discussion is essential to determine the factors that should be addressed by the RM act to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRP therapy.}

abstract = {One bottleneck problem in the quality control of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is the accurate identification of easily confused herbal medicines from Chinese patent medicine (CPM). Ginseng products derived from the multiple parts (e.g., root/rhizome, leaf, and flower bud) of multiple Panax species (P. ginseng, P. quinquefolius, P. notoginseng, P. japonicus, and P. japonicus var. major) are globally popular; however, their authentication is very challenging. Using online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC × LC), we propose the concept of a three-dimensional characteristic chromatogram (3D CC) by integrating enhanced LC × LC separation and a contour plot that visualizes the stereoscopic chromatographic peaks and examine its performance in authenticating various ginseng products. Targeted at the resolution of 17 ginsenoside markers, an online LC × LC/UV system with a 56 min analysis time was constructed: a CORTECS UPLC Shield RP 18 column running at 0.1 mL/min for the first-dimensional chromatography and a Poroshell SB-Aq column at 2.0 mL/min in shift gradient mode in the second dimension of separation. In particular, ginsenosides Rg1/Re and Rc/Ra1 were well resolved. According to the presence/absence of stereo peaks consistent with the main ginsenoside markers in the 3D CC and the depth of shade (depending on peak volume), it was feasible to use a single method to identify and distinguish among 12 different ginseng species as the drug materials and the use of ginseng simultaneously from 21 CPMs. Conclusively, a practical solution enabling the accurate identification of easily confused TCMs was provided, covering both the drug materials and the compound preparations.}

Background
Interpersonal violence impacts communities, victims, perpetrators, families, and children. This audit of 315 cases of non-sexual assault compares characteristics of general assault to those of non-fatal strangulation (NFS).
Method
Clinical review of all cases referred to Clinical Forensics Australian Capital Territory (CFACT) by ACT Policing between 2018 and 2022, following allegations of non-sexual assault. Descriptions of the model of care, victim characteristics, alleged perpetrators, and presentations in NFS versus general assault, from forensic medical examination.
Results
Patients: Of 315 cases, 170 were victims of NFS, females (153/170, 90%), males 16/170 (9%), and one person with another preferred term. General assault cases comprised 145/315 (46%) presentations, 69/145 (47.6%) patients being female, 76/145 (52.4%) male. A majority of individuals who experienced NFS 113/170 (66%) presented within 12 h of the events, 41% of victims thought they might die during the NFS. Perpetrators: Most NFS perpetrators were male (161/170: 95%), NFS was mostly perpetrated by a partner 104/170 (62%), ex-partner 35/170 (21%), or family member 17/170 (10%). Repeated assaults by the same perpetrator was common 109/170 (64%). Children were present in 48/170 (28%) cases of NFS.
Discussion
NFS is gendered violence overwhelmingly affecting women, many experience NFS repeatedly. Later presentation may affect clinical signs, symptoms, and evidence collection. Forensic medicine management of NFS provides an opportunity to effect change, especially in those who thought they may die during the attack. Intervention to prevent trauma in children may be enabled by reporting their presence during an assault. Twenty-four-hour service provision enables both clinical and forensic assessment following NFS.
Conclusions
NFS is gendered, mostly affecting women, occurs in a family violence context, perpetrated by current and/or ex-partners, and often occurs with children present. Clinical forensic medicine doctors can provide care and support, provide referrals, and collect forensic medical evidence to support legal process.}

To further understand and compare the effectiveness of pattern differentiation treatment and fixed prescription treatment in perimenopausal syndrome.
Methods
The study will be conducted in the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions Workers’ Medical Clinics, Hong Kong Baptist University Chinese Medicine Clinic cum Training and Research Centre (Hong Kong, China). One hundred Chinese women, aged 45–55 years, will be recruited. The participants will be randomized into 2 groups. The intervention group will be administered medication, based on pattern differentiation, by qualified traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners. After each evaluation, TCM practitioners will evaluate and revise the prescription, based on the participants' patterns. The control group will be given the standard formula, i.e., the Erxian decoction, which contains 6 herbs. The treatment period and the follow-up period will be 8 weeks each. The primary assessment outcome measure will be the Kupperman Index, and the secondary outcome measure will be the Menopause-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire score.
Conclusion
Pattern-differentiated treatment is the basic principle of TCM to understand and treat diseases. The study will show the pattern-differentiated treatment is effectiveness than the fixed prescription.}

abstract = {Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered a rise in the global phenomenon of self-medication. The use of medicines with unsubstantiated claims of benefit for the prevention and/or treatment of infected people has been widely adopted.
Objective
To determine the factors associated with the use of medicines and self-medication by Latin American populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted via an analysis of secondary data collected from 8777 responses from 12 Latin American countries obtained from a survey on the use of medicines and self-medication during the pandemic.
Results
Respondents who reported using Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, or antibiotics (ABx) disclosed this as self-medication in 26.9%, 16.6%, and 9.7% of cases respectively. In our multivariate analysis, significant associations were found between: self-medication by individual choice and the use of Hydroxychloroquine, ABx, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (p = 0.026, = 0.003, and <0.001 respectively); self-medication on the recommendation of a family member, with ABx, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs (p <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, and <0.001 respectively); and self-medication on the recommendation of another person, with Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Penicillin, other ABx, Warfarin, Ivermectin, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs (p <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, = 0.001, <0.001, <0.001, = 0.004, <0.001, <0.001, and <0.001 respectively).
Conclusion
There was a significantly high prevalence of self-medication in our Latin American study population, including the use of medicines not recommended for COVID-19 treatment and/or prevention. The implementation of public health measures aimed at combating the worrying COVID-19 infodemic is essential to prevent this ongoing issue and its associated negative impacts on both current public health and future medication efficacy. This is especially important in the case of ABx due to the threat of a future antimicrobial resistance pandemic.}

We have developed a scientifically well-grounded, methodological, and reporting checklist for economic evaluation (EE) of medicines in the Slovak health technology assessment process, which serves as a supplement to the Slovak pharmacoeconomic guidelines.
Methods
The checklist was developed using an iterative process in which items were generated and gradually added to the baseline checklist based on shortcomings identified in an analysis of Slovak EEs, using relevant published checklists, and Slovak, as well as international, methodological guidance that was identified in the systematic literature review. The selection of checklist recommendations, their clarity, and relevance to the Slovak setting were validated in the online survey.
Results
From the sample of 151 price and reimbursement submissions published between January 2018 and July 2021, almost half of them (n = 73) received at least 1 request from the Ministry of Healthcare to justify or modify the methodology used in the EE; and in 18 proceedings, a negative opinion was issued because of shortcomings identified in the EE. The 25-items preliminary checklist, resulting from an iterative working process, has been validated in an online survey conducted among members of ISPOR Chapter Slovakia. After incorporating relevant comments, the final proposal for the Slovak checklist consists of 55 recommendations.
Conclusions
The research represented the first attempt to create a Slovak EE checklist, which serves as a part of ISPOR Slovakia pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Implementation of the checklist allows checking whether EE meets legislative and methodological requirements and thus helps in improving the appropriateness and standardization of EEs in Slovakia.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Introduction
In French Guiana, the COVID-19 pandemic was marked by very high levels of transmission in the population, low rates of hospitalisations and deaths, and high vaccine hesitancy. The use of traditional herbal remedies is very common in the population and understanding its influence as part of the population’s healing strategy is important. We investigated the use of traditional remedies for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in French Guiana and its influence on vaccine hesitancy.
Methods
An online survey was conducted between April and May 2021 among 1 295 participants aged 18 years or older. Demographic characteristics, attitudes, and perceptions of the population about the pandemic, vaccination intentions and use of traditional remedies were collected through a standardised questionnaire. The cited plants were collected and deposited at the Cayenne herbarium for identification.
Results
For combating COVID-19, 31.7% of people used traditional remedies while 71.4% reported usually treating themselves with remedies unrelated to COVID-19. A total of 604 use reports were recorded as ‘anticoronavirus.’ Quassia amara (Simaroubaceae) was the most frequently used species (153/604), representing 25.3% of the citations. Preventive use was more prevalent than curative use. Vaccine hesitancy was more common among people using traditional remedies.
Discussion/Conclusions
Several species commonly used in French Guiana such as Quassia amara, Neurolaena lobata, Alpinia zerumbet, and Tinospora crispa were found to be used in the context of COVID-19. Further studies would be useful to investigate qualitative and quantitative components of interest, mechanisms, and effects.}

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a worldwide public health problem. Intervention and prevention before the onset of rheumatic diseases is a new direction in current research.
Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential and feasibility of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the prevention of RA.
Methods
This was a single-armed prospective clinical trial. All participants were recruited from a single center in Guangdong, China. Adults who were tested positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) and/or rheumatoid factor (RF), had no synovitis and never been treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), were enrolled to take the Huayu-Qiangshen-Tongbi (HQT) decoction orally twice daily, 200 mL each time for 24 weeks. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients who met 2010 ACR(American College of Rheumatology)/EULAR(European League Against Rheumatism) classification criteria of RA during observation. Secondary outcomes included levels of anti-CCP, RF, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), assessment of signs and symptoms, and radiographic progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Results
19 individuals were enrolled in the study, 4 of which withdrew because of the epidemic of COVID-19. During the observation period, 3 individuals (20%) developed RA and they had longer morning stiffness (P = 0.009) and more obvious synovial enhancement in MRI (P = 0.041) at baseline when compared with those who did not develop RA. After 24 weeks of intervention, there were improvements in 28-swollen joint count (SJC28) (P = 0.046), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (P = 0.019), Patient's Global Assessment (PtGA) (P = 0.019) and Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) (P = 0.031), but no statistical significance was observed in the levels of anti-CCP, RF, ESR, CRP, morning stiffness, 28-tender joint count (TJC28), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis (P > 0.05).
Conclusion
The HQT formula is safe and could improve joint symptoms and signs in these at-risk individuals, but it remains to be investigated in futher study to see if it might potentially reduce the risk of developing RA. Besides, for individuals at high risk to develop RA, morning stiffness and synovial enhancement in MRI might be predictive factors and warning signs.}

Pudilan Xiaoyan Oral Liquid (PDL) wastewater, characterized by high COD (around 5500 mg/L) and baicalin content, served as the model feedstock. The A/O-MBR demonstrated removal rates of 23.6 mg COD g biomass−1 h−1 and 1.0 mg NH3-N g biomass−1 h−1. The combined A/O-MBR-NF process achieved exceptional COD removal exceeding 99 %, significantly reducing the wastewater's environmental impact. Importantly, the treated effluent exhibited no biological toxicity in zebrafish acute toxicity tests, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in detoxifying PDL wastewater. Analysis of the A/O-MBR's bacterial community further elucidates the treatment mechanism. This study indicates that MBR treatment for complex TCM wastewater is feasible and holds promising industrial prospects, offering a fresh perspective on the treatment of TCM wastewater with high COD levels.}

Dried products of Pedicularis flava and Pedicularis muscicola are often used as ‘LuRu’ in the market. This study aims to compare the chemical constituents of P. flava and P. muscicola using GC-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS, and confirm which plant species is more suitable to be used as ‘LuRu’. A total of 46 and 68 compounds were identified from the volatile and non-volatile components, respectively. Out of these, 17 and 37 volatile and non-volatile components, respectively, had pharmacological activities. P. flava showed a higher content of the same active components than P. muscicola. Good biological activities are only observed in the unique components in P. flava, and not in P. muscicola. The two herbs should not be mixed in clinical medication. Our study shows that P. flava is better suited as a high-quality herb for the Tibetan medicine, ‘LuRu’. Volatile components of Tibetan Pedicularis flava and Pedicularis muscicola were analysed for the first timewiooi.Non-volatile components of Tibetan Pedicularis flava and Pedicularis muscicola were analysed for the first time.Differences in chemical composition and content between Pedicularis flava and Pedicularis muscicola were studied.}

To determine the top orthopaedic surgery sports medicine fellowship programs in the United States and the most important aspects of fellowship programs as perceived by applicants.
Methods
An anonymous survey was distributed via e-mail and text message to all current/former orthopaedic surgery residents who applied to one particular orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship program during the 2017-2018 through 2021-2022 application cycles. The survey asked applicants to rank what they considered to be the top-10 orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship programs in the United States before and after completion of their application cycle, based on operative and nonoperative experience, faculty, game coverage, research, and work–life balance. Final rank was calculated by awarding 10 points for a first-place vote, 9 points for a second-place vote, etc., with total number of points used to determine final ranking for each program. Secondary outcomes included rates of applying to perceived top-10 programs, relative importance of different fellowship program aspects, and preferred type of practice.
Results
Seven-hundred sixty-one surveys were distributed with 107 applicants responding (14% response rate). Applicants voted the top orthopaedic sports medicine fellowships programs to be: (1) Steadman Philippon Research Institute, (2) Rush University Medical Center, and (3) Hospital for Special Surgery, both before and following the application cycle. When ranking fellowship program aspects, faculty members and fellowship reputation were most likely to be ranked highest in importance.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that most orthopaedic sports medicine fellowship applicants highly valued program reputation and faculty members when choosing a fellowship program and that the application/interview process did not have a substantial effect on how individuals perceived the top programs.
Clinical Relevance
The findings of this study are important for residents applying to orthopaedic sports medicine fellowships and may have implications on fellowship programs and future application cycles.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Introduction
The majority of Ethiopians—about 80%—of the Ethiopian population relies on traditional remedies as a primary source of health care. Children are dependent on their parents and are influenced by their parents' beliefs and practices on health care, including traditional medicine (TM). Most research on the usage of TM in Ethiopia has only focused upon adults. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of TM use for children age less than 5 years old by their parents in Sodo town, Southern Ethiopia.
Methods
The community-based cross-sectional study was carried out between February and May 2021. A multistage sampling technique was conducted to select 522 households to collect the required data using structured questionnaire. Data were coded and double-entered using EpiData version 3.1 and data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify associated factors.
Results
The prevalence of TM use for children was 68.4%. After adjusting for other variables no formal education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]= 5.96, 95%CI: [2.58-13.74]), can read and write (AOR= 5.23, 95%CI: [2.13-12.85]), primary education (AOR= 3.39, 95%CI: [1.24-9.30]), monthly income <1000 Ethiopian Birr (AOR= 4.70, 95%CI: [1.88-11.78]), monthly income 1000 to 2000 Ethiopian Birr (AOR= 2.79, 95%CI: [1.38-5.66]), easily accessible (AOR= 2.69, 95%CI: [1.35-5.38]) and parental self-TM use (AOR= 2.63, 95%CI: [1.37-5.04]) were predictors of TM use for children.
Conclusions
This study found that children under the age of five substantially more frequently take TMs. Community health education and additional studies on efficacy and safety of TMs were recommended.}

abstract = {Background
How to screen and identify the effective components in the complex substance system is one of the core issues in achieving the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas. However, it is still challenging to systematically screen out the effective components from the hundreds or thousands of components in a TCM formula.
Purpose
An innovative five-layer-funnel filtering mode stepwise integrating chemical profile, quantitative analysis, xenobiotic profile, network pharmacology and bioactivity evaluation was successfully presented to discover the effective components and implemented on a case study of Zhishi-Xiebai-Guizhi decoction (ZXG), a well-known TCM formula for coronary heart disease (CHD).
Methods
Initially, the chemical profile of ZXG was systemically characterized. Subsequently, the representative constituents were quantitatively analyzed. In the third step, the multi-component xenobiotics profile of ZXG was systemically delineated, and the prototypes absorbed into the blood were identified and designated as the primary bioavailable components. Next, an integrated network of “bioavailable components-CHD targets-pathways-therapeutic effects" was constructed, and the crucial bioavailable components of ZXG against CHD were screened out. Lastly, the bioactivities of crucial bioavailable components were further evaluated to pinpoint effective components.
Results
First of all, the chemical profile of ZXG was systemically characterized with the detection of 201 components. Secondly, 37 representative components were quantified to comprehensively describe its content distribution characteristics. Thirdly, among the quantified components, 24 bioavailable components of ZXG were identified based on the multi-component xenobiotic profile. Fourthly, an integrated network led to the identification of 11 crucial bioavailable components against CHD. Ultimately, 9 components (honokiol, magnolol, naringenin, magnoflorine, hesperidin, hesperetin, naringin, neohesperidin and narirutin) exhibiting myocardial protection in vitro were identified as effective components of ZXG for the first time.
Conclusion
Overall, this innovative strategy successfully identified the effective components of ZXG for the first time. It could not only significantly contribute to elucidating the therapeutic mechanism of ZXG in the treatment of CHD, but also serve as a helpful reference for the systematic discovery of effective components as well as ideal quality markers in the quality assessment of TCM formulas.}

By understanding a patient’s unique genetic and biological characteristics, it aims to tailor treatments specifically to the individual. This approach takes into account factors such as an individual’s lifestyle, genetic makeup, and environmental factors to provide targeted therapies that have the potential to be more effective and lower the risk of side reactions or ineffective treatments. It is a paradigm shift from the traditional “one size fits all” approach in medicine, where patients with similar symptoms or diagnoses receive the same standard treatments regardless of their differences. It leads to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient use of healthcare resources. Drug repurposing is a strategy that uses existing drugs for new indications and aims to take advantage of the known safety profiles, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action of these drugs to accelerate the development process. Precision medicine may undergo a revolutionary change as a result, enabling the rapid development of novel treatment plans utilizing drugs that traditional methods would not otherwise link to. In this chapter, we have focused on a few strategies wherein drug repurposing has shown great success for precision medicine. The approach is particularly useful in oncology as there are many variations induced in the genetic material of cancer patients, so tailored treatment approaches go a long way. We have discussed the cases of breast cancer, glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Other than that, we have also looked at drug repurposing approaches in anxiety disorders and COVID-19.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Ischemic heart diseases (IHD), characterized by metabolic dysregulation, contributes majorly to the global morbidity and mortality. Glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism are critical energy production for cardiomyocytes, and disturbances of these metabolism lead to the cardiac injury. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), widely used for treating IHD, have been demonstrated to effectively and safely regulate the cardiac metabolism reprogramming.
Aim of the review
This study discussed and analyzed the disturbed cardiac metabolism induced by IHD and development of formulas, extracts, single herb, bioactive compounds of TCM ameliorating IHD injury via metabolism regulation, with the aim of providing a basis for the development of clinical application of therapeutic strategies for TCM in IHD.
Materials and methods
With “ischemic heart disease”, “myocardial infarction”, “myocardial ischemia”, “metabolomics”, “Chinese medicine”, “herb”, “extracts” “medicinal plants”, “glucose”, “lipid metabolism”, “amino acid” as the main keywords, PubMed, Web of Science, and other online search engines were used for literature retrieval.
Results
IHD exhibits a close association with metabolism disorders, including but not limited to glycolysis, the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, branched-chain amino acids, fatty acid β-oxidation, ketone body metabolism, sphingolipid and glycerol-phospholipid metabolism. The therapeutic potential of TCM lies in its ability to regulate these disturbed cardiac metabolisms. Additionally, the active ingredients of TCM have depicted wonderful effects in cardiac metabolism reprogramming in IHD.
Conclusion
Drawing from the principles of TCM, we have pinpointed specific herbal remedies for the treatment of IHD, and leveraged advanced metabolomics technologies to uncover the effect of these TCMs on metabolomics alteration. In the future, further clinical experimental studies should be included to explore whether more TCM medicines can play a therapeutic role in IHD by reversing cardiac metabolism disorders; multi-omics would be conducted to explore more pathways and genes targeting such metabolism reprogramming by TCMs, and to seek more TCM therapies for IHD.}

A Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column and an XBridge Shield RP18 column were separately utilized in the first-dimensional (1D) and the second-dimensional (2D) chromatography. Eight consecutive cuttings could achieve good separation of 16 ginsenosides within 85 min. The developed MHC-2DLC/CAD method showed good linearity (R2 > 0.999), repeatability (RSD < 6.73%), stability (RSD < 5.63%), inter- and intra-day precision (RSD < 5.57%), recovery (93.76–111.14%), and the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) varied between 0.45–2.37 ng and 0.96–4.71 ng, respectively. We applied it to the content determination of 16 ginsenosides simultaneously from 28 different ginseng-containing CPMs, which unveiled the ginsenoside content difference among the tested CPMs, and gave useful information to discriminate ginseng in the preparation samples, as well. The MHC-2DLC/CAD approach exhibited advantages of high specificity, good separation ability, and relative high analysis efficiency, which also justified the feasibility of our proposed ″Monomethod Characterization of Structure Analogs″ strategy in quality evaluation of diverse CPMs that contained different ginseng.}

The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend triple-panel testing (hepatitis B surface antigen screening, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) at the initial prenatal visit if not previously documented or known to have been performed (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend universal hepatitis B surface antigen screening alone at the initial prenatal care visit for all pregnancies where there has been a previously documented negative triple-panel test (GRADE 1B); (3) we recommend that individuals with unknown hepatitis B surface antigen screening status be tested on any presentation for care in pregnancy; we also recommend that those with clinical hepatitis or those with risk factors for acute hepatitis B infection be tested at the time of admission to a birthing facility when delivery is anticipated (GRADE 1B); (4) we do not recommend altering routine intrapartum care in individuals chronically infected with hepatitis B; administration of neonatal immunoprophylaxis is standard of care in these situations (GRADE 1B); (5) we do not recommend cesarean delivery for the sole indication of reducing perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission (GRADE 1B); (6) we recommend that individuals with HBV infection can breastfeed as long as the infant has received immunoprophylaxis at birth (GRADE 1C); (7) we suggest individuals with hepatitis B infection who desire invasive testing may have the procedure performed after an informed discussion on risks and benefits in the context of shared decision-making and in the context of how testing will affect clinical care (GRADE 2C); (8) in individuals with hepatitis viral loads >200,000 IU/mL (>5.3 log 10 IU/mL), we recommend antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir (tenofovir alafenamide at 25 mg daily or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg daily) in the third trimester (initiated at 28–32 weeks of gestation) as an adjunctive strategy to immunoprophylaxis to reduce perinatal transmission (GRADE 1B); (9) we recommend administering hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobin within 12 hours of birth to all newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen–positive pregnant patients or those with unknown or undocumented hepatitis B surface antigen status, regardless of whether antiviral therapy has been given during the pregnancy to the pregnant patient (GRADE 1B); and (10) we recommend hepatitis B vaccination in pregnancy for all individuals without serologic evidence of immunity or documented history of vaccination (GRADE 1C).}

abstract = {Background
This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) details assessment and management of the child with overweight or obesity. The term “child” is defined as the child between 2 and 12 years of age. Because children are in a continual state of development during this age range, we will specify when our discussion applies to subsets within this age range. For the purposes of this CPS, we will use the following definitions: overweight in the child is a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 85th and <95th percentile, obesity in the child is a BMI ≥95th percentile, and severe obesity is a BMI ≥120% of the 95th percentile.
Methods
The information and clinical guidance in this OMA Clinical Practice Statement are based on scientific evidence, supported by medical literature, and derived from the clinical perspectives of the authors.
Results
This OMA Clinical Practice Statement provides an overview of prevalence of disease in this population, reviews precocious puberty in the child with obesity, discusses the current and evolving landscape of the use of anti-obesity medications in children in this age range, discusses the child with obesity and special health care needs, and reviews hypothalamic obesity in the child.
Conclusions
This OMA Clinical Practice Statement on the child with obesity is an evidence based review of the literature and an overview of current recommendations. This CPS is intended to provide a roadmap to the improvement of the health of children with obesity, especially those with metabolic, physiological, psychological complications and/or special healthcare needs. This CPS addresses treatment recommendations and is designed to help the clinician with clinical decision making.}

abstract = {Objective
Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is one of the most challenging conditions that physicians and patients face nowadays. This study aimed to assess the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) body constitution profiles, demographic characteristics, and lifestyle of women suffering from CPP.
Materials and methods
This study included 378 female patients of reproductive potential from a single Obstetrics and Gynecology clinic in Taiwan. Data were collected using the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36), the TCM Body Constitution Deviation (BCQ-44) Questionnaire, and the Behavior Rating Scale. The chi-squared test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman's correlation were used to analyze the data.
Results
TCM body composition deviation was correlated with the level of pain in patients with CPP. Moreover, the quality of life (QOL) of these patients was found to be affected by the level of pain. Additionally, the QOL was correlated with the TCM body composition deviation profile.
Conclusion
The TCM BCQ-44 can be used in the medical practice to assess patients’ health status and can also serve as a guide to address the risk factors for CPP.}

The Medicine Wheel is a circle with four equal quadrants representing vast teachings, which are specific to local First Nations, which can used as the conceptual framework as well as theory. Through a rapid narrative review of literature on the Medicine Wheel and associated uses as well as the authors’ Anishinaabe teachings, we examine four research uses of the Medicine Wheel in academics and with Indigenous community research to apply it as a theory, conceptual framework, analysis, and evaluation practices. The Medicine Wheel ontologies and epistemologies lend the teachings to be used as a conceptual framework (visual representation of a research project), evaluation framework (as a methodology for conducting research), a data analysis tool (providing a method to see patterns, themes, and connections not easily seen in linear research methods), and the multi-layered knowledge within the Medicine Wheel can be seen as a theory for examining Indigenous research with an Indigenous lens instead of western worldviews or theories. We provide examples of how the Medicine Wheel can be used through the Anishinaabe teachings of the Medicine Wheel. It is possible to expand our abilities to see patterns, themes, connections, and wholism by looking beyond linear positivistic methods through many ways to use Medicine Wheel teachings.}

Acute respiratory illness remains a worldwide leading cause of morbidity and mortality.
Objective
This study was undertaken to identify trends in Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) use and diagnostic results from 2019 to 2022.
Methods
The institutional Medical Laboratory created a database that included all RVP test results. The database included month and year of test, RVP test results, subject age, and sex.
Results
Utilization of RVP testing markedly expanded from 2019, with a mean utilization of 2 tests per quarter, to 2022, with a mean utilization of 1071 tests per quarter. Diagnostic results varied over time. The incidence of multiple pathogens per test increased from 2019 to 2022, although the percentage of tests with multiple pathogens did not differ significantly. The incidence of specific virus results varied by time. Adenovirus, COVID-19, Influenza A, Metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, and RSV were found more commonly in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2019 and 2020.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder with an increasing global prevalence. Managing disease activity relies on various pharmacological options. However, the effectiveness of current therapeutics is limited and not universally applicable to all patients and circumstances. Consequently, developing new management strategies is necessary. Recent advances in endoscopically obtained intestinal biopsy specimens have highlighted the potential of intestinal epithelial organoid transplantation as a novel therapeutic approach. Experimental studies using murine and human organoid transplantations have shown promising outcomes, including tissue regeneration and functional recovery. Human trials with organoid therapy have commenced; thus, this article provides readers with insights into the necessity and potential of intestinal organoid transplantation as a new regenerative therapeutic option in clinical settings and explores its associated challenges.}

Current therapeutic management of lupus nephritis (LN) fails to induce long-term remission in over 50% of patients, highlighting the urgent need for additional options.
Methods
We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in peripheral blood from patients with active LN (n = 41) and active nonrenal lupus (n = 62) versus healthy controls (HCs) (n = 497) from the European PRECISESADS project (NTC02890121), and dysregulated gene modules in a discovery (n = 26) and a replication (n = 15) set of active LN cases.
Results
Replicated gene modules qualified for correlation analyses with serologic markers, and regulatory network and druggability analysis. Unsupervised coexpression network analysis revealed 20 dysregulated gene modules and stratified the active LN population into 3 distinct subgroups. These subgroups were characterized by low, intermediate, and high interferon (IFN) signatures, with differential dysregulation of the “B cell” and “plasma cells/Ig” modules. Drugs annotated to the IFN network included CC-motif chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) inhibitors, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, and irinotecan; whereas the anti-CD38 daratumumab and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib showed potential for counteracting the “plasma cells/Ig” signature. In silico analysis demonstrated the low-IFN subgroup to benefit from calcineurin inhibition and the intermediate-IFN subgroup from B-cell targeted therapies. High-IFN patients exhibited greater anticipated response to anifrolumab whereas daratumumab appeared beneficial to the intermediate-IFN and high-IFN subgroups.
Conclusion
IFN upregulation and B and plasma cell gene dysregulation patterns revealed 3 subgroups of LN, which may not necessarily represent distinct disease phenotypes but rather phases of the inflammatory processes during a renal flare, providing a conceptual framework for precision medicine in LN.}

The decline in nuclear medicine (NM) residencies in the United States has led to a shortage of NM physicians. To help address this, a 16-month NM pathway for diagnostic radiology (DR) residents was developed in 2010. At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, we matched our first resident into the NuRad (NM + DR) pathway in 2013. Despite our success, we remain one of only five programs in the United States that offers a combined training pathway through the National Resident Matching Program.
Objectives
Review our 10-year experience with the NuRad pathway at UAMS and highlight the key components and significance of the 16-month NM pathway.
Methods
Retrospective review of NRMP applicants to the DR and NuRad pathway from 2013 and 2023 at UAMS. Literature and website review of the educational structure of the 16-month NM pathway.
Results
We have seen significant increase in the number of applicants to the NuRad pathway at UAMS over the last 10 years with 184 applicants for 1 position in 2023, up from 18 applicants in 2013. Furthermore, we have seen an increase in the USMLE step scores for applicants during this time.
Conclusions
There is a growing need for NM trained physicians in the United States. Over the last 10 years, we have seen increasing interest in the NM 16-month pathway as a part of DR residency. A wider implementation of this combined training pathway is needed, if we are to realize its full potential.}

While this personalized approach is revoluzionizing many areas of oncology, it is quite late in the field of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs), in which there are few molecular alterations to be therapeutically targeted. We critically reviewed the current evidence about precision medicine in GEP NENs, focusing on potential clinically relevant actionable targets for GEP NENs, such as the mTOR pathway, MGMT, hypoxia markers, RET, DLL-3, and some general agnostic targets. We analysed the main investigational approaches with solid and liquid biopsies. Furthermore, we reviewed a model of precision medicine more specific for NENs that is the theragnostic use of radionuclides. Overall, currently no true predictive factors for therapy have been validated so far in GEP NENs, and the personalized approach is based more on clinical thinking within a NEN-dedicated multidisciplinary team. However, there is a robust background to suppose that precision medicine, with the theragnostic model will yield new insights in this context soon.}

Faculty development (FD) encompasses structured programming that aims to enhance educator knowledge, skill, and behavior. No uniform framework for faculty development exists, and academic institutions vary in their faculty development programming, ability to overcome barriers, resource utilization, and achievement of consistent outcomes.
Objective
The authors aimed to assess current FD needs among emergency medicine educators from six geographically and clinically distinct academic institutions to inform overall faculty development advancement in emergency medicine (EM).
Methods
This cross-sectional study assessed FD needs among EM educators. A survey was developed, piloted, and distributed to faculty via each academic institution's internal e-mail listserv. Respondents were asked to rate their comfort level with and interest in several domains of FD. Respondents were also asked to identify their previous experience, satisfaction with the FD they have received, and barriers to receiving FD.
Results
Across six sites, 136/471 faculty completed the survey in late 2020 (response rate of 29%): 69.1% of respondents reported being satisfied overall with the FD they have participated in, and 50.7% reported being satisfied with education FD specifically. Faculty report higher comfort levels and interest in several domains when satisfied with the education-specific FD they have received compared with those who report not being satisfied.
Conclusions
EM faculty report generally high satisfaction with the overall faculty development they have received, although only half express satisfaction with their education-related faculty development. Faculty developers in EM may incorporate these results to inform future faculty development programs and frameworks.}

abstract = {Biochar (BC) is widely used in the remediation of soil and wastewater polluted by heavy metals, but there are few reports on the characteristics of biochar derived via pyrolysis from different traditional Chinese medicine residues (TCMRs). In this study, biochars were prepared by slow pyrolysis of five common Chinese medicine residues, namely, Salvia miltiorrhiza (DNS), Ligusticum striatum (CX), Angelica sinensis (DG), Codonopsis pilosula (DGS), and Astragalus membranaceus (HQ). The biochars were systematically investigated by determining their physicochemical properties and using common characterization techniques. The Spearman correlation matrix between factors was used to examine relationships between properties of different biochars. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to investigate the adsorption characteristics of biochar on Pb(II) and the mechanisms involved. The results showed that the physicochemical properties and adsorption performance of biochar were related to the type of its pharmaceutical residue. Biochar produced from materials with higher lignin content showed a better adsorption of the heavy metal Pb(II). All biochars were alkaline, with yields ranging from 29.30 to 38.65 %, and the main structure comprised of mesopores and macropores. The FT-IR and Boehm experiments revealed that the various TCMR biochars contained comparable functional groups, but their content varied. XRD and TEM results show that all biochar is amorphous with a crystalline structure, with the surface dominated by cellulose crystals and graphitic carbon. The O/C ratio (<0.2) and H/C ratio (<0.6) of biochars suggested that it had a desirable half-life. The TGA results confirmed its stability in the environment. The results of mineral experiments confirm the enrichment of the mineral content of biochar during biomass pyrolysis.The biochars' adsorption kinetics followed pseudo-second-order models (R2 > 0.99), and their isotherms were consistent with the Langmuir model (R2 > 0.99), indicating a monolayer chemisorption process. The biochar samples exhibited varying adsorption capacities for Pb(II), with the highest capacity observed for BDNS (36.42 mg/g). The adsorption mechanism mainly involved precipitation, complexation with oxygen-containing functional groups, and ion exchange. This study indicates that biochars from herbal residues exhibit promising potential for adsorbing heavy metal Pb(II), suggesting biochar production as a viable method for recycling herbal residues.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Nursing home-associated pneumonia (NHAP) is a common type of infection among long-term care residents. Moreover, the mortality of NHAP is also higher than community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the decoctions of Banxia Houpo Tang (BHT) and Ding Chuan Tang (DCT) are two formulas supporting the lungs' natural defense systems, helps to expel mucus and promote detoxification.
Aim of the study
We designed a concentrated Chinese herbal extract formula called BDT1, that combines the compounds of BHT and DCT. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of BDT1 for NHAP prevention in high-risk older residents in the nursing home.
Materials and methods
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 160 participants aged over 65 years old living in the nursing home were randomly assigned 1:1 to the BDT1 and placebo group. Besides regular medicine, participants received either BDT1 or a placebo for 12 consecutive weeks. The primary outcome was the hospitalization rate for pneumonia in the intervention period and half-year follow-up. The microscopic examination of Gram-stained sputum was also evaluated before and after the trial. Data were analyzed by using the Chi-square test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test with SPSS.
Results
A total of 160 participants were enrolled into two study groups in this study, which was completed with 143 participants analyzed, including 70 subjects in the BDT1 group and 73 subjects in the placebo group. After the 12-week medical treatment, the hospitalization rate for pneumonia was 10.0% and 34.2% in the BDT1 and placebo group respectively. The risk of pneumonia in half a year was lower in the BDT1 group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.422, 95% CI = 0.226–0.791). Compared to the placebo group, the level of Gram-negative bacilli in the BDT1 group is significantly declined in sputum samples (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the cumulative incidence of pneumonia and related-hospitalization rates declined significantly after 12-weeks of BDT1 treatment. Besides, Chinese herbal medicine BDT1 is a safe therapy without hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity.}

1. Utilizing simulation technology, participants will describe an approach to teach the pertinent required skills to perform compassionate extubations in the ED setting to be implemented for EM residents and other health care professional learners. 2. Engaging with an interdisciplinary approach, participants will describe the different roles of the interprofessional health professionals in participating in compassionate extubations and providing end-of-life care for patients and their families in the ED.
Key Message
We developed a simulation program with the objective of creating a curriculum for emergency medicine residents to perform compassionate extubation in the emergency department setting. Data collected showed that the simulation was effective in improving participants’ comfort and understanding of compassionate extubation in the emergency department.
Introduction/Context
The aging population and COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the boarding of critically ill patients in the ED. According to the American Board of Emergency Medicine Model of Clinical Practice, terminal extubations and palliative care skills are within the scope of practice for emergency medicine clinicians. It is pertinent that emergency medicine (EM) physicians have the skills necessary to perform compassionate extubations (CE) in the emergency department (ED).
Objective
To determine the effectiveness of CE simulations to improve EM residents’ comfort with and understanding of compassionate extubation in the emergency department.
Methods
We developed a simulation program with an interdisciplinary team with the objective of creating a curriculum for EM residents to learn the skills to perform compassionate extubations (CE) specifically for the ED setting. The participants in the simulations are led through the scenario to learn the essential components of performing CE, including post-extubation symptom management, and leading anticipatory guidance for family members. Following the simulation, a debriefing session is facilitated by palliative care attending and emergency medicine attending.
Results
There were a total of 18 participants. Participants took a pre-post test survey to assess their confidence in knowledge in managing compassionate extubations. This assessment consisted of a 5-point Likert scale: “strongly agree,” “agree,” “neither agree or disagree,” “disagree,” and “strongly disagree.” Results showed that participants who either agree or strongly agree they are comfortable in providing anticipatory guidance increased by 225% after simulation. Similarly, participants that either agree or strongly agree that they understand practice recommendations for CE increased by 60%. Using the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks (p=0.05), participants had significant improvement in their understanding of various aspects of CE after simulation program.
Conclusion
The structured interdisciplinary simulation on CE is effective in improving learners’ understanding and ability to perform CE in the ED setting.

Conventional chromatographic methods for natural product analysis are not suitable for oligosaccharides due to their large polarity and structural similarity. Herein, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with charged aerosol detector (UHPLC-CAD) method was developed for the profiling of oligosaccharides using 9 neutral (DP3-DP11) reference oligosaccharides. Various factors, including columns, mobile phase, elution conditions, flow rate, and column temperature were systematically examined. Optimal separation was achieved using an Amide column with gradient elution within 18 min, at 0.5 mL/min flow rate and 30°C column temperature. Moreover, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) method was also optimized to provide structural information. The developed method was applied to detect oligosaccharides in several TCMs, including Morindae Officinalis Radix (MOR), Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (ZSS), Menthae Haplocalycis Herba (MHH) and Chrysanthemi Indici Flos (CIF), revealing 9 and 16 oligosaccharides being uncovered from MHH and CIF respectively for the first time.

This study presents a unique case of a patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and a relatively rare type of traditional Chinese medicine known as Qi deficiency and cold-dampness syndrome. The patient's condition was successfully treated using a combination of complementary therapies, specifically the modified Buzhong Yiqi decoction and the Erchen decoction.
Case presentation
A 34-year-old female patient experienced intermittent arthralgia and skin rash over three years. She also developed recurrent arthralgia and skin rashes in the last month, followed by low-grade fever, vaginal bleeding, alopecia, and fatigue. The patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and was prescribed prednisone, tacrolimus, anti-allergic medications (ebastine and loratadine), and norethindrone. While the arthralgia improved, the low-grade fever and rash persisted and, in some instances, worsened. Based on the evaluation of tongue coating and pulses, the patient's symptoms were attributed to Qi deficiency and cold-dampness syndrome. Consequently, the modified Buzhong Yiqi decoction and the Erchen decoction were added to her treatment regimen. The former was used to tonify Qi, while the latter was employed to resolve the phlegm dampness. As a result, the patient's fever subsided after three days, and all symptoms resolved within five days.
Conclusion
The modified Buzhong Yiqi decoction and the Erchen decoction could be considered complementary therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with Qi deficiency and cold-dampness syndrome.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) system is a medical system that has been expanding for thousands of years that was formed by the extensive clinical practice experience of many physicians and the accumulation of personal medication habits in China. In TCM, there is a history of long-term medication for epilepsy, the main treatment for epilepsy is TCM drugs and its prescription, supplemented by TCM modalities such as acupuncture therapy, moxibustion therapy, tuina, emotion adjustment therapy, etc.
Purpose
With the modernization of TCM, the active ingredients and molecular mechanisms of TCM for epilepsy treatment have been gradually revealed. This review aimed to comprehensively summarize the TCM treatment of epilepsy, focusing on the current TCM drugs and some TCM formulae for the treatment of epilepsy, and to discuss the research progress of TCM for the treatment of epilepsy, and to provide a reference to develop future related studies in this field.
Materials and methods
The mechanism of action of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was interpreted from different perspectives by searching online databases and querying various materials identify drugs used in both modern medicine and TCM systems for the treatment of epilepsy. We collected all relevant TCM for epilepsy literature published in the last 30 years up to December 2022 from electronic databases such as PubMed, CNKI and Web of Science, and statistically analyzed the literature for the following keyword information. The search terms comprise the keywords “TCM”, “phytochemistry”, “pharmacological activity”, “epilepsy” and “traditional application” as a combination. Scientific plant names were provided by “The Plant List” (www.theplantlist.org).
Results
Epilepsy is a complex and serious disease of the brain and nervous system. At present, the treatment of epilepsy in modern medicine is mainly surgery and chemotherapy, but there are many serious side effects. By summarizing the treatment of epilepsy in TCM, it is found that there are various methods to treat epilepsy in TCM, mainly TCM drugs and its formulae. Many TCM drugs have antiepileptic effects. Now found that the main effective TCM drugs for the treatment of epilepsy are Curcumae Longae Rhizoma, Scorpio, Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, Uncariae Ramulus Cum Uncis and Ganoderma, etc. And the main compounds that play a role in the treatment of epilepsy are curcumin, gastrodin, ligustrazine, baicalin and rhynchophylline, etc. These TCM drugs have played an important role in the treatment of epilepsy in TCM clinic. However, the chemically active components of these TCM drugs are diverse and their mechanisms of action are complex, which are not fully understood and need to be further explored.
Conclusions
TCM treats epilepsy in a variety of ways, and with the discovery of a variety of potential bioactive substances for treatment of epilepsy. With the new progress in the research of other TCM treatment methods for epilepsy, TCM will have greater potential in the clinical application of epilepsy.}

abstract = {Study objective
Given the popularity of educational blogs and podcasts in medicine, learners and educators need tools to identify trusted and impactful sites. The Social Media Index was a multi-sourced formula to rank the effect of emergency medicine and critical care blogs. In 2022, a key data point for the Social Media Index became unavailable. This bibliometric study aimed to develop a new measure, the Digital Impact Factor, as a replacement.
Methods
The Digital Impact Factor incorporated modern measures of website authority and reach. This formula was applied to a cross-sectional study of active emergency medicine and critical care blogs and podcasts. For each website, we generated a Digital Impact Factor score based on Ahrefs Domain Rating and the follower count of the websites’ pages from 8 social media platforms. A series of Spearman correlations provided evidence of association by comparing a rank-ordered list to rank lists derived from the Social Media Index over the last 5 years. The Bland-Altman analysis assessed for agreement.
Results
The authors identified 88 relevant websites with a median Ahrefs Domain Rating of 28 (range 0 to 71, maximum 100) and total social media followership count across 8 platforms of 1,828,557. The Domain Rating and individual social media followership scores were normalized based on the highest recorded values to yield the Digital Impact Factor (median 4.57; range 0.02 to 9.50, maximum 10). The correlation between the 2022 Digital Impact Factor and the 2021 Social Media Index was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.97; p<.001; n=41 rankings correlated), suggesting that they measure similar constructs. The Bland-Altman plot also demonstrated fair agreement between the 2 scores.
Conclusion
The Digital Impact Factor is a measure of the relative effect of educational blogs and podcasts within emergency medicine and critical care.}

In this study, a MetS prediction model based on a simple, small number of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinical indicators and biological indicators combined with machine learning algorithms is investigated. Electronic medical record data from 2040 patients who visited outpatient clinics at Guangdong Chinese medicine hospitals from 2020 to 2021 were used to investigate the fusion of Bayesian optimization (BO) and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) in order to create a BO-XGBoost model for screening nineteen key features in three categories: individual bio-information, TCM indicators, and TCM habits that influence MetS prediction. Subsequently, the predictive diagnostic model for MetS was developed. The experimental results revealed that the model proposed in this paper achieved values of 93.35 %, 90.67 %, 80.40 %, and 0.920 for the F1, sensitivity, FRS, and AUC metrics, respectively. These values outperformed those of the seven other tested machine learning models. Finally, this study developed an intelligent prediction application for MetS based on the proposed model, which can be utilized by ordinary users to perform self-diagnosis through a web-based questionnaire, thereby accomplishing the objective of early detection and intervention for MetS.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a chronic lung dysfunction disease with a poor prognosis and poor recovery. The clinically used therapeutic drugs, such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, have no significant therapeutic effect and are accompanied with severe side effects. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in exploring and applying natural herb components for treating ILD. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) possesses innate, non-toxic characteristics and offers advantages in preventing and treating pulmonary ailments. However, a comprehensive study of TCM on ILD therapy has not yet been reviewed.
Aim of the review
This review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the monomer components, total extracts, and prescriptions of TCM for ILD therapy, elucidating their molecular mechanisms to serve as a reference in treating ILD.
Materials and methods
The literature information was searched in the PubMed, Web of Science databases. The search keywords included ‘interstitial lung disease’, ‘lung fibrosis’ or ‘pulmonary fibrosis’, and ‘traditional Chinese medicine’, ‘traditional herbal medicine’, or ‘herb medicine’.
Results
The active components of single herbs, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, and quinones, have potential therapeutic effects on ILD. The active extracts and prescriptions were also summarized and analyzed. The herbs, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Gancao), Astragalus membranaceus Fisch. Bunge. (Huangqi) and Angelicasinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Danggui), play significant roles in the treatment of ILD. The mechanisms involve the inhibition of inflammatory factor release, anti-oxidative injury, and interference with collagen production, etc.
Conclusion
This review examines the therapeutic potential of TCM for ILD and elucidates its molecular mechanisms, demonstrating that mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress, modulating the immune system, and promoting tissue repair are efficacious strategies for ILD therapy. The depth research will yield both theoretical and practical implications.}

Background
Inappropriate antibiotic use drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is often used alongside Western medicine in multi-cultural Singapore. This study aimed to assess the influence of CAM use on antibiotic usage practices.
Methods
A nationally representative cross-sectional population survey was conducted in Singapore from November 2020 to January 2021. CAM use was defined as the use of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, Jamu, Ayurvedic medicine or herbal remedies. Multi-variable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between CAM use and good antibiotic usage practices, as defined by six proxy statements adapted from guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sociodemographic characteristics, motivations for CAM use, and knowledge of antibiotic use and AMR were analysed.
Results
Thirty-four percent of 2004 respondents used CAM. The majority of CAM users were female (CAM users 57% vs non-CAM users 50%; P=0.004), Chinese (82% vs 66%; P<0.001), had a higher level of education (68% vs 64%; P=0.036), lived in the highest tier of public housing apartments or private housing (45% vs 36%; P<0.001), and had good knowledge of antibiotic use (63% vs 58%; P=0.036). After adjusting for potential confounding, CAM use (adjusted odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.00–1.52; P=0.048) was associated with 23% increased odds of good antibiotic usage practices. The top reasons for CAM use included recommendations from family and friends (65%), and concern about the side effects of Western medicine (44%).
Conclusion
CAM use is positively associated with good antibiotic usage practices. Further studies assessing educational interventions utilizing social networks and highlighting the side effects of antibiotics may be useful in improving antibiotic usage practices in communities.}

This research aims to design a novel “Trade-Online-Deliver-Offline” (TODO) system to recycle unwanted medicines (UMs) by reutilizing the existent informative pharmaceutical sales network, which is the first dual-channel recycle system with synergies of manufacturer, chain drugstores and governments. Cross-selling effect, i.e., the additional sales from the customers who visit the drugstores for returning UMs, is also considered in this system. With a given revenue-sharing contract, a bi-level programming model is built to formulate such a recycle system, where the drugmaker is the leader and the chain drugstores are the followers within a decision mode of the Stackelberg game. Through reformulating, this complicated model is solved by developing an efficient smoothing algorithm. Scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis are employed to validate the built model and reveal valuable managerial insights. Main findings include: Compared with the existing modes, the proposed TODO mode is more efficient in terms of the recycled UM quantity and the reduced government burden; Cross-selling effects enhance the profit of drugstores without damage of customer’s surplus, but without significant impacts on the drugmaker’s profit; An increasing revenue-sharing ratio is beneficial to the drugstores in certain scenarios, but reduces the total profit of the recycle system; Resale prices of UMs and governmental tax relief policies both dominate the drugmaker’s optimal ratio of the resold and donated UMs.}

To explore ancient and modern medication laws of aromatic Chinese medicines in treating angina pectoris, and to provide new ideas for the clinical treatment.
Methods
With “angina pectoris” as the key word, ancient books prescriptions and Chinese patent medicines related to angina pectoris were collected from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Traditional Chinese Medicine Database System, Chinese Medicine Prescription Database, New National Proprietary Chinese Medicine (2nd edition), and Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition) from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2021. Core high-frequency aromatic Chinese medicines were defined, and their potential medication rules were analyzed and summarized. Microsoft Access 2010 was used for data management. Data analysis software, including Excel and IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 were used for drug association rule analysis, and Cytoscape 3.7.2 for visual display.
Results
There were 67 ancient books prescriptions and 258 Chinese patent medicines containing aromatic Chinese medicines treating angina pectoris collected from relevant databases. In ancient books prescriptions, there were nine aromatic Chinese medicines with the frequency ≥10, and the most commonly used medicine was Danggui (Angelicae Sinensis Radix), followed by Chenpi (Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium). There were 33 aromatic Chinese medicines with the frequency ≥10 in Chinese patent medicines, and the most commonly used medicine was Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma), followed by Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma) and Sanqi (Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma). In ancient books prescriptions, the medicines mainly belonged to intenal-warming medicines, Qi-regulating medicines, and blood circulation promoting and blood stasis removing medicines. There were eight medicine pairs with confidence equal to 100% in ancient books prescriptions, the most frequently used pairs were Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma) + Danggui (Angelicae Sinensis Radix), and Xiangfu (Cyperi Rhizoma) + Chenpi (Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium). In Chinese patent medicines, the aromatic Chinese medicine Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma) could be combined with many other Chinese medicines, among which the Confidence and Support of Chuanxiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma) + Danshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) were at a high level.
Conclusion
Aromatic Chinese medicines for the treatment of angina pectoris of coronary heart disease are mainly warm, and the flavors are mainly pungent, sweet, and bitter. They mainly access to the liver, gallbladder, and pericardium meridians. The treatment of angina pectoris of coronary heart disease mainly focuses on warming heart pulse, and promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis.}

The departure of the UK from the European Union (EU) and affiliated European regulatory bodies, including the European Medicines Agency, on Dec 31, 2020, has resulted in the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency becoming an independent national regulator. This change has required a fundamental transformation of the UK drug regulatory landscape, creating both opportunities and challenges for future development of oncology drugs. New UK pharmaceutical policies have sought to make the UK an attractive market for drug development and regulatory review, by offering expedited review pathways coupled to strong collaborative relations with other leading international medicines regulators, outside of Europe. Oncology is a key global therapy area for both drug development and regulatory approval, and the UK Government has been keen to show regulatory innovation and international collaboration through approval of new cancer medicines. In this Policy Review, we examine the new UK regulatory frameworks, policies, and global collaborations affecting new oncology drug approvals after departure from the EU. We explore some of the challenges that might lie ahead as the UK creates new and independent regulatory review and approval processes for the next generation of cancer medicines.}

However, currently there are no evidence-based guideline for the treatment of CAP with CPMs, and the misuse of CPMs is common. Therefore, we established a guideline panel to develop this guideline. We identified six clinical questions through two rounds of survey, and we then systematically searched relevant evidence and performed meta-analyses, evidence summaries and GRADE decision tables to draft recommendations, which were then voted on by a consensus panel using the Delphi method. Finally, we developed ten recommendations based on evidence synthesis and expert consensus. For the treatment of severe CAP in adults, we recommend Tanreqing injection, Reduning injection, Xuebijing injection, Shenfu injection, and Shenmai injection respectively. For the treatment of non-severe CAP in adults, we recommend Tanreqing injection, Reduning injection, Lianhua Qingwen capsule/granule, Qingfei Xiaoyan Pill and Shufeng Jiedu capsule respectively. CPMs have great potential to help in the fight against CAP worldwide, but more high-quality studies are still needed to strengthen the evidence.}

The pathogenesis of DN involves various factors such as hemodynamic changes, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and lipid metabolism disorders. Increasing attention is being given to DN caused by oxidative stress in the mitochondrial pathway, prompting researchers to explore drugs that can regulate these target pathways. Chinese herbal medicine, known for its accessibility, rich historical usage, and remarkable efficacy, has shown promise in ameliorating renal injury caused by DN by modulating oxidative stress in the mitochondrial pathway. This review aims to provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of DN. Firstly, we outline the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction impairs DN, focusing on outlining the damage to mitochondria by oxidative stress. Subsequently, we describe the process by which formulas, herbs and monomeric compounds protect the kidney by ameliorating oxidative stress in the mitochondrial pathway. Finally, the rich variety of Chinese herbal medicine, combined with modern extraction techniques, has great potential, and as we gradually understand the pathogenesis of DN and research techniques are constantly updated, there will be more and more promising therapeutic targets and herbal drug candidates. This paper aims to provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of DN.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Chinese herbal medicines have been long used among pregnant populations in China. However, despite the high susceptibility of this population to drug exposure, it continued to remain unclear about how often they were used, to what extent they were used at different pregnancy stages, and whether their use was based on sound safety profiles, particularly when used in combination with pharmaceutical drugs.
OBJECTIVE
This descriptive cohort study aimed to systematically investigate the use of Chinese herbal medicines throughout pregnancy and their safety profiles.
STUDY DESIGN
A large medication use cohort was developed by linking a population-based pregnancy registry and a population-based pharmacy database, which documented all prescriptions at both outpatients and inpatients from conception to 7 days after delivery, including pharmaceutical drugs and processed Chinese herbal medicine formulas that were approved by the regulatory authority and prepared under the guidance of national quality standards. The prevalence of the use of Chinese herbal medicine formulas, prescription pattern, and combination use of pharmaceutical drugs throughout pregnancy were investigated. Multivariable log-binomial regression was performed to assess temporal trends and further explore the potential characteristics associated with the use of Chinese herbal medicines. Of note, 2 authors independently conducted a qualitative systematic review of patient package inserts of the top 100 Chinese herbal medicine formulas used to identify their safety profiles.
RESULTS
This study included 199,710 pregnancies; of those pregnancies, 131,235 (65.71%) used Chinese herbal medicine formulas, including 26.13% during pregnancy (corresponding to 14.00%, 8.91%, and 8.26% in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy) and 55.63% after delivery. The peak uses of Chinese herbal medicines occurred between 5 and 10 weeks of gestation. The use of Chinese herbal medicines significantly increased over the years (from 63.28% in 2014 to 69.59% in 2018; adjusted relative risk, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.13), which was particularly great during pregnancy (from 18.47% in 2014 to 32.46% in 2018; adjusted relative risk, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.77–1.90). Our study observed 291,836 prescriptions involving 469 Chinese herbal medicine formulas, and the top 100 most used Chinese herbal medicines accounted for 98.28% of the total prescriptions. Of those, a third (33.39%) were dispensed at outpatient visits; 6.79% were external use, and 0.29% were administered intravenously. However, Chinese herbal medicines were very often prescribed in combination with pharmaceutical drugs (94.96% overall), involving 1175 pharmaceutical drugs with 1,667,459 prescriptions. The median of pharmaceutical drugs prescribed in combination with Chinese herbal medicines per pregnancy was 10 (interquartile range, 5–18). The systematic review of drug patient package inserts found that the 100 most frequently prescribed Chinese herbal medicines contained a total of 240 herb constituents (median, 4.5); 7.00% were explicitly indicated for pregnancy or postpartum conditions; 43.00% were reported with efficacy or safety data from randomized controlled trials. Information was lacking about whether the medications had any reproductive toxicity, were excreted in human milk, or crossed the placenta.
CONCLUSION
The use of Chinese herbal medicines was prevalent throughout pregnancy and increased over the years. The use of Chinese herbal medicines peaked in the first trimester of pregnancy and was very often used in combination with pharmaceutical drugs. However, their safety profiles were mostly unclear or incomplete, suggesting a strong need for postapproval surveillance for the use of Chinese herbal medicines during pregnancy.}

abstract = {Introduction
Sasang Constitutional Medicine (SCM) is a type of traditional Korean medicine where patients are classified as one of four Sasang constitution types (Sasang type) and medications consisting of medicinal herbs are prescribed according to the Sasang type. Despite the importance of personalized medicine, the operation mechanism is largely unknown. To gain a better understanding, we investigated the compound information that composes Sasang type-specific personalized herbal medicines on both multivariate and univariate levels.
Methods
Five machine learning classifiers including extremely randomized trees (ERT) were trained to investigate whether the Sasang type can be explained by compound information at the multivariate level. Hierarchical clustering was conducted to determine whether compounds are processed distributedly or specifically. Taxonomic and biosynthetic analyses were conducted on these compounds. A univariate level statistical test was conducted to provide more robust Sasang type-specific compound information.
Results
Using the trained ERT classifier, sixty important compounds were extracted. The sixty compounds were clustered into three groups, corresponding to each Sasang type-prominent compounds, suggesting that most compounds have specific preference for the Sasang type. Structural and biosynthetic characteristics of these Sasang type-prominent compounds were determined based on taxonomy and pathway analyses. Fourteen compounds showed statistically significant relevance with the Sasang type. Additionally, we predicted the Sasang type of unknown herbs, which were confirmed by their biological effects in functional assays.
Conclusion
This study investigated the personalized herbal medicines of the SCM using compound information. This study provided information on the chemical characteristics of the compounds that are essential for classifying the Sasang type of medicinal herbs, as well as predictions regarding the Sasang type of the commonly used but unidentified medicinal herbs.}

abstract = {Regenerative medicine and cosmetics are currently two outstanding fields for drug discovery. Although many pharmaceutical products for regenerative medicine and cosmetics have received approval by official agencies, several challenges are still needed to overcome, especially financial and time issues. As a result, drug repositioning, which is the usage of previously approved drugs for new treatment, stands out as a promising approach to tackle these problems. Recently, increasing scientific evidence is collected to demonstrate the applicability of this novel method in the field of regenerative medicine and cosmetics. Experts in drug development have also taken advantage of novel technologies to discover new candidates for repositioning purposes following computational approach, one of two main approaches of drug repositioning. Therefore, numerous repurposed candidates have obtained approval to enter the market and have witnessed financial success such as minoxidil and fingolimod. The benefits of drug repositioning are undeniable for regenerative medicine and cosmetics. However, some aspects still need to be carefully considered regarding this method including actual effectiveness during clinical trials, patent regulations, data integration and analysis, publicly unavailable databases as well as environmental concerns and more effort are required to overcome these obstacles.}

abstract = {Efficient enrichment of trace zearalenone (ZEN) from the complex traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) samples is quite difficult, but of great significance for TCM quality control. Herein, we reported a novel magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) strategy for ZEN enrichment using the amino- and hydroxyl dual-functionalized magnetic microporous organic network (Fe3O4@MON-NH2-OH) as an advanced adsorbent combined with the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) determination. Efficient extraction of ZEN was achieved via the possible hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and π-π interactions between Fe3O4@MON-NH2-OH and ZEN. The adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@MON-NH2-OH for ZEN was 215.0 mg g−1 at the room temperature, which was much higher than most of the reported adsorbents. Under the optimal condition, the developed Fe3O4@MON-NH2-OH-MSPE-HPLC method exhibited wide linear range (5–2500 μg L−1), low limits of detection (1.4–35 μg L−1), less adsorbent consumption (5 mg), and large enhancement factor (95) for ZEN. The proposed method was successfully applied to detect trace ZEN from 10 kinds of real TCM samples. Conclusively, this work demonstrates the Fe3O4@MON-NH2-OH can effectively extract trace ZEN from the complex TCM matrices, which may open up a new way for the application of MONs in the enrichment and extraction of trace contaminants or active constituents from the complex TCM samples.}

abstract = {According to the World Health Organization's world report on hearing, nearly 2.5 billion people worldwide will suffer from hearing loss by 2050, which may contribute to a severe impact on individual life quality and national economies. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs commonly as a result of noise exposure, aging, and ototoxic drugs, and is pathologically characterized by the impairment of mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear, which is mainly triggered by reactive oxygen species accumulation, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Though recent advances have been made in understanding the ability of cochlear repair and regeneration, there are still no effective therapeutic drugs for SNHL. Chinese herbal medicine which is widely distributed and easily accessible in China has demonstrated a unique curative effect against SNHL with higher safety and lower cost compared with Western medicine. Herein we present trends in research for Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of SNHL, and elucidate their molecular mechanisms of action, to pave the way for further research and development of novel effective drugs in this field.}
