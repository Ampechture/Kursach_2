abstract = {Chitosan based nanofibers are emerging biomaterials with a plethora of applications, especially in medicine and healthcare. Herein, binary quaternized chitosan/chitosan fibers are reported for the first time. Their preparation strategy consisted in the electrospinning of ternary chitosan/quaternized chitosan/poly(ethylene oxide) solutions followed by the selective removal of poly(ethylene oxide). Their morphology and performances were systematically investigated and discussed in detail. It was found that the fibers had reversible water vapor adsorption/desorption and showed swelling degrees similar to commercial wound dressings. They presented good mechanical properties and the content of quaternized chitosan modulated their bioadhesion, mucoadhesion and biodegradation rate and conferred them strong antimicrobial activity. Tests on normal human fibroblasts confirmed their safely use in contact with tissues and the biocompatibility investigation on rats showed no harmful effect when subcutaneous implanted. All these proved the binary quaternized chitosan/chitosan fibers as bioactive materials suitable for tissue regeneration, wound healing and drug delivery systems.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore the dynamic of microbial community and metabolic function in food waste composting amended with traditional Chinese medicine residues (TCMRs). Results suggested that TCMRs addition at up to 10% leads to a higher peak temperature (60.5 °C), germination index (GI) value (119.26%), and a greater reduction in total organic carbon (TOC) content (8.08%). 10% TCMRs significantly induced the fluctuation of bacterial community composition, as well as the fungal community in the thermophilic phase. The addition of 10% TCMRs enhanced the abundance of bacterial genera such as Acetobacter, Bacillus, and Brevundimonas, as well as fungal genera such as Chaetomium, Thermascus, and Coprinopsis, which accelerated lignocellulose degradation and humification degree. Conversely, the growth of Lactobacillus and Pseudomonas was inhibited by 10% TCMRs to weaken the acidic environment and reduce nitrogen loss. Metabolic function analysis revealed that 10% TCMRs promoted the metabolism of carbohydrate and amino acid, especially citrate cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and cysteine and methionine metabolism. Redundancy analysis showed that the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio was the most significant environmental factor influencing the dynamic of bacterial and fungal communities.}

SC-technologies delve deep into genomics at the single-cell level, revealing previously restricted, valuable information on the identity of single cells, particularly highlighting their heterogeneity. Understanding the cellular heterogeneity of complex tissue provides insight about the gene expression and regulation across different biological and environmental conditions. This vast heterogeneity of cells and their markers makes identifying populations and sub-clusters especially difficult, even more so in rare cell types limited by the absence of rare sub-population markers. One particularly overlooked challenge is the lack of adequate ethnic representation in single-cell data. As the availability of cell types and their markers grow exponentially through new discoveries, the need to study ethnically driven heterogeneity becomes more feasible, while offering the opportunity to further elaborate ethnicity-related heterogeneity. In this commentary, we will discuss this major single-cell limitation particularly focusing on the repercussions it has on disease research, therapeutic design, and precision medicine.}

Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid (SHL) is a commonly used TCM formula for treating respiratory tract infections. In this study, we present a thorough evaluation method for the quality of SHL and its intermediates. We assessed the quality through multi-wavelength fusion high-performance liquid chromatogram (HPLC) fingerprints of 40 batches of SHL samples and 15 batches of intermediates. Meanwhile, we introduced a new method called multi-markers assay by monolinear method (MAML) to quantify ten components in SHL, and revealed quality transmitting of ten components from intermediates to formulations. This information allowed us to establish a quality control system for intermediates, ensuring their quality consistency. Furthermore, we proposed UV quantum fingerprinting as an orthogonal complement to the quality evaluation by HPLC fingerprint. The relationship between fingerprinting and antioxidant capacity was also established. Overall, this study presented a novel and integrated approach for the quality evaluation of TCM products, providing valuable information for ensuring the safety and efficacy of TCM products for consumers.}

Heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common disabling and painful diseases. A traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, Shengmaisan, is known as a multitarget medicine that is widely used clinically to treat heart failure (HF) in Asian countries. However, its mechanism has not been comprehensively demonstrated.
Aim of the study
To use a prediction network to figure out which disease link SMZ mainly alleviates in HF and find biomarkers related to myocardial fibrosis in the serum for clinical reference.
Materials and methods
In this article, we collected a large amount of actual measurement data and our own proteomics data, along with the biomarkers of heart failure staging under study to establish a precise network. Then, we tested and verified the medicinal effect of SMZ in treatment of HF after MI by Measurement of left ventricular wall thickness and ejection fraction by echocardiography. Then we tested the serum level of the potential targets of SMZ predicting by the network we developed using ELISA. Results: the cardiac ejection fraction and retarding the thinning of the anterior wall of the left ventricle increased after treating with SMZ. The serum level of EGFR and MAPK1 decreased in the groups treated with SMZ.
Conclusion
SMZ can improve the cardiac function of rats with MI by increasing the cardiac ejection fraction and retarding the thinning of the anterior wall of the left ventricle. In addition, SMZ could delay heart failure mainly by inhibiting the progression of myocardial fibrosis through decreasing the EGFR and MAPK1 levels.}

Further studies were performed to determine the IC50 values of strong inhibitors. For the compounds belong to CHMs reported to cause cholestasis and strong inhibitors defined in hBSEP vesicles, their relative transport activities of Taurocholic acid (TCA) were evaluated in hBSEP vesicles as well as hBSEP vesicles with S9 system (S9/hBSEP vesicles). The differences of their relative transport activities of TCA between the above two system were compared to reveal the net effect of metabolism on BSEP's activity. It was found that the inhibitory effect of Saikogenin A (SGA), Saikogenin D (SGD), Diosbulbin B (DB) and rhein were significantly increased; while the inhibitory effect of isobavachalcone, saikosaponin d and saikosaponin b2 were significantly decreased after S9 metabolizing. Identification of metabolic pathways suggested that CYP3A4 was responsible for aggravating inhibitory effect of SGA and SGD against BSEP.}

abstract = {Objectives
In this study, I examined the low uptake of oral contraceptives (OCs) in China and the factors affecting the reluctance among unmarried Chinese women seeking abortion to use OCs to prevent unintended pregnancies.
Study design
I conducted ethnographic and participant observation in multiple medical facilities and interviewed 62 women who were seeking or had had an abortion between 2013 and 2017 in a coastal city in east China. I analyzed data regarding the women's perceptions and experiences of using OCs through a thematic analysis approach.
Results
The women reported fear of side effects, including infertility, weight gain, and mental health issues and their view on traditional Chinese medicine further validated their skepticism toward Western medicine. Discouragement from male partners and a lack of sexual and reproductive education also caused their hesitancy and misunderstandings of OCs.
Conclusions
This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the barriers to OC use in China. It resonates with existing studies that associate the reluctance to use OCs with the fear of side effects and highlights the influence of sociocultural specificities and couple interactions in shaping contraceptive use.
Implications
Tackling premarital abortions is one of the priorities of the Chinese government in the face of the population crisis. Service providers and educators should understand unmarried women's reluctance to use OCs and provide comprehensive sexuality education and postabortion counseling services to women and men to dispel culturally specific misconceptions.}

To achieve the objective of the paper, initially, the data was acquired and collected from several data sources such as bedside monitors and electronic nursing records from the Intensive Care Unit of the Santo António Hospital. Secondly, the data was transformed so that it could be used in DM models. The models were induced using the following algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. The analysis of the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were the metrics used to identify the most relevant measures to predict COVID-19 diagnosis. This work demonstrates that the models created had promising results.}

abstract = {Twentieth-century medicine saw the remarkable rise of complex machines and infrastructures to process blood for medical purposes, such as transfusion, dialysis, and cardiac surgery. Instead of attributing these developments to technological ingenuity, this article argues for the primacy of material encounters as a promising focal point of medical historiography. In fact, blood's special properties consistently clashed with most materials used in medical practice, provoking a series of material exchanges. Drawing on a combination of epistemological and network approaches, three exemplary cases are presented to examine blood's encounters with plastics, plant and animal extracts: William M. Bayliss's (1860–1926) injections of dissolved gum acacia to expand diminished blood volume; Charles H. Best's (1899–1978) production of the anticoagulant heparin from animal organs; and the preservation of fragile blood cells by silicone coatings inside of John H. Gibbon Jr.‘s (1903–1973) heart-lung machine. The case studies demonstrate how the complementarity of blood and these materials produced hybridizations between medicine and a range of industrial branches, from colonial forestry and meatpacking to commercial chemistry. In this light, the paper concludes by discussing the dependencies of today's healthcare environments on globally distributed, capitalistically appropriated resources in the face of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.}

Ventilation-perfusion lung scans are easy and safe to perform with less radiation exposure than computed tomography pulmonary angiography and remain an appropriate procedure to perform on children with suspected pulmonary embolism as a first imaging test in a hemodynamically stable patient with no history of lung disease and normal chest radiograph. 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy (Meckel's scan) is the best noninvasive procedure to establish the diagnosis of ectopic gastric mucosa in Meckel's diverticulum. 99mTcred blood cell scintigraphy generally is useful for assessing lower GI bleeding in patients from any cause. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is the most accurate diagnostic imaging modality for acute cholecystitis. 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy is the simplest, and the most reliable and sensitive method for the early diagnosis of focal or diffuse functional cortical damage. 99mTcmercaptoacetyltriglycine scintigraphy is used to evaluate for early and late complications of renal transplantation. Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive and noninvasive technique for diagnosis of bone disorders such as osteomyelitis and fracture. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography could be valuable in the evaluation of fever of unknown origin in pediatric patients, with better sensitivity and significantly less radiation exposure than a gallium scan. Moving forward, further refinement of pediatric radiopharmaceutical administered activities, including dose reduction, greater radiopharmaceutical applications, and updated consensus guidelines is warranted, with the use of radionuclide imaging likely to increase.}

National health technology assessments (HTAs) across Europe show differences in evidentiary requirements from assessments by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), affecting time to patient access for drugs after marketing authorization. This article analyzes the differences between EMA and HTA bodies’ evidentiary requirements for oncology drugs and provides recommendations on potential further alignment to minimize and optimally manage the remaining differences.
Methods
Interviews were performed with representatives and drug assessment experts from EMA and HTA bodies to identify evidentiary requirements for several subdomains and collect recommendations for potentially more efficiently addressing differences. A comparative analysis of acceptability of the evidence by EMA and the HTA bodies and for potential further alignment between both authorities was conducted.
Results
Acceptability of available evidence was higher for EMA than HTA bodies. HTA bodies and EMA were aligned on evidentiary requirements in most cases. The subdomains showing notable differences concerned the acceptance of limitation of the target population and extrapolation of target populations, progression-free survival and (other) surrogate endpoints as outcomes, cross-over designs, short trial duration, and clinical relevance of the effect size. Recommendations for reducing or optimally managing differences included joint early dialogues, joint relative effectiveness assessments, and the use of managed entry agreements.
Conclusions
Differences between assessments of EMA and HTA bodies were identified in important areas of evidentiary requirements. Increased alignment between EMA and HTA bodies is suggested and recommendations for realization are discussed.}

Specializing in one sport too soon is not recommended. Sports readiness also involves understanding and counseling about proper diet and nutrition for maximum sports activity as well as overall health benefits. As clinicians understand sports readiness they can provide a beneficial pre-participation sports examination and deal with qualifications for sports play. Various medical conditions arise in dealing with pediatric persons involved in sports and these are considered in this discussion. They include the female athlete triad, iron deficiency anemia, sports anemia, musculoskeletal overuse injuries, obesity, sudden cardiac death, return to learning after sports-related concussion, epilepsy, asthma, diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal disorders, genitourinary disorders and dermatology disorders in sports.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Purpose
With advances in genome sequencing technologies, large-scale genome-wide sequencing has advanced our understanding of disease risk and etiology and contributes to the rapidly expanding genomic health services in pediatric settings. Because it is possible to return ancestry estimates following clinical genomic sequencing, it is important to understand the interest in ancestry results among families who may have the option of receiving these results.
Methods
We conducted 26 semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews of parents with children/newborns with likely genetic conditions from two studies of clinical genome sequencing. Using a purposive sampling approach, we selected parents from the SouthSeq cohort, Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER Phase 2) project active in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, or an earlier Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER Phase 1) initiative based in the same region. Our interviews focused on parental knowledge about, attitudes on, interest in, and preferences for receiving genetic ancestry results following clinical genome sequencing in the neonatal intensive care unit or in pediatric clinics.
Findings
Overall, parents prioritized clinical results or results that would help guide the diagnosis and treatment of their child, but they were also interested in any genetic result, including genetic ancestry, that potentially could enhance the meaning of information on disease risk, prevention and screening guidance, or family planning. While parents thought that ancestry results would help them learn about themselves and their heritage, the had concerns over the privacy, security, and accuracy of genetic ancestry information, although parents indicated that they had greater trust in ancestry findings provided as part of clinical care compared with those offered commercially. Parents also wanted ancestry results to be returned in a timely manner by knowledgeable staff, with kid-friendly materials and online tools available to aid, as needed, in the understanding of their results.
Implications
Taken together, our results highlight that despite being in high-stress situations, such as having a newborn in the neonatal intensive care unit, parents were interested in receiving genetic ancestry results along with their clinically relevant findings.}

The study of chemodiversity and versatility of bioactivities has always been an important content of pharmacophylogeny. There is amazing progress in the discovery and research of natural components with novel structures and significant bioactivities in 2020. In this paper we review 271 valuable natural products, including terpenoids, steroids, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics, nitrogen containing compounds and essential oil, etc., isolated and identified from TCMs published in journals of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs (Zhong Cao Yao) and Chinese Herbal Medicines (CHMs), and focus on their structures, source organisms, and relevant bioactivities, paying special attention to structural characteristics of novel compounds and newly revealed pharmacological properties of known compounds. It is worth noting that natural products with antitumor activity still constitute the primary object of research. Among the reported compounds, two new triterpenoids, i.e., ursolic acid 3-O-β-cis-caffeate and mollugoside E, display remarkable cytotoxicity against PC-9 and HL-60 cell lines, respectively. Three known phenolic compounds, i.e., pyoluteorin, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamaldehyde and 3,7-dimethoxy-5-hydroxy-1,4-phenanthrenequinone, exhibit significant cytotoxicity against multiple cell lines. Numerous studies on the free radical scavenging activity of reported compounds are currently underway. In vitro, three known phenolic compounds, i.e., 3,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid methyl ester, 3,4,5-O-tricaffeoylquinic acid methyl ester and arbutin, had more considerable antioxidant activities than vitamin C. The anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, hypolipidemic, neuroprotective and antimicrobial activities of isolated compounds are also encouraging. The structural characteristics and bioactivities of TCM compounds highlighted here reflect the enormous progress of CHM research in 2020 and will play a positive role in the future drug discovery and development. According to pharmacophylogeny, the phylogenetic distribution of compounds with different natures and flavors can be explored, with view to better mining TCM resources.}

Objectives
Investments into ‘Blue Skies’ fundamental TB research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been forthcoming. We highlight why blue skies research will be essential for achieving global TB control and eradicating TB.
Methods
We review the historical background to early TB discovery research and give examples of where investments into basic science and fundamental ‘blue skies research’ are delivering novel data and approaches to advance diagnosis, management and holistic care for patients with active and latent TB infection.
Findings
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that making available adequate funding for priority investments into ‘Blue skies research’ to delineate scientific understanding of a new infectious diseases threat to global health security can lead to rapid development and rollout of new diagnostic platforms, treatments, and vaccines. Several advances in new TB diagnostics, new treatments and vaccine development are underpinned by basic science research.
Conclusions
Blue Skies research is required to pave the way for a personalized medicine approach for management of TB and other Respiratory Tract Infections and preventing long-term functional disability. Transfer of skills and resources by wealthier nations is required to empower researchers in LMICs countries to engage in and lead Blue Skies research.}

Precision medicine promises to overcome this obstacle through integrating information from different ‘subsystems’, including the host, the external environment, the tumor itself and the tumor micro-environment. Immunogenetics is an essential tool that allows dissecting both lymphoid cancer ontogeny at both a cell-intrinsic and a cell-extrinsic level, i.e. through characterizing micro-environmental interactions, with a view to precision medicine. This is particularly thanks to the introduction of powerful, high-throughput approaches i.e. next generation sequencing, which allow the comprehensive characterization of immune repertoires. Indeed, NGS immunogenetic analysis (Immune-seq) has emerged as key to both understanding cancer pathogenesis and improving the accuracy of clinical decision making in oncology. Immune-seq has applications in lymphoid malignancies, assisting in the diagnosis e.g. through differentiating from reactive conditions, as well as in disease monitoring through accurate assessment of minimal residual disease. Moreover, Immune-seq facilitates the study of T cell receptor clonal dynamics in critical clinical contexts, including transplantation as well as innovative immunotherapy for solid cancers. The clinical utility of Immune-seq represents the focus of the present contribution, where we highlight what can be achieved but also what must be addressed in order to maximally realize the promise of Immune-seq in precision medicine in cancer.}

abstract = {Background
Previous studies have shown an association between hyperoxemia and mortality in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); however, evidence is lacking in the extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) setting.
Objective
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that hyperoxemia is associated with poor neurological outcomes in patients treated by ECPR.
Methods
The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine OHCA Registry is a multicenter, prospective, observational registry of patients from 2014 to 2017. Adult (18 years or older) patients who had undergone ECPR after OHCA were included. Eligible patients were divided into two groups based on the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) levels at 24 h after ECPR: the high-PaO2 group (n = 242) defined as PaO2 ≥ 157 mm Hg (median) and the low-PaO2 group (n = 211) defined as PaO2 60 to < 157 mm Hg. The primary outcome was the favorable neurological outcome, defined as a Cerebral Performance Categories Scale score of 1 to 2 at 30 days after OHCA.
Results
Of 34,754 patients with OHCA, 453 patients were included. The neurological outcome was significantly lower in the high-PaO2 group than in the low-PaO2 group (15.9 vs. 33.5%; p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, high PaO2 was negatively associated with favorable neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–0.97; p = 0.040). In a multivariate analysis with multiple imputation, high PaO2 was also negatively associated with favorable neurological outcomes (aOR 0.63; 95% CI 0.49–0.81; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Hyperoxemia was associated with worse neurological outcomes in OHCA patients with ECPR.}

This observational study validated the efficacy of a combination of three herbal preparations (Mist Dyspepsia®, Mist Enterica®, and Natural Pain Killer® (NPK)) in patients with symptoms of dyspepsia who visited the Clinic of the Centre for Plant Medicine Research (CPMR), Mampong-Akuapem, Ghana.
Method
The Short Form Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (SF-LDQ) was used to assess the presence, severity, frequency, and the most troublesome symptoms in patients diagnosed with dyspepsia at the CPMR Clinic. The patients were put on Dyspepsia®, Enterica®, and Natural Pain Killer® (NPK).
Results
A total of 162 patients were enrolled in the study. This included a hundred and seven (107, 66%) females and fifty-five (55, 34%) males with a mean age of 36.79 years. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability test value was 0.74 indicating the reliability of the SF-LDQ. The prevalence rate of dyspepsia among the study participants on the day of recruitment was 98.7% (160/162). Almost 80% of study participants were classified as having severe or moderate dyspepsia. The presence or absence of Helicobacter pylori infections did not affect the dyspepsia severity. The most troublesome dyspeptic symptom was indigestion. There was a significant reduction in the severity of dyspepsia at the end of the study (p = 0.001) with no serious side effects.
Conclusion
Dyspeptic patients at the CPMR-Clinic had improved symptoms as indicated by the reduction in the frequency and severity after treatment with the combination of Mist Dyspepsia®, Mist Enterica®, and Natural Pain Killer® (NPK).}

Conventional treatment strategy is focused on one drug or a group of drugs to treat the whole population. But, half of the prescribed drugs failed to show adequate clinical benefits. As a result, current treatment strategy is changing toward personalized medicine. A patient-tailored treatment strategy requires identification of robust biomarkers that can be used in clinical translation of disease stage, drug repurposing, new drug formulation, drug safety and toxicity, develop diagnostics kits or devices, and reproducibility. Genome sequencing, which is one of the omics technologies, is used in identifying mutation in the gene of the patient and biomarkers of different types. However, metabolomics, which is another omics technology, provides closest phenotype of the patient, as metabolites can be detected from the biological fluids and collected in a noninvasive process. Therefore identification of robust biomarkers requires integration of both genomic and metabolomic data. With the advancement of high-throughput technologies, industries, clinics, and researchers from multidisciplinary fields are trying to improve the personalized medicine sector toward prevention of diseases. These are contributing to the global market size of personalized medicine. Although challenges exist for industries in commercialization of personalized products, there are different types of products that have been approved by regulatory bodies and are already in use by clinicians.}

1. Summarize the benefits of an EM palliative care curriculum on residents’ knowledge, skills, and level of comfort in caring for patients with chronic and/or terminal illness in the ED. 2. Describe which learning modalities are most effective as means to learn palliative care knowledge and skills for emergency medicine residents.
Introduction
Half of Americans visit the emergency department (ED) in their last month of life, and 75% in the last 6 months. Because many patients present to the ED while critically ill and require urgent interventions, it is imperative emergency medicine (EM) physicians are able to quickly align with patients and families to determine patients’ values and offer recommendations for further medical treatment. EM physicians have reported that primary palliative care is an important competence in their practice, yet they feel they are not adequately educated in providing palliative care. Previously reported EM residency palliative care curricula were effective methods to increase knowledge and increase resident confidence in palliative care skills. Our specific aim is to develop a primary palliative care curriculum for EM residents and evaluate if this curriculum improves residents’ knowledge, level of comfort, and perceived application of skills in caring for patients with chronic and/or terminal illness in the ED. Secondarily, we would like to determine if EM residents find primary palliative care education important and determine which modalities are most effective as a means to learn palliative care knowledge and skills.
Methods
A comprehensive literature review of palliative care needs in the ED and previously implemented palliative care curricula for EM residents was performed. A curriculum was developed that consisted of four didactic sessions, a communication skills lab using standardized patients, and a small-group simulation case using a high-fidelity manikin. The study population is emergency medicine residents at Advocate Christ Medical Center in all levels of training. Data will be collected via pre- and postintervention surveys using Likert-scale questions to capture residents’ perceived ability in each component. The preintervention survey data was collected from 7/26/22-8/2/22.
Results/Conclusion
This QI project is ongoing; postintervention data will be collected no later than 12/31/2022.}

But DAM is very small tube space and one fly per tube is very limited to analyze for fly social behavior. To overcome such demerits of DAM system, we developed a novel automated sleep and rhythm analysis system (AutoCircaS) which monitors and records any behaviors like social mating, sleep, and circadian rhythm in flies (Drosophila) and small fishes medaka (Oryzias latipes) in free space using the time-lapse (one frame per 10 sec) imaging. AutoCircaS can detect the caffeine-induced insomnia in flies in light–dark (LD) and constant dark (DD) conditions. Thus, using the AutoCircaS, we discovered that Japanese traditional herbal medicines, KyushinKannouGan-ki (KKG), NouKassei (NK) as well as, and Sansoninto, significantly improved caffeine-induced insomnia in flies. The data suggest that AutoCircaS is useful for sleep analysis of small animals and screening of new sedative-hypnotics from many origins.}

Three-dimensional organoid culture is known to recapitulate the tissue dynamics in vivo. We, therefore, tried to generate cPLC organoids (cPLCO) for analyzing the profiles of cPLC. After samples from cPLC and the corresponding normal lung tissue were collected, cPLCO were successfully generated, which recapitulated the tissue architecture of cPLC, expressed lung adenocarcinoma marker (TTF1), and exhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. The sensitivity of cPLCO to anti-cancer drugs was different among strains. RNA-sequencing analysis showed significantly upregulated 11 genes in cPLCO compared with canine normal lung organoids (cNLO). Moreover, cPLCO were enriched with the MEK-signaling pathway compared with cNLO. The MEK inhibitor, trametinib decreased the viability of several strains of cPLCO and inhibited the growth of cPLC xenografts. Collectively, our established cPLCO model might be a useful tool for identifying novel biomarkers for cPLC and a new research model for dog and human lung cancer.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate the potential anti-tumor mechanisms of naphthoquinone compound shikonin (SKN) extracted from the root of Chinese herbal medicine plant lithospermum (Lithospermum erythrorhizon Sieb. & Zucc.).
Methods
We first observed that SKN treatment led to swelling and bubbles in HeLa cells that were similar to the phenotype of cell pyroptosis. Subsequently, the HeLa cells experienced a pyroptotic process with SKN, and this was then assessed using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and propidium iodide (PI)/Hoechst double staining experiments. Pyroptosis is defined as gasdermin-mediated programmed necroptosis. To identify the potential pyroptosis machinery, two strategies were utilized that included a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 screening experiment and a pyroptosis reconstitution assay executed by each of the five known gasdermins (GSDMA-E). Moreover, endogenous cleavage was also detected in a panel of tumor cell lines.
Results
Compared with the control, both the LDH release and PI/Hoechst double-staining experiments suggested that SKN induced perforation and enhancement of the permeability of the cell membranes that resulted in pyroptosis in HeLa cells (P = .028 and P = .032, respectively). In addition, the reconstitution assays in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells and endogenous cleavage assays in HeLa cells indicated that the pyroptosis was controlled by GSDME. In addition, we also found SKN could trigger pyroptosis in a panel of tumor cell lines in which the cellular morphologies were proportional to the GSDME expression levels. Additionally, the cleavage of GSDME was also detected, and this was indicative of a similar GSDME-mediated mechanism.
Conclusion
Our study not only explained the molecular mechanism of cytotoxicity of SKN to various tumor cells, but also provided additional information for the potential clinical application of natural naphthoquinone compounds against cancer.}

The length of telomeres, protective caps on chromosome ends, is influenced by genetic and acquired factors, and shorter telomeres have been associated with and predictive of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. Many studies have shown associations between telomere length in white blood cells (WBC) and diabetes per se and its chronic complications, and some studies show that telomeres do not always progressively shorten in people with diabetes. With the pandemic of diabetes and taking into consideration the calculations of residual risk using existent risk equations, additional tests to stratify subject risk are desirable. In this evolving era of precision medicine for people with diabetes, this ‘global biomarker’ of WBC telomere length may be useful to help predict health outcomes, to monitor health status, and may be a therapeutic target.

The increment in pectin content generates amorphous, granular surfaces with interconnected porosity, improving crosslinking, decreasing swelling and accelerating its rate of degradation in physiological and proteolytic media, also promoting antibacterial capacity showing inhibition of growth of pathogens such as E. coli. Specifically, the scaffold with 20 wt.% pectin (CPc20) shows a mechanical improvement of 342 ± 12% (with respect to crosslinked collagen), allowing the mineralization of 15 ± 1.5% of carbonated apatite on its surface, showing no cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts and allowing their proliferation; in addition, it was determined that immune system cells such as human monocytes can secrete high levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and low levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), conditions required in the process of bone formation. These results demonstrate that these bioactive scaffolds could be applied in bone tissue regenerative medicine strategies.}

abstract = {Objective
To identify all outcome measures used to assess salivary gland hypofunction (i.e., objective measures used to determine actual changes in saliva quantity or to assess response to treatment of salivary gland hypofunction) and to group these into domains.
Study Design
A systematic review including clinical trials and prospective or retrospective observational studies involving human participants with dry mouth, with any type of intervention where the objective assessment of salivary gland hypofunction was described.
Results
Five hundred fifty-three studies involving 31,507 participants were identified. Most assessed salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia (68.7%), whereas 31.3% assessed salivary gland hypofunction alone. Most studies investigated the “amount of saliva,” and the highest number of outcome measures were within the domain of “clinical/objective signs of salivary gland hypofunction.”
Conclusions
Seven domains encompassing 30 outcome measures were identified, confirming the diversity in outcomes and outcome measures used in research regarding salivary gland hypofunction. Identified items will be used in conjunction with those identified regarding xerostomia to create a core outcome set for dry mouth quantification for use in future clinical trials, with the overall goal of improving the standardization of reporting, leading to the establishment of more robust evidence for the management of dry mouth and improving patient care.}

abstract = {Introduction
Under-representation of women in high academic and medical positions is reported in many countries. This study aims to compare degrees and careers between men and women tenured as Full Professors of Medicine in recent years in France.
Methods
We identified all new tenured French Full Professors between 2017 and 2021 and collected the publicly available data (gender, year of birth, curriculum) from the Bibliographic Agency for Higher Education, a public institution under the aegis of the Ministry for Higher Education Research and Innovation. The primary outcome was the gender difference in age appointment of Full Professors. Secondary outcomes were gender differences in career development.
Results
Among 820 Full Professors, only 266 (32.4%) were women. They were tenured at a later age than men (43.7 vs 42.4 years, p<0.001), while they graduated for the MD (29.5 vs 29.9 years, p<0.005) or PhD (35.3 vs 36.0 years, p<0.05) several months earlier. Women were also more often Associate Professors than men before becoming Full Professors (67.3% vs 59.2%, p<0.05).  Before achieving Full professor tenure, the average delay is longer for women from MD graduation (14.6 vs 12.5 years), PhD graduation (8.7 vs 6.4 years), or Associate Professor nomination (7.5 vs 5.5 years), with a difference of 2.2, 2.4 and 2.0 years respectively (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusion
Gender inequalities remain in regards to access to Full Professor status, the highest position in the medical fields.}

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been applied for more than 2000 years. However, modern basic research on the safety of TCMs is limited. Establishing safety evaluation technology in line with the characteristics of TCM and conducting large-scale basic toxicity research are keys to comprehensively understand the toxicity of TCMs. In recent years, zebrafish has been used as a model organism for toxicity assessment and is increasingly utilized for toxicity research of TCMs. Yet, a comprehensive review in using zebrafish as a toxicological model for TCMs is lacked.
Aim of the study
We aim to summarize the progress and limitation in toxicity evaluation of TCMs using zebrafish and put forward the future research ideas.
Materials and methods
The scientific databases, including Springer, Science Direct, Wiley, Pubmed and China Knowledge Resource Integrated (CNKI) were searched using the key words of zebrafish, toxicology, traditional Chinese medicine, acute toxicity, liver injury, cardiotoxicity, kidney toxicity, developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal irritation, immunotoxicity, ototoxicity, and osteotoxicity.
Results
Zebrafish assays are low experimental cost and short cycle, easily achieving high-throughput toxicity screening, and exemption from ethical legislation up to 5 dpf. It has been widely used to evaluate the acute toxicity, liver toxicity, cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal irritation, immunotoxicity, and ototoxicity caused by TCMs, although some physiological difference limited its application.
Conclusions
Zebrafish is a powerful model for TCMs toxicity evaluation, but it is not flawless. The toxicity testing criterion and high throughput assays are urgent to be established. This review provides references for future studies.}

Up to 43% of patients with anxiety disorders (ADS) use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), however, many healthcare providers receive little training on this topic. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are relied upon to guide decision-making, especially with respect to topics less familiar to healthcare providers. In the present study, we identified the quantity and assessed the quality of CAM recommendations in CPGs for the treatment and/or management of ADS.
Methods
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were systematically searched from 2009 to April 2020 to identify eligible CPGs. In addition, the Guidelines International Network and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health websites were also searched. Eligible CPGs containing CAM recommendations were evaluated using AGREE II.
Results
Eleven CPGs were eligible, of which six made CAM recommendations. Average scaled domain percentages for these six CPGs from highest to lowest were as follows (% overall, % CAM): clarity and presentation (83.3%, 73.6%); scope and purpose (77.8%, 76.4%); editorial independence (69.4%, 36.8%); stakeholder involvement (55.6%, 31.9%); rigour of development (53.1%, 46.9%); and applicability (43.8%, 29.2%).
Conclusions
A need exists to improve the quality of CAM recommendations in anxiety CPGs through insight from AGREE II and other CPG development resources.}

Cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) is an important molecule regulating signaling for the life and differentiation of B lymphocytes and possesses the characteristics of a drug target for treating NHL. 2-Methoxyestradiol induces apoptosis in lymphoma Raji cells and CD20 protein is highly expressed by Raji lymphoma cells. Therefore, in this study, a CD20-SNAP-tag/CMC model was developed to validate the interaction of 2-methoxyestradiol with CD20. 2-Methoxyestradiol was used as a small molecule control compound, and the system was validated for good applicability. The cell membrane chromatography model was combined with high-performance liquid chromatography ion trap time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (HPLC-IT-TOF-MS) in a two-dimensional system to successfully identify, analyze, and characterize the potential active compounds of Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. extract and Lysionotus pauciflorus Maxim. extract, including Schisandrin A, Schizandrol A, Schizandrol B, Schisantherin B, and Nevadensin, which can act on CD20 receptors. The five potential active compounds were analyzed by non-linear chromatography. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of their interaction with CD20 were also analyzed, and the mode of interaction was simulated by molecular docking. Their inhibitory effects on lymphoma cell growth were assessed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Nevadensin and Schizandrin A were able to induce apoptosis in Raji cells within a certain concentration range. In conclusion, the present experiments provide some bases for improving NHL treatment and developing small molecule lead compounds targeting CD20 with low toxicity and high specificity.}

In pharmaceuticals, SSE 3DP has already been used to manufacture formulations for human clinical studies. To further support its clinical adoption, the use of a pressure sensor may provide information on the printability of the feedstock material in situ and under the exact printing conditions for quality control purposes. This study aimed to integrate a pressure sensor in an SSE pharmaceutical 3D printer for both material characterization and as a process analytical technology (PAT) to monitor the printing process. In this study, three materials of different consistency were tested (soft vaseline, gel-like mass and paste-like mass) under 12 different conditions, by changing flow rate, temperature, or nozzle diameter. The use of a pressure sensor allowed, for the first time, the characterization of rheological properties of the inks, which exhibited temperature-dependent, plastic and viscoelastic behaviours. Controlling critical material attributes and 3D printing process parameters may allow a quality by design (QbD) approach to facilitate a high-fidelity 3D printing process critical for the future of personalized medicine.}

The aim of the current research was to investigate the protective effect of Zhangyanming Tablets (ZYMT) in a mouse model of RP, and explore the underlying mechanism. Eighty RP mice were randomly divided into two groups. The mice in ZYMT group were administered with ZYMT suspension(0.0378 g/mL), while the mice in model group were given the same volume of distilled water. At day 7 and day 14 after intervention, electroretinogram (ERG), fundus photography, and histological examination were used to assess the retinal function and structure. TUNEL, immunofluorescence and qPCR were used to evaluate cell apoptosis and expressions of Sirt1, Iba1, Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3. A significantly shortened latency of ERG waves was observed in ZYMT-treated mice, in comparison to those in the model group (P < 0.05). Histologically, ultrastructure of the retina was better preserved, and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) exhibited marked increase in thickness and cell count in ZYMP group (P < 0.05). The apoptosis rate was decreased markedly in ZYMT group. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the expressions of Iba1 and Bcl-2 in the retina were increased, Bax and Caspase-3 were decreased after ZYMT intervention, while the qPCR revealed that the expressions of Iba1 and Sirt1 were significantly increased (P < 0.05). This study indicated that ZYMT has protective effect on retinal function and morphology of inherited RP mice in the early stage, possibly mediated via the regulation of antioxidant and anti-/pro-apoptotic factors expressions.}

1. Identify the benefits of a “patient story” exercise with a reflection component for medical students on a palliative care rotation 2. Describe the impact of a patient story exercise by reviewing common themes that were identified among medical students’ reflections 3. Discuss feasibility of integration of a patient story assignment with reflection as a routine part of palliative medicine rotations for learners of all stages
Original Research Background
Communication with seriously ill patients is a skill that requires practice; the traditional medical student model of learning to interview patients overlooks in-depth exploration of patients’ social background and personal history. This information is vital to determining goals of care and facilitates an authentic care partnership by building empathy and trust. We implemented a narrative medicine activity for students during their hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) rotation with the intent of highlighting the impact of humanism in the care of patients.
Research Objectives
Todetermine the impact of a narrative medicine exercise by a thematic analysis of students’ reflections on a “patient story” assignment.
Methods
Studentsreceived a 5-minute introduction to the “patient story” assignment. They invited patients to share their story and elicited “what matters most.” Students transcribed and shared this story with the HPM team and penned a personal reflection. We analyzed 100 reflections and used an inductive and iterative approach to thematic analysis that started with the development of codes from which broader themes were constructed.
Results
Four main themes were analyzed as being predominant with associated subthemes constructed and shown in parentheses: getting to know the patient (background, values, family, seeing the patient as more than a disease, resilience). student reaction to the experience (positive, negative, challenging), building blocks of the patient-physician relationship (empathy, trust, connection, listening), and student personal insights (personal reflection, lasting impact)
Conclusion
This activity demonstrated to students the value of uncovering patients’ backgrounds and values, reinforcing the multidomain approach of palliative medicine. The majority of students felt this was a positive, impactful exercise that would change their approach to patients in future practice.
Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice
A patient storyassignment is a feasible, well-received activity that creates an opportunity for students to reflect on the physician-patient relationship beyond the medical domain and enriches the care of those with serious illness.}

The studies were analyzed using bibliometric methods, and statistical maps were drawn to explore research trends and research frontiers. Sudden cardiac death and sudden unexpected epilepsy death were the two major causes of sudden unexplained deaths. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics in the past 10 years, molecular autopsy has become an effective research method as well as a research hotspot for exploring the cause of sudden unexplained deaths. However, molecular autopsy is underutilized in the investigation of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Developing standardized guidelines for diagnostic strategies for the deceased and their families, expanding the screening of mutation spectrum of related diseases, studying the association between variants and diseases in complex genetic diseases, and improving variants interpretation guidelines and disease sequencing databases are future research directions.}

abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gradually played an indispensable role in people’s health maintenance, especially in the treatment of chronic diseases. However, there is always uncertainty and hesitation in the judgment and understanding of diseases by doctors, which affects the status recognition and optimal diagnosis and treatment decision-making of patients. In order to overcome the above problems, we lead into probabilistic double hierarchy linguistic term set (PDHLTS) to accurately describe language information in traditional Chinese medicine and make decisions. In this paper, a multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) model is constructed based on the MSM-MCBAC (Maclaurin symmetric mean-MultiCriteria Border Approximation area Comparison) method in the PDHL environment. Firstly, a PDHL weighted Maclaurin symmetric mean (PDHLWMSM) operator is proposed to aggregate the evaluation matrices of multiple experts. Then, combined with the BWM and maximizing deviation method, a comprehensive weight determination method is put forward to calculate the weights of criteria. Furthermore, we propose PDHL MSM-MCBAC method based on the Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) method and the PDHLWMSM operator. Finally, an example of a selection of TCM prescriptions is used and some comparative analyses are made to verify the effectiveness and superiority of this paper.}

Hormone therapy (testosterone or estrogen treatment), one part of the standard of medical care for transgender adults, aligns secondary sex characteristics with an individual’s gender identity and expression. Despite established effects of sex steroids on drug-metabolizing enzyme expression and activity in vitro and in animal models, the effect of long-term, supraphysiological sex hormone treatment on drug metabolism in transgender adults is not yet established. Here, we synthesize available in vitro and animal model data with pharmacological concepts in transgender medicine to predict potential effects of sex steroids on drug-metabolizing enzymes, and their relationship with potential hormone–drug interactions, in transgender medicine.}

Diagnostic services at all levels requires technical expertise of different laboratory specialists. However the presence of all specialist together in one setup is always not possible due to limited number of trained manpower. Even today, diagnostic laboratory services remain unsupervised. To void this gap, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi, in 1988, opened up the patient-centric department of Laboratory Medicine with a centralised specimen collection centre and a core laboratory performing the majority of the routine laboratory investigations, offering a one-window solution to both patients and clinicians. In 1997, a three-year postgraduate Masters degree (MD) in Laboratory Medicine was started. This medical specialty encompasses the art of test selection, test operation, and test interpretation to manage patients. It aligns with the recent technological advancement of automation and advanced instrumentation that are breaking boundaries of the traditional medical laboratories of pathology, biochemistry, and microbiology. This postgraduate model ensures that the laboratory services are accessible, affordable, and available to both patients and clinicians without compromising quality care. Laboratory Medicine is emerging as an answer to one of the several inadequacies and pitfalls of the Indian health system.}

abstract = {Context
Pre-hypertension remains a significant public health challenge and appropriate intervention is required to stop its progression to hypertension and/or cardiovascular diseases.
Objective
To study the effects of individualized homeopathic medicines (IH) against placebo in intervening with the progression of pre-hypertension to hypertension.
Design
Double-blind, randomized, two parallel arms, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting
Outpatient departments of D. N. De Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.
Patients
Ninety-two patients suffering from pre-hypertension; randomized to receive either IH (n = 46) or identical-looking placebo (n = 46).
Interventions
IH or placebo in the mutual context of lifestyle modification (LSM) advices including dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) and brisk exercises.
Main outcome measures
Primary – systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP); secondary – Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile version 2.0 (MYMOP-2) scores; all measured at baseline, and every month, up to 3 months.
Results
After 3 months of intervention, the number of patients having progression from pre-hypertension to hypertension between groups were similar without any significant differences in between (all P>0.05). Reduction in BP and MYMOP-2 scores were non-significantly higher (all P>0.05) in the IH group than placebo with small effect sizes. Lycopodium clavatum, Thuja occidentalis and Natrum muriaticum were the most frequently prescribed medicines. No harms or serious adverse events were reported from either group. Thus, there was a small, but non-significant direction of effect favoring homeopathy, which ultimately rendered the trial as inconclusive.

abstract = {People are deepening the study on model explainability as well as performance to better understand models’ decisions from the human perspective. However, the lack of rare clinical diagnosis data always limits the power of the emerging data-driven deep diagnosis methods, and the traditional deep transfer learning (DTL) applicable for the case is often insufficient to learn specific features in medical image processing, leading to poor explainability. To address those challenges, a two-stage deep transfer learning model is proposed and applied to assist in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis. Especially, a two-stage transfer learning training strategy is designed to loose the data dependence of deep learning on the domain data, which is composed of the imitate stage that discovers shared basic source features and the transfer stage to relearn target patterns, with good explainability. The corresponding deep squeeze-and-excitation convolutional network is proposed to learn the clinical patterns of tongue symptoms, in which a three-layer feature pyramid network fuses the multi-scale tongue features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real clinical dataset in terms of classification accuracy and learning efficiency. The resulting accuracy of the proposed model proves its performance advantage with the recognition time achieving real-time performance.}

With the advent of genomic sequencing technologies, achieving precision cancer medicine requires prospective norms due to the large and varied sources of data involved. Here, we discuss the ethical and legal aspects of the policy debate around the relevant topics in precision cancer medicine: the return of incidental findings and sequencing raw data to patients, the communication of genetic results to patients’ relatives, privacy and communication risks with concomitant oversight strategies, patient participation and consent models. We present the arguments and empirical data supporting specific policy solutions delineating still contested areas. What type of consent and oversight are required to acquire genomic data or to access it where desired, either by the participant/patient or third-party researchers? Most of the raw sequencing data is still uninterpretable and the variants revealed subject to reinterpretation over time. No doubt the ethical challenges of precision cancer medicine are a prototype of what’s to come for other diseases. They are also paradigmatic for regulatory and ethical questions of the translational endeavors since the two worlds – basic science and patient care – are governed by different ethical and legal principles that need to be reconciled in precision cancer medicine.}

A sample of 310 students (141 from medicine and 169 from social work) voluntarily participated in the anonymous online survey. The vast majority (92.5%) indicated they had no formal education about MC, and only 11.2 % reported being prepared to answer clients’ MC-related questions. Participants reported favorable beliefs about MC benefits, the need for training, and recreational marijuana use legalization. Less supportive attitudes were reported regarding MC risks. Prior cannabis use (e.g., self-use, friends, or family) and individuals from a secular background were associated with more positive beliefs about MC benefits and its legalization for recreational purposes. Prior recreational cannabis use [OR=1.541] and having friends who recreationally use the substance [OR=1.891] were associated with the belief that MC is an effective therapy for epilepsy. These findings indicate an urgent need for students’ MC education to provide future physicians and social workers with MC-related capacities. Development of curricula and training programs in Israel are encouraged.}

This work proposed a new protocol for preformulation studies simulating thermal processing and aging of the printed medicines, tested regarding their morphology and thermal, crystallographic, and spectroscopic profiles. Generally, despite the strong drug-polymer interactions observed, the chemical stability of the model drugs was preserved under such conditions. In fact, in the metoprolol and Soluplus® composition, the drug's solubilization in the polymer produced a delay in the drug decomposition, suggesting a protective effect of the matrix. Paracetamol and polyvinyl alcohol mixture, in turn, showed unmistakable signs of thermal instability and chemical decomposition, in addition to physical changes. In the presented context, establishing protocols that simulate processing and storage conditions may be decisive for obtaining stable pharmaceutical dosage forms using three-dimensional printing technology.}

abstract = {Objectives
Publications assessing health and economic outcomes of risk-sharing arrangements (RSAs) are limited. Better knowledge of these outcomes would shed light on the pertinence of such arrangements, informing design improvements for the future. The aim of the study is to describe the different types of RSAs implemented in Catalonia and their health and economic outcomes.
Methods
Retrospective descriptive analysis of RSAs implemented from January 2016 to December 2019 in the Catalan Health Service, CatSalut. Individual RSAs were reviewed and categorized according to standard RSA guidelines. Relevant health and economic outcomes pertaining to the RSAs were analyzed using aggregate data recorded in Catalan central registries.
Results
A total of 15 RSAs were implemented over the study period (10 of which are still ongoing). A total of 8 consisted of performance-linked reimbursements (PLRs) and 7 of cost-sharing arrangements (CSAs). The arrangements were implemented in the oncohematology (n = 11), rare disease (n = 3), and neurology (n = 1) areas. A total of 951 patients were included in PLR and 73% achieved the target health outcomes. Total medication costs were €9 295 755 of which 11% were refunded to CatSalut. CSAs involved 2066 patients and resulted in overall refunds of €1 349 564 (2.61%) for CatSalut.
Conclusions
Both PLRs and CSAs were used to manage the different uncertainties related to accessing innovative medicines in Catalonia. The data generated provide relevant information to inform decision-making, allowing an adaptation of the initial recommendation for use and access. Additional efforts are required to increase the RSA assessments and their publication.}
