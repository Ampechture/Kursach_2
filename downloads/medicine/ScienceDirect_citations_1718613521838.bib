abstract = {Introduction
Traditionally Western Herbal Medicine (WHM) uses ‘whole plant extracts’, typically presented as liquids, teas and powders, with no formal measurement of identified plant constituents. In contrast, 'standardised extract’ preparations offer a guaranteed minimum content of specified constituents, as identified in modern research. A limited number of these preparations, referred to here as ‘highly standardised extracts’ and largely presented as tablets, offer a much higher dose of ‘active constituent/s′ than is present in the whole plant extract. They are the focus of this study. The study investigated how herbalists have come to use highly standardised extracts and their attitudes towards them, with a view to informing the debate and the wider interested community.
Methods
An online survey, a mix of quantitative and qualitative questions, was distributed by UK herbalists’ professional bodies to members.
Results
Findings from a total of 78 respondents indicate that there is limited but clear use of single highly standardised extracts by a large minority of participants, with use influenced mainly by the growing body of research, historical influence of other herbalists and clinical evidence of ‘strength’. All herbalists reported accessing herbal research studies. The major identified limiting factor on highly standardised extract use was the strong emphasis on the ‘natural’ whole plant extract.
Conclusion
This survey indicated a strong focus of responding herbalists on the use of the natural whole plant extract. Despite limited use of research-based highly standardised extracts, all reported engagement with research. It is acknowledged that response bias limits strength of conclusions.}

abstract = {The proprietary Chinese medicine Jinkui Shenqi Pill (PCM-JKSQP) is a classic compound used for the effective clinical treatment of kidney yang deficiency syndrome (KYDS), a metabolic disease accompanied by kidney injury. However, its active ingredients and therapeutic mechanisms are not clear. This study employed serum pharmacochemistry, network pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics (PK) to identify the bioactive components of PCM-JKSQP and preliminarily clarify its mechanism in treating KYDS. One hundred and forty chemical components of PCM-JKSQP, 47 (20 parent compouds and 27 metabolites) of which were absorbed into the blood, were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS). The topological parameters of network pharmacology and high concentrations in blood found six parent components as PK markers (cinnamic acid, paeonol, loganin, morroniside, apigenin, and poricoic acid A). PK analysis further identified these six compounds as active ingredients. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and molecular docking simulation predicted and verified eight core targets (TP53, ESR1, CTNNB1, EP300, EGFR, AKT1, ERBB2, and TNF). Most were concentrated in the MAPK, HIF-1, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, indicating that these six active ingredients may mainly exert therapeutic effects through these three pathways via their core targets. The PK results also showed these six components were absorbed quickly, although cinnamic acid and paeonol were rapidly metabolized, with a short half-life and retention time. Loganin and morroniside did not have high peak concentrations, and apigenin and poricoic acid A had long retention times. This study provides a new overall perspective for exploring the bioactive components and mechanisms underlying the effects of PCM-JKSQP in treating KYDS.}

abstract = {Introduction
Medicines related problems (MRPs) can be common in frail older people due to age-compromised body systems and a propensity to be on multiple drugs concurrently. This group of people can also succumb to a rapid deterioration in health. Thus, it is important to investigate MRPs in frail older people. The objectives of the study were to evaluate prevalence of MRPs, types of MRPs, risk factors and deterioration that can be associated with MRPs in frail older people admitted to an English teaching hospital from primary care.
Methods
Included in the sample were frail older adults, aged 65 years and over, admitted from primary care. Data was retrieved from the hospital's electronic patient record system, anonymised, and reviewed for MRPs. MRPs which were retrospectively identified at admission were coded with the WHO-ICD10,2016 (World Health Organisation-International Classification of Diseases version 10, 2016). Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed on the data using SPSS Version 25. Primary outcome was the prevalence of MRPs in frail older patients. Secondary outcome was the association of deterioration indicated as fall, delirium, or NEWs ≥3 with presence of MRPs.
Results
Among the 507 frail older people (≥4 on Rockwood scale) that met criteria for inclusion, 262 (51.8%) were patients with MRPs and 244 (48.2%) without. The Median age of sample as a whole was 85 years (IQR = 80–89). Prevalence of MRPs was 33.28%. Types of MRPs were adverse drug reaction (ADR-20%), non-compliance (9.1%), unintentional poisoning (3.3%) and inappropriate polypharmacy (0.8%). In logistic regression, potentially inappropriate medicines (PIM), social support, number of comorbidities and winter were significant predictors of MRPs. Risk of deteriorating with delirium was two times higher in patients with MRPs than in patients without MRPs, RR 2.613 (95% CI, 1.049 to 6.510).
Conclusion
MRPs and risks of deterioration associated with MRPs in frail older people can be reduced. This is because factors associated with MRPs can be modified.}

abstract = {Objective
A core outcome set (COS) is the minimum agreed-on data set required to be measured in interventional trials. To date, there is no COS for oral lichen planus (OLP). This study describes the final consensus project that brought together the results of the previous stages of the project to develop the COS for OLP.
Study Design
The consensus process followed the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials guidelines and involved the agreement of relevant stakeholders, including patients with OLP. Delphi-style clicker sessions were conducted at the World Workshop on Oral Medicine VIII and the 2022 American Academy of Oral Medicine Annual Conference. Attendees were asked to rate the importance of 15 outcome domains previously identified from a systematic review of interventional studies of OLP and a qualitative study of OLP patients. In a subsequent step, a group of OLP patients rated the domains. A further round of interactive consensus led to the final COS.
Results
The consensus processes led to a COS of 11 outcome domains to be measured in future trials on OLP.
Conclusion
The COS developed by consensus will help reduce the heterogeneity of outcomes measured in interventional trials. This will allow future pooling of outcomes and data for meta-analyses. This project showed the effectiveness of a methodology that could be used for future COS development.}

Mental health comorbidities among individuals with serious illness are prevalent and negatively impact outcomes. Mental healthcare is a core domain of palliative care, but little is known about the experiences of palliative care clinicians delivering such care.
Objectives
This national survey aimed to characterize the frequency with which palliative care providers encounter and manage common psychiatric comorbidities, evaluate the degree of mental health integration in their practice settings, and prioritize strategies to meet the mental health needs of palliative care patients.
Methods
A e-survey distributed to the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine membership.
Results
Seven hundred eight palliative care clinicians (predominantly physicians) were included in the analysis. Mood, anxiety, and neurocognitive disorders were frequently encountered comorbidities that many respondents felt comfortable managing. Respondents felt less comfortable with other psychiatric comorbidities. Eighty percent of respondents noted that patients’ mental health status impacted their comfort delivering general palliative care at least some of the time. Mental health screening tool use varied and access to specialist referral or to integrated psychiatrists/psychologists was low. Respondents were unsatisfied with mental health training opportunities.
Conclusion
Palliative care clinicians play a crucial role in addressing mental health comorbidities, but gaps exist in care. Integrated mental health care models, streamlined referral systems, and increased training opportunities can improve mental healthcare for patients with serious illness.}

1. Describe the current landscape of learning opportunities on substance use, misuse, and use disorder integrated into Hospice and Palliative medicine fellowship training across the country. 2. Examine high priority gaps in educational resources that support teaching relevant primary addiction medicine knowledge and skills to specialty Hospice and Palliative medicine fellows.
Key Message
Primary addiction medicine skills training is critical for the modern practice of hospice and palliative medicine (HPM). This national survey of HPM program directors reveals wide variation, gaps in training opportunities, and limited resources. Results highlight the need to support the design and wide dissemination of educational curricula on critical and relevant primary AM skills for HPM trainees.
Introduction
Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) have high rates of serious illness, co-existing pain, and risk for substandard medical care. Over half of HPM specialists report regular management of opioid misuse/OUD, yet the overwhelming majority do not feel comfortable or well-trained in managing OUD or concurrent pain. Teaching core primary addiction medicine (AM) skills has been shown to increase fellows’ self-reported competency and satisfaction in caring for patients with addiction. ACGME requires fellowship training on ‘recognizing the signs of addiction,’ however there is little guidance on what this entails. Thus, little is known about the national variation in primary AM education for HPM specialty fellows, and which topics would be prioritized for curricular development if resources were available.
Objectives
To describe current training opportunities, educational implementation challenges, and curricular gaps in core primary AM skills for HPM fellows nationwide.
Methods
Anonymous Qualtrics surveys were sent to program directors (PD) at all 163 HPM ACGME accredited fellowships.
Results
84 (52%) of HPM PDs responded, representing adult/ pediatric physician (83%), nurse practitioner (8%), social work (4%), and pharmacy (3%) trainees. A mean of 3.6 hours was spent on formal education around OUD and misuse. 39% felt their trainees were ‘not so confident’ or ‘not at all confident’ in caring for patients with OUD. Three priority learning objectives for curricular development include: identifying appropriate patients and plans for buprenorphine (17%), managing pain and OUD (16%), and managing prescription medication misuse (9%). The most common challenges include lack of faculty with addiction training (22%), limited faculty with experience using buprenorphine (20%), and lack of available curricula (19%) or faculty to deliver training (19%).
Conclusions
Wide gaps in training highlight the need to support the design and dissemination of educational curricula on critical and relevant primary AM skills for HPM trainees.

abstract = {Background & Aim
Using standards in regulatory submission for regenerative medicine therapies is encouraged by regulators. The FDA has recently published a CBER document, “Guidance for Industry: Voluntary Consensus Standards Recognitions Program for Regenerative Medicine Therapies" (SRP-RMT). This poster will introduce and explain the use of the recently established program as well as the initial list of recognized voluntary consensus standards. This poster will outline this program and how to encorporate standards into your manufacturing process and regulatory approval. The current effort from the Standards Coordinating Body and ISCT to develop curriculum on how to interpret and implement these standards will be outline in this presentation.
Methods, Results & Conclusion: Methods
The SRP-RMT is a program through CBER to vet and formally recognize voluntary consensus standards that are relevant to regulatory approval of regenerative medicine therapies. Currently they have released a list of standard that have been accepted. These standards are voluntary in the approval process for regenerative medicines but are already understood and vetted by the FDA. This program will ease the burden on both sponsors and reviewers during the application process. There are many questions from the field about this program and how to interpret and implement these standards appropriately in the manufacturing process.
Results
In order to help the regenerative medicine community the Standards Coordinating Body has developed packages through ANSI where you can find these standards in relevant groupings and easily acess them. SCB has partnered with ISCT to develop courses accredited through ANSI on how to implement some of these standards. Currently the first course on ISO 20391-1:2018 Cell counting — Part 1: General guidance on cell counting methods and ISO 20391-2:2019 Cell counting — Part 2: Experimental design and statistical analysis to quantify counting method performance is preparred to launch through ISCT. SCB is currently in development of several other courses focused on other standards within the SRP-RMT.
Conclusion
SCB would like to spread acess and awareness of standards relevant to regenerative medicne and the new CBER SRP-RMT. Currently ANSI packages are available of these standards for sponsors to find and access. Courses in partnership with ISCT will help explain how to interpret and implment these standards appropriately within your regenerative medicne therapy manufacturing and regulatory approval process.}

The U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 has been used as a screening tool for residency selection. In February 2020, Step 1 numerical scoring changed to pass/fail.
Objective
Our aim was to survey emergency medicine (EM) residency program attitudes towards the new Step 1 scoring change and to identify important applicant screening factors.
Methods
A 16-question survey was distributed through the Council of Residency Directors in Emergency Medicine listserv from November 11 through December 31, 2020. Given the Step 1 scoring change, the survey questioned the importance of EM rotation grades, composite standardized letters of evaluation (cSLOEs), and individual standardized letters of evaluation, using a Likert scale. Descriptive statistics of demographic characteristics and selection factors were performed along with a regression analysis.
Results
Of the 107 respondents, 48% were program directors, 28% were assistant or associate program directors, 14% were clerkship directors, and 10% were in other roles. Sixty (55.6%) disagreed with pass/fail Step 1 scoring change and, of those, 82% believed that numerical scoring was a good screening tool. The cSLOEs, EM rotation grades, and interview were the most important selection factors. Residencies with 50 or more residents had 5.25 odds (95% CI 1.25–22.1; p = 0.0018) of agreeing with pass/fail scoring and those who ranked cSLOEs as the most important selection factor had 4.90 odds (95% CI 1.125–21.37; p = 0.0343) of agreeing with pass/fail scoring.
Conclusions
Most EM programs disagree with pass/fail scoring of Step 1 and will most likely use Step 2 score as a screening tool. The cSLOEs, EM rotation grades, and interview are considered the most important selection factors.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the impact of an etonogestrel implant training program within a primary care Internal Medicine residency training program.
Study design
We surveyed graduates of our primary care Internal Medicine residency program in the Bronx, New York who performed implant procedures though the first 32 months after implementation of a monthly faculty-supervised resident implant clinic. We assessed the number of implants placed and removed per graduate, and surveyed graduates’ satisfaction with the implant training program, perceived competence with implant procedures, and intent and ability to perform implant procedures and barriers to performing implant procedures postgraduation.
Results
Between July 2017 and February 2020, 14 residents placed a total of 34 devices and removed four. All 14 program graduates completed the survey in August 2020. All but one respondent felt this training was valuable and 11 felt competent placing implants without supervision. Although 10 planned to provide implants following graduation, none have been able to, largely because of credentialing and clinic-practice level barriers.
Conclusions
The primary care Internal Medicine program graduates we surveyed (n = 14) valued our etonogestrel implant training program and perceived competence, particularly with implant placement. However, even those who intended to provide etonogestrel implants postgraduation were unable to do so.
Implications
Internal Medicine residents trained to place and remove etonogestrel implants are most comfortable with implant placement. However, these physicians may face barriers related to credentialing and ambulatory practice scope when attempting to provide this care in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Medicines management is an integral element of Kuwait’s national healthcare system, crucial for ensuring patient safety and the efficiency of healthcare services. However, challenges have arisen within Kuwait's medicines management system due to loose administrative linkages among related agencies. This article aims to propose a cohesive and efficient national medicines management system aligned with Kuwait's broader healthcare framework. The piece consolidates insights from various dimensions of the national medicines management mechanism, encompassing medicines registration, marketing procedures, retail pricing mechanisms, information gathering systems, and safety assurance mechanisms. By considering Kuwait's healthcare system and adopting a holistic approach, the article recommends four pivotal pathways and essential agencies to oversee national medicines management. These pathways encompass a comprehensive description of each agency's roles. It stresses the urgent necessity for a cohesive national medicine management system intertwined with robust components: a medicines registration system, essential medicine management, pricing mechanism, distribution and information gathering, and a robust safety and risk management system. Collaboratively established with existing public agencies, including the Ministry of Health, Drug & Food Administration, and Central Medical Stores, this proposed National System for Medicine Management aims to function systematically and cohesively, ensuring the provision of quality, cost-effective, and safe medicines to patients. It emphasizes the critical positioning of Kuwait's medicines management system within the legal and regulatory framework of the country. The burgeoning field of digital health policy holds the potential to significantly transform Kuwait's healthcare landscape. As technological advancements continue to shape society, their integration into healthcare policies becomes imperative. Digital health policies, encompassing telemedicine, health information technologies, electronic health records (EHRs), and innovative data analytics, offer not only a means to modernize healthcare delivery but also to enhance accessibility, efficiency, and patient-centered care. Embracing digital health policies becomes crucial for Kuwait's evolving healthcare system, providing a pathway toward a more inclusive and efficient healthcare infrastructure. By leveraging technology to transcend geographical barriers, Kuwait can augment healthcare access, optimize resource utilization, and fortify its healthcare framework. The integration of digital health policies promises not just an evolution in care delivery but also a transformation in how healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patients engage, collaborate, and benefit from technological advancements within the healthcare domain. This paradigm shift presents Kuwait with an opportunity to innovate and create tailored solutions, effectively addressing disparities in healthcare and bolstering the quality, cost-effectiveness, and safety of healthcare services for its diverse population.}

To evaluate the prognosis of patients diagnosed with oral cancer by specialists in oral medicine before referral to a high-complex oncology center (HCOC).
Study design
A retrospective cohort study was performed with 282 participants diagnosed with oral cancer between 1998 and 2016 at an HCOC. Group I consisted of participants referred by oral medicine specialists (n = 129), while Group II consisted of participants referred by non-oral medicine specialists (n = 153). Sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related variables were tested as predictors of survival. Data analysis was performed using the Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, multiple logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression.
Results
Stage T was lower in group I, as well as the occurrence of locoregional and distant metastases. Exclusive surgical treatment was more indicated in group I, while in group II it was surgery followed by adjuvant treatment. Indication of surgical treatment was associated with lower TNM. Higher TNM stages were associated with worse overall survival. Specialized care did not influence the chances of surgery or overall survival.
Conclusion
Patients referred by specialists in oral medicine had lower clinical staging and higher chances of surgical treatment, although no differences in survival were observed between groups.}

Practicing self-medication using conventional and/or herbal drugs during pregnancy could contribute/result in illness and death for the mother and embryo. The focus of the current study was to investigate the level of practice and factors affecting self-medication with conventional and herbal drugs among pregnant women who were on follow-up at the antenatal care (ANC) clinic of Mizan-Tepi University teaching hospital (MTUTH), Southwest Ethiopia.
Methodology
A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1st to February 30th, 2022, among 264 pregnant mothers who were on follow-up at antenatal care of MTUTH. A lottery method was used to pick study subjects who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data which was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 24 software. Bivariate followed by multivariate logistic regression was employed to point out factors affecting self-medication practice with conventional and herbal drugs. P-value <0.05 in multivariate analysis was used as a cut-off point to decide statistical significance.
Results
It was revealed that 44.3 percent and 49.2 percent of pregnant women self-medicate with conventional and herbal medications, respectively. Women with no history of self-medication were 6.69 folds less likely to practice self-medication using conventional medicine than those with prior experience (AOR: 6.69, 95% CI, (3.847–11.659). Having no health insurance increased the odds of self-medication using conventional medicine by about 46% among pregnant women (AOR: 0.687, 95% CI, (0.373–1.264). Pregnant mothers who joined college/university education were more likely to practice self-medication than mothers without formal education (AOR: 0.656, 95% CI, (0.304–1.414). Gravidity, education level, and history of herbal medicine use were factors that influenced pregnant mothers’ use of herbal medicines.
Conclusion
According to the present investigation, self-medication by expectant mothers is very common; thus, education and guidance of pregnant women and their partners should be considered during their ANC follow-up to minimize self-medication-associated potential threats.}

A critical analysis of the list was performed and was compared with the WHO 22nd Model List of Essential Medicines published in 2021. The Standing National Committee, since its inception, have taken four years to finalise a list. The analysis identified that all the available formulations and strengths of the selected drugs are included in the list, which must be avoided. Furthermore, the antibacterial agents are not categorised as access, watch and reserve (AWaRe) and this list is not aligned with the national programs, standard treatment guidelines and nomenclature. There are a few factual errors and some typographic errors. These problems in the list need to be rectified immediately so that the document would be able to serve the community more effectively as a true model list.}

abstract = {Objectives
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners use body constitution (BC) in their daily clinical practice. The BC is innate, shaped by the environment, and highly dependent on the intrinsic properties of the human body. The Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) is the most frequently used diagnostic tool for physiological BC types. This study aimed to determine the proportion of nine TCM constitution types and comorbidities observed in the Ho Chi Minh City community.
Methods
A cross-sectional design was applied to collect data for this study. All the participants were classified as BC types by the CCMQ.
Results
There were 2127 participants aged from 18 to 90 years old (35.3% were male and 64.7% were female) enrolled in this study. Five comorbidities were observed including hypertension (33.7%), cardiovascular diseases (21.8%), diabetes (19.8%), hyperlipidemia (17.3%) and obesity (13.4%). In participants, the Balanced type was the most common (53.1%). The order of decreasing proportions of the unbalanced types was as follows: Qi-deficiency (20.0%), Qi-depression (15.7%), Blood-stasis (13.0%), Yang-deficiency (10.0%), Phlegm-dampness (9.1%), Yin-deficiency (8.7%), Inherited-special (7.6%), Dampness-heat (7.2%). Hypertension was strongly associated with most of types (except Dampness-heat), Diabetes mellitus was associated with only Qi-deficiency. Obesity had associations with Phlegm-dampness, Dampness-heat, and Blood-stasis. Factors such as gender, age and occupation can cause different BC development.
Conclusions
Among the participants in Ho Chi Minh City, hypertension (33.7%) is the most common comorbidity. Balanced (53.1%) is the majority in BC types. The associations between BC types and ages, genders, jobs, five chronic diseases were different.}

abstract = {Background
Access to internationally controlled essential medicines (ICEMs), medicines that are listed on both the World Health Organization's Essential Medicines List and one of three international drug control conventions, remains problematic in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Previous reviews have focused only on specific ICEMs or ICEM-related healthcare fields, but none have focused on all ICEMs as a distinct class. This scoping review therefore aims to identify the barriers to accessing ICEMs across all relevant healthcare fields in SSA.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted across indexing platforms Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science of studies published between January 1 2012 and February 1 2022. Articles were eligible if they mentioned barriers to accessing ICEMs and/or ICEM-related healthcare fields, if studies were conducted in SSA, or included data on an SSA country within a multi-country study. The review was guided by the Access to Medicines from a Health System Perspective framework.
Results
The search identified 5519 articles, of which 97 met the inclusion criteria. Many barriers to access were reported and were common across the ICEMs drug class. Main barriers were: at the individual level, the lack of knowledge about ICEMs; at the health service delivery level, low availability, stockouts, affordability, long distances to health facilities, insufficient infrastructure to store and distribute ICEMs, and lack of ICEM knowledge and training among healthcare workers; at the health sector level, lack of prioritisation of ICEM-related healthcare fields by governments and subsequent insufficient budget allocation. Cross-cutting, governance-related barriers pertained to lack of proper quantification systems, cumbersome procurement processes, and strict national laws controlling ICEMs, leading to overly restrictive prescription practices.
Conclusion
This review showed that there are a multitude of barriers to accessing ICEMs in SSA across all health system levels. Many of the barriers identified are applicable to all ICEMs, highlighting the importance of tackling barriers for this entire class of drugs together.}

abstract = {Objective
To systematically analyze the current status of outcomes reporting in clinical trials on treating stasis acute mastitis with Traditional Chinese Medicine breast massage.
Methods
We searched CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, JBI, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal, Clinical Trials Registry, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Center Watch Registry from inception to May IS, 2022 to find randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case series and cohort studies which reported the outcomes of stasis acute mastitis managed with Traditional Chinese Medicine breast massage, with search terms of mastitis, acute mastitis, lactation mastitis, puerperal mastitis, breast problem, breast engorgement, milk stasis, blocked ducked, breast pain, breast massage, and acupoint massage. Outcomes and the measurement schemes (measurement methods, timing of assessing outcome, frequency of assessing outcome, measurers) were extracted from the included studies. We used the Management of Otitis Media with Effusion in Children with Cleft Palate (MOMENT) to assess the quality of each study, then categorized outcomes derived from the included studies into different domains according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Arthritis Clinic Trials (OMERACT) Filter 2.1 framework.
Results
We identified 85 clinical trials, in which 54 different outcomes were reported. A total of 81.2% (69/85) of studies were assessed as medium quality with a mean score of 2.6, and 18.8% (16/85) as low quality with a mean score of 0.9. These outcomes were organized in three core areas. Lump size (89.4%, 76/85) was the most frequently reported outcome, followed by breast pain (69.4%, 59/85) and milk excretion (68.2%, 58/85). Five methods were used to assess lump size and four methods to assess breast pain.
Conclusions
The outcomes reported in clinical trials regarding stasis acute mastitis treated by Traditional Chinese Medicine breast massage are heterogeneous. Developing a core outcome set to achieve consistent standards for reporting outcomes and modalities for validation of the outcomes is clearly warranted.}

abstract = {Introduction
In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is regarded as an effective treatment for primary liver cancer (PLC). The present study analyzed the effect of TCM on the survival period of patients with PLC by analyzing the relationship between the treatment-duration-ratio of traditional Chinese medicine (C-TDR, (traditional Chinese medicine treatment duration)/(Overall treatment duration) × 100%) and the survival time of 1002 patients with PLC.
Methods
In this study, 1002 patients with PLC admitted to TCM Oncology Department of Changhai Hospital from January, 2015 to December, 2019 were enrolled. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression equation, propensity score matching (PSM) were performed to identify independent prognostic factors for survival outcomes of PLC patients at different stages and estimate the influence of C-TDR on survival time.
Results
Cox regression analysis indicated that C-TDR was an independent prognostic factor for survival outcome (P＜0.05) and a corresponding reduction of relative risk of death of 75.67% (relative risk (RR) = 0.2433; 95%Confedential Interval (CI) = 0.1747–0.3388). Similarly, it is also an independent prognostic factor for patients outcome of each stage (P＜0.05). The 251 patients of BCLC-A reduced 96.09% risk of mortality (RR = 0.0391; 95%CI = 0.0151–0.1012). The 396 BCLC-B patients decreased risk of death of 81.24% (RR = 0.1876, 95%CI = 0.1112–0.3163). Moreover, 355 patients of stage C demonstrated a 51.36% lower risk of death (RR = 1.0016, 95%CI = 0.9885–1.0149). Significant differences were found in the median overall survival (OS) both higher and lower C-TDR of all patients. Even after PSM, the overall survival of two groups were significantly improved following each stage.
Conclusion
Earlier administration of traditional Chinese medicine can reduce the risk of mortality and prolong survival in patients with liver cancer.}

Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DOs) are sparsely represented within plastic and reconstructive surgery (PRS) and recent changes including the elimination of step 1 scoring have further disadvantaged DO applicants. The demographics, degrees, and scholarly output of DO PRS trainees were compared to that of Doctors of Medicine (MDs) to identify areas of focus which could be used to increase competitiveness of DO applications.
DESIGN
A cross-sectional study was created, including ACGME-accredited PRS program trainees during the 2020 to 2021 academic year. DO and MD trainee demographics and scholarly accomplishments were compared using t-test and chi-squared analysis.
SETTING
Web-based publicly available information was collected for subjects.
PARTICIPANTS
A total of 1092 PRS MD and DO trainees were identified. DOs made up only 2.7% (n = 30) and MDs made up 97.3% (n = 1062).
RESULTS
More DOs trained in independent programs (63.3%) than integrated (36.7%) compared to MDs (88.2% v. 11.8%, p < 0.001) and more DOs trained at lower ranked PRS programs (60.0% of DOs and 18.1% of MDs trained at Q4 programs, p < 0.001). DOs had fewer publications (median, IQR: 1, [0-2]) compared to MDs (3, [1-8]), fewer citations (0, [0-6]) vs. (10, [1-56]) and lower H-index (1, [0-1]) vs. (1, [1-3]).
CONCLUSION
DO candidates should consider research years in the field of PRS and optimize clinical experience opportunities to increase the competitiveness of their PRS applications. Special attention should be paid to providing networking and research opportunities to DOs who lack home institutions.}

Regenerative medicine aims to activate the body's innate healing mechanisms to repair and function-restore damaged tissue and organs. Cell treatments, tissue engineering, and gene therapies are examples of regenerative medicine strategies. Cell treatments restore or speed up recovery by employing living cells, such as stem cells. The process of tissue engineering entails transferring newly grown tissue into the body. Gene treatments to cure or prevent disease entail changing or altering cell genes. Stem cell research is vital to regenerative medicine because it is crucial in many emerging treatment strategies. Researchers can create novel medicines that help enhance the lives of patients with various illnesses and disorders by better understanding how stem cells function and how they might be utilized to heal or rejuvenate tissues and organs. Imaging techniques play a vital role in regenerative medicine by allowing researchers and clinicians to visualize and track the growth and behavior of cells, tissues, and organs in the body. Imaging techniques can offer detailed information regarding the structure, function, and composition of tissues and organs, essential for developing and testing new regenerative therapies. This chapter will look at the most common imaging techniques used in regenerative medicine and understand how these imaging techniques are employed in regenerative research and treatments. Also, this chapter will provide insight into the software programs used in the current stem cell research. It will provide a future perspective on stem cell research with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Chinese herbal medicine is increasingly used as complementary therapy to manage nausea and vomiting in different cultures. One such herbal recipe is the Hezhong granules, which contain classical antiemetic formulations, and are commonly used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the key components of Hezhong granules, including Pinellia ternata (Thunb.), Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.), and Zingiber officinale exhibit significant antiemetic and antitumor properties. Despite this promising evidence, controlling CINV remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment. Moreover, there is a lack of scientifically designed clinical trials to validate the efficacy and safety of classical antiemetic formulas for CINV interventions.
Aims of the study
To investigate the efficacy and safety of Hezhong granules in preventing CINV in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods
This study was conducted between October 2020 and February 2022 in 12 hospital wards in Southwest China. In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, we enrolled patients with advanced CRC who received fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the Hezhong granule group (receiving a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and Hezhong granules) or the placebo group (receiving a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and placebo) during the first and second courses of chemotherapy. A 5-day diary was provided to all patients. Acute and delayed CINV were defined as CINV occurring within 24 h or between 24 and 120 h after the start of treatment. The primary endpoints were complete response rate (CRR, defined as the proportion of patients without nausea/vomiting) and objective response rate (ORR, defined as the proportion of patients without nausea/vomiting plus mild nausea/vomiting) for both acute and delayed CINV. Secondary endpoints were the daily rates of CINV events and Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE). To identify the predictors of CINV, we conducted multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial, number ChiCTR2100041643.
Results
A total of 120 participants were randomly assigned, of whom 112 (56/56) completed two cycles and were included in the full analysis. In the acute phase, there were minor improvements in the Hezhong granule group, but there were no significant differences in the CRRs for nausea and vomiting (mean difference:10.7 %, P = 0.318, 0.324), while the ORRs increased by approximately 17.5 % (mean difference:16.1 %, P = 0.051; 17.9 %, P = 0.037, respectively). In the delayed phase, significant improvements of approximately 20 % were observed in both the CRRs (mean difference:19.6 %, P = 0.053; 21.4 %, P = 0.035) and ORRs (mean difference:17.9 %, P = 0.037, 0.043) for nausea and vomiting. Additionally, the daily rate of CINV events showed a mean difference of 19 % (P < 0.05). According to FLIE scores, approximately 70 % of patients who received Hezhong granules reported an improvement in their quality of life, with CINV symptoms having“no impact on daily life (NIDL)”. No serious adverse events were attributed to herbal medicine.
Conclusions
Hezhong granules proved to be both effective and well-tolerated in preventing CINV in patients with advanced CRC, with notable benefits in preventing delayed CINV. These promising results set the stage for subsequent phase III clinical trials and experimental research on Hezhong Granules.}

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have yielded beneficial effects in a broad range of preclinical models and clinical trials for human diseases. In the context of MSC transplantation, it is widely recognized that the main mechanism for the regenerative potential of MSCs is not their differentiation, with in vivo data revealing transient and low engraftment rates. Instead, MSCs therapeutic effects are mainly attributed to its secretome, i.e., paracrine factors secreted by these cells, further offering a more attractive and innovative approach due to the effectiveness and safety of a cell-free product.
Aim of review
In this review, we will discuss the potential benefits of MSC-derived secretome in regenerative medicine with particular focus on respiratory, hepatic, and neurological diseases. Both free and vesicular factors of MSC secretome will be detailed. We will also address novel potential strategies capable of improving their healing potential, namely by delivering important regenerative molecules according to specific diseases and tissue needs, as well as non-clinical and clinical studies that allow us to dissect their mechanisms of action.
Key scientific concepts of review
MSC-derived secretome includes both soluble and non-soluble factors, organized in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Importantly, besides depending on the cell origin, the characteristics and therapeutic potential of MSC secretome is deeply influenced by external stimuli, highlighting the possibility of optimizing their characteristics through preconditioning approaches. Nevertheless, the clarity around their mechanisms of action remains ambiguous, whereas the need for standardized procedures for the successful translation of those products to the clinics urges.}

In this article, we present the rationale for rigorous formal training in clinical embryology, introduce CanEMB competencies for practicing professional clinical embryologists that are founded on CanMEDs role principles, and present a nascent Masters of Health Sciences degree program in Laboratory Medicine with a specialization in clinical embryology. This 2-year program has unique features including a Clinical Embryology Skills Development Laboratory, research capstone project, and 200-hour placement within a practicing assisted reproductive technology laboratory. Importantly, this program is delivered through a university-based Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology in partnership with a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Moreover, CHM has been widely used in China and other countries for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, with the advantages of preventing and curing hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases. However, the use of CHM in Western countries remains rather limited, partly because of the incomplete understanding of multiple complex components and uncertain pharmacological mechanisms.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Acacetin is widely distributed in traditional Chinese medicine and traditional herbs, with strong biological activity. Perhaps there are many potential effects that have not been explored. In the field of drug discovery, Mainstream methods focus on chemical structure. Traditional medicine cannot adapt to the mainstream prediction methods due to its complex composition.
Aim of the study
Our aim is that provide a prediction method more suitable for traditional medicine by graph representation learning and transcriptome data. And use this method to predict acacetin.
Materials and methods
Our method mainly consists of two parts. The first part is to use the method of graph representation learning to vectorize drugs as a database. The original data of this part comes from transcriptome data on Gene Expression Omnibus. The method of graph representation learning is an unsupervised learning. If there is no prior knowledge as the label data, the training effect cannot be analyzed. Therefore, we define a standard score to evaluate our results through the idea of Jaccard index. The second part is to put the target drug into our database. The potential similarity between drugs was evaluated by the Euclidean distance between vectors, and the potential efficacy of the target drug is predicted by combining the chemical-disease relationship data in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. The target drug in this paper uses acacetin. We compared the predicted results with existing reports, and we also experimentally verified the efficacy of improving insulin resistance in the predicted results.
Results
The prediction results are relatively consistent with the existing reports, which demonstrated that our method has a certain degree of predictive performance. And for the efficacy of improving insulin resistance in the predicted result, we verified it through experiments.
Conclusions
We propose a method to predict the potential efficacy of drugs based on transcriptome data, using Graph representation learning, which is very suitable for traditional medicine. Through this method, we predicted the efficacy of acacetin, and the results are relatively consistent with the current reports. This provides a new idea for unsupervised learning to apply medical information.}

abstract = {Objective
The Exercise is Medicine® On Campus (EIM-OC) international campaign leverages university resources (e.g., health centers, recreation, and kinesiology departments) to encourage students, faculty, and staff to integrate physical activity into campus culture. This involves evaluating student physical activity levels during health visits and establishing referral systems for exercise prescriptions. EIM-OC allows universities to earn tiered recognition (Gold, Silver, or Bronze) based on their on-campus physical activity promotion and integration. For Gold recognition, schools must incorporate routine physical activity assessments into their health system, ultimately connecting healthcare providers with health/fitness professionals (HFPs, e.g., campus recreation professionals, kinesiology professors). This research worked to uncover pivotal factors driving EIM-OC on-campus collaborations through HFPs’ perspectives.
Methods
HFPs (n = 11) working full-time at a Gold-level institution (n = 10 in United States) participated. Semi-structured, Zoom-recorded interviews with a generic qualitative research design were completed between June and September 2022.
Results
Major thematic findings included the importance of tangible support (e.g., personnel), encounters with both trust and tension cross-campus, positive student development opportunities, and variations in outcome reporting and program evaluation. Faculty and staff emphasized the need for methods to obtain and sustain program funding. Participants also expressed the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to increase the collective impact of EIM-OC on student health and overall collegiate success.
Conclusion
HFPs expanded on their EIM-OC experiences and program sustainment or growth requirements. With increased interdisciplinary collaboration, rigor in outcome reporting, and tangible resources, the collective impact of EIM-OC on student health outcomes and overall collegiate success could be greatly perpetuated.}

abstract = {Background
Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare yet well-documented polygenic and systemic autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent spiking fever, transient skin rash, arthralgia, and sore throat. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds a significant role in complementary and alternative medicine. This study presents a unique case of a female AOSD patient with concurrent Qi and fluid deficiency syndrome who received combined treatment with formulated Zhu Ye Shi Gao Decoction (ZYSGD).
Case presentation
In this case, a 28-year-old female patient presented with a 15-day history of fever and skin rash accompanied by sore throat, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia. Additionally, leucocytosis, aminotransferase abnormalities, and elevated inflammatory factor levels were observed. Infectious diseases, solid tumors, and hematological disorders were all ruled out. Anti-infective treatments proved ineffective, leading to the final diagnosis of AOSD. Glucocorticoid therapy provided only partial relief. Consequently, formulated ZYSGD and hepatoprotective drugs were added to the glucocorticoid treatment. Subsequently, the patient's symptoms and inflammatory biomarkers showed improvement. After discharge, the patient's condition remained stable while continuing the formulated ZYSGD in combination with 4 mg of Medrolol (qd) during a 10-month follow-up period.
Conclusion
This case report suggests that formulated ZYSGD could be a viable option for complementary and alternative therapy for late-stage AOSD, especially in cases involving both Qi and body fluid imbalances.}

Skeletal disorder is of concern to the poultry industry as it affects animal welfare and production performance. Traditional Chinese medicine could improve bone quality and reduce the incidence of bone disease, but the molecular regulation of Chinese medicine formula (CMF) on improving bone quality in broilers is still unclear. This study was performed to research the effects of CMF on skeletal performance of Cobb broilers and reveal the molecular regulation. A total of 120 one-day-old Cobb broilers were randomly allocated into 4 equal groups of 30 chickens, with 5 replicates and 6 chickens in each replicate. The control (CON) group was fed a diet without CMF, while the CMF1, CMF2, and CMF3 groups were supplemented with different CMF at 6,000 mg/kg diet, respectively. The broilers were raised to 60 d of age, then bone tissues were collected for biomechanical properties, micro-CT detection and transcriptomic sequencing analysis. The results showed that CMF3 improved the biomechanical properties of broiler tibia, via increasing the elastic modulus (P < 0.05), yield strength (P > 0.05), maximum stress (P < 0.05) and fracture stress (P < 0.05) of the tibia. Micro-CT analysis indicated that CMF3 increased the bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), bone surface density (BS/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and decreased the trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) of femur cancellous bone (P < 0.05). RNA-seq analysis revealed 2,177 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (|log2FoldChange| ≥ 1, FDR < 0.05) between the CMF3 group and CON group. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) analysis showed 13 pathways mostly associated with bone growth and development and bone metabolism, and we identified 39 bone-related DEGs. This study suggests that CMF3 could improve bone strength and bone microstructure of broilers, and showed a positive effect on bone performance. Our research could provide a theoretical reference for the development of pollution-free feed additives to improve the skeletal performance of broilers, which could help promote healthy farming of chickens.}

For each method, its application and implementation e.g., single classifier vs. multiple classifier, single compound vs. multiple compounds, validation vs. screening, were explored. While these methods provide data-driven toxicity prediction that is validated in vitro and/or in vivo, it is still limited to single compound analysis. In addition, these methods are limited to several types of toxicity, with hepatotoxicity being the most dominant. Future studies involving the testing of combination of compounds on the front end i.e., to generate data for in silico modeling, and back end i.e., validate findings from prediction models will advance the in silico toxicity modeling of TCM compounds.}

To characterize the emergency medicine resident physician workforce and the residency programs training them.
Methods
We identified emergency medicine residents in the 2020 American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile, analyzed demographic information, mapped both county-level population-adjusted and hospital referral region densities, and compared 2020 versus 2008 resident physician densities. We also analyzed all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited emergency medicine residency programs from 2013 to 2020, mapped state-level population-adjusted densities, and identified temporal trends in program location and state-level program densities. All population-adjusted densities were calculated using the US Census Bureau resident population estimates.
Results
There were 6,993 emergency medicine residents in the 2020 AMA dataset with complete information. Most of them (98%) were in urban areas. Compared with 2008, per 100,000 US population, this represents disproportionate increases in urban areas (total [0.5], urban [0.5], large rural [0.2] and small rural [0.05]). We further identified 160 (2013) to 265 (2020) residency programs using the ACGME data. The new programs were 3-year training programs that were disproportionately added to states with an already higher number of programs (Florida [5 to 19], Michigan [11 to 25], New York [21 to 31], Ohio [9 to 18], Pennsylvania [12 to 21], California [14 to 22]).
Conclusion
The number of emergency medicine residency programs has increased; most new programs were added to the states that already had emergency medicine residency programs. There is an emergency physician “desert” in the rural United States, lacking both residents and residency training programs. This analysis provides essential context to the ongoing conversation about the future of the emergency physician workforce.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
This joint expert review by the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) and National Lipid Association (NLA) provides clinicians an overview of the pathophysiologic and clinical considerations regarding obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
METHODS
This joint expert review is based upon scientific evidence, clinical perspectives of the authors, and peer review by the OMA and NLA leadership.
RESULTS
Among individuals with obesity, adipose tissue may store over 50% of the total body free cholesterol. Triglycerides may represent up to 99% of lipid species in adipose tissue. The potential for adipose tissue expansion accounts for the greatest weight variance among most individuals, with percent body fat ranging from less than 5% to over 60%. While population studies suggest a modest increase in blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with excess adiposity, the adiposopathic dyslipidemia pattern most often described with an increase in adiposity includes elevated triglycerides, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), increased non-HDL-C, elevated apolipoprotein B, increased LDL particle concentration, and increased small, dense LDL particles.
CONCLUSIONS
Obesity increases CVD risk, at least partially due to promotion of an adiposopathic, atherogenic lipid profile. Obesity also worsens other cardiometabolic risk factors. Among patients with obesity, interventions that reduce body weight and improve CVD outcomes are generally associated with improved lipid levels. Given the modest improvement in blood LDL-C with weight reduction in patients with overweight or obesity, early interventions to treat both excess adiposity and elevated atherogenic cholesterol (LDL-C and/or non-HDL-C) levels represent priorities in reducing the risk of CVD.}

Overall, pretravel advice content and frequency including vaccine and malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations were inadequate. Significant predictors of high frequency of pretravel consultations (≥10/month) included male PCPs (AOR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.01, 3.18), PCPs who had postgraduate training or experience in TM (AOR 2.74, 95% CI: 1.59, 4.72), and multilingual (speaking ≥3 languages) physicians (AOR 1.96, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.45). Frequently encountered post-travel illnesses included travelers’ diarrhea, respiratory diseases, and fever. While, most PCPs provided pretravel consultations, the frequency and content of consultations were inadequate. Male PCPs, past training or experience in TM, and multilingual physicians were important predictors of providing a high frequency of pretravel consultation. The findings of this study identified several gaps in PCPs’ TM practice. Specific measures should be designed and implemented to reduce the burden of travel-related illnesses and promote healthy travel.}

abstract = {Background
Quality measures within Emergency Medicine (EM) were developed to standardize and improve care. Their development has been limited by lack of consideration of sex- and gender-based differences. Research has suggested that sex and gender can impact clinical care and treatment. Inclusion of sex and gender differences is needed to create EM quality measures that are equitable to all.
Objective
The aim of the review is to provide a brief history of EM quality measures and the value of considering sex- and gender-based evidence in their development to ensure equity, using acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as an example.
Discussion
Current quality measures related to AMI, such as time-to-electrocardiogram and door-to-balloon time in percutaneous coronary intervention, may have important and modifiable disparities when stratified by sex. Even when presenting with signs and symptoms of AMI, women experience delayed time to diagnosis and treatment. Few studies have considered interventions to mitigate these differences. However, the data available suggest that sex-based disparities can be minimized by implementation of strategies such as a quality control checklist.
Conclusions
Quality measures were created to deliver high-quality, evidence-based, and standardized care, but without the inclusion of sex and gender metrics, they may not advance care to an equitable level.}

abstract = {Summary
Theranostic Nuclear Medicine is based on the idea of combining the same molecule (or drug) with different radioisotopes, both for diagnosis and treatment, a concept that emerged in the early 1940s with thyroid diseases. It has since expanded to diseases of higher incidence, such as prostate cancer with several imaging methods used to assess the extent of the disease and the corresponding radiopharmaceuticals used for treatment. For example, by detecting osteoblastic metastases by bone scintigraphy, there are corresponding radiopharmaceuticals with therapeutic properties that eliminate pain from bone metastases, reduce pain of these detected metastases and/or determine overall survival gain. The purpose of this review is to discuss the role and great importance of Theranostic Nuclear Medicine in prostate cancer, addressing the main diagnostic imaging studies with their corresponding treatments, in the Theranostic model.
Conclusão
Nuclear Medicine plays an increasingly significant role in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to urological malignancies. The enormous advances in SPECT/CT and especially PET/CT images now allow an assessment of these tumors in the staging, recurrence, and response to treatment settings. Molecular imaging identifies alterations not identified by anatomical imaging and for this reason, PET/CT images are becoming increasingly indispensable in specific clinical situations and with precise indications according to the type of urological neoplasia. Theranostic Nuclear Medicine is rapidly evolving in prostate cancer and is a well-established and routine treatment option. Additionally, it is a personalized therapy. The concept of using the same molecule for diagnosis and therapy opened the door to guided and effective treatment, increasing patient survival while maintaining an excellent quality of life and without serious side effects, which is a challenge in metastatic cancer treatments.}

Semen Ziziphi Spinosae (SZS), the seed of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H.F. Chow (Chinese name Suan-Zao-Ren), is widely distributed in China, Laos, Myanmar, and Iran. It is a classic traditional Chinese medicine with sedative and sleeping effects. In clinical practice, there are more than 155 proprietary Chinese medicines containing SZS. However, many commercial SZS products are difficult to qualify using current methods. Moreover, there is a scarcity of quality standards for SZS in proprietary Chinese medicines.
Aim of the study
The purpose of this study was to clearly reveal the quality indicators during the entire production process of SZS and its products.
Materials and methods
This study reviewed more than 230 articles and related books on the quality control of SZS and its proprietary Chinese medicines published over the last 40 years (from January 1979 to October 2022). Moreover, where available, information on the quality of SZS and its proprietary Chinese medicines was also collected from websites for comparison, including online publications (e.g. PubMed, CNKI, Google Scholar, and Web of Science), the information at Yaozhi website and China Medical Information Platform, along with some classic books on Chinese herbal medicine. The literature and information search were conducted using keywords such as "Suan-Zao-Ren", " Ziziphus jujuba" and "quality control", and the latest results from various databases were combined to obtain valid information. The active components, which in vivo exposure, and Q-markers were also summarized.
Results
The jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin were revealed as the key Q-markers for SZS. Moreover, the advancements and prospects of the quality control for SZS and its extract, proprietary Chinese medicines, health foods, and adulterants were comprehensively summarized. The high-performance liquid chromatography-UV/evaporative light scattering detection and fingerprint analysis were found to be the mainstream methods for the SZS quality control. In particular, the novel quality evaluation method based on the unit content was applied for SZS and its proprietary Chinese medicines. Significant fluctuations were found in the contents of Q-markers. Moreover, the mass transfer rule of Q-markers was comprehensively clarified based on the entire production process, including production origins, ripening time, primary process, processing, compatibility decoction/extract, and storage. Ultimately, the crushing and compatibility of SZS were found to be the key steps affecting the active components.
Conclusions
In short, this study provides solid evidences to reveal quality indicators for the entire production process of developing rational quality standards for SZS and its products. Moreover, this study also provides a template quality control overview, which could be extended to other traditional Chinese medicines.}

abstract = {Objectives
We established a program of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) telemedicine that is safe and acceptable. Since December 2019, a multi-disciplinary team has been planning this quality improvement project.
Methods
We performed a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of using telemedicine and tele-ultrasound to enable prompt MFM consultations for patients in remote locations. We began with the training of sonographers followed by implementation in a small pilot. Interim analysis of the acceptability and feasibility of the program was done through patient surveys, images audit, and review of neonatal outcomes.
Results
Our background epidemiologic data showed that in Alberta, between 2017 and 2022, 460 patients travelled >6 hours, and 5038 travelled >2 hours from home to reach their site of birth. Patients were appropriately triaged to delivery/consultation at the tertiary level center based on diagnosis/suspicion of anomalies, such as abnormally invasive placenta, intrauterine growth restriction, hydrops, and partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, all of which were confirmed postdelivery. There was no neonatal mortality, and the single stillbirth was related to an unpreventable peri-viable co-twin demise. The patient survey demonstrated that for >85% of respondents the program reduced costs and stress. Ultrasound image audit found improvement and consistency in image quality after 3 months of training combined with supervision.
Conclusion
MFM telemedicine is feasible and can be safe with adequate supervision. Additional support and resources are needed to scale and spread this quality improvement initiative.}

abstract = {Background
Medicines are the most common medical intervention and medicines adherence is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Understanding drivers and experiences of medicines adherence is important for optimising medicines use. Māori (Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) experience inequities in access to medicines yet little evidence exists regarding Māori and medicines adherence, or the role of pharmacists in supporting medicines adherence for Māori.
Objectives
To explore Māori experiences of medicines adherence and non-adherence, and pharmacists' role in supporting adherence.
Methods
This was a convergent parallel mixed methods study. Facilitated wānanga (collaborative knowledge-sharing group discussions) were undertaken either online or in-person with eligible participants, using convenience and snowball sampling to recruit. Participants were eligible if they were Māori, 18 years or older, and had recently obtained medicine from a pharmacy. Wānanga involved semi-structured interviewing and questionnaire completion. General inductive coding and thematic analysis and descriptive statistical analysis were used respectively, and findings were situated in social, cultural and political Māori contexts.
Results
Thirteen wānanga were conducted with 62 participants (71% female, median age range 35–44) from September 2021 to February 2022. Four themes were identified: The aspirations of hauora Māori (Māori wellbeing) - medicines as a component of holistic wellbeing; whanaungatanga (relationships); knowledge; and whānau (family and support network) advocacy and problem solving. Forgetting to take medicines was the most frequently identified reason for non-adherence, followed by not having medicines on hand, adverse effects, and lack of symptoms of health conditions. Participants identified that proactive pharmacist support, including developing caring therapeutic relationships, sharing knowledge, acknowledging medicines as just one component of holistic wellbeing, and giving adherence tips to support routine medicine taking were positive ways that pharmacists could support medicines adherence.
Conclusions
Factors contributing to medicines adherence were diverse and participants identified numerous practical solutions that pharmacists, health service providers and policymakers could employ to support Māori medicines adherence.}

abstract = {Background
Improving social determinants of health, such as access to nutritious food, is crucial for achieving health equity. Nutrition insecurity, especially during pregnancy and postpartum, can lead to poor maternal and birth outcomes. Food is Medicine (FIM) programs, which integrate food into the health care system to prevent or manage disease, have the potential to improve nutrition insecurity, but research about perinatal FIM programs is limited.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of public health impacts of perinatal FIM programs from the perspectives of both program implementers and program supporters and implementation strategies used to enhance program adoption, implementation, and maintenance.
Design
Qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The interview guide was based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework.
Participants/setting
Program implementers (n = 16) and program supporters (n = 20) were recruited across the United States through purposive sampling in 2022 and 2023.
Analysis
Data were analyzed using deductive thematic analysis and an iterative feedback loop with the project partner.
Results
Interviews were completed with program implementers and program supporters and generated meaning units (n = 1,942), which were coded into themes aligned with each Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance dimension. Perinatal FIM programs reached multiple priority populations who were mainly recruited through health care systems. Effectiveness measures typically included nutrition patterns and practices, as well as return on investment. Motivations for adopting programs primarily included partnerships and connections, financing, and policies and laws. Program components varied and were adapted to meet participants and setting needs. Policy, evidence, funding, and partnerships could lead to program maintenance. Implementation strategies applied by the program supporters included financial strategies and infrastructure changes.
Conclusions
There is a need to identify the core functions and adaptable forms of perinatal FIM programs, which could lead to identification of standard evaluation metrics. This could result in greater uptake by potential delivery agents, increased funding and policy support, and enhanced benefits for perinatal population experiencing health disparities.}

Aim
To compare the students’ performance in SDL and DSL among UBCOM students.
Methodology
A total of 502 multiple choice questions (MCQs) from the mid-course and final exams were collected by the relevant subject experts from nine courses during the period from September 2020 till June 2023 that adopted PBL and TBL; 247 MCQs related to PBL and 255 related to TBL. Psychometric analysis was used to determine difficult, easy, and optimum questions (≤25%, ≥90%, and 26–89%, respectively). Point biserial as <0.19, 0.20–0.29, 0.30–0.39, and >0.40 which indicate poor, marginal, good, and excellent point biserial, respectively. Finally, the number of functional distractors was attempted by >5% of the candidates.
Results
No significant differences were noted for the students’ performance in MCQs related to PBL (representing self-directed, small group learning tool), and TBL (representing directed-self, large group learning tool) regarding difficulty index (DI), point biserial, and distractors functionality.
Conclusion
It has been observed that there is no difference in students’ performance whether PBL or TBL is used for learning Basic Medical Science courses. Small group learning such as PBL needs more resources in comparison to large group learning as in TBL, therefore any institute can decide on the adopted learning strategy depending on its resources and the number of students.}

Multiple factors (patient age, wait time, depression, etc.) have been associated with lower patient satisfaction as assessed by the Press Ganey® Outpatient Medical Practice Survey (PGOMPS). Social deprivation has been shown to impact multiple aspects of patient care but its impact on patient satisfaction in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) is limited.
Objective
We hypothesized that increased social deprivation would independently predict lower patient satisfaction, as measured by the PGOMPS.
Design
Retrospective large cohort study.
Setting
Single tertiary academic institution.
Patients
Adult patients seen by PM&R physicians practicing outpatient interventional spine and musculoskeletal medicine who completed PGOMPS between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019.
Interventions
Independent variables include: Social deprivation as measured by 2015 Area Deprivation Index (ADI), wait time, patient age, and sex.
Main outcome measure
Patient satisfaction was defined as receiving a perfect PGOMPS Total Score.
Results
A totla of 64,875 patients (mean age 52.7 ± 21.8 years, 41.4% male, mean ADI 29.9 ± 18.8) were included. Univariate analysis showed a decreased odds of achieving satisfaction for each decile increase in ADI (odds ratio 0.965; 95% confidence interval 0.957–0.973; p < 0.001). The most socially deprived quartile was significantly less likely to report satisfaction on PGOMPS compared to the least deprived quartile (91.1 vs 93.2; p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that the odds of achieving satisfaction was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.980 to 0.997; p = 0.009) for the Total Score, independent of age, wait time, and patient sex for each decile increase in ADI.
Conclusions
In this cohort, increased social deprivation independently predicted patient dissatisfaction in PM&R.}

Although regenerative medicine is a relatively new field, multiple diverse research groups are helping regenerative medicine reach its objectives. All endeavors in this field go through in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials which are prerequisites to translating such approaches from the bench to the bedside. However, despite such promise, there are only a few regenerative medicine approaches that have actually entered commercialization due to extensive demands for the inclusion of multiple rules, principles, and finances, to reach the market. This review covers the commercialization of regenerative medicine, including its progress (or lack thereof), processes, regulatory concerns, and immunological considerations to name just a few key areas. Also, commercially available engineered tissues, including allografts, synthetic substitutes, and 3D bioprinting inks, along with commercially available cell and gene therapeutic products, are reviewed. Clinical applications and future perspectives are stated with a clear road map for improving the regenerative medicine field.}

Coronavirus disease(COVID-19) outbroke towards the end of December 2019 in China, soon it started spreading rapidly to various countries leading to an outburst of pandemic. Due to the restrictions imposed to control the spread of the infection, globally the manufacturing, import and export of medicine and the healthcare services to patients with chronic illness had been affected. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of the pharmacists on the medicine supply chain for patients with chronic diseases during COVID-19 pandemic in India.
Methods
This study is a prospective, qualitative research involving telephonic, semi-structured in-depth interviews. An interview guide for pharmacists was prepared and validated using “Interview Protocol Refinement” method. Purposive sampling method was used to recruit the pharmacists; a telephonic oral consent was obtained. The interview session was audio recorded and the recordings were transcribed verbatim. Further, transcripts were validated and later analysed using NVivo software.
Results
A total of 8 participants were interviewed during our study. Thematic analysis of the transcripts resulted in seven main themes. The study showed that there was deficiency in medicine supply during the COVID-19 pandemic and the pharmacists faced several challenges in procuring and storing the medication, arranging for unavailable medicines, medication dispensing and provision of the services such as medicine delivery, patient counselling. There was also scarcity of manpower leading to extra workload and working overtime.
Conclusion
Uninterrupted supply of essential medicine is the backbone of health care system. An effective plan and appropriate strategies are vital to combat such future emergencies.}

1. Participants will be able to apply knowledge on palliative medicine integration with surgical decision making in frail patients in clinical practice, thus ensuring that elective surgical procedures are aligned with goals of patient with potential benefit of reducing mortality due to surgical complications in the frail. 2. Upon successful completion, participants will be able to employ similar practices in their respective hospital systems, and potentially conduct further quality improvement research on long term benefits of integration of palliative medicine with surgical decision making in the frail as part of processes to reduce risk in these patients.
Key Message
A collaboration between the surgical and palliative medicine teams aimed at improving goals of care discussions and aligning elective surgical interventions with patients’ values and wishes, with ultimate goal to reduce post-operative mortality rates. This comprehensive approach ensures that elective surgery optimally benefits patients while emphasizing their goals and preferences.
Introduction
Alignment of surgery with patient values is a critical concern in surgical care, especially for frail patients. We present a collaborative initiative between the surgical and palliative medicine teams to address this issue. Employing the Risk Assessment Index (RAI) tool with a threshold of =/>37 for pre-operative frailty screening, frail patients are identified and referred to the Frailty team for a comprehensive assessment and pre-habilitation efforts. The assessment includes a palliative medicine consult. This process had shown to decrease mortality among the frail from 25% to 8%. Our institution implemented frailty screening using the RAI tool in 2022. Data collection started in March 2023. Between March and August 2023, 143 pre-elective surgery patients were identified as frail with RAI =/>37. Twenty-seven of these patients received palliative medicine consultations. This approach resulted in significant increase in palliative care consults especially during the second three-month period compared to the first- 21/50 (42%) vs 6/93 (6%) respectively. All patients with palliative care consultations had goals of care discussions. In addition, this collaborative approach yielded several important outcomes and potential benefits: • Patient-Centered Care: Active engagement in discussions empowers patients to align surgery with their values and preferences, as well as making informed decisions about elective surgery and treatment options, improving care quality and patient satisfaction. • Potential for Non-Operative Management: Improved goals of care discussions lead to more frail patients choosing non-operative management, enhancing outcomes and quality of life. • Enhanced access to additional resources designated to facilitate patient-center decision making.
Conclusion
The collaborative model, employing the RAI for pre-operative frailty screening, pre-habilitation, and palliative medicine consultation, holds promise in prioritizing patient values and reducing post-operative mortality rates. Further follow up is warranted to evaluate the long-term impact of this collaborative approach on patient outcomes.

abstract = {Objective
To quantitatively validate the preintention factors, behavioral intentions, and implementation factors and examine the relationships theorized by the Unified Theory of Behavior Change (UTBC) model among adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Methods
We conducted longitudinal analyses of data from 40 adolescents with ADHD, aged 11 to 15 years old, and their parents, including self-report of UTBC constructs using standardized measures. We collected pharmacy dispensing records for adolescents for the 4 months that followed. We used bivariate correlations to examine relationships between medication continuity, behavioral intentions, preintention factors, and the implementation factors. We conducted paired sample t-tests to compare adolescent and parent responses on UTBC items.
Results
Adolescents (mean [standard deviation {SD}] age = 13.3 [1.2] years, 75% male, 77.5% non-Hispanic Black, 90% publicly insured) reported a mean total ADHD symptom score = 29.8/54 (SD = 10.94) and mean total impairment score = 18.7/52 (SD = 10.90) and had a mean percentage of days covered with medicine over 4 months = 0.21 (range = 0–0.97). Adolescent intention to take ADHD medicine every school day was significantly related to adolescents’ subsequent medication continuity (r = 0.37, P < .05). Adolescent self-concept/image and confidence taking ADHD medicine were the most important factors related to the intention to take ADHD medicine every school day. Adolescents reported less belief and intention to take ADHD medicine and more barriers to taking ADHD medicine compared to their parents.
Conclusion
The UTBC model shed light on factors related to subsequent medication use, providing a plausible mechanism for additional research to intervene to promote future medication continuity.}

Spinal muscular atrophy is used as an example case to illustrate this argument. To guide further inquiry into the current move in biomedicine towards precision medicine, I outline two analytical dimensions—material and social interactionist aspects of disease classification—and show how these can be fruitfully combined.

abstract = {Objective
The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine in the treatment of blood glucose, blood lipid and insulin resistance in prediabetic patients through a meta-analysis of clinical trials.
Methods
Randomized controlled trials of Chinese patent medicine in the treatment of prediabetes were searched in the databases of CNKI, WanFang, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Web of Science and Embase using the computer with the search deadline on June 2, 2022. The two researchers independently screened the literatures based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin resistance index, blood lipids, prediabetes reversal rate and diabetes conversion rate were used as outcome indicators. The quality of the study was evaluated according to the Cochrane scale, and data were analyzed by RevMan software.
Results
Sixteen clinical trial studies were eventually fitted into, and a meta-analysis was conducted on the included studies, and the final results showed as follows: Compared with conventional lifestyle intervention, the remedy of Chinese patent medicine intervention in prediabetes patients had significant effects on the outcome indicators, such as fasting blood glucose [MD = -0.36, 95%CI = (-0.45,-0.26), P < 0.00001], 2 h postprandial blood glucose [MD = -0.71, 95%CI = (-0.99,-0.42), P < 0.00001], glycated hemoglobin [MD = -0.33, 95%CI = (-0.48,-0.19), P < 0.00001], BMI [MD = -0.82, 95%CI = (-1.20,-0.44), P < 0.0001], insulin resistance index [MD = -0.20, 95%CI = (-0.29,-0.11), P < 0.00001], diabetes conversion rate [MD = 0.49, 95%CI = (0.34,0.70), P＜0.0001], and the differences were indicated as a statistically significant. However, the outcome indexes of TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C in blood lipid exhibited no significant effect, and no significant difference.
Conclusions
The results indicated that Chinese patent medicine intervention could ameliorate the outcome indicators of prediabetes with significant efficacy and good safety. Its therapeutic effect was mainly manifested in blood glucose, insulin, body weight, and diabetes conversion rate. Chinese patent medicine maybe a promising avenue for prediabetes.}
