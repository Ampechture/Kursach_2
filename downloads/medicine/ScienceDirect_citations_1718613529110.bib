abstract = {Summary
Background
Sarcomas represent an extensive group of malignant diseases affecting mesodermal tissues. Among sarcomas, the clinical management of chondrosarcomas remains a complex challenge, as high-grade tumours do not respond to current therapies. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes are among the most common mutations detected in chondrosarcomas and may represent a therapeutic opportunity. The presence of mutated IDH (mIDH) enzymes results in the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-HG leading to molecular alterations that contribute to drive tumour growth.
Methods
We developed a personalized medicine strategy based on the targeted NGS/Sanger sequencing of sarcoma samples (n = 6) and the use of matched patient-derived cell lines as a drug-testing platform. The anti-tumour potential of IDH mutations found in two chondrosarcoma cases was analysed in vitro, in vivo and molecularly (transcriptomic and DNA methylation analyses).
Findings
We treated several chondrosarcoma models with specific mIDH1/2 inhibitors. Among these treatments, only the mIDH2 inhibitor enasidenib was able to decrease 2-HG levels and efficiently reduce the viability of mIDH2 chondrosarcoma cells. Importantly, oral administration of enasidenib in xenografted mice resulted in a complete abrogation of tumour growth. Enasidenib induced a profound remodelling of the transcriptomic landscape not associated to changes in the 5 mC methylation levels and its anti-tumour effects were associated with the repression of proliferative pathways such as those controlled by E2F factors.
Interpretation
Overall, this work provides preclinical evidence for the use of enasidenib to treat mIDH2 chondrosarcomas.

Obesity is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in infertility, largely because of anovulation, and is associated with a lower rate of pregnancy with ovulation induction among anovulatory women. As a result of these trends and associations, in vitro fertilization (IVF) care will need to be adapted to provide safe, effective, and equitable access for patients with obesity. Research over the past 10 years has demonstrated safe sedation practices and effective procedure modifications for oocyte retrievals and embryo transfers in patients with obesity undergoing IVF treatment. We encourage IVF medical directors to revisit body mass index restrictions for IVF treatment in favor of individualized patient risk assessments to minimize weight bias and provide timely access to safe and effective IVF care for patients with obesity and infertility.}

With the limited resources and existent bed pressures it is important this postoperative destination is identified in advance. In this study we aimed to assess whether attendance in specialist preadmission clinic, involving an assessment by either an anaesthetic consultant or perioperative medicine physician, was related to unplanned ICU/HDU admissions postoperatively. All patient surgeries conducted at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne between July-December 2019 were retrospectively collected. Patients were excluded if they were emergency cases, hospital transfers or cardiac cases. Patients were grouped as either being seen in preadmission clinic by an anaesthetist/perioperative medicine physician or not and whether they were later admitted to ICU. Patients were counted as planned ICU admissions if there was a preoperative bed request or a noted plan for ICU ahead of surgery. Of 7712 surgeries conducted, 160 were admitted to ICU (2.07%). Of the ICU admissions, 73 were unplanned (0.9% of all surgeries) and 87 were planned (1.1%). Of the unplanned admissions, 19 were seen in preadmission clinic and 54 were not. This suggests that a preoperative review by a specialist anaesthetic consultant or perioperative medicine physician was associated with a reduction in unplanned ICU/HDU admission at our hospital.}

In patient or family narratives, fears or anxieties about impending procedures may be visualized, allowing for reader identification and empathy. Informational comics have also been found to be effective in preparing pediatric and adult populations for procedures.

abstract = {Background
The liver is renowned for its remarkable regenerative capacity to restore its structure, size and function after various types of liver injury. However, in patients with end-stage liver disease, the regenerative capacity is inhibited and liver transplantation is the only option. Considering the limitations of liver transplantation, promoting liver regeneration is suggested as a new therapeutic strategy for liver disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history of preventing and treating various liver diseases, and some of them have been proven to be effective in promoting liver regeneration, suggesting the therapeutic potential in liver diseases.
Purpose
This review aims to summarize the molecular mechanisms of liver regeneration and the pro-regenerative activity and mechanism of TCM formulas, extracts and active ingredients.
Methods
We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases using "TCM", "liver regeneration" or their synonyms as keywords, and classified and summarized the retrieved literature. The PRISMA guidelines were followed.
Results
Forty-one research articles met the themes of this review and previous critical studies were also reviewed to provide essential background information. Current evidences indicate that various TCM formulas, extracts and active ingredients have the effect on stimulating liver regeneration through modulating JAK/STAT, Hippo, PI3K/Akt and other signaling pathways. Besides, the mechanisms of liver regeneration, the limitation of existing studies and the application prospect of TCM to promote liver regeneration are also outlined and discussed in this review.
Conclusion
This review supports TCM as new potential therapeutic options for promoting liver regeneration and repair of the failing liver, although extensive pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies, as well as elaborate clinical trials, are still needed to demonstrate safety and efficacy.}

abstract = {Background
Pediatric trauma patients undergo fewer computed tomography (CT) scans when evaluated at pediatric trauma centers (PTC) versus adult trauma centers (ATC) with no change in clinical outcome. Factors contributing to this difference are unclear. We sought to identify whether the training background of physicians, specifically emergency medicine (EM) versus pediatric emergency medicine (PEM), affected the CT rate of pediatric trauma patients within one institution.
Methods
A single-center retrospective study of CT utilization based on attending physicians’ training in trauma patients <18 years between November 2018 and November 2020. Attendings were categorized into two groups: EM residency with no PEM fellowship, or pediatrics/EM residency with PEM fellowship. Primary outcomes measured were the proportion of patients receiving a CT and CT positivity rate.
Results
Of 463 study patients, CTs were obtained in 145/228 (64%) patients by EM, and 130/235 (55%) by PEM (p=.07). CT positivity rate was 21% and 19% in EM and PEM, respectively (p=.46). The mean number of CTs per patient in EM was 2.8 compared to 2.1 in PEM (p<.01), and for patients with an injury severity score (ISS) >15, mean number of CTs per patient increased to 4.9 in EM versus 2.4 in PEM (p=.01).
Conclusions
The mean number of CTs ordered per patient was statistically higher for EM attendings. The differences between CT rates highlight future opportunities for ongoing development of pediatric trauma imaging guidelines and radiation exposure reduction.

Background
COVID-19 is an important pandemic that affects the whole world. Another branch of the wreckage its devastating effects on the health care system is organ and cadaver donations. This article aimed to raise awareness about cadaver and organ donation during the COVID-19 period, with the support of student opinions.
Methods
Twelve opinions about cadaver and organ donation during the COVID-19 pandemic were presented to the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-year students at the Kafkas University Faculty of Medicine. The answers were compared between male and female students using the χ2 test.
Results
It is seen that the data obtained about cadaver and organ donation are important. In addition, the storage conditions of cadavers and organs, the risk of disease transmission, and the risk of contamination are discussed with striking data.
Conclusions
It is understood from the obtained data that awareness about cadaver and organ donation is always on the agenda. In particular, conferences and meetings should be held frequently to keep medicine faculty students informed. The handling of COVID-19 has also given a significant impetus to the research throughout.}

Various key parameters affecting the performance of the DSPE method, including the amount of sorbent, desorption solvent, desorption volume and time, extraction time, and sample volume, were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, NF@COF combined with GC-MS was successfully applied to the determination of 16 PAHs in CHMs. The method showed wide linearity (20–2000 ng mL−1), low limits of determination (0.3–2.7 ng mL−1), and high recoveries (78.0–124%).

As an advanced analytical technique, deep learning models significantly impact precision medicine because they can process voluminous amounts of diversified data with improved accuracy. Two salient features of deep learning models, namely processing a massive volume of multi-model data at multiple levels of abstraction and the ability to identify inherent features from the input data on their own, attract the implication of deep learning techniques in precision medicine research.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological human diseases, affecting 1% of the population in all age groups. Despite the availability of over 25 anti-seizure medications (ASMs), which are approved in most industrialized countries, approximately 30% of epilepsy patients still experience seizures that are resistant to these drugs. Since ASMs target only limited number of neurochemical mechanisms, drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is not only an unmet medical need, but also a formidable challenge in drug discovery.
Aim
In this review, we examine recently approved epilepsy drugs based on natural product (NP) such as cannabidiol (CBD) and rapamycin, as well as NP-based epilepsy drug candidates still in clinical development, such as huperzine A. We also critically evaluate the therapeutic potential of botanical drugs as polytherapy or adjunct therapy specifically for DRE.
Methods
Articles related to ethnopharmacological anti-epileptic medicines and NPs in treating all forms of epilepsy were collected from PubMed and Scopus using keywords related to epilepsy, DRE, herbal medicines, and NPs. The database clinicaltrials.gov was used to find ongoing, terminated and planned clinical trials using herbal medicines or NPs in epilepsy treatment.
Results
A comprehensive review on anti-epileptic herbal drugs and natural products from the ethnomedical literature is provided. We discuss the ethnomedical context of recently approved drugs and drug candidates derived from NPs, including CBD, rapamycin, and huperzine A. Recently published studies on natural products with preclinical efficacy in animal models of DRE are summarized. Moreover, we highlight that natural products capable of pharmacologically activating the vagus nerve (VN), such as CBD, may be therapeutically useful to treat DRE.
Conclusions
The review highlights that herbal drugs utilized in traditional medicine offer a valuable source of potential anti-epileptic drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action, and with clinical promise for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Moreover, recently developed NP-based anti-seizure medications (ASMs) indicate the translational potential of metabolites of plant, microbial, fungal and animal origin.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence available on the associations between urban greenness and mental health is mainly based on cross-sectional studies and has relied on 2D indicators of greenness. This longitudinal study aimed at investigating the association between 2D and 3D indicators of green and grey spaces and incident mental health-related outcomes in a large population-based cohort.
Methods
Our study used data from 593,894 Italian adults (≥30 years) from the Rome Longitudinal Study. Mental health outcomes were defined using either drug prescriptions (antidepressants, antipsychotics, lithium and other mood stabilisers, and anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives), or hospitalisation records (for schizophrenia spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, stress-related and somatoform, or substance use disorders). We obtained 2D and 3D indicators of green and grey exposures including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), green volume, grey volume, number of trees, and Normalized Difference Green-Grey Volume Index around participants’ homes. Cox proportional hazards regression models were developed to estimate the association of green and grey space exposure and psychiatric conditions and medicine use, adjusted for relevant covariates.
Results
We found beneficial associations of NDVI and the number of trees with antipsychotic and lithium and other mood stabiliser drugs. We also observed detrimental associations between grey volume and lithium and other mood stabilisers and anxiolytic, hypnotic and sedative drugs. Finally, we found a protective association of the NDGG with lithium and other mood stabilisers (HR: 0.977; 95% CI: 0.965–0.990) and anxiolytic, hypnotic and sedative drugs (HR: 0.851; 95% CI: 0.762–0.950). The associations for hospitalisation for psychiatric conditions were less consistent and generally not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Findings suggested that higher greenness areas around residential addresses are associated with reduced use of drugs for psychiatric conditions, while the opposite is true for higher grey space exposure. The study highlights the importance of accurately characterising green and grey spaces, using novel exposure indicators.}

abstract = {“Mountain emergency medicine” by definition is an emergency. In the wilderness, a mild disease or slight injury can become a serious problem. Mountain rescue originated among people who had established a close relationship with the mountains and stemmed from a strong sense of solidarity and thorough experience of the mountain environment. In Europe and North America, around 40,000 rescuers and 750 helicopters are ready for evacuation of casualties and patients in mountain areas. More than 1300 physicians and 50,000 paramedics take part in ground and air mountain rescue operations. Outside of Europe and North America, mountain emergency medicine is, however, still almost nonexistent, although 10% of the global population lives at altitudes >1500m and recreational activities in the mountains worldwide are significantly increasing. In the near future, climate change will become more and more the greatest challenge. Numbers of serious weather-related events are increasing as well as heat-related illnesses and vector-borne diseases. Robust rescue chains must be implemented, especially in developing countries. Nations should be supported by regional networks and mechanisms as well as international organizations for operational emergency response.}

abstract = {Summary
Precision medicine research has seen growing efforts to increase participation of communities that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Marginalized racial and ethnic communities have received particular attention, toward the goal of improving the generalizability of scientific knowledge and promoting health equity. Against this backdrop, research has highlighted three key issues that could impede the promise of precision medicine research: issues surrounding (dis)trust and representation, challenges in translational efforts to improve health outcomes, and the need for responsive community engagement. Existing efforts to address these challenges have predominantly centered on single-dimensional demographic criteria such as race, ethnicity, or sex, while overlooking how these and additional variables, such as disability, gender identity, and socioeconomic factors, can confound and jointly impact research participation. We argue that increasing cohort diversity and the responsiveness of precision medicine research studies to community needs requires an approach that transcends conventional boundaries and embraces a more nuanced, multi-layered, and intersectional framework for data collection, analyses, and implementation. We draw attention to gaps in existing work, highlight how overlapping layers of marginalization might shape and substantiate one another and affect the precision-medicine research cycle, and put forth strategies to facilitate equitable advantages from precision-medicine research to diverse participants and internally heterogeneous communities.}

Methods and results A single-center retrospective-observational study conducted at the Tel Aviv "Sourasky" Medical Center. Data was collected from electronic medical records (EMRs), from January 2010 to December 2020. We identified 24,021 patients, using ICD-9-CM codes. Only 7967 syncope patients were admitted to Internal Medicine Departments and evaluated. Logistic regression models were used to determine the effects of diagnostic testing per patient in each department on 30-day mortality and readmission rates. All-cause 30-day mortality rate was 4.1%. There was a significant difference in the number of diagnostic tests performed per patient between the different departments, without affecting 30-day mortality. The 30-day readmission rate was 11.4%, of which 4.4% were a result of syncope. Conclusion Syncope patients admitted to Internal Medicine Departments show a 30-day all-cause mortality rate of ∼4%. Despite the heterogeneity in the approach to the diagnosis of syncope, mortality is not affected. This novel information about syncope patients in large Internal Medicine Departments is further proof that the diagnosis of syncope requires a logic, personalized approach that focuses on medical history and a few tailored, diagnostic tests.}

abstract = {Objective
Vestibular migraine is a common vertigo disease, and studies confirm that Traditional Chinese medical has unique advantages in treating vestibular migraine. However, there is no unified clinical treatment method and lacks objective outcome indicators. This study aims to provide evidence-based medical evidence by systematically evaluating the clinical efficacy of oral TCM in treating vestibular migraine.
Methods
Search journals related with clinical randomized controlled trials of oral traditional Chinese medicine for vestibular migraine in databases includes China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China Science and Technology Journal Database(VIP), Wangfang Medicine Online(WANFANG), PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and OVID databases from their inceptions until September 2022. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, then conduct the Meta analysis by using RevMan5.3.
Results
There were 179 papers left after selection. Moreover, according to the literature inclusion and exclusion criteria, 158 studies were filtered and the remaining 21 articles would be considered in this paper, which include 1650 patients in total and 828 of them were in the therapy group and 822 of them were in the control group.Furthermore,the therapy group outperformed the control group in terms of the total efficiency rate and TCM syndrome score, and the difference is statistically significant(P < 0.01). The number of vertigo attacks and the duration of each vertigo decreased compared to the control group, which difference is also statistically significant (P < 0.01). The funnel chart of the total efficiency rate was approximately symmetric and publication bias was low.
Conclusion
The oral traditional Chinese medicine is an effective way for vestibular migraine, which would help with the clinical symptoms, reduce the TCM syndrome score, decrease the number of vertigo attacks and the duration of each vertigo, and improve life quality of patients}

This paper provides an assessment of the evidence gap between regulatory and HTA agencies on medicines receiving conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) and examines how HTA agencies in France, England, Scotland, and Canada interpret and appraise evidence for these medicines. A mixed methods research design was used to identify the types and frequency of parameters raised in the context of HTA decision-making for all conditional approvals in Europe and Canada between 2010 and 2017. Significant heterogeneity was found across the HTA agencies in England, Scotland, France, and Canada in the assessment of medicines receiving CMA, with the highest likelihood of rejection present in Quebec (50%) and Scotland (25%). Rejected medicines were more likely to have unresolved uncertainties related to the magnitude of clinical benefit, study design, and issues in economic modelling. More systematic use of joint early dialogue and conditional reimbursement pathways would help clarify evidence requirements and avoid delays in patient access to innovative medicines.}

abstract = {Currently, the spread and proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is of great concern due to the overuse of antibiotics, especially oxytetracycline (OTC), in aquaculture. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in aquaculture because of its advantages in improving the intestinal flora. However, there is a lack of direct evidence on whether TCM impacts antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments. In this article, a short-term simulated cultivation microcosm was established to investigate the ARGs distribution and microbial community composition in the gut of fish exposed to OTC and five TCMs (Emodin, Matrine, Berberin, Andrographolide and Astragalus Polysacharin) alone or in combination using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and high-throughput quantitative PCR. The results showed that TCM alone did not significantly increase the abundance of ARGs, but ARGs abundance increased when a TCM was combined with OTC, and there was no significant interaction effect between any of the TCMs and OTC (P > 0.05). Principal component analysis indicated that OTC had a stronger effect on gut resistomes than the TCMs. TCM exposure increased the ratio of beneficial intestinal bacteria (Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes), while OTC decreased this ratio. β-diversity analysis showed that TCM had a smaller effect on the intestinal microbiome than OTC. The host network of ARGs and microorganisms showed that Enterobacter, Aeromonas, and Niveibacterium may be hosts of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Variation partitioning analysis suggested that the effects of MGEs accounted for 17.8% and 7.1% of the variation in the ARG spectrum in the TCM and co-exposure treatment groups, respectively. Overall, this study indicates that the risk of developing and spreading ARGs in the gut environment under exposure to TCMs is lower than that under antibiotics exposure; thus, TCM may provide a solution for antibiotic-free aquaculture in the future.}

Assess resident physicians’ training experiences and self-reported application of motivational interviewing (MI) skills.
Methods
A cross-sectional nationally representative survey of internal medicine and medicine/pediatric residents from October 2021 - May 2022. Residents reported their MI skill training settings: lectures, standardized patients, role plays, group exercises, direct observation of patient encounters, and a full day or more course. Respondents reported frequency of using specific MI skills in the prior six months during behavior change conversations with patients.
Results
The response rate 71.2% (202/281). Respondents received MI training in medical school (67.7%), residency (27.2%), both (22.7%), or none (23.5%). Respondents reported MI training through formal lectures/information discussion (77.5%), MI exercises (77.5%), direct observation of a real patient encounter (38.7%), and one or more full-day workshops (8.5%). Most respondents never or only sometimes elicited change talk statements (73.2%), responded to a patient’s sustain talk (64.3%), and developed discrepancies in behavior between individuals’ current actions and desired behaviors (75%).
Conclusions
Significant training gaps exist within resident MI education, which may reduce the application of MI skills.
Practical implications
Behavior change is crucial to many aspects of patient health outcomes. This lack of knowledge may impact future physicians’ ability to comprehensively care for patients.}

Recently, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has transformed the medical field, and was expected to facilitate the efficient design and development of customized drugs through the synergy of their respective advantages. In this study, we present an innovative method that combines AI and 3D printing technology to design and fabricate customized capsules. Initially, we discretized and encoded the geometry of the capsule, simulated the dissolution process of the capsule with classical drug dissolution model, and verified it by experiments. Subsequently, we employed a genetic algorithm to explore the capsule geometric structure space and generate a complex multi-layer structure that satisfies the target drug release profiles, including stepwise release and zero-order release. Finally, Two model drugs, isoniazid and acetaminophen, were selected and fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing technology was utilized to precisely print the AI-designed capsule. The reliability of the method was verified by comparing the in vitro release curve of the printed capsules with the target curve, and the f2 value was more than 50. Notably, accurate and autonomous design of the drug release curve was achieved mainly by changing the geometry of the capsule. This approach is expected to be applied to different drug needs and facilitate the development of customized oral dosage forms.}

Insufficient representation of women and underrepresented in medicine (URiM) students remains a problem among the ophthalmology workforce. In the residency selection process, research productivity is an important factor. We aimed to determine the average research output listed by applicants and assess for differences by gender and race.
DESIGN
Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS
All San Francisco Match applications to the Wilmer Eye Institute for the 2019, 2020, and 2021 ophthalmology residency cycles were retrospectively reviewed. Each applicant's number of published research articles was recorded and subclassified into first-author publications in any field, publications in ophthalmology, and first-author publications in ophthalmology. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with successful publication.
RESULTS
A total of 1376 applications were reviewed. On average, women had a greater number of publications in ophthalmology (2.08 vs 1.73, P = .05) and presentations (4.52 vs 4.09, P = .01) compared with men. Self-identified URiMs were less likely to list publications in ophthalmology (odds ratio [OR] 0.650, P = .05) and first-author publications in ophthalmology (OR 0.570, P = .02) compared to non-URiMs.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings highlight disparities in research productivity by self-identified URiM status. On the other hand, women had similar if not higher research outputs than men. Greater research mentorship and opportunities to support URiM students may facilitate the recruitment of diverse trainees to ophthalmology programs.}

The effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine Huashibaidu granule (HSBD) in treating mild Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain to be identified. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of HSBD in mild COVID-19 patients.
Methods
A prospective, non-randomized, controlled study in mild COVID-19 patients was conducted in Shanghai, China, from April 8 to May 6, 2022. Finally, 360 mild COVID-19 patients received HSBD (orally 20 g twice daily for 7 days), and 368 patients received herbal medicine placebo (orally 20 g twice daily for 7 days). The primary endpoints were the negative conversion rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the negative conversion time. Secondary endpoints included the hospitalized days and the improvement in the clinical condition.
Results
The negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days posttreatment in the HSBD group was higher than that in the control group (95.28% vs. 82.61%, P < 0.001). The median negative conversion time in the HSBD group was markedly decreased by 2 days compared with the control group (3 [3–6] vs. 5 [4–7], P < 0.001). In addition, the median hospitalized day was shortened in the HSBD group by 1 day compared with the control group (6 [4–7] vs. 7 [5–9], P < 0.001). The clinical improvement rate (275/360 [76.39%]) in the HSBD group within 7 days was significantly higher than that (203/368 [55.16%]) in the control group (P < 0.001). The improvement of symptom scores in the HSBD group was higher than that in the control group (2 [1–4] vs. 1 [1–2], P < 0.001). No severe adverse events occurred.
Conclusions
Our study suggested that HSBD effectively increased the negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 and shortened the negative conversion time and hospitalized days in mild COVID-19 patients.
Clinical trial registration
The trial was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2200058668.}

abstract = {Background & Aims
The complex tumor microenvironment (TME) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has hindered the development of reliable predictive biomarkers for targeted therapy and immunomodulatory strategies. A comprehensive characterization of the TME is necessary to advance precision therapeutics in PDAC.
Methods
A transcriptomic profiling platform for TME classification based on functional gene signatures was applied to 14 publicly available PDAC datasets (n = 1657) and validated in a clinically annotated independent cohort of patients with PDAC (n = 79). Four distinct subtypes were identified using unsupervised clustering and assessed to evaluate predictive and prognostic utility.
Results
TME classification using transcriptomic profiling identified 4 biologically distinct subtypes based on their TME immune composition: immune enriched (IE); immune enriched, fibrotic (IE/F); fibrotic (F); and immune depleted (D). The IE and IE/F subtypes demonstrated a more favorable prognosis and potential for response to immunotherapy compared with the F and D subtypes. Most lung metastases and liver metastases were subtypes IE and D, respectively, indicating the role of clonal phenotype and immune milieu in developing personalized therapeutic strategies. In addition, distinct TMEs with potential therapeutic implications were identified in treatment-naive primary tumors compared with tumors that underwent neoadjuvant therapy.
Conclusions
This novel approach defines a distinct subgroup of PADC patients that may benefit from immunotherapeutic strategies based on their TME subtype and provides a framework to select patients for prospective clinical trials investigating precision immunotherapy in PDAC. Further, the predictive utility and real-world clinical applicability espoused by this transcriptomic-based TME classification approach will accelerate the advancement of precision medicine in PDAC.}

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance endangers the successful combat of bacterial infections in humans and animals. The common use of antibiotic classes including those of high clinical value in human as well as veterinary medicine is a critical factor contributing to or suspected to promote the emergence of antibiotic resistance. New legal provisions laid down in veterinary drug legislations and related guidelines and advice are in force in the European Union to safeguard the effectiveness, accessibility and availability of antibiotics. Categorisation of antibiotics in classes of importance for treatment of infections of humans by the WHO was one of the first steps. This task is also undertaken for antibiotics for treatment of animals by the EMA's Antimicrobial Advice Ad Hoc Expert Group. The new veterinary Regulation (EU) 2019/6 has extended restrictions for use of some antibiotics in animals to a full ban of certain antibiotics. While some (but not all) antibiotic compounds not being authorized in veterinary medicine may still be used in companion animals more strict provisions were already applicable for treatment of food producing animal species. Distinct regulations are in place for the treatment of animals kept in large numbers in flocks. Initial regulations focussed on the protection of consumers from residues of veterinary drugs in food commodities, new regulations address prudent (not routinely) and responsible selection, prescription and use of antibiotics, and have improved the practicality for cascade use outside the terms of marketing authorisation. Mandatory recording of use of veterinary medicinal products for food safety reasons is extended to rules for veterinarians and owners or holders of animals to regularly report the use of antibiotics for the purpose of official surveillance of consumption. National sales data of antibiotic veterinary medicinal products have been collected on a voluntary basis until 2022 by ESVAC, which has created awareness of major differences between EU member states. A significant decline in sales was reported for third and fourth generation cephalosporines, polymyxins (colistin), and (fluoro)quinolones since the initiation in 2011.}

Herein, a series of chemical profiling strategies including in-house library matching, molecular networking and MS/MS fragmentation behavior validation based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) were developed for qualitative analysis of MFZT granules. A total of 207 compounds were identified or characterized in which several rare guanidines were discovered and profiled into alkyl substituted or cyclic subtypes. Moreover, network pharmacology analysis indicated that MFZT’s anti-gout mechanism was mostly associated with the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling, nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like signaling and rheumatoid arthritis pathways, along with the synergistic effect of 84 potential active compounds. In addition, a quantitative analytical method was developed to simultaneously determine the 29 potential effective components. Among them, berberine, pellodendrine, 3-feruloylquinic acid, neoastilbin, isoacteoside and chlorogenic acid derivatives at higher concentrations were considered as the chemical markers for quality control.

abstract = {Purpose
Optimizing individualized clinical care in heterogeneous rare disorders, such as primary mitochondrial disease (PMD), will require gaining more comprehensive and objective understanding of the patient experience by longitudinally tracking quantifiable patient-specific outcomes and integrating subjective data with clinical data to monitor disease progression and targeted therapeutic effects.
Methods
Electronic surveys of patient (and caregiver) reported outcome (PRO) measures were administered in REDCap within clinical domains commonly impaired in patients with PMD in the context of their ongoing routine care, including quality of life, fatigue, and functional performance. Descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and inter-measure correlations were used to evaluate system feasibility, utility of PRO results, and consistency across outcome measure domains. Real-time tracking and visualization of longitudinal individual-level and cohort-level data were facilitated by a customized data integration and visualization system, MMFP-Tableau.
Results
An efficient PRO electronic capture and analysis system was successfully implemented within a clinically and genetically heterogeneous rare disease clinical population spanning all ages. Preliminary data analyses demonstrated the flexibility of this approach for a range of PROs, as well as the value of selected PRO scales to objectively capture qualitative functional impairment in four key clinical domains. High inter-measure reliability and correlation were observed. Between-group analyses revealed that adults with PMD reported significantly worse quality of life and greater fatigue than did affected children, while PMD patients with nuclear gene disorders reported lower functioning relative to those with an mtDNA gene disorder in several clinical domains.
Conclusion
Incorporation of routine electronic data collection, integration, visualization, and analysis of relevant PROs for rare disease patients seen in the clinical setting was demonstrated to be feasible, providing prospective and quantitative data on key clinical domains relevant to the patient experience. Further work is needed to validate specific PROs in diverse PMD patients and cohorts, and to formally evaluate the clinical impact and utility of harnessing integrated data systems to objectively track and integrate quantifiable PROs in the context of rare disease patient clinical care.}

To investigate user behavioural profiles and the prevalence of self-medication with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for COVID-19 among the general public in China.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
Self-administered online survey was carried out between January and June 2021 in China.
Results
A total of 1132 complete responses were received from a nationwide sample. A considerable proportion viewed TCM to be more effective than Western medicine for treating COVID-19 (67.1 %) and stated that it is safer to use TCM (63.5 %) and easier to access TCM for treating COVID-19 (63.5 %). A total of 16.4 % (95 %CI 14.3–18.7) reported ever self-medicating with TCM to resolve COVID-19 symptoms and 12.2 % (95 % CI 10.3–14.2) ever using TCM to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lianhua Qingwen capsule/granule (53.2 %), Ganmao granule (50.5 %) and Banlangen granule (44.6 %) were most commonly used to resolve COVID-19 symptoms whereas Banlangen granule (60.1 %) was commonly used for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age participants, from rural areas, with chronic diseases, higher socioeconomic status, and a positive attitude towards TCM were more likely to self-medicate using TCM to resolve COVID-19 symptoms.
Conclusion
Self-medication with TCM during the COVID-19 pandemic for symptom control or prevention is prevalent. The findings of the user behavioural profile and types of TMCs commonly used in this study provide beneficial information for the development of strategies to improve public health-seeking behaviour and the performance of the country’s healthcare system in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.}

abstract = {The last few decades have seen major therapeutic advancements in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapeutics. New disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have continued to emerge, creating more choices for people. However, no therapeutic works for all patients. Each has its own inherent benefits, risks, costs, dosing, and monitoring considerations. In parallel, there has been a focus on personalized medicine initiatives that tailor therapeutic decisions to patients based on their unique characteristics or biomarkers. Personalized effect estimates require an understanding of a patient's baseline probability of response to treatment and data on the comparative effectiveness of the available treatments. However, even if accurate risk prediction models are available, trade-offs often still need to be made between treatments. In this paper, we review the history of RA therapeutics and progress that has been made toward personalized risk predictive models for DMARDs, outlining where knowledge gaps still exist. We further review why patient preferences play a key role in a holistic view of personalized medicine and how this links with shared decision-making. We argue that a “preference misdiagnosis” may be equally important as a medical misdiagnosis but is often overlooked.}

Their choices are informed by a complex interplay of experience, information, and external forces. While cognitive shortcuts (heuristics) expedite assessments, there are multiple ways they can be subtly manipulated, potentially leading to reflexive control: external actors steering EPs' decisions for their own benefit. Pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, and media narratives are among the numerous factors that influence the EPs' information landscape. Using tactics such as selective data dissemination, framing, and financial incentives, these actors can exploit pre-existing cognitive biases like anchoring, confirmation, and availability. This creates fertile ground for reflexive control, where EPs may believe they are acting independently while unknowingly serving the goals of external influencers. The consequences of manipulated decision making can be severe: misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatments, and increased healthcare costs. Ethical dilemmas arise when external pressures conflict with patient well-being. Recognizing these dangers empowers EPs to resist reflexive control through (1) critical thinking: examining information for potential biases and prioritizing evidence-based practices, (2) continuous education: learning about cognitive biases and mitigation strategies, and (3) institutional policies: implementing regulations to reduce external influence and to promote transparency. This vulnerability of emergency medicine decision making highlights the need for awareness, education, and robust ethical frameworks. Understanding reflexive control techniques is crucial for safeguarding patient care and promoting independent, ethical decision making in emergency medicine.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate the metabolic mechanisms of Chinese and Western medicines on the metabolic network of striatal injury in a copper-loaded rat model of Wilson disease (WD) from a metabolomic perspective.
Methods
We divided 60 rats into 4 groups of 15 rats each according to a random number table, namely the control group, the model group, the Bushen Huoxue Huazhuo Recipe group, and the penicillamine group, and subsequently replicated the WD copper-loaded rat model according to the literature method for a total of 12 weeks. From the 7th week onwards, each intervention group was given an equivalent dose of the corresponding drug, and the control and model groups were given an equal volume of saline gavage until the end of the model replication. We used 1H NMR metabolomics techniques combined with multivariate statistical methods to describe the changes in the striatal metabolic profile of nerve injury in Wilson's disease and to analyze the effect of different treatments on their biomarker interventions.
Results
Nerve cell damage was evident in the WD copper-loaded rat model and could be reduced to varying degrees by different methods of intervention in the striatal nerve cells. The content of glycine, serine metabolism, and valine metabolism decreased in WD copper-loaded rat model; aspartate content increased after penicillamine intervention; glycolytic metabolism, valine metabolism, taurine metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism increased in the group of Bushen Huoxue Huazhuo Recipe.
Conclusion
Different intervention methods of Chinese and Western medicine affect aspartate, glycolysis, taurine, tyrosine, valine, and carbon metabolism in striatal tissues of WD copper-loaded rats, and can regulate the metabolism of small molecules, which in turn have certain repairing effects on nerve damage in WD copper-loaded rats.}

Pre-diabetes is a significant public health problem worldwide. India has a very high rate of progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes, 75–78 per thousand persons per year.
Objective
To study the efficacy of individualized homeopathic medicinal products (HMPs) against placebos in preventing the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes.
Design
Six-month, double-blind, randomized (1:1), two parallel arms, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting
Outpatient departments of D. N. De Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.
Patients
Sixty participants with pre-diabetes.
Interventions
Verum: HMPs plus yoga therapy (YT; n = 30); control: identical-looking placebos plus YT (n = 30).
Main outcome measures
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, measured after three and six months. Secondary outcomes comprised of fasting blood glucose (FBS), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), glycated hemoglobin percentage (HbA1c%), lipid profile, liver enzymes (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase), urea and creatinine, and Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile version 2 (MYMOP-2); all measured after 3 and 6 months.
Results
The proportion of participants converted from pre-diabetics to diabetics (n/N; n = diabetics, N = prediabetics) was significantly less in the verum group than control: HbA1C% (month 3: verum – 2/30 versus control – 11/30, p = 0.003; month 6: 3/30 vs. 2/30, p = 0.008), OGTT (month 3: 0/30 vs. 8/30, p = 0.015; month 6: 0/30 vs. 1/30, p = 0.008), but not according to FBS (month 3: 1/30 vs. 1/30, p = 0.779; month 6: 1/30 vs. 3/30, p = 0.469). Several secondary outcomes also revealed significant improvements in the verum group than in placebo: HbA1C% (p < 0.001), OGTT (p = 0.001), serum ALT (p = 0.031), creatinine (p = 0.012), and MYMOP-2 profile scores (p < 0.001). Sulphur, Bryonia alba, and Thuja occidentalis were the most frequently indicated medicines. Thus, HMPs outperformed placebos by successfully preventing the progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Munziq Balgam (MBm) is a classic preparation of a traditional Uyghur medicine used for many years to treat abnormal body fluid diseases. The formula, as an in-hospital preparation, has already been used in the Hospital of Xinjiang Traditional Uyghur Medicine to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with significant clinical effects.
Aim of the study
This study intends to reveal the intervention effect of MBm on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, discover the potential biomarkers with efficacy, and explore the mechanisms of metabolic regulation by using metabolomics method.
Material and methods
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups: blank group, CIA model group, Munziq Balgam nomal-dosage, Munziq Balgam high-dosage group and control group. Body weight, paw swelling, arthritis index, immune indices and histopathological experiments were carried out. Plasma from rats were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Metabolomics of plasma was performed to analyze metabolic profiles, potential biomarkers, and metabolic pathways of MBm for CIA rats. The main metabolic result of Uyghur medicine MBm was compared with that of Zhuang medicine Longzuantongbi granules (LZTBG) to explore the characteristics of two ethnic medicines from different regions for RA.
Results
MBm could significantly alleviate symptoms of CIA rats by relieving arthritis symptoms on paw redness and swelling, inflammatory cell infiltration, synovial hyperplasia, pannus, cartilage and bone tissue destruction, as well as inhibiting the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, UA and ALP. Linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, achidonic acid, gycerophospholipid, sphingolipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism and fatty acid degradation served as the main nine pathways of the interventional effect of MBm on CIA rats. Twenty-three different metabolites were screened out and strongly associated with the indicator makes of RA. Eight potential efficacy-related biomarkers were finally discovered in metabolic pathway network (phosphatidylcholine, bilirubin, sphinganine 1-phosphate, phytosphingosine, SM (d18:1/16:0), pantothenic acid, l-palmitoylcarnitine, chenodeoxycholate). Three metabolites (chenodeoxycholate, hyodeoxycholic acid and O-palmitoleoylcarnitine) were changed in both the metabolic study of MBm and LZTBG intervention effects on CIA rats. Additionally, MBm and LZTBG shared the same 6 metabolic pathways including linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, achidonic acid, gycerophospholipid, and primary bile acid biosynthesis.
Conclusion
The study suggested that MBm may effectively alleviate RA by regulating inflammation, immunity-related pathways and multiple targets. Metabolomics analysis showed that MBm (Xinjiang, the north of China) and LZTBG (Guangxi, the south of China), two ethnic medicines from different regions in China, share common metabolites and pathways but also have distinct differences in their interventions for RA.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Describe the design, implementation, and value of a travel medicine pharmacy elective. Students translated skills from rotations and practice environments addressing travel health-related needs. Content and educational outcomes align with the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, and Pharmacists' Patient Care Process core components of student learning and assessment.
Educational activity and setting
A two-credit travel medicine elective included live and pre-recorded lectures, self-learning modules, peer critiques, and patient engagement. Students shadowed in a travel health clinic interacting with patients to prepare a formal travel care plan unique to the patient's history and travel destination. Pre- and post-course surveys, quizzes, progressive assignments, and course evaluations provided the framework for curricular enhancement.
Findings
A cohort of 32 third-year students provided evidence of successful curricular integration. Pre-course surveys demonstrated 87% of students self-scored low knowledge and ability to apply travel health services. Ninety percent of post-course surveys reported high levels of knowledge and ability. High perceived value was evident in course evaluations with some student intent to pursue credentialing.
Summary
Community practice affords increased opportunities to identify patients in need of travel medicine services. The unique approach and design supported successful integration of a travel medicine elective in the University of South Florida Taneja College of Pharmacy curriculum. Upon elective completion, students were prepared to educate internationally traveling patients to safely self-manage chronic health conditions, reduce potential health risks and harm exposures during travel, and monitor health changes upon return.}

As illustrative case studies, Schisandra chinensis, Fructus cnidii and Radix ophiopogonis were chosen to develop and verify the strategy. The HPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used to identify the compounds in comparison with reference standards and literature data. A total of eight compounds, including four biphenyl-cyclooctene ligands from Schisandra chinensis and four coumarins from Fructus cnidii, were found to potentially increase SOD activities. No ligands were found in the extract of Radix ophiopogonis. Then, in silico molecular docking was performed to investigate the binding site and binding affinity of the candidates on SOD. Compared to the nonspecific ligands screened from the extract, the specific ligands presented stronger binding affinities. In addition, the activity and kinetic parameters of the SOD-ligand were investigated through an improved pyrogallol autoxidation method. Gomisin J and xanthotoxin showed a stronger ability to increase SOD activities. The present study indicated that combining UF-HPLC-Q-TOF-MS and in silico molecular docking offers a powerful and meaningful tool to rapidly screen SOD activators from traditional Chinese medicines.}

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose and is associated with high morbidity and mortality among the diabetic population. Uncontrolled chronic hyperglycaemia causes increased formation and accumulation of different oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, resulting in microvascular and macrovascular complications, which might seriously affect the quality of a patient’s life. Conventional treatment strategies are confined to controlling blood glucose by regulating the insulin level and are not involved in attenuating the life-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop a viable treatment strategy that could target the multi-etiological factors involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Stem cell therapy, a regenerative medicine approach, has been investigated in diabetic complications owing to their unique characteristic features of self-renewal, multilineage differentiation and regeneration potential. The present review is focused on potential therapeutic applications of stem cells in the treatment of microvascular diabetic complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and polyneuropathy.}

abstract = {In recent years tribology tests have been used to measure friction properties of oral consumables such as semi-solid foods and medicines. The tests aim to simulate thin-film mastication conditions and are intended to correlate with mouth feel or food texture properties. In this paper a new approach is proposed to better simulate shear conditions, fluid supply and friction data capture associated with mastication and swallowing. Two primary changes are suggested: these are the reduction of the inlet influence on lubricant film properties and the ability to measure transient and time-dependent friction. The new test was used to measure friction for a range of oral medicines including a viscous solution (cough syrup) and particulate suspensions (paediatric, calcium carbonate) in combination with an artificial saliva (mucin solution), The tongue-palate was replicated by a PCX glass lens loaded and reciprocating against a textured silicone surface. A short stroke length, comparable to the Hertzian diameter of the contact, was used so the contact operated in a partially replenished lubrication condition. This ensured the film in the contact region has the same composition as the bulk fluid. Friction was measured continuously during reciprocation for up to 5 cycles (comparable to mastication time) and data was sampled at 100 Hz to capture transient friction. Tests were run with and without a mucin layer present. The results showed that tests performed after 20 min adsorption of an artificial saliva solution reduced the friction coefficient from μ = 1 to μ = 0.2–0.3. Tests with the paracetamol suspensions, which contain hard particles, recorded transient friction spikes which were not recorded for the softer calcium carbonate suspensions. Key conclusions for the design of pertinent simulation tests are that the film properties in the oral cavity are not determined by the inlet as for classical lubrication. The (bulk) oral sample is captured in the tongue-palate contact and not continually replenished. When sheared it will exhibit time (transient, longer-term) and speed dependent friction responses which contribute to sensory and texture perception.}

The current review provides a thorough analysis of the studies conducted on the most important species of medicinal plants used in this disease, bioactive compounds and on the activity of herbal medicines in the evolution of chronic liver diseases. However, a negative aspect is that there is frequently a lack of comprehensive data on the progression of the illness and the living standards of patients who are affected when evaluating the effects of these phytocomponents on the evolution of chronic liver disease, the patients' health, and their quality of life. It is essential to take this impairment into account when evaluating the long-term effects of herbal treatments on the health of individuals who suffer from liver illness. Bioactive phytocomponents may be a suitable source for the development of novel medications due to the correlation between traditional uses and medical advances. Additional high-quality preclinical examinations utilizing cutting-edge approaches are needed to assess safety and effectiveness and to detect, categorize, and standardize the active substances and their formulations for the most suitable therapeutic management of liver illnesses.}

This study investigated the calculation of carbon emissions from TCMPE, with a case study focusing on the Shangyao Xingling (SYXL) Qingpu Pharmaceutical Base in Shanghai, China. Furthermore, the accounting of carbon emissions within its operational boundaries was conducted. The results indicated that the carbon emissions of the SYXL primarily stemmed from indirect emissions resulting from purchased electricity and heat, accounting for 80.7%. Meanwhile, sewage treatment also generated significant carbon emissions. Gray carbon, blue carbon, and red carbon were used to represent various types of carbon emissions, corresponding to different emission reduction concepts. Energy conservation, efficiency improvement, and the development of renewable energy will be crucial for TCMPE to achieve carbon neutrality. At the same time, some carbon offsets will also be required. Furthermore, the existing issues with the current accounting system were discussed, and pertinent suggestions were proposed.}

abstract = {Background
Sleep is essential for maintaining human health, and insomnia is a widespread problem. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for centuries to treat sleep disorders, with fewer reported side effects compared to conventional treatments.
Objective
This study seeks to investigate the sleep-promoting effects of the GSZ formula, which comprises γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus (Wuweizi in Chinese), and Ziziphi Spinosae Semen (Suanzaoren in Chinese). In addition, this study aims to explore the active ingredients and potential mechanisms underlying the sleep-enhancing effects of the formula.
Methods
The impact of GSZ on sleep was evaluated using two models, the complete sleep model and the subthreshold sleep model. Mice were randomly divided into five groups and orally administered GSZ solution (0.33 g/kg/day or 0.99 g/kg/day), positive drug diazepam (2.50 mg/kg) or a control solution for 30 days. Hypnosis model was established in mice using pentobarbital sodium. Sleep duration and incidence were measured by recording when the righting reflex of mice disappeared for more than 1 min. GABA and dopamine (DA) levels in mouse brain tissue were measured using ELISA kits. The ingredients of the GSZ formula were identified using mass spectrometry, and the targets of these ingredients and disease-related genes were retrieved from public databases. A network medicine approach was used to calculate the shortest path between ingredient targets and disease-related proteins. The expression levels of potential proteins, such as Akt, p-Akt, GSK-3β, and p-GSK-3β, were analyzed using Western blotting based on the predicted results.
Results
GSZ significantly prolonged sleep duration and enhanced the sleep rate in mice (P < 0.05). Furthermore, it elevated GABA levels and reduced DA levels in the mouse brain (P < 0.05). Network medicine analysis suggested that GABA, stearic acid, genistin, and coumestrol may be the most crucial active ingredients for sleep improvement. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that GSZ modulated the protein expression levels of p-Akt/Akt and p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Our study demonstrated that the GSZ formula could improve sleep, with key ingredients likely being GABA, stearic acid, genistin, and coumestrol. The mechanism might involve the regulation of the Akt/GSK-3β pathway, as revealed by the network medicine analysis and experimental validation. Our current new findings shed light on the potential mechanisms underlying the sleep-enhancing effects of the GSZ formula, which could provide experimental evidence to develop innovative treatments for insomnia.}

Single-photon scintigraphy is routinely used to assess conditions such as pulmonary embolism, cardiac ischemia, and thyroiditis, and COVID-19 may present in these studies. The most common nuclear imaging finding of COVID-19 vaccination to date is hypermetabolic axillary lymphadenopathy.

The proposed method blends expert opinion and experience using fuzzy linguistic variables and a triangle membership function. A numerical example demonstrates the practical application of the proposed model. This study considers a model for fuzzy inventory pharmaceutical products with a two-tier supply chain. This supply chain model aids healthcare decision-makers in acquiring medications that meet the necessary time, quality, and cost standards.}

Mutational evolution has been assessed in primary and metastatic breast cancer samples. Overall, based on these findings the current concept of precision medicine is questioned and challenged by alternative therapeutic strategies. In the last two decades, immunotherapy as a powerful and harmless tool to fight cancer has received huge attention. Thus, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) composition, its prognostic role for clinical course as well as a novel definition of immunogenicity in breast cancer are proposed. Investigational clinical trials carried out by us and other findings suggest that G0-G1 state induced in endocrine-dependent metastatic breast cancer is more suitable for successful immune manipulation. Residual micro-metastatic disease seems to be another specific condition that can significantly favor the immune response in breast and other solid tumors.}

Chinese medicine (CM) treatment for menopause is based on syndrome differentiation with few side effects. At present, there is no systematic and acceptable guideline to support clinical decisions on menopause management. Therefore, we aim to develop a guideline to assist clinical decisions on menopause management using CM approaches. Methods: This guideline referred to the WHO handbook for guideline development and followed six main steps. The recommendation followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system, which contained four levels of evidence quality and four categories of recommendation. All the recommendations were based on the evidence from current research and experienced experts’ opinions. Results: Seven types of menopausal syndrome and their main symptoms were identified. A total of thirteen prescriptions were suggested with various grade of recommendation. Acupuncture for menopause was also recommended, the most common acupoints were San-yin-jiao (SP 6), Tai-xi (KI 3), Tai-chong (LV 3), and Zu-san-li (ST 36). Conclusion: This is the first CM guideline for menopause management in Hong Kong, which provides essential suggestions and support for clinical practice. However, further assessment of the guideline implementation is needed.}

abstract = {About a quarter of the world's population suffers from insomnia, and the number of the insomniacs is gradually increasing. However, the current drug therapy and non-drug therapy sleep-aid methods have certain limitations. In general, the sleep-aid effect of drug therapy is better than that of Non-drug therapy, but western medicine may lead to some side effects and drug abuse. Although the side effects of Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) are relatively small, making the herbal decoction is complex and time-consuming. Therefore, exploring a novel sleep-aid method is very significant. In this paper, a flexible and dissolving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) microneedle patch is proposed for sleep-aid intervention. The TCM microneedle patch is a micrometer-scale intrusive object, and the herbal extracts are carried by the patch. The materials, design method, and fabrication process of the microneedle patch have been described in detail. Besides, the mechanical characteristics of the microneedle patch, sleep-aid effect evaluation method, and experimental scheme have been presented. Three microneedle tips with radii of 5 μm, 15 μm, and 22 μm are selected for simulation analysis. Abaqus simulation results indicate that the smaller the radius of the microneedle tip, the smaller the piercing force. Considering that the microneedle should easily penetrate the skin without buckling, that is, the piercing force should be larger than the buckling force, thus 15 μm, instead of 5 μm or 22 μm, is more suitable to be adopted as the radius of the microneedle tip. For the microneedle with the radius of 15 μm, the piercing force is 0.033 N, and the difference between the piercing force and buckling force is 0.036 N. Experimental results demonstrate that the fracture force of the microneedle is about 0.29 N, which is far larger than the piercing force and buckling force. The single-lead EEG signals of the frontal lobe are used to evaluate the sleep-aid effect of the TCM microneedle patch. After sleep-aid intervention on the Anmian and Yintang acupoints using the patches, for most subjects, the ratios of the low-frequency brain wave energies to the high-frequency brain wave energies are increased obviously, indicating that the proposed sleep-aid method is effective.}

Machine learning models are increasingly adopted for facilitating clinical decision-making. However, recent research has shown that machine learning techniques may result in potential biases when making decisions for people in different subgroups, which can lead to detrimental effects on the health and well-being of specific demographic groups such as vulnerable ethnic minorities. This problem, termed algorithmic bias, has been extensively studied in theoretical machine learning recently. However, the impact of algorithmic bias on medicine and methods to mitigate this bias remain topics of active discussion. This paper presents a comprehensive review of algorithmic fairness in the context of computational medicine, which aims at improving medicine with computational approaches. Specifically, we overview the different types of algorithmic bias, fairness quantification metrics, and bias mitigation methods, and summarize popular software libraries and tools for bias evaluation and mitigation, with the goal of providing reference and insights to researchers and practitioners in computational medicine.}

They induce host plants to improve their resistance to environmental stresses by accumulating secondary metabolites. Microorganisms can interact with their host plants to produce long-term, targeted selection results and improve their ability to adapt to the environment. Due to the interdependence and interaction between microorganisms and medicinal plants, Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) quality is closely related to the associated microorganisms. This review summarizes the relationship between medicinal plants and their associated microorganisms, including their species, distribution, life activities, and metabolites. Microorganisms can aid in quality control, improve the efficacy of medicinal plants, and provide markers for identifying the origin and storage time of CHMs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between microorganisms and medicinal plants will help to control the quality of CHMs from different perspectives.}

Inhibition or inactivation of gmβ-GUS enzymes has become a promising therapeutic strategy to alleviate drug-induced intestinal toxicity. Herein, the Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE) was found with potent and broad-spectrum inhibition on multiple gmβ-GUS enzymes. Subsequently, the anti-gmβ-GUS activities of the major constituents in RCE were tested and the results showed that 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose (PGG) acted as a strong and broad-spectrum inhibitor on multiple gmβ-GUS (including EcGUS, CpGUS, SaGUS, and EeGUS). Inhibition kinetic assays demonstrated that PGG effectively inhibited four gmβ-GUS in a non-competitive manner, with the Ki values ranging from 0.12 μM to 1.29 μM. Docking simulations showed that PGG could tightly bound to the non-catalytic sites of various gmβ-GUS, mainly via hydrogen bonding and aromatic interactions. It was also found that PGG could strongly inhibit the total gmβ-GUS activity in mice feces, with the IC50 value of 1.24 μM. Collectively, our findings revealed that RCE and its constituent PGG could strongly inhibit multiple gmβ-GUS enzymes, suggesting that RCE and PGG could be used for alleviating gmβ-GUS associated enterotoxicity.}

Besides, it is time-consuming to conduct a risk assessment of trace elements in TCMs with a non-automatic approach due to the wide variety of TCMs. Here, we present MRTCM, a cloud-computing infrastructure for automating the probabilistic risk assessment of metals and metalloids in TCM. MRTCM includes a consumption database and a pollutant database involving forty million rows of consumption data and fourteen types of TCM potentially toxic elements concentrations. The algorithm of probabilistic risk assessment was also packaged in MRTCM to assess the risks of eight elements with Monte Carlo simulation. The results demonstrated that 96.64% and 99.46% had no non-carcinogenic risk (hazard indices (HI) were < 1.0) for animal and herbal medicines consumers, respectively. After twenty years of exposure, less than 1% of the total carcinogenic risk (CRt) was > 10-4 for TCM consumers, indicating that they are at potential risk for carcinogenicity. Sensitivity analysis revealed that annual consumption and concentration were the main variables affecting the assessment results. Ultimately, a priority management list of TCMs was also generated, indicating that more attention should be paid to the non-carcinogenic risks of As, Mn, and Hg and the carcinogenic risks of As and Cr in Pheretima and Cr in Arcae Conch. In general, MRTCM could significantly enhance the efficiency of risk assessment in TCM and provide reasonable guidance for policymakers to optimize risk management.}

With recent advances in point-of-care testing, wearable electronics, and implantable medical devices, there is a growing interest in developing state-of-the-art methods to monitor human health conveniently and dynamically. Among these methods, electrochemical biosensors have offered a unique opportunity to transform lab-in-hospital to lab-around-body and lab-on-body. In an electrochemical biosensing system, appropriate bioreceptors that could specifically recognize and capture target molecules pose a significant impact on the performance of the biosensors. Thus, this review systematically explores different types of bioreceptors and their immobilization methods utilized in electrochemical biosensors for the detection of a wide range of biomarkers in clinical applications. Moreover, it delves into different principles behind the operation of electrochemical biosensors and provides insights into the challenges and limitations associated with the use of different bioreceptors in practical settings. Furthermore, this review proposes possible strategies to overcome existing challenges in order to stimulate further research and clinical implementation of biosensing methods on a larger scale.}

abstract = {Background Aggressive hematological malignancies have a dismal prognosis in the relapsed/refractory setting representing an unmet medical need. Despite the advance of numerous novel therapeutics to clinical routine, treatment selection at advanced disease stages typically is challenging because of chemoresistance, cumulative toxicity, patient-specific factors, and a lack of evidence-based protocols in heavily pretreated patients. Precision medicine approaches promise to extend the number of candidate drugs beyond the standard of care, ultimately providing a treatment rationale in situations where evidence-based treatment options are scarce. We have previously shown that single-cell functional precision medicine (scFPM) is clinically feasible and efficacious in patients with aggressive hematological cancers who exceeded all standard therapy lines (Snijder et al. Lancet Haematology 2017, Kornauth et al, Cancer Discovery 2022). Inspired by this proof of concept, we launched a multicentric, prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess if genetic, or functional precision medicine-guided therapy may improve patient outcomes compared to best clinical experience-guided therapy (NCT04470947). Methods EXALT-2 is a multicentric, prospective, randomized controlled trial in five academic hospitals in Austria (Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, Linz, and Salzburg). The study aims to enroll 150 patients with aggressive hematological malignancies in a relapsed/refractory setting with an overall good performance status (ECOG ≤ 1). After inclusion, a real-time tumor-containing biopsy is obtained to confirm relapse and collect viable tumor samples from each patient. Tumor cells are subjected to single-cell functional precision medicine (scFPM) and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assays. Importantly, scFPM testing comprises flow cytometry- and/or imaging-based high-throughput drug screening. Depending on the randomization arm, therapy is suggested by the multicentric, multidisciplinary EXALT-2 tumor board, which consists of at least 2 hematology specialists, a pathologist, a molecular biologist, and a pharmacist. The EXALT-2 board gives a treatment recommendation either based on i) scFPM or ii) CGP results, or iii) without any precision medicine support (Physicians' Choice, PC). If precision medicine assays fail or do not yield a treatment recommendation, a cross-over between study arms is allowed. An overview of the study design is shown in Figure 1A. Results Feasibility results are available for the first 55 included patients. Of these, 54 patients (98%) underwent real-time biopsy and were randomized with an equal distribution across study arms. 42 patients (76%) received a therapy suggestion from the EXALT-2 tumor board. The majority of these patients suffered from aggressive lymphoma . Finally, 39 patients (71% of the total, 92% of patients with a board recommendation) received treatment. 10 patients were classified as early drop-outs due to death or progression within the first 28 days of board-recommended therapy according to the study protocol. 29 patients (53% of total, 69% of patients with a board recommendation) continued on study and are available for further evaluation. Precision medicine assays were technically feasible in most instances (flow cytometry-based scFPM: 80% of tests; microscopy-based scFPM: 52% of tests; CGP: 86% of tests) and identified actionable hits in 100%, 100%, and 78%, respectively. The median time to report was shorter for scFPM than CGP testing (7 vs. 19 days, p<0.0001; Figure 1B). CGP identified a median of 1 (0-5) druggable genetic targets. In 60% of the patients (12 out of 20) with complete work-up, we observed a substantial overlap between genetic and functional (within the top 10 drug hits) results. Conclusions Our results provide further evidence that either genetic-based or functional precision medicine can be efficiently and safely implemented in clinical routine. scFPM and CGP aid to identify a rationale for innovative treatment options in a heavily pretreated cohort. Treatment recommendations can be translated to clinical application in the majority of these patients.}

Cardiovascular medicine is particularly well poised to take advantage of these ML advances, due to the widespread digitization of medical data and the large number of diagnostic tests used to evaluate cardiovascular disease. Various ML approaches have successfully been applied to cardiovascular tests and diseases to automate interpretation, accurately perform measurements, and, in some cases, predict novel diagnoses from less invasive tests, effectively expanding the utility of more widely accessible diagnostic tests.

We also reviewed the metastasis-preventive effects of TCM, which act by targeting the physicochemical materials and functional mediators of TDE biogenesis, regulating the cargo sorting machinery and secretory molecules in TDEs, and targeting the TDE-recipient cells involved in PMN formation.}

abstract = {Coronary heart disease (CHD) has severely impacted the lives and health of patients for ages. Although the modern methods used for the prevention and treatment of CHD have been increasingly perfected, clinical problems remain that require solutions. In the prevention and treatment of CHD with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), great therapeutic advantages have been demonstrated. However, the expression of its advantages relies on scientific evidence-based research and evaluation, which require further optimization and improvement. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively emphasize our understanding of the current deficiencies in TCM evidence-based studies and the necessity of adopting scientific evidence-based optimization methods for use in research. In this process, evidence should be produced in a standard manner, and the advantages of TCM patterns should be accurately stated because these factors contribute to efficient transformation and proper verification of the obtained evidence. Additionally, focusing on patient-oriented medicine and doctor–patient relationships is also essential. These methods are of great significance to prove the clinical efficacy of TCM and promote its development.}

abstract = {Background
This joint expert review by the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) and National Lipid Association (NLA) provides clinicians an overview of the pathophysiologic and clinical considerations regarding obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
Methods
This joint expert review is based upon scientific evidence, clinical perspectives of the authors, and peer review by the OMA and NLA leadership.
Results
Among individuals with obesity, adipose tissue may store over 50% of the total body free cholesterol. Triglycerides may represent up to 99% of lipid species in adipose tissue. The potential for adipose tissue expansion accounts for the greatest weight variance among most individuals, with percent body fat ranging from less than 5% to over 60%. While population studies suggest a modest increase in blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with excess adiposity, the adiposopathic dyslipidemia pattern most often described with an increase in adiposity includes elevated triglycerides, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), increased non-HDL-C, elevated apolipoprotein B, increased LDL particle concentration, and increased small, dense LDL particles.
Conclusions
Obesity increases CVD risk, at least partially due to promotion of an adiposopathic, atherogenic lipid profile. Obesity also worsens other cardiometabolic risk factors. Among patients with obesity, interventions that reduce body weight and improve CVD outcomes are generally associated with improved lipid levels. Given the modest improvement in blood LDL-C with weight reduction in patients with overweight or obesity, early interventions to treat both excess adiposity and elevated atherogenic cholesterol (LDL-C and/or non-HDL-C) levels represent priorities in reducing the risk of CVD.}

We applaud this editorial innovation and believe that it is an important step in advancing the ability to provide healing to human beings.This article aims to illustrate suggestions for scientific research and integrative care derived from studying the ancient Chinese medicine and philosophy using pathophysiological and clinical examples. It shows how some fundamental categories of ancient Chinese philosophies, such as the yin–yang theory, and healing models, such as yang sheng (nurturing life), can help us understand how the immune system works and where the foundations of health are rooted. It also examines some examples of the yin–yang dialectic in immunology, such as T helper 1 (Th1) circuit control by the same cells that initially produce cytokines (IL-12 and IFN-γ) to activate this circuit and then produce Th2 circuit cytokines (IL-4) to moderate it. In addition, the transformation of regulatory T-cells into inflammatory T-cells (Th17) and the IL-6 dual pro- or anti-inflammatory face, depends on the context. In the first example, yin is present in yang. In the second, the yang is in the yin. Finally, we present an example of the cytokine yin–yang. This article also shows the surprising concordances of ancient Chinese chronobiology with the modern science of circadian rhythms and the unknown connections between organs, such as between the lungs and gut, which has drawn the attention of modern scientific research only recently. Finally, this article highlights the peculiar approach of ancient Chinese medicine to prevention and treatment, called yang sheng, which shows strong concordance with the model proposed by Psychoneuroendocrineimmunology.}

Despite the wisdom of using medicinal flora as antidiabetic therapies by practitioners of Ayurveda and traditional medicine, the process of documenting this knowledge is untapped to date. The objective of the present survey was to record the knowledge and the utility of the medicinal plants used as antidiabetic remedies that have been used in clinical practice by Ayurveda and traditional medicine practitioners in Galle, Sri Lanka.
Methods
Ethnobotanical data were collected from 132 registered Ayurveda and traditional medicine practitioners in Galle, Sri Lanka, through an open-ended semi-structured questionnaire.
Results
A total number of 28 medicinal plant species belonging to 20 families were reported. The leaves were the most cited part of the plant and decoction was the most popular method of preparation of antidiabetic remedies. The most cited medicinal plant was Salacia reticulate (relative frequency citation; RFC = 0.55) followed by Coccinia grandis (RFC = 0.48) and Syzygium cumini (RFC = 0.43). The most important family of utilization in therapies was Celastraceae (family importance value; FIV = 54.55%) followed by Cucurbitaceae (FIV = 53.79%). Aerva javanica had the highest use value (UV = 1.67) and the relative popularity level (RPL=0.75) in antidiabetic remedies. Sida alnifolia had the highest rank order priority of 30.00.
Conclusions
This is the first survey revealing the significance of medicinal plants in antidiabetic remedies, used by Ayurveda and traditional medicine practitioners in Galle, Sri Lanka. The findings of the survey could promote the preservation of knowledge on the utilization of antidiabetic medicinal plants and the development of potential antidiabetic drug leads.}

DNA barcoding as an effective species identification tool is limited by its low sample throughput nature. In this study, combining DNA mini-barcode, DNA metabarcoding and species delimitation method, a novel biological sources consistency evaluation strategy was proposed, and high level of interspecific and intraspecific variations were observed and validated among 5376 Amynthas samples from 19 sampling points regarded as “Guang Dilong” and 25 batches of proprietary Chinese medicines. Besides Amynthas aspergillum as the authentic source, 8 other Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) were elucidated. Significantly, even the subgroups within A. aspergillum revealed here differ significantly on chemical compositions and biological activity. Fortunately, this biodiversity could be controlled when the collection was limited to designated areas, as proved by 2796 “decoction pieces” samples. This batch biological identification method should be introduced as a novel concept regarding natural medicine quality control, and to offer guidelines for in-situ conservation and breeding bases construction of wild natural medicine.}

Symptoms like apathy and fatigue may be mistaken for EDS. In addition, EDS has multi-factorial origin, which makes its evaluation complex. The marketing authorization [Autorisation de Mise sur le Marché (AMM)] for two wake-promoting agents (solriamfetol and pitolisant) raises several practical issues for clinicians. This consensus paper presents recommendations of good clinical practice to identify and evaluate EDS in this context, and to manage and follow-up the patients. It was conducted under the mandate of the French Societies for sleep medicine and for pneumology [Société Française de Recherche et de Médecine du Sommeil (SFRMS) and Société de Pneumologie de Langue Française (SPLF)]. A management algorithm is suggested, as well as a list of conditions during which the patient should be referred to a sleep center or a sleep specialist. The benefit/risk balance of a wake-promoting drug in residual EDS in OSAHS patients must be regularly reevaluated, especially in elderly patients with increased cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders risks. This consensus is based on the scientific knowledge at the time of the publication and may be revised according to their evolution.}
