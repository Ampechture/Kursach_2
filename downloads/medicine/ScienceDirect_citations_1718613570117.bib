abstract = {TCM herbal remedies are popular among European patients. However, a very limited number of TCM products have been approved as herbal medicinal products (HMPs) in Europe. Multi-herbal TCM products, the most prevalent form of medication in TCM practice, are even rare. This indicates multi-herbal TCM products are facing considerable obstacles in the access to EU market. To further identify such obstacles, we make a systematic analysis of current advances in both EU herbal monographs and combination HMPs granted in member states and present main features of the regulation as well as challenges for multi-herbal TCM products. The results show the EU is open to combination HMPs based on TCM or other non-European traditions. The regulation allows appropriate flexibility in the range of drug extraction rations, variation in concentrations of extraction solvent and number of herbal drugs presented in the product, if plausible pharmacological effects could be justified. Meanwhile, to guarantee the safety and efficacy based on medicinal usage, especially to justify the rationale or plausibility of the combination, is the key element for well-established use or traditional use combination HMPs. Additionally, EU herbal monographs also have great value in their marketing procedure. Nonetheless, there are many challenges in the European market access of multi-herbal TCM products which lies in quality control, safety and efficacy evaluation and others e.g., practical standard for full marketing authorization. Enforced scientific research and communication among research institutions, industries and authorities are necessary to further facilitate the access of multi-herbal TCM products to EU market. The results of this article may provide guidance for HMPs based on TCM or other non-European traditions with intention to entering EU market.}

Purpose
Nutrition is an important lifestyle modification used in the treatment of obesity. The purpose of this review is to highlight different dietary interventions used to promote weight loss in both adults and children.
Methods
A search using PubMed was performed for articles on topics related to nutrition and management and/or treatment of obesity in adults adolescents and children. The literature was reviewed and pertinent sources were used for this narrative review.
Discussion
There are many effective nutrition interventions used to treat obesity, including altering macronutrient composition, implementing different dietary patterns, and changing meal timing. Although these interventions can induce weight loss in adults, management of obesity in children is more difficult given their varied nutrition needs in growth and development. The use of food as medicine in obesity treatment is individualized based on patient's age, food preference, and concurrent medical conditions.
Implications
Given the multifactorial etiology of obesity, treatment requires multidisciplinary care beyond nutrition intervention.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacology relevant
“Four Natures and five “Flavors” comes from the high generalization of medicine pharmacological rules from clinical practice by ancients. “Flavor” and “Natures”are both descriptions of the effect properties of traditional Chinese medicine. At present, researchers have realized that the “Flavors” (Pungent, Sour, Sweet, Bitter and Salty) are related to the different pharmacological effects of treatment. The “Natures” (Warm, Hot, Cold and Cool) are closely related to energy and substance metabolism and contribute to the effect of the “Flavors”. Since “Four Natures and five Flavors” are the rules derived from clinical practice, how to describe and characterize “Natures” and “Flavors” scientifically is still a problem that needs to be solved.
Aim of the study
the aim is to objectively further understand the scientific connotations of properties (“Flavors”and “Natures”) from the perspective of metabolomics and characterize them by metabolites.
Materials and method
“Pungent-Neutral”, “Sweet-Neutral and “Bitter-Neutral” TCMs were selected to characterize the “Flavors” (Pungent, Sweet and Bitter). “Pungent-Warm” and “Bitter-Cold” were selected to characterize the “Natures” (Warm and Cold). The rat serum metabolomics was performed on UHPLC-Q-Exactive. Metabolites were identified through the metabolites databases and related literature.
Results
The “Flavors” and “Natures” metabolites were identified, respectively, including four “Pungent”, four “Sweet” and thirteen “Bitter” characterized metabolites and thirteen “Cold” and sixteen “Warm”related metabolites.
Conclusions
The “Natures” characterized metabolites show the “Natures” are closely related to lipid and energy metabolism. The “Warm” may promote lipid metabolism to produce ATP to generate energy through bile acid metabolism and purine metabolism. The “Cold” may inhibit lipid metabolism to generate ATP to decrease energy through the way of tryptophan metabolism and purine metabolism. The “Flavors” characteristic metabolites can provide a theoretical basis for the rules of the “Flavors”. These metabolites can also be used to characterize TCM's “Natures” and “Flavors” in the development of traditional Chinese medicine resources and quality control.}

Cholinesterase is the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Cholinesterase inhibitors are synthetic drugs that provide symptomatic relief to Alzheimer’s patients. Synthetic cholinesterase inhibitors are associated with several side effects. The current study is based on finding a suitable lead from natural products, specifically plants used in Unani medicine for various ailments.
Methods
Three plants used in Unani medicine were selected and investigated for cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase [AChE] and butyrylcholinesterase [BuChE]) inhibition, that is, Cyperus rotundus L., Delphinium denudatum Wall. ex Hook.f. & Thomson, Paeonia officinalis L.
Results
An aqueous extract of C rotundus inhibits BuChE and AChE by 45 ± 1.54% and 15.99 ± 2.5%, respectively. An ethanolic extract exhibits 82.5 ± 2% and 65.55 ± 1.74% inhibition for BuChE and AChE, respectively. The ethanolic extract showed a mixed mode of inhibition. An aqueous extract of P officinalis showed 44.94 ± 1.29% and 29.52 ± 1.96% inhibition for BuChE and AChE, respectively. An ethanolic extract exhibits 59 ± 0.73% and 38 ± 0.005% for BuChE and AChE, respectively, with an uncompetitive inhibition mode. An aqueous and ethanolic extract of D denudatum showed 39.73 ± 1.58% and 52 ± 1.02% inhibition of BuChE, respectively, and 29.52 ± 0.75% and 43 ± 1.31% for AChE. Significant free radical scavenging activity was observed in C rotundus and P officinalis using 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay. Ethanolic extracts were more active and were subject to secondary metabolite analysis using UPLC-QTOF to identify abundant phytoconstituents responsible for the inhibitory activity. Individual interaction of identified phytoconstituents with target proteins was demonstrated using molecular docking analysis using Autodock 4.2. ADMET studies showed the predicted pharmacokinetic profile of the compounds.}

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a main global epidemic increasing as population age and affecting approximately 10% of subjects over 45 years. COPD is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease with several endo-phenotypes and clinical presentations. Although neutrophilic inflammation is canonically considered a hallmark of COPD, eosinophilic inflammation can also be present in a subgroup of patients. Several other immune cells and cytokines play a key role in orchestrating and perpetuating the inflammatory pathways in COPD, making them attractive targets for treating this disorder. Recent studies have started to evaluate the possible role of type 2 (T2) inflammation and epithelial-derived alarmins (TSLP and IL-33) in COPD. Two phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed a modest reduction in exacerbations in COPD patients with eosinophilic phenotype treated with mepolizumab (anti-IL-5) or benralizumab (anti-IL-5Rα). A phase III RCT showed a 30% reduction in exacerbations in COPD patients with ≥ 300 eosinophils/μL treated with dupilumab (anti-IL-4Rα). These results suggest that blocking a single cytokine (e.g., IL-5) or its main target (i.e., IL-5Rα) is less promising than blocking a wider spectrum of cytokines (i.e., IL-4 and IL-13) in COPD. TSLP and IL-33 are upstream regulators of T2-high and T2-low immune responses in airway inflammation. Several ongoing RCTs are evaluating the efficacy and safety of anti-TSLP (tezepelumab), anti-IL-33 (itepekimab, tozorakimab), and anti-ST2 (astegolimab) in patients with COPD, who experience exacerbations. In conclusion, targeting T2 inflammation or epithelial-derived alarmins might represent a step forward in precision medicine for the treatment of a subset of COPD.}

Herein, we developed a new strategy based on aggregation-induced emission (AIE) for monitoring thrombin activity and screening thrombin inhibitors from XBJ. The molecule AIE603 and the thrombin substrate peptide S-2238 were formed into AIE nanoparticle (AIENP) which emitted notable fluorescence due to the restriction of intramolecular motions. In the presence of thrombin, AIENP was specifically hydrolyzed and AIE603 was released from AIENP, leading to the decrease of fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, AIENP was combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-fraction collector (UHPLC-FC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) for separation, preparation, screening and identification of the thrombin inhibitors from XBJ, a total of 58 chemical constituents were identified, among which 6 compounds possessed higher anticoagulant activity. Notably, the overall inhibition rate of the 6 mixed standards was equivalent to about 60% of the inhibition rate of XBJ. Therefore, this work provides a novel, cheap and simple method for monitoring thrombin activity and is promising to screen active substances from traditional Chinese medicines.}

Herbal medicines (HMDs) are widely used in some countries. However, a consumer's health may be threatened when pollutants are present in HMDs and a high quantity of these medications is consumed. This work was conducted to evaluate the accumulation of toxic elements and the potential human health risks associated with high consumption of HMDs in Zahedan, Iran. In this study, 15 brands of popular HMDs were selected from five pharmacies. In each pharmacy, three HMD samples were randomly chosen, for a total of 225 samples, and evaluated for 11 elements. Inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry was used to analyze cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and aluminum (Al) in each sample. Total arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg) were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. The human health risk of each element from ingestion of each HMD was estimated. The mean concentrations of these elements in different types of HMDs were highly variable and significantly different within the same type of HMD (P < 0.001). All samples contained detectable concentrations of target elements. However, the mean concentrations of each element in all HMDs were significantly lower than the legal limit published by the World Health Organization. The outcomes of this work indicated that for both children and adults, the target hazard quotient (THQ) for each metal and the hazard index (HI) for all metals in all types of HMDs were significantly lower than the acceptable limit (THQ and HI = 1). The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for each carcinogenic metal and the total carcinogenic risk (TCR) for all carcinogenic metals also were lower than the acceptable limit (ILCR and TCR = 10−4).
HIGHLIGHTS
HMDs are becoming more popular in some countries.Contaminants such as toxic elements in HMDs can threaten consumer health.THQ values for each metal were lower than the acceptable limit in all HMDs.HI values for all metals were lower than the acceptable limit in all HMDs.ILCR for each metal and TCR for all metals were below acceptable limits.}

Guipi Tang (GPT) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine that is used to treat major depressive disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms of its effects remain unclear.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant-like effects of GPT and explore its underlying molecular mechanisms.
Materials and methods
Male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) procedure and treated with various doses of GPT, with fluoxetine treatment as a positive control. Behavioural tests (including sucrose preference test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, open-field test and forced swim test), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were conducted. The levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, BDNF, TrkB and CREB or p-CREB were assessed at the protein level using western blotting or immunofluorescence.
Results
GPT consists of mainly known drugs, such as liquiritin and ginsenosides. It reversed depressive behaviours and decreased cell apoptosis in the hippocampi of CUMS rats. It significantly upregulated the protein level of Bax, p-Akt, p-PI3K, BDNF, TrkB and p-CREB and downregulated the level of cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2.
Conclusions
GPT had anti-depressive activity as indicated by the amelioration of depression-like behaviour and the inhibition of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in CUMS rats. This inhibition was mediated partly by modulating the PI3K/Akt and/or BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway, in which, glycosides, the main components of GPT, might be involved.}

Structural characterization using XRD, SEM, and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the binding of DNA to GO nanosheets and the interaction of Ab with the DNA/GO array. Electrochemical characterization of Ab/DNA/GO/GCE using CV and DPV indicated immobilization of antibodies on DNA/GO/GCE and sensitive and selective behavior of modified electrodes for determination of BVZ. The linear range was obtained 10–1100 μg/mL, and the sensitivity and detection limit values were determined to be 0.14575 μA/μg.mL−1 and 0.02 μg/mL, respectively. To verify the applicability of the planned sensor for determination of BVZ in human serum and wastewater fluid specimens, the outcomes of DPV measurements using Ab, DNA, GO, and GCE and the results of the Bevacizumab ELISA Kit for determination of BVZ in prepared real specimens showed good conformity between the outcomes of both analyses. Moreover, the proposed sensor showed considerable assay precision with recoveries ranging from 96.00% to 98.90% and acceptable relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 5.11%, illustrating sufficiently good sensor accuracy and validity in the determination of BVZ in prepared real specimens of human serum and wastewater fluids.

Inpatient Addiction Consultation Services (ACS) fill an important need by connecting hospitalized patients with substance use disorders with resources for treatment; however, providers of these services may be at risk for burnout. In this qualitative study, we aimed to identify factors associated with burnout and, conversely, resilience among multidisciplinary providers working on ACS.
Methods
We completed 26 semi-structured interviews with clinicians working on ACS, including physicians, social workers, and advanced practice providers. Twelve institutions across the country were represented. The study recruited participants via email solicitation to ACS directors and then via snowball sampling. We used an inductive, grounded theory approach to analyze data.

Providers described factors contributing to burnout and strategies for promoting resilience, and three main themes arose: (1) Systemic barriers contributed to provider burnout, (2) Engaging in meaningful work increased resilience, and (3) Team dynamics influenced perceptions of burnout and resilience.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that hospital-based addiction medicine work is intrinsically rewarding for many providers and that engaging with other addiction providers to debrief challenging encounters or engage in advocacy work can be protective against burnout. However, administrative and systemic factors are frequent sources of frustration for providers of ACS. Structured debriefings may help to mitigate burnout. Furthermore, training to enhance providers' ability to engage effectively in advocacy work within and between hospital systems has the potential to promote resilience and protect against burnout among ACS providers.}

abstract = {Background
Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) showed to be beneficial for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
Purpose
This study aimed to systematically assemble the evidence on the efficacy and safety of QFPDD combined with Western medicine treatments (WMT) for COVID-19.
Study design
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, CSTJ, CBM, Wanfang Data for clinical trials with a control arm until January 13, 2022. Studies matched the selection criteria were included. Data extraction and quality assessment of the included studies were independently conducted by two reviewers. Review Manager 5.4 was used for meta-analysis.
Results
A total of 9 trials including 1108 COVID-19 patients met the selection criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated that QFPDD combined with WMT reduced aggravation rate (AR) by 71% [risk ratio (RR) = 0.29, 95% confidence intervals (CI) (0.17, 0.51)], increased effective rate (ER) by 13% [RR = 1.13, 95%CI (1.04, 1.22)], shortened 4.78 days of viral shedding [95%CI (-5.79, -3.77)] and 4.45 days of hospital stay [95%CI (-6.05, -2.86)], also decreased the incidence of adverse events (AE) by 56% [RR = 0.44, 95%CI (0.22, 0.89)].
Conclusion
QFPDD combined with WMT might reduce the proportion of severe cases and the incidence of AE, shorten the duration of viral shedding and length of hospital stay. More randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to confirm our findings in the future.}

The improper activation and degranulation of mast cells is the triggering event, which results in the production of various mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, PAF, chemokines, and cytokines. Antihistamines are currently the most common pharmacological treatment for urticaria, but corticosteroids and monoclonal antibodies can also be employed. Patients who have been taking antihistamines for a long time are often looking for alternatives. Whole plants, portions of plants, or single extracted active compounds are all used in phytomedicine. Plant elements are frequently combined to create formulations that can be utilized to treat a variety of pathological disorders. Anti-inflammatory and/or anti-allergic properties are found in several herbs regularly used in herbal formulations. Antioxidant properties are also present in some of the constituents. Exogenous antioxidants have been shown to improve the progression of autoimmune disorders in numerous studies. The aim of this review is to identify the most common herbs used to treat chronic urticaria, and to characterize their efficacy, mechanisms of action, and risk/benefit ratio in comparison to western treatment, and also to find less often used formulations and assess their therapeutic efficacy, safety profile, and potential for wider use.Unlabelled Image}

abstract = {Background Oncologic emergencies (OEs) are life-threatening complications of malignancy that can present in multiple clinical settings and necessitate early recognition and intervention. Most medical resident training is experiential, but variability in exposure can yield gaps in medical knowledge that could result in delayed patient care. Remote curricula are commonly used to fill these gaps and reduce classroom burden on trainees. Given their time-sensitive nature, OEs are a prime target to augment clinical experience with a supplementary curriculum to prepare residents for new scenarios. This study evaluates whether an original, remote curriculum improves internal medicine resident knowledge of and confidence in recognition and management of OEs. Methods With expert faculty input, we developed a remote curriculum for first-year internal medicine residents at a tertiary care academic medical center. The curriculum includes 6 OEs: tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), hypercalcemia (hyperCa), neutropenic fever (NF), hyperviscosity syndrome and leukostasis (HVS/LS), superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and malignant spinal cord compression (CC). OEs were selected based upon prominence in the literature, morbidity and mortality, need for urgent management, and association with malignancy. We created an online lesson in Qualtrics for each OE. Each lesson was designed to be completed in 15 minutes via computer or smartphone. Lessons were delivered by email every 10 days, with reminders every 5 days. Learning objectives for each OE lesson were to 1) identify concerning signs and symptoms, 2) order appropriate workup, and 3) provide prompt management in the appropriate clinical setting. Lessons included clinical questions and evidence-based information delivery contextualized by case presentations. We evaluated the curriculum's efficacy with a randomized, controlled study. First-year residents were randomly assigned to two groups (“Intern A” and “Intern B”). We built assessments of knowledge and confidence with expert faculty input. Confidence in identifying and managing each OE was assessed by Likert scale (“1 - completely confident,” “5 - not at all confident”). Knowledge was evaluated with 3 multiple choice questions per OE, for a maximum knowledge score of 18. After both groups completed the pre-test, Intern A received the curriculum. After curriculum completion, both groups completed the post-test. All interns were required to complete the curriculum, but research participation was optional. Residents consented to participation prior to each test administration. All lessons and research activities were anonymous. Analysis was completed in GraphPad Prism 9 using the unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA with post-hoc testing, as appropriate. Results Thirty-nine internal medicine residents completed the curriculum. Twenty were assigned to Intern A and 19 to Intern B. Intern A had 10 pre-test respondents (50.0%) with a mean knowledge score of 9.13 (50.7% correct), and Intern B had 13 pre-test respondents (68.4%) with a mean knowledge score of 9.35 (51.9% correct). There were no differences by OE-specific score. Baseline confidence was similar between groups (Table 1). Comparison of mean knowledge scores is shown in Figure 1. Intern A and B had 9 (45.0%) and 10 (52.6%) post-test respondents, respectively. Both Intern A (mean 14.2; 95% CI, 12.8 to 15.7; 78.9% correct) and Intern B (mean 12.2; 95% CI, 10.5 to 13.9; 67.8% correct) significantly improved their knowledge scores compared to prior, though Intern A had a more marked effect size (Intern A mean difference 5.02; 95% CI, 2.84 to 7.21; P<0.0001; Intern B mean difference 2.66; 95% CI, 0.660 to 4.66; P=0.006). Intern A confidence significantly improved from the pre-test in both the identification and management of HVS/LS and SVC syndrome. Intern A confidence was significantly better than Intern B confidence in management of SVC syndrome at the time of the post-test (Table 1). Conclusions Baseline intern OE knowledge scores were sub-optimal. Intern participation in a remote OE curriculum improved knowledge acquisition to a greater degree than experiential learning alone. Confidence in identification and management of OEs with low pre-existing confidence, such as HVS/LS and SVC syndrome, improved in the remote curriculum. Further study should evaluate knowledge retention over time, resident clinical performance, and patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Introduction
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites and is associated with significant risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition.
Objective
This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning SBP for the emergency clinician.
Discussion
SBP is commonly due to Gram-negative bacteria, but infections due to Gram-positive bacteria and multidrug resistant bacteria are increasing. The typical presentation of SBP includes abdominal pain, worsening ascites, fever, or altered mental status in a patient with known liver disease; however, some patients may be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms. Paracentesis is the diagnostic modality of choice and should be performed in any patient with ascites and concern for SBP or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or in those being admitted for a complication of cirrhosis. Ultrasound should be used to optimize the procedure. An ascites absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 250 cells/mm3 is diagnostic of SBP. Ascitic fluid should be placed in blood culture bottles to improve the culture yield. Leukocyte esterase reagent strips can be used for rapid diagnosis if available. While many patients will demonstrate coagulation panel abnormalities, routine transfusion is not recommended. Management traditionally includes a third-generation cephalosporin, but specific patient populations may require more broad-spectrum coverage with a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Albumin infusion is associated with reduced risk of renal impairment and mortality.
Conclusions
An understanding of literature updates can improve the care of patients with suspected SBP.}

The international standard ISO 17511:2020 presents requirements for manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices (MDs) for documenting the calibration hierarchy for a measured quantity in human samples using a specified IVD MD. The objective of this article is to define an unequivocal, metrologically traceable calibration hierarchy for the INR measured in plasma as well as in whole blood samples. Calibration of PT and INR for IVD MDs according to World Health Organization guidelines is similar to that in cases where there is a reference measurement procedure that defines the measurand for value assignment as described in ISO 17511:2020. We conclude that, for PT/INR standardization, the optimal calibration hierarchy includes a primary process to prepare an international reference reagent and measurement procedure that defines the measurand by a value assignment protocol conforming to clause 5.3 of ISO 17511:2020. A panel of freshly prepared human plasma samples from healthy adult individuals and patients on vitamin K antagonists is used as a commutable secondary calibrator as described in ISO 17511:2020. A sustainable metrologically traceable calibration hierarchy for INR should be based on an international protocol for value assignment with a single primary reference thromboplastin and the harmonized manual tilt tube technique for clotting time determination. The primary international reference thromboplastin reagent should be used only for calibration of successive batches of the secondary reference thromboplastin reagent.}

abstract = {Objective:
To promote research on knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction of chest discomfort medical cases in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this paper focuses on their named entity recognition (NER). The recognition task includes six entity types: “syndrome”, “symptom”, “etiology and pathogenesis”, “treatment method”, “medication”, and “prescription”.
Methods:
We annotated data in a BIO (B-begin, I-inside, O-outside) manner. For the characteristics of medical case texts, we proposed a custom dictionary method that can be dynamically updated for word segmentation. To compare the effect of the method on the experimental results, we applied the method in the BiLSTM-CRF model and IDCNN-CRF model, respectively.
Results:
The models using custom dictionaries (BiLSTM-CRF-Loaded and IDCNN-CRF-Loaded) outperformed the models without custom dictionaries (BiLSTM-CRF and IDCNN-CRF) in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The BiLSTM-CRF-Loaded model yielded F1 scores of 92.59% and 93.23% on the test set and validation set, respectively, surpassing the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model by 3.59% and 4.87%. Furthermore, when analyzing the results for the six entity categories separately, we found that the use of custom dictionaries has a marked impact, with the categories of “etiology and pathogenesis” and “syndrome” demonstrating the most noticeable improvements. By comparing the F1 scores, we observed that the entity category “medication” yielded the highest performance, reaching F1 scores of 96.04% and 96.48% on the test set and validation set, respectively.
Conclusion:
We propose a word segmentation method based on a dynamically updated custom dictionary. The method is combined with the BILSTM-CRF and the IDCNN-CRF models, which enhances the model to recognize domain-specific terms and new entities. It can be widely applied in dealing with complex text structures and texts containing domain-specific terms.}

PANoptosis is a newly identified pro-inflammatory programmed cell death pathway controlled by the recently discovered cytoplasmic polymeric protein complex is called a PANoptosome. PANoptosome Components are linked to a variety of human diseases, including autoinflammatory diseases, cancer, etc. However, the specific effect of PANoptosis regulatory factors in regulating the prognosis and potential mechanism in lung adenocarcinoma is unclear. Here, we ultimately identified 14 differentially expressed PANoptosis related regulators by comparing unpaired and paired lung adenocarcinoma samples and summarized the genetic mutations and molecular correlations of PANoptosis regulators in LUAD. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that these PANoptosis factors were mainly involved in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, necroptosis, TNF signaling pathway, apoptosis, and IL-17 signaling pathway. PANoptosis related prognostic signature based on three genes (FADD, MAP3K7, and NLRP3) has a good performance in prognostic prediction models of LUAD patients. The validation results showed that the expression trend of the FADD gene and protein was in agreement with the previous analysis results of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, we found that the expression of FADD was involved in most immune infiltrating cell types. We also found the regulatory axis of lncRNA TUG1/ miR-128–3p /FADD in the progression of LUAD. Besides, we found that resveratrol, quercetin, capsaicin, as well as Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (Shui Fei Ji), Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (Wu Wei Zi), Mangifera indica L.

From a total of 34,922 records retrieved, 688 articles involving 122,151 persons with xerostomia were included. There were 16 unique outcome domains and 166 outcome measures extracted. None of these domains or measures were consistently used across all the studies. The severity of xerostomia and physical functioning were the 2 most frequently assessed domains.
Conclusion
There is considerable heterogeneity in outcome domains and measures reported in clinical studies of xerostomia. This highlights the need for harmonization of dry mouth assessment to enhance comparability across studies and facilitate the synthesis of robust evidence for managing patients with xerostomia.}

abstract = {Background & Aims
Pien Tze Huang (PZH) is a well-established traditional medicine with beneficial effects against inflammation and cancer. We aimed to explore the chemopreventive effect of PZH in colorectal cancer (CRC) through modulating gut microbiota.
Methods
CRC mouse models were established by azoxymethane plus dextran sulfate sodium treatment or in Apcmin/+ mice treated with or without PZH (270 mg/kg and 540 mg/kg). Gut barrier function was determined by means of intestinal permeability assays and transmission electron microscopy. Fecal microbiota and metabolites were analyzed by means of metagenomic sequencing and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated mice were used as models of microbiota depletion.
Results
PZH inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in azoxymethane plus dextran sulfate sodium–treated mice and in Apcmin/+ mice in a dose-dependent manner. PZH treatment altered the gut microbiota profile, with an increased abundance of probiotics Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans and Eubacterium limosum, while pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas veronii, Campylobacter jejuni, Collinsella aerofaciens, and Peptoniphilus harei were depleted. In addition, PZH increased beneficial metabolites taurine and hypotaurine, bile acids, and unsaturated fatty acids, and significantly restored gut barrier function. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that PZH inhibited PI3K–Akt, interleukin-17, tumor necrosis factor, and cytokine–chemokine signaling. Notably, the chemopreventive effect of PZH involved both microbiota-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Fecal microbiota transplantation from PZH-treated mice to germ-free mice partly recapitulated the chemopreventive effects of PZH. PZH components ginsenoside-F2 and ginsenoside-Re demonstrated inhibitory effects on CRC cells and primary organoids, and PZH also inhibited tumorigenesis in azoxymethane plus dextran sulfate sodium–treated germ-free mice.
Conclusions
PZH manipulated gut microbiota and metabolites toward a more favorable profile, improved gut barrier function, and suppressed oncogenic and pro-inflammatory pathways, thereby suppressing colorectal carcinogenesis.}

abstract = {Background
The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains a variety of microbial species that constitute the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota has a role in host immune health and defence against pathogenic organisms. The composition of gut microbiota is affected by several factors that impact the role of the GI tract, one of these factors influences medications, in particular antibiotics, however, recent findings revealed that non-antibiotic medications significantly impact the diversity of gut microbiota as well. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of three commonly prescribed medicines in vitro.
Methods
Amlodipine, metformin and atorlip (atorvastatin calcium) tablets, which are frequently administered for lowering blood pressure, diabetes type II and cholesterol respectively, were included in this study. To study the antibacterial activity against potential pathogens, agar-well diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was used.
Results
The outcomes indicated that metformin and atorlip showed less activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The drug of lowering cholesterol amlodipine significantly inhibited the growth of all tested bacterial strains. The zone of inhibition ranged between 12 and 30 mm. B. casei was highly susceptible and the zone of inhibition was 30 mm, conversely the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa showed resistance against amlodipine and the zone of inhibition was only 12 mm. The MIC values ranged from 0.039 to 0.612 mg/L. Conclusion: The present findings revealed that two of the used medicines (metformin and atorlip) showed no antimicrobial properties, in contrast, amlodipine reflected a potent impact against all examined microbes either probiotics or potential pathogens at very low concentrations.}

The prevalence and use of Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) varies according to sociodemographic factors and health condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of TCIM use and its association with self-perceived health status, depression and sociodemographic factors.
Methods
We used data from the Brazilian National Survey (PNS 2019), a population-based study, with complex and probabilistic sampling method. There were 94,114 participants with complete information about the use of TCIM. All participants answered a questionnaire containing sociodemographic, clinical data and information about their TCIM use during the last 12 months. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression. All variables were categorized. Logistic regression models were performed to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
The prevalence of any type of TCIM use was 5.3% (95%CI: 5.0% - 5.6%). Among TCIM users, medicinal plants and phytotherapy (57.2%), acupuncture (26.3%), and homeopathy (17.0%) were the most frequently used. In the adjusted analysis, the variables associated with higher prevalence of TCIM use were: female gender, being older than 29 years old, being White, higher socioeconomic and educational status, living in a rural area and in the Northern region of the country. Poorer self-reported health status and depression were also associated with TCIM use.
Conclusion
In Brazil, despite the expansion of TCIM in the public health system over the last few years did not reflect a higher use in the general population.}

Now, it will be possible to diagnose diseases more precisely and to treat each patient based on his/her own “individual” disease etiology. Surprisingly, the obstacles on this path are not of a technical nature but rather related to affordability, accessibility of treatment, and most importantly, ethical issues. Thus, society will not escape the need to provide solutions to this and multiple other bioethical problems that will arise as more information, related to present or future health issues which affect each and every one of us, becomes available. Excitingly, the project is trail-blazed by the scientific community worldwide, a wonderful one-of-a-kind collaboration of scientists, clinicians, bioinformaticians, and bio ethicists who are scattered all over the world, at times who do not communicate with one another, but add their knowledge to this wonderful melting pot which is being converted into a great chapter in human history.}

The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) in evidence-based clinical decision support systems is becoming increasingly popular. However, existing KG construction frameworks are not fully automated and contextualized, thus unable to adapt to new domains and incorporate constantly changing information into their knowledge base, resulting in loss of relevance over time. Furthermore, existing KGs construction frameworks don't generate KG that provide relevant information within an acceptable response time for evidence-based practitioners because the organization of constructed subgraphs is neither topic-specific nor evidence-based PICO (Participants/Problem P, Intervention-I, Comparison C, Outcome O) query-friendly. By employing concept extraction, semantic enrichment, optimized clustering, and state of art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with BioBERT based encoded representation to categorize PICO elements and predict relationships between concepts using huge corpus of publicly available literature on COVID-19 and cerebral aneurysm, this paper proposes a topic specific, PICO enabled, and fully automated framework to curate information and create KG of different clinical domains. The evaluation shows that the proposed framework achieves significant improvement over baseline models and has 93 %, and 82 % accuracy on aneurysm and COVID data set respectively for PICO classification. Also, the relationship extraction module has an accuracy of 96 % with precision and recall being 92 %, and 90 % respectively.}

abstract = { 
Aviation and Space Medicine (ASM) gained recognition as a specialty by the UK's General Medical Council in 2016 and is poised to grow in importance with growing demand in aviation and the expanding global space sector both in the UK and across the world. The predicted 41% growth of the commercial spaceflight industry within the next 5 years1 amplifies the need for ASM physicians capable of addressing unique health challenges associated with space travel. ASM extends beyond in-flight care, playing a crucial role in translating lessons learned in extreme environments to terrestrial healthcare. Recognising the influence of exposure and role models on student's specialty preferences2, a study was conducted to assess the current level of ASM education provided to UK medical students compared to their desired level and interest in the specialty. A 29-question survey, consisting of multiple-choice, Likert scale and free-text responses on these topics was distributed via Google Workspace's survey administration software to students from 37 UK medical schools, through contacting their medical societies and/or faculty administrators. To evaluate disparities in curriculum understanding at various points in the medical degree journey, analyses were subcategorised into pre-clinical (62.4%) and clinical/graduate doctor (36.7%) stages. The 170 respondents, representing 18 different UK medical schools, revealed a lack of awareness regarding ASM - only 16.4% of total respondents were aware that ASM is a GMC-approved training pathway, and 83.5% rated their knowledge of the UK ASM training pathway as 1 (no knowledge). However, 15.3% and 7.7% expressed strong consideration (rated 4 and 5, respectively) for pursuing a career in ASM. The majority (78.2%) reported zero hours of ASM teaching in their medical school curriculum, with 37.6% expressing a desire for 1–4 h and 33.5% for 5+ h, predominantly through lectures. Fig. 1 shows satisfaction rating with current level of exposure within medical school curricula, and Fig. 2 shows the number of hours of ASM teaching desired by UK medical students. Similarly, outside of the core curriculum, exposure to ASM was limited, with 65.3% receiving none. 20.6%, 10.1% and 2.5% had the options of ASM-related electives, student selected programmes or research available to them, respectively. Outside of medical school, the main exposure to ASM was through student societies (27.1%). We found that despite minimal exposure and educational opportunities, significant interest in ASM was evident among UK medical students. To address this gap, we recommend curriculum development – whilst recognising the already saturated core medical curriculum we propose introduction and expansion of optional modules to align with students’ demonstrated interest. We recognise the possibility of response bias in this survey, which could impact the overall representativeness of the findings. Despite this, greater representation in the undergraduate curriculum is essential to generate heightened awareness of ASM and its UK training pathway. This not only ensures that the option of a career in this specialty is accessible to all UK medical students, but that interested individuals are adequately prepared to embark on careers in this new, exciting era of Aviation and Space Medicine.}

The use of these devices to deliver pharmaceutical active ingredients has also been reported in the literature; however, achievement of the therapeutic dose usually required a large number of puffs. Promisingly, these devices were shown to generate aerosols within the optimal aerodynamic particle size distribution to achieve deep lung deposition. Moreover, they demonstrate the ability to be efficient drug delivery systems for patients with a poor lung function or anatomy, as they can offer a tailored aerosol medicine. This study was conducted with the aim of successfully delivering free base salbutamol via inhalation using e-liquid salbutamol formulations, aerosolized using the ENDS technology. E-liquids formulations containing salbutamol as active ingredient were prepared; impaction data were collected using a Next Generation Impactor under laminar flow conditions and aerodynamic particle size distribution evaluated using Copley's Inhaler Testing Data Analysis Software (CITDAS). This study showed a delivery up to 245 μg/puff of salbutamol with Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) ranging 1.2–1.4 μm. The results of this study suggest that the use of ENDS technology in inhalation medicine can represent a large innovation, potentially this technology, could close the existing gap in currently available technology, between inhaler design and patients’ compliance and adherence.}

abstract = {Hydrogels have become a very popular trend in interdisciplinary research because of their versatile characteristics and applicability in a diverse array of healthcare sector. They have been widely explored as contact lens materials, materials for wound dressings, and materials of filler in augmentation of soft tissue, where typically the backbones of polymers such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate are commonly used. Polysaccharides have lately attracted researchers' attention as a suitable material of construct for man-made extracellular matrices. Particularly, in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicines, alginate, pullulan, chitosan, dextran, and hyaluronic acid are the preferred choices amid the range of polysaccharides and a precise chemical functionalization is very crucial for obtaining appropriate functionalized hydrogels from these polysaccharides. This chapter overviews the structural aspects of polysaccharides for functionalization and covers several recent advances in polysaccharides’ chemical derivatization, crosslinking, and bioactive ligand decoration for their defined biomedical applications. In addition, we have also discussed the crosslinking techniques, both convergent and divergent, as well as biofunctionalization strategies for polysaccharides. In a nutshell, functionalized polysaccharides-based hydrogels and their biomedical applications particularly in tissue engineering and regenerative medicines are discussed.}

abstract = {Background and aims
There is an alarming delay in Europe for anticancer medicines becoming accessible for children. Following a paediatric European Union marketing authorisation, national Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies evaluate effectiveness, and safety of medicines to support decision on their cost and reimbursement. This study (a SIOPE Access to Medicines project) aimed to evaluate how these HTA evaluations take place for anticancer medicines indicated for paediatric use in Europe and to explore where the delays for market access originate.
Methods
We obtained HTA reports from the public domain for nine European countries for blinatumomab, dinutuximab beta and tisagenlecleucel. We evaluated the time elapsed between marketing authorisation for a paediatric indication and a national HTA decision and the nature of the decision.
Results
Out of 23 HTA decisions (four countries without blinatumomab report), 18 were positive, two with restrictions, three negative. For blinatumomab, tisagenlecleucel and dinutuximab beta, the median time to an HTA decision after regulatory approval for paediatric use was 353 days (range 193–751), 141 days (range 77–517) and 515 days (range 0–780), respectively, with variability between countries. Dinutuximab beta and tisagenlecleucel were first introduced in children, but did not result in shorter time to HTA decision. For blinatumomab, marketing authorisation followed 1008 days after the indication in adults, with HTA applications submitted a median of 167 days later, and a recommendation after 145 days.
Conclusions
This study reveals ample variability in HTA decision making in nine European Union countries. Collaboration and alignment of required evidence is needed to facilitate robust scientific HTA assessments, also considering methodological challenges in paediatric oncology.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder and its prevalence is increasing in the last few decades. No treatment can cure the condition. Pregnancy often worsens the clinical manifestation. There are considerable interests in Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) as an alternative treatment for AD. A well tolerated CHM formula (Pentaherbs formulation, PHF) has been proven efficacious in improving life quality and reducing topical corticosteroid use in children with moderate-to-severe AD. However, safety data of PHF are not available.
Aim of the study
Our study aimed to evaluate the safety of PHF and its 5 individual herbal extracts, including embryotoxicity by Embryonic Stem Cell Test (EST) and irritation by Skin Irritation Test (SIT).
Materials and methods
Quality of 5 herbal extracts of PHF was confirmed by chromatography. In EST, mouse embryonic stem cell line (D3) and mouse fibroblast cell line (3T3) were used to study potential embryotoxicity. Three endpoints were assessed by concentration-response curves after 10 days’ culture: 50% inhibition of D3 differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes (ID50D3), 50% cytotoxic effects on D3 (IC50D3) and on fibroblasts (IC503T3). A biostatistically based prediction model (PM) was applied to predict the embryotoxic potentials of each CHM. In SIT, epidermis equivalent commercially available kits (EpiDerm™) were used, and concentration-viability curves were obtained by MTT assay to detect skin irritations of each CHM.
Results
Chemical authentication confirmed that 5 test herbal extracts contained their main active compounds. EST results indicated that the formula PHF and its individual CHMs were non-embryotoxic, except one CHM, Amur Corktree Bark (Huang Bai, Phellodendron chinense C.K.Schneid), was weakly embryotoxic. SIT results showed that cell viability was above 50% after treatment with different concentrations of all tested CHMs.
Conclusions
Our in vitro tests provided preliminary evidence for safety of the formula PHF in embryonic stem cell test and skin irritation model, but PHF shall be cautiously used in pregnant women with AD. Further studies are needed to support its clinical application as an alternative treatment for AD, especially to the patients who plan for pregnancy or at lactation stages.}

abstract = {Background
Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of death and severe long-term disability worldwide. Over the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in anti-ischemic therapies. However, IS remains a tremendous challenge, with favourable clinical outcomes being generally difficult to achieve from candidate drugs in preclinical phase testing. Traditional herbal medicine (THM) has been used to treat stroke for over 2,000 years in China. In modern times, THM as an alternative and complementary therapy have been prescribed in other Asian countries and have gained increasing attention for their therapeutic effects. These millennia of clinical experience allow THM to be a promising avenue for improving clinical efficacy and accelerating drug discovery.
Purpose
To summarise the clinical evidence and potential mechanisms of THMs in IS.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in seven electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, the VIP Information Database, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the Wanfang Database, from inception to 17 June 2022 to examine the efficacy and safety of THM for IS, and to investigate experimental studies regarding potential mechanisms.
Results
THM is widely prescribed for IS alone or as adjuvant therapy. In clinical trials, THM is generally administered within 72 h of stroke onset and are continuously prescribed for over 3 months. Compared with Western medicine (WM), THM combined with routine WM can significantly improve neurological function defect scores, promote clinical total effective rate, and accelerate the recovery time of stroke with fewer adverse effects (AEs). These effects can be attributed to multiple mechanisms, mainly anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, brain blood barrier (BBB) modulation, inhibition of platelet activation and thrombus formation, and promotion of neurogenesis and angiogenesis.
Conclusions
THM may be a promising candidate for IS management to guide clinical applications and as a reference for drug development.}

We recently demonstrated that IR occurs at the pre-symptomatic state during the aging process of a mouse model of aging, providing a promising biomarker for that state, and can be restored to the normal state by juzentaihoto (JTT), a Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo) (Okada et al. 2021). Here we characterized the genes that accumulate retained introns, examined the biological significance of increased IR in these genes for the host, and determined whether drugs other than JTT can have this effect. By analyzing RNA-sequencing data generated from the hippocampus of the 19-week-old SAMP8 mouse, a model for studying age-related depression and Alzheimer's disease, we showed that genes with increased IR are generally involved in multiple metabolic pathways and have pivotal roles in sensing homeostasis. We thus propose that IR is a stress response and works to fine-tune the expression of many downstream target genes, leading to lower levels of their translation under stress conditions. Interestingly, Kampo medicines, as well as other organic compounds, restored splicing of a specific set of retained introns in these sensor genes in accordance with the physiological recovery conditions of the host, which corresponds with the recovery of transcripts represented by differentially expressed genes. Thus, analysis of IR genes may have broad applicability in evaluating the pre-symptomatic state based on the extent of IR of selective sensor genes, opening a promising early diagnosis of any diseases and a strategy for evaluating efficacies of several drugs based on the extent of IR restoration of these sensor genes.}

Here, we prepared a compound solution by combining ethanol extracts from three medicine food homology plants: Siraitia grosvenorii, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Alpinia oxyphylla. The antimicrobial activities of the compound solution were investigated using five common food spoilage microorganisms as target strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Rhizopus, and Aspergillums niger. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for each target strain, and further examined the effects of various environmental factors on antimicrobial activity. Our results indicate that the compound solution effectively inhibited the growth of S. aureus and Rhizopus at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 7.81 mg/mL. It also inhibited the growth of B. subtilis, E. coli, and A. niger at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 15.6 mg/mL. Furthermore, the compound solution was stable under heat, ultraviolet, and light treatments, and was effective in the pH range of 3–5. Adding salt or sucrose to the compound mixture increased the antimicrobial effect synergistically, and added Fe3+ and Fe2+ also enhanced the antimicrobial activity of the compound solution.

abstract = {Background
Systematic reviews on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are constantly increasing. However, if these reviews are to be of practical value, the evidence needs to be relevant, valid, and adequately reported. Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs) are considered as high-quality systematic reviews that can inform health care decision making. Our aim was to provide an overview of the scope, findings, quality and impact of CSRs on the benefits and harms associated with TCM interventions for the treatment and prevention of disease to provide new information for clinical practice and future research.
Methods
The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched up to May 2021, and descriptive characteristics were extracted. The correspondence between the questions asked in the CSRs and the available evidence, conclusions and certainty of findings (according to GRADE assessment), methodological quality (AMSTAR 2), and impact (Altmetric Attention Score [AAS], total citations by guideline, and total citations in Web of Science [WoS]) of CSRs were extracted. Tabular and graphical summaries of these descriptive characteristics were constructed.
Results
Of 104 CSRs on TCM identified, 70 diseases belonged to 16 disease systems and contained 1642 primary studies with 157,943 participants. Interventions included Chinese herbal medicine (n = 70), acupuncture (n = 28), TCM exercises (n = 4), and moxibustion (n = 2). Among 1642 primary studies, 662 studies included an intervention group treated with at least one TCM therapy and 980 studies included a combination of therapies. Promising outcomes from the 104 CSRs were divided into endpoint outcomes (34 diseases), doctor- or patient-reported outcomes (27 diseases), and surrogate outcomes (37 diseases). Despite the presence of promising outcomes, only 5/104 CSRs drew overall positive conclusions, 42 CSRs concluded the evidence was insufficient, and 54 failed to draw firm conclusions. GRADE assessments were reported in 41.3% of the CSRs, and the ratings were mostly low or very low. Comparing the questions asked and results obtained, there was frequently a lack of information about specific outcomes. Only 16 CSRs obtained results for all outcomes listed in the methods section. According to AMSTAR 2, 51 CSRs (49.0%) were of low quality. The total number of citations in the WoS was 2135 (mean ± SD: 20.8 ± 21.2), and 38.5% of the CSRs had been cited in guidelines 95 times.
Conclusion
Although TCM is commonly used, evidence of its effectiveness remains largely inconclusive. Rigorous high-quality trials are needed to support the performance of high-quality reviews and to increase the evidence base. It is critical to emphasize quality over quantity in future TCM research.}

The purpose of this study was to report demographic trends in terms of ethnicity/race and gender among the membership and leadership positions of the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA) and the American Orthopaedic Society of Sports Medicine (AOSSM). Over the years both AANA and AOSSM will increase in diversity through their committee membership and leadership positions.
Methods
AANA and AOSSM membership and leadership were reviewed for the years 2010, 2015, and 2020. Race/ethnicity was divided into Caucasian, Asian, African American (AA), Hispanic/Latin/South American (HLSA), and Middle Eastern (ME). Gender was limited to male or female, based on name and photographic depiction.
Results
Diversity in AANA and AOSSM committee and leadership positions is summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. In 2010, 166/191 (87%) AANA committee members were Caucasian, as compared with 125/186 (67%) in 2020. Asian committee members were similar in 2010 (13/191, 7%) and 2015 (13/216, 6%) but increased to 17/186 (10%) in 2020. HLSA committee members increased from 5/191 (3%) 2010 to 11/186 (6%) in 2020. AA committee membership increased from 2/191 (1%) in 2010 to 5/186 (3%) in 2020. The diversity of AANA Board of Director leadership positions increased, with Caucasian representation decreasing from 14/14 (100%) 2010 to 11/12 (92%) in 2020 and Asian representation increasing from 0% in 2010 to 1/12 (8%) in 2020, with HLSA, AA and ME remaining the same with 0/12 (0%). In AANA, men comprised 181/191 (95%) committee members in 2010 and 166/186 (89%) in 2020. The percentage of female committee members increased from 10/191 (5%) in 2010 to 20/186 (11%) in 2020. In 2010, 73/79 (92%) AOSSM committee members were Caucasian compared to 62/81 (77%) in 2020 with AA having the largest increase in committee members from 0% in 2010 to 6/81 (7%) in 2020 (Table 2). Within AOSSM, men comprised 73/79 (92%) committee members in 2010 and 70/81 (86%) in 2020. The percentage of female committee members in AOSSM increased from 6/79 (8%) in 2010 to 11/81 (14%) in 2020.
Conclusion
There has been a progressive trend toward increasing diversity in both committee membership and leadership positions in AANA and AOSSM from 2010 to 2020. Within AANA, there has been a decrease in the Caucasian representation from 87% in 2010 to 67% in 2020 and an increase in the female representation from 5% in 2010 to 11% in 2020. AOSSM demonstrated a similar trend, with Caucasian representation decreasing from 92% in 2010 to 77% in 2020, in addition to female percentage increasing from 8% in 2010 to 14% in 2020. Although there has been an increase in representation of minority and female orthopaedic surgeons within both societies, there is still room for more diversity and inclusion within committee membership and leadership. It is important to progress toward the understanding of the changes that need to be made and work to implement opening the field of orthopaedic sports medicine.}

Such research is critical for examining the myriad factors that limit the lives of gender and sexual minorities. Few studies, however, have explored LGBTQ people's concepts of health. People's accounts of health are important, as they reveal insights into a person's relationship to the social world and are fundamental to accessing care. Semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of 40 LGBTQ-identified adults living in New York City, aiming to explore (a) how LGBTQ people conceptualize health, and (b) how participant constructions of health reflect personal, social, cultural, and political subjectivities as well as institutionalized discourses of health and illness. Through framework analysis, four primary themes were identified: (1) health as medicine; (2) health as mind-body-spirit; (3) health as survival; and (4) health as access. Implications for the health professions, including patient-centered care, shared decision-making, and provider training, are discussed.}

abstract = {Background
The Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) regarding definition, diagnosis, bias, standard operating procedures (SOPs) and telehealth is intended to provide clinicians an overview of obesity medicine and provide basic organizational tools towards establishing, directing, managing, and maintaining an obesity medical practice.
Methods
This CPS is based upon published scientific citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
OMA has defined obesity as: “A chronic, progressive, relapsing, and treatable multi-factorial, neurobehavioral disease, wherein an increase in body fat promotes adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass physical forces, resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial health consequences.” While body mass index may be sufficiently diagnostic for populations and many patients, accurate diagnosis of adiposity in an individual may require anthropometric assessments beyond body weight alone (e.g., waist circumference, percent body fat, and android/visceral fat). Obesity complications can be categorized as “sick fat disease” (adiposopathy) and/or “fat mass disease.” Obesity complications predominantly of fat mass origins include sleep apnea and orthopedic conditions. Obesity complications due to adiposopathic endocrinopathies and/or immunopathies include cardiovascular disease, cancer, elevated blood sugar, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and alterations in sex hormones in both males (i.e., hypogonadism) and females (i.e., polycystic ovary syndrome). Obesity treatment begins with proactive steps to avoid weight bias, including patient-appropriate language, office equipment, and supplies. To help manage obesity and its complications, this CPS provides a practical template for an obesity medicine practice, creation of standard operating procedures, and incorporation of the OMA “ADAPT” method in telehealth (Assessment, Diagnosis, Advice, Prognosis, and Treatment).
Conclusions
The OMA CPS regarding “Obesity Definition, Diagnosis, Bias, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and Telehealth” is one in a series of OMA CPSs designed to assist clinicians care for patients with the disease of obesity.}

Firstly, a deep-learning MDF was used to classify and characterize the whole phytochemical components of QJYQ based on the mass spectrum (MS) data of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Secondly, the highly sensitive UHPLC-sMRM data-acquisition method was established to quantify the multi-ingredients of QJYQ. Totally, nine major types of phytochemical compounds in QJYQ were intelligently classified and 163 phytochemicals were initially identified. Furthermore, fifty components were rapidly quantified. The comprehensive evaluation strategy established in this study would provide an effective tool for accurately evaluating the quality of QJYQ as a whole.}

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms in all waves. Participants reported frequency (minutes), type (aerobic, strength, combined), and place (out of home, at home) of physical activity at baseline. Generalized linear models were used to investigate the interaction between time and PA, adjusting for possible confounding variables. Subjective memory decline was assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models to obtain adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and respective 95% confidence interval (CI). Participants (n = 424) with self-reported clinically diagnosed depression were included. We observed a non-linear increase trajectory of depression during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. PA was associated with a slower trajectory of depressive (slope: −1.89; 95%CI: −3.34, −0.43 points) but not anxiety (slope: −1.33; 95%CI: −2.93, 0.25 points) symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who continued physically active from pre-pandemic in wave 1 showed a lower risk of subjective memory decline during follow-up than those who persisted inactive in the same period (HR: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.30, 0.89). PA attenuated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depressive symptoms in adults living with depression in south Brazil. Regularity of physical activity was associated with fewer depression and anxiety symptoms and a lower risk of subjective memory decline.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Amenorrhea caused by antipsychotic drugs is not uncommon in clinical practice, and various treatment strategies are used to treat the condition. Chinese herbal medicine has its own theory for amenorrhea caused by antipsychotic drugs and has developed its own medication methods.
Aim of the study
To review and conduct meta-analysis of the use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in treatment of amenorrhea caused by antipsychotic drugs.
Materials and methods
A search was conducted across seven Chinese electronic databases (the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, the China Science and Technology Journal Database, the Wanfang Database, the SinoMed, the Foreign Medical Literature Retrieval Service(FMRS), the Chinese University of Hong Kong Library, the Airiti Library), and the following English databases: MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, OLD MEDLINE、Publisher Supplied Citation in pubmed; JBI EBP Database, EBM Reviews, Embase, OVID Emcare, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Maternity & Infant Care Database(MIDIRS), APA PsycInfo in OVID, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Reviews), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (Other Reviews), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials),The Cochrane Methodology Register (Method Studies), Health Technology Assessment Database (Technology Assessments), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (Economic Evaluations) in Cochrane Library; and four databases (Science Direct, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Scopus) in official website using common standards and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The remaining reports were used for preliminary studies. Due to inconsistencies in control groups, randomized controlled trials and articles that combined with other drugs were also excluded. This study is a META analysis of a single rate.
Results
Initial screening returned 912 potentially relevant publications in all databases. After subsequent filtering, a total of 18 articles were included in the analysis. The overall effectiveness for treatment amenorrhea caused by antipsychotic drugs using traditional Chinese herbal medicine was 0.91, with 95% confidence interval of 0.89–0.93. Notably in most studies, the time needed to achieve this level of effectiveness was relatively long, usually in excess of three months. Although a satisfactory verification of an improvement in menstrual cycling takes time, the long treatment duration is a downside. Our analysis revealed that the following Chinese herbal remedies were most common: Danggui (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels), Chuanxiong (Ligusticum striatum DC.), Taoren (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch), Honghua (Carthamus tinctorius L.), Gancao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.), Fuling ((Fungus) Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf), Baizhu (Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.), Xiangfu (Cyperus rotundus L.), Chaihu (Bupleurum chinense DC.), Shudihuang (Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn.) DC.(Processed), Baishao (Cynanchum otophyllum C.K.Schneid.)
Conclusions
Chinese herbal medicine can effectively treat amenorrhea caused by psychiatric drugs, although it takes a long time to achieve satisfactory effectiveness. More research is needed to better understand different aspects of Chinese herbal medicine use in treatment of this particular medical condition.}

Treatment for SBS is mainly supportive, consisting of supplementation, prevention and treatment of complications, and promotion of intestinal adaptation. While development of parenteral nutrition and drugs promoting intestinal adaptation has improved clinical outcomes, the prognosis of patients with SBS remains poor. Intestinal transplantation is the only curative therapy but its outcome is unsatisfactory. In the absence of definitive therapy, novel treatment is urgently needed. With the advent of intestinal organoids, research on the intestine has developed remarkably in recent years. Concepts such as the “tissue-engineered small intestine” and “small intestinalized colon,” which create a functional small intestine by combining organoids with other technologies, are potentially novel regenerative therapeutic approaches for SBS. Although they are still under development and there are substantial issues to be resolved, the problems that have prevented establishment of the complex function and structure of the small intestine are gradually being overcome. This review discusses the current treatments for SBS, the fundamentals of the intestine and organoids, the current status of these new technologies, and future perspectives.}

Quality markers (Q-markers) are a new concept in TCM quality control. According to the characteristics of TCM system, such as biological attributes, manufacturing process, and compatibility theory, these markers take into account the correlation among effectiveness, material basis, and quality control landmark components and create a new model of TCM quality research. This paper reviews the research pathway and practice on TCM Q-markers in recent years and reports selected examples of case studies. It discusses the application of Q-markers to TCM quality traceability system and industry supervision. Results will provide references for further in-depth research on Q-markers to improve the whole-process quality control level of TCM.}

Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a public health emergency most commonly presenting with a painful rash and several systemic findings. However, there are several conditions that may mimic its presentation.
Objective
This narrative review provides a focused overview of mpox mimics for emergency clinicians.
Discussion
Mpox is a global health emergency. The disease is primarily spread through contact, followed by the development of a centrifugally-spread rash that evolves from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. This is often associated with lymphadenopathy and fever. As the rash is one of the most common presenting signs of the infection, patients mpox may present to the emergency department (ED) for further evaluation. There are a variety of mimics of mpox, including smallpox, varicella, primary and secondary syphilis, acute retroviral syndrome, and genital herpes simplex virus.
Conclusion
Knowledge of mpox and its mimics is vital for emergency clinicians to differentiate these conditions and ensure appropriate diagnosis and management.}

Chinese medicine injections (CMIs) are widely used by clinicians in China as an adjuvant treatment in dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure (DCM-HF). However, comprehensive and systematic evidence supporting the beneficial effects of CMIs combined with Western medicine (WM) against DCM-HF was lacking.
Objective
This network meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of five different CMIs in the treatment of DCM-HF.
Methods
The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Allied and Alternative Medieine Database (AMED), Chinese Biological Medicine Database (CBM), Wanfang Database, and Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP) were comprehensively searched from their inception to March 10, 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on the use of CMIs combined with WM to treat DCM-HF. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook 5.1.0. Bayesian network meta-analysis were designed to access the effectiveness of different CMIs.
Results
A total of 38 eligible RCTs involving 3247 patients were enrolled. The study showed that Huangqi injection, Shengmai injection, Shenfu injection, Shenmai injection, and Xinmailong injection combined with WM significantly improved performance compared with WM alone in treating DCM-HF. Xinmailong injection + WM had the highest likelihood of being the best treatment in terms of the improvement in the clinical effectiveness rate, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and 6-min walking distance. Huangqi injection + WM had the highest probability of being the best treatment on account of the enhancement of left ventricular ejection fraction. Shenmai injection + WM had the highest likelihood of being the best treatment considering the improvement in cardiac output and the reduction in brain natriuretic peptide.
Conclusions
The combination between CMIs and WM exerted a more positive effect in DCM-HF treatment. Xinmailong injection + WM had the best performance in treating DCM-HF, followed by Shenmai injection and Huangqi injection. However, due to the low qualities of the original studies, more high-quality studies are needed to support the findings.}

abstract = {Adopting healthy behaviors is a multifaceted and complex process that poses significant challenges for individuals. Despite awareness of the detrimental effects of certain behaviors on health, many individuals continue to engage in risky practices. Traditional medical advice and prescriptions, while well intentioned, often fall short in fostering lasting lifestyle changes. Although individuals may also have good intentions, solely relying on doctor's counsel does not ensure successful lifestyle adjustments. One primary reason for this limitation is the lack of specialized expertise in behavioral modification among gynecologists and healthcare providers. Health psychologists are specialized professionals capable of effectively guiding and assisting individuals in modifying health-related behaviors. Their expertise in behavior change strategies and psychological interventions proves invaluable in empowering individuals to embrace healthier lifestyles and contributes to people's well-being. This paper emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts between medical professionals, such as gynecologists, and health psychologists to promote healthy behaviors among peri- and postmenopausal women and enhance women's health. By forging integrative alliances, they can develop comprehensive and tailored interventions. By bridging the gap between medical advice and behavior modification, this collaborative effort has the potential to ensure a more effective intervention process. This holistic approach not only addresses women's specific health needs but also fosters sustainable behavior change when promoting healthy behaviors among middle-aged women. The ultimate goal of such a synergy is to improve women's health outcomes and contribute to a healthier society overall.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
We sought to quantify in-hospital and early post-discharge mortality rates in hospitalised patients.
Methods
Consecutive adult patients admitted to an internal medicine ward were prospectively enrolled. The rates of in-hospital and 4-month post-discharge mortality and their possible associated sociodemographic and clinical factors (eg Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS], body mass index [BMI], polypharmacy, Barthel Index) were assessed.
Results
1,451 patients (median age 80 years, IQR 69–86; 53% female) were included. Of these, 93 (6.4%) died in hospital, while 4-month post-discharge mortality was 15.9% (191/1,200). Age and high dependency were associated (p<0.01) with a higher risk of in-hospital (OR 1.04 and 2.15) and 4-month (HR 1.04 and 1.65) mortality, while malnutrition and length of stay were associated (p<0.01) with a higher risk of 4-month mortality (HR 2.13 and 1.59).
Conclusions
Several negative prognostic factors for early mortality were found. Interventions addressing dependency and malnutrition could potentially decrease early post-discharge mortality.}

In this context, motivational interviewing (MI) as provided by family doctors (FDs) seems promising: influential health professionals motivate patients to adopt healthy lifestyles in a patient-centred style that promotes a balanced, horizontal doctor-patient relationship. Based on these assumptions, a pilot project called Girasole was implemented in Switzerland between 2016 and 2018 to train and support 19 FDs in implementing MI in their practices. This paper presents the analysis of implementation of the intervention with the aim of exploring the doctors’ experiences with MI through a qualitative research design. Data derive from focus groups and interviews with the participants, and from the observation of collective training sessions and follow-up meetings. A thematic analysis was conducted using the software Atlas.ti. Results show that there is great diversity in how FDs implement MI. FDs can be classified in four groups – convinced, interested, critical, and resistant – based on their adherence to the principles underlying the MI approach. This taxonomy highlights opportunities and challenges for family medicine: MI offers flexible tools and new ways of interacting with patients to meet the challenges of non-communicable and chronic diseases; at the same time, the issues associated with the medicalisation of human everyday problems, physicians’ status loss, and low cost-effectiveness should not be underestimated. Any further attempt to promote MI among FDs should take into account their individual attitudes and should establish tailored approaches and training methods.}

By taking into account heterogeneity of the UMs, cross-selling effect, subsidies and tax deductions from governments and participation willingness of UM holders, a new bi-level programming model is built to formulate such a recycle system with reflecting of sustainable synergy of drugmakers, drugstores, customers and governments in the framework of the Stackelberg game. In this model, the amount of recycled UMs is treated as an endogenous variable, depending on proportion of the selected drugstores, points-exchange incentive scheme and advertising investment. By reformulation techniques, an efficient smoothing algorithm is developed to solve the complicated model. The conducted scenario analysis validates the proposed framework of recycling the UMs and sufficiently shows its advantages over the similar ones in the literature in terms of profitability and sustainability. On average, our system can obtain a net profit margin of 24.7% and a recovery ratio of more than 50% in the scenario analysis. Main findings include: Heterogeneity of the UMs dominates distinct optimal policies of drugmakers and drugstores; Subsidies and tax deductions from governments play a critical role in promoting the recycling of UMs; The adopted strategy of reutilizing physical drugstores strategy and the cooperation between drugmakers and drugstores can significantly enhance the profitability and sustainability of the system, apart from great reduction in delivery cost and increment in customer surplus.}
