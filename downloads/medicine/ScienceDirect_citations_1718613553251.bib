abstract = {Objective
A review of current practices of educational interventions for lifestyle medicine was performed to inform the design of interventions with long-term goals of improving patient outcomes.
Methods
Systematic review of PubMed, MedEdPORTAL, and Cochrane using keywords “lifestyle medicine,” “education,” “medical students,” and “medical school” was done by 3 independent reviewers. Location, learner, curricular hours, focus, outcomes, and impact are reported.
Results
Of 452 identified citations, 32 met criteria. Most studies (81%) were conducted in the U.S. and designed for medical students (72%). Studies focused primarily on nutrition (78%) and exercise (59%). Curricula were delivered on average across 13.7 h. Lectures were used in 53% of papers. The outcomes most commonly studied were satisfaction (66%,), knowledge perception (66%), and reported clinical practices (34%). Intervention impact at level 2b (31%) and level 3 (34%) were most common.
Conclusion
Medical educators looking to integrate lifestyle education curriculum should consider current resources as a starting point, especially ones with higher outcome measurements.
Practice Implications
Novel interventions should target lifestyle medicine competencies with equitable distribution among learners using active learning approaches. The authors propose initial efforts focusing on instruction of clinical educators and practicing physicians, with advocacy for increased reimbursement.}

It was hypothesized that participants would experience a decline in type 2 diabetes symptoms following the 12-month program of bi-monthly healthy groceries, nutritional guidance, educational sessions, and group health coaching. For this initial pilot study, four cohorts of patients were admitted consisting of 20 participants. The 12-month program included bi-monthly food pick-ups, nutritional recipes, and bi-monthly group educational and health coaching sessions for participants. They also completed pre- and post-program assessments, including a medical history questionnaire, biometric screening (HbA1c, weight, BMI, and blood pressure), and health behavior questionnaires. While there were not statistically significant differences from pre- to post-program, mean HbA1c slightly decreased from the time of the initial test (i.e., month 1) to follow-up testing (i.e., month 12). The pre- to post-program trends for diabetes self-care activities indicated improvements for general and specific diet maintenance, days of exercise per week, blood glucose testing per week, foot care, and smoking habits. Participants also exhibited a decrease in diabetes distress for emotional, physical, regimen, and interpersonal distress from pre- to post-program. This is very important as self-regulation of behaviors is necessary to successful management of diabetes. The results are discussed in relation to the limitations created by COVID-19, along with future implementation suggestions.}

abstract = {Objective
To provide recommendations on the management of urgent obstetrical emergencies outside the maternity ward.
Design
A group of 24 experts from the French Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU), the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (SFAR) and the French College of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) was convened. Potential conflicts of interest were formally declared at the outset of the guideline development process, which was conducted independently of industry funding. The authors followed the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method to assess the level of evidence in the literature. The potential drawbacks of strong recommendations in the presence of low-level evidence were highlighted. Some recommendations with an insufficient level of evidence were not graded.
Methods
Eight areas were defined: imminent delivery, postpartum haemorrhage (prevention and management), threat of premature delivery, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, trauma, imaging, cardiopulmonary arrest, and emergency obstetric training. For each field, the expert panel formulated questions according to the PICO model (population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) and an extensive literature search was conducted. Analysis of the literature and formulation of recommendations were conducted according to the GRADE method.
Results
Fifteen recommendations on the management of obstetrical emergencies were issued by the SFMU/SFAR/CNGOF panel of experts, and 4 recommendations from formalised expert recommendations (RFE) established by the same societies were taken up to answer 4 PICO questions dealing with the pre-hospital context. After two rounds of voting and several amendments, strong agreement was reached for all the recommendations. For two questions (cardiopulmonary arrest and inter-hospital transfer), no recommendation could be made.
Conclusions
There was significant agreement among the experts on strong recommendations to improve practice in the management of urgent obstetric complications in emergency medicine.}

Dr. John L. Cameron was appointed the chair of surgery at Johns Hopkins in 1984. He subsequently built the largest group of clinician-scientists anywhere in the world who were focused on pancreatic cancer.
Materials and Methods
Trainees were selected over the decades to join the group based on characteristics including self-confidence, a sense of humor, a collegial and congenial personality, and a strong previous track record. Resume items such as prior leadership positions, academic achievements, and participation in team sports can all prove to be important predictors for future success.
Results
Many of the trainees that were molded by that group have perpetuated its ideals by pursuing academic careers. Dr Cameron's approach can be distilled to 3 key points: work hard and lead by example, make diamonds by applying the right amount of pressure, and serve your people and give the impression that you are working for your trainees and junior people.
Conclusions
With those leadership principles, it should still be possible to build successful academic programs, despite the significant challenges that have arisen.}

abstract = {Objective
Conventional treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) like 5alpha-reductase inhibitors and invasive surgery are associated with some obvious side effects. Conversely, evidence, though limited, has shown that alternative medicines are safer and have potential to improve the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and quality of life in addition to improving sexual dysfunction in patients with BPH. The current article aimed to include an overview of BPH, different ways of its management, and particularly its appreciation in Greco-Arab (Unani) system of medicine, one of the alternative medicinal systems.
Methods
PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar databases and classical texts of Greco-Arab medicine were searched for data collection.
Results
In Unani system of medicine, BPH, traced under the headings of Waram unuq al-mathana (bladder neck swelling) and Insidad majra-i-mathana (bladder outlet obstruction), has been managed for centuries with herbal medicines yet demanding a comprehensive scientific validation. Among the herbs, Cucurbita pepo, Tribulus terrestris, Urtica dioica, and Linum usitatissimum are worth mentioning.
Conclusion
For achieving the goal of LUTS-free ageing men, and safer and cost-effective future management of BPH, Unani herbal medicine could hopefully prove beneficial.}

abstract = {Background
Reliable and evidence-based medicines information (MI) is critical for patient care. To guarantee this, in many countries, there are medicines information centers (MICs) which offer medicines information services (MISs). While there are no MICs in Finland, pharmacists in all five university hospital pharmacies provide MISs. A proposal for establishing five MICs has been made by the National Medicines Information Network.
Objectives
The aim was to explore the current MISs and the perceptions of current and potential MI service providers of the need for the proposed national MICs. Barriers and facilitators for potential transition from the current MISs provided by the university hospital pharmacies to establishing national MICs, were examined.
Methods
This sequential explanatory mixed methods study was conducted nationally during September 2019–April 2020 as an online survey and semi-structured individual, pair and group theme interviews with hospital representatives. The survey questionnaire was sent to chief pharmacists and MI pharmacists in all five Finnish university hospital pharmacies (n = 5, census). The interviews (n = 13) were carried out with chief pharmacists, MI pharmacists, medication safety officers (pharmacists), chairs of the Medicines Advisory Board (physicians) and clinical pharmacologists (physicians) (participants n = 19). The data was analyzed using descriptive quantitative analysis and qualitative content analysis.
Results
All invited representatives participated in the study. Offered MISs are quite similar but the human resources vary among the organizations. Answering MI questions was one of the core MISs. Most representatives considered a proposal of establishing five MICs to Finland positively. The expected benefits were related to achieving an official status to enhance MI, establishing the MICs within the university hospitals and close to where the MISs are needed, and fostering multiprofessional collaboration and collaboration between the MICs. Limited financial and human resources were seen the most critical challenges.
Conclusion
The existing expertise of the pharmacists and the similarities in MISs provided by the university hospital pharmacies seem to provide a good basis and preconditions for expanding MI operations and forming MICs at the national level. By pooling current limited resources, synergies could be achieved and MISs, and potentially MICs developed. The establishment of MICs may enhance utilization of networking and multiprofessional collaboration in producing MISs at the national level.}

To describe, validate, and evaluate the effectiveness of an in-house-developed mannequin versus standard commercial mannequins for emergency medicine training among undergraduate medical students.
Materials and methods
Firstly, we developed a 3-in-1 model consisting of 3 modules (sampling techniques, fluid resuscitation and IV drug administration, and minor surgery). Forty participants of 2nd-year medical students were enrolled. Each student completed three scenarios through the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) simulation assessment. The questionnaire was used to rate the mannequins' overall quality, usability, comparability, cost efficiency, and realism.
Results
Although students using an in-house-developed mannequin had similar OSCE scores to a standard mannequin, students rated an in-house-developed mannequin easier to use. On the other hand, most students agreed that the standard commercial mannequin was more realistic than a substitute one. The costs of the materials needed for mannequin fabrication were less than 100 USD, and it was functionally comparable.
Conclusion
An in-house-developed mannequin was well accepted by students and teachers and could be used to deliver and assess clinical skills for medical students effectively at low-cost.
Resumen
Introducción
describir, validar y evaluar la efectividad de un maniquí desarrollado internamente versus maniquíes comerciales estándar para la capacitación en medicina de emergencia entre estudiantes de medicina de pregrado.
Materiales y métodos
en primer lugar, desarrollamos un modelo 3 en uno que consta de 3 módulos (técnicas de muestreo, reanimación con líquidos y administración de fármacos por vía intravenosa y cirugía menor). Se inscribieron 40 participantes de estudiantes de medicina de segundo año. Cada estudiante completó 3 escenarios a través de la evaluación de simulación del examen clínico estructurado objetivo (OSCE). El cuestionario se utilizó para calificar la calidad general, la facilidad de uso, la comparabilidad, la rentabilidad y el realismo de los maniquíes.
Resultados
aunque los estudiantes que usaron un maniquí desarrollado internamente obtuvieron puntajes OSCE similares a los de un maniquí estándar, los estudiantes calificaron un maniquí desarrollado internamente como más fácil de usar. Por otro lado, la mayoría de los estudiantes estuvo de acuerdo en que el maniquí comercial estándar era más realista que uno sustituto. Los costos de los materiales necesarios para la fabricación del maniquí eran inferiores a 100 USD y eran funcionalmente comparables.
Conclusión
un maniquí desarrollado internamente fue bien aceptado por estudiantes y profesores y podría usarse para brindar y evaluar habilidades clínicas para estudiantes de medicina de manera efectiva a bajo costo.}

To support the transition from administrations of fixed activities to personalised treatments based on patient-specific dosimetry, EFOMP presents a number of recommendations including: increased networking between centres and disciplines to support data collection and development of codes-of-practice; resourcing to support an infrastructure that permits routine patient dosimetry; research funding to support investigation into individualised treatments; inter-disciplinary training and education programmes; and support for investigator led clinical trials. Close collaborations between the medical physicist and responsible practitioner are encouraged to develop a similar pathway as is routine for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. EFOMP’s policy is to promote the roles and responsibilities of medical physics throughout Europe in the development of molecular radiotherapy to ensure patient benefit.

abstract = {Objectives
In Portugal, the dispensing of most outpatient specialty medicines is performed exclusively through hospital pharmacies and totally financed by the National Health Service. During the COVID-19 first wave, the government allowed the transfer of the dispensing of hospital-only medicines (HOMs) to community pharmacies (CPs). This study aimed to measure the value generated by the intervention of CP in the dispensing of HOM.
Methods
A single-arm, before-and-after study with 3-month follow-up was conducted enrolling a randomly selected sample of patients or caregivers with at least 1 dispensation of HOM through CP. Data were collected by telephone interview. Main outcomes were patients’ self-reported adherence (Measure Treatment Adherence), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D 3-Level), satisfaction with the service, and costs related to HOM access.
Results
Overall 603 subjects were recruited to participate in the study (males 50.6%) with mean 55 years old (SD = 16). The already high mean adherence score to therapy improved significantly (P < .0001), and no statistically significant change (P > .5757) was found in the mean EQ-5D score between baseline (0.7 ± 0.3) and 3-month follow-up (0.8 ± 0.3). Annual savings account for €262.1/person, arising from travel expenses and absenteeism reduction. Participants reported a significant increase in satisfaction levels in all evaluated domains—pharmacist’s availability, opening hours, waiting time, privacy conditions, and overall experience.
Conclusions
Changing the dispense setting to CP may promote better access and satisfaction. Moreover, it ensures the persistence of treatments, promotes savings for citizens, and reduces the burden of healthcare services, representing a crucial public health measure.}

This paradigm shift offers an emerging approach for understanding tumor dynamics, treatment responses, and disease progression. Leveraging advancements in molecular biology and technology, liquid biopsies enable clinicians to gain intricate insights from peripheral blood, thereby transforming the landscape of cancer care. This review describes the clinical impact, technological innovations, and recent evidence surrounding the integration of ctDNA and exosome analysis in cancer monitoring. Through early detection, real-time treatment response assessment, and the tracking of minimal residual disease, liquid biopsies have redefined the standards of precision oncology. Key advancements in ctDNA analysis, such as high-throughput sequencing and digital PCR, empower the detection of actionable mutations with high sensitivity. Concurrently, the characterization of exosomal cargo, facilitated by next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry, unveils the molecular nuances of tumors. Recent studies underscore the utility of these approaches, demonstrating their efficacy in predicting relapse, guiding therapeutic decisions, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. As the field continues to evolve, liquid biopsies hold promise not only as diagnostic tools but also as agents of personalized medicine, enabling precise navigation of the intricate landscape of cancer with minimally invasiveness.}

abstract = {Gualou-Xiebai-Banxia decoction (GXB) is a famous classical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD, namely chest stuffiness and pain syndrome in Chinese medicine). Compared with Gualou-Xiebai-Baijiu decoction, which only consists of Trichosanthis Pericarpium (TP), Allii Macrostemonis Bulbus (AMB) and wine, GXB comprises one additional herbal medicine, Pinellinae Rhizoma Praeparatum (PRP). However, due to a lack of kinetic profile studies on GXB, its in vivo components with high exposure remain unknown, making it difficult to interpret bioactive components likely linked to its efficacy, but also fails to provide substance-related evidence for reflecting the compatibility in GXB. The goal of this study was to systematically characterize the kinetic features of GXB in rat plasma and intestine content for revealing its in vivo high-exposure components on the basis of their metabolic fates, and to compare the kinetic differences between GXB and GXB-dePRP (GXB deducted PRP) for describing the chemical contribution of PRP to the compatibility in GXB. Firstly, the metabolic profile of GXB was systematically investigated by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS. Subsequently, quantitative methods for representative xenobiotics in rat plasma and intestine content were respectively validated and developed by UPLC-TQ-MS. Then, the established approaches were successfully applied to characterize the kinetic features of GXB through estimating pharmacokinetic parameters. These results showed that only a few kinds of xenobiotics at low exposure levels were observed in plasma, while various xenobiotics possessed high exposure in intestine content. Among them, steroidal saponins and triterpenoid saponins displayed relatively high exposure in plasma and intestine content, which are likely associated with the therapeutic effects of GXB. Moreover, there were no significant differences between metabolic profiles of GXB and GXB-dePRP, whereas the pharmacokinetic parameters, including area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) and Cmax (p < 0.05) for most xenobiotics in GXB were significantly larger than those in GXB-dePRP, implying that the introduction of PRP improved the bioavailability of constituents from TP and AMB. Altogether, this study laid a solid foundation and provided theoretical guidance for further clarification of bioactive components of GXB, as well as the synergistic effect of PRP to the compatibility in GXB.}

Due to stringent legal restrictions, the cannabis plant's therapeutic potential has long been untapped. The discovery of the body's endocannabinoid system and the legalization of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes have drawn more attention to studying the variety of phytoconstituents and have provided a new avenue for understanding their potential for therapeutic benefit in both humans and animals. Cannabis-based therapies are still in their infancy in veterinary care. The majority of the research on cannabinoid usage in veterinary medicine is based on small-scale clinical investigations and case reports. Therefore, to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness, standardize the species-specific doses, create evidence-based dosing regimens, assess therapeutic concentration in plasma, interaction with other drugs, and safety concerns of the phytoconstituents of the cannabis plant, more randomized controlled trials with large population sizes are warranted.}

The current pill dispenser has limitations when it comes to administering medication before and after food, doesn't take into account over- and under-dosing situations, and doesn't send notifications to the relevant medical entities when the weight of the pills falls below the threshold. Despite the availability of numerous techniques and methods for automating the delivery of pills, there is no assistive method for the timely and secure delivery of medication. The suggested architecture provides EVIP with five crucial capabilities that aren't present in any of the current pill dispensers in an integrated way. In this paper, we present a biometric sensor-based secure access method for medication kits. The right person is only allowed access to the kit based on the finger print scanner. Second, the suggested architecture provides a self-managed and patient-centric service through assisted and automatic medication delivery. The third feature of this paper is the design method for the efficient delivery of pills before and after meals. A method of alerting the medical entities whenever a medication is over or under dosed is a fourth feature of the system. As a fifth feature, the implementation also automatically notifies the pharmacist and doctor when the weight of the pill strips in the chamber falls below the threshold value. Through the use of an integrated Timely Assistance Messaging (TAM) algorithm, all five features are implemented in the suggested architecture. A finger print recognition system is included with VGG-16 deep neural network with image enhancement. The EVIP can use this proposed system in residences, medical facilities, and retirement communities.}

abstract = {Background
The Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) was implemented to minimise the circulation of falsified medicines in the legal pharmaceutical supply chain. Whilst pharmacists are involved in the final step of the FMD requirements with the decommissioning of medicines at the point of supply to patients, limited research has been conducted to investigate the impact of fulfilling these requirements on the relevant stakeholders.
Objective
To examine community pharmacists' views on how the FMD has affected their practice.
Methods
An online survey was disseminated via email in June 2020 to pharmacists in Ireland (n = 4727), who were invited to participate if practising full time or part time in community pharmacies. Quantitative data were captured through multiple option and Likert-scale questions, and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data were captured by use of a free-text box, with the open comments analysed thematically.
Results
In total, 618 valid responses were received (13.1% response rate). Most perceived that FMD requirements increased waiting times for patients (82%) and reduced time interacting with patients (65%). Only 28% agreed/strongly agreed that the introduction of the FMD legislation improves patient safety. In the open comments, the need for medicine authentication was acknowledged, but it was believed that this should be the wholesalers' responsibility, not pharmacists' responsibility. The additional step of medicines decommissioning was viewed as a time-consuming distraction to clinical checks that increased the risk for error. Pharmacists complained that they were not remunerated for the lost staff productivity or the additional software and equipment costs. Many pharmacists felt that the increased workload was disproportionate to the small risk of patients receiving falsified medicines.
Conclusions
Key stakeholder engagement is required to optimise the implementation and integration of the FMD procedures into community pharmacy practice with minimal impact on dispensing and without compromising patient care.}

A total of 69 sesquiterpenoids were identified by UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap MS, of which 17 compounds were isolated. By integrating multiple databases, 91 overlapping protein targets were found between A. argyi sesquiterpenes and COVID-19, and 7 core targets and major signaling pathways for disease treatment were suggested. The techniques of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) infection, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have shown that some compounds in A. argyi can effectively inhibit PsV infection and the activities of Mpro and RBD and exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the secretion of NO. Molecular docking further confirmed the binding ability of these compounds to the corresponding proteins. It was found that Compound 10 (Achillinin C) could significantly inhibit the infection of PsV at a concentration of 14.85 μM, showing an anti-inflammatory effect and no obvious cytotoxicity to a variety of cells at this concentration. The study concludes that A. argyi holds promise as a natural treatment for COVID-19, offering multiple sesquiterpenoids with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings provide a solid foundation for future research on traditional Chinese medicine for epidemic prevention.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Monoclonal antibody (mAb) and Fc-fusion protein (FcP) are highly effective therapeutic biologics. We aimed to analyse consumption and expenditure trends in 14 Asia-Pacific countries/regions (APAC) and three benchmark countries (the UK, Canada, and the US).
Methods
We analysed 440 mAb and FcP biological products using the IQVIA-MIDAS global sales database. For each year between 2010 and 2020 inclusive, we used standard units (SU) sold per 1000 population and manufacture level price (standardised in 2019 US dollars) to evaluate consumption (accessibility) and expenditure (affordability). Changes of consumption and expenditure were estimated using compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Correlations between consumption, country's economic and health performance indicators were measured using Spearman correlation coefficient.
Findings
Between 2010 and 2020, CAGRs of consumption in each region ranged from 7% to 34% and the CAGRs of expenditure ranged from 9% to 31%. The median consumption of biologics was extremely low in lower-middle-income economies (0·29 SU/1000 population) compared with upper-middle-income economies (1·20), high-income economies (40·94) and benchmark countries (109·55), although the median CAGRs of biologics consumption in lower-middle-income economies (31%) was greater than upper-middle-income (14%), high-income economies (13%) and benchmark countries (9%). Consumption was correlated with GDP per capita [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) = 0·75, p < 0·001], health expenditure as a percentage of total (r = 0·83, p < 0·001) and medical doctors’ density (r = 0·85, p < 0·001).
Interpretation
There have been significant increases in mAb and FcP biologics consumption and expenditure, however accessibility of biological medicines remains unequal and is largely correlated with country's income level.
Funding
This research was funded by NHMRC Project Grant GNT1157506 and GNT1196900; Enhanced Start-up Fund for new academic staff and Internal Research Fund, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong.}

abstract = {In recent years, liver fibrosis has become a hot research topic in the field of liver disease. Liver fibrosis is a healing response to trauma, it is not an independent disease, any liver injury is often accompanied by fibrosis, clinically there are many causes of liver fibrosis, such as viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver, fatty liver, autoimmune hepatitis and cholestatic hepatitis. The main pathological feature is the abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to the formation of fibrous scarring. Under physiological conditions, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are in an inactive state and behave as quiescent cells, which are involved in the storage of vitamin A in the liver. When liver injury occurs, inflammatory mediators activate quiescent HSC to differentiate into myofibroblasts, which initiate tissue remodeling in the liver by secreting ECM proteins and matrix metalloproteinases. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is the most important fibrogenic factor identified, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is the most effective factor in stimulating HSC proliferation, differentiation and migration. PDGF receptors and ligands are upregulated in both experimental liver fibrosis models and human liver fibrosis disease. The development of liver fibrosis is a dynamic process, and the mechanism of its occurrence is very complex. Besides being related to astrocytes and cytokines, there are some other intricate factors, and the current studies cannot fully elucidate the mechanism. MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated angiogenesis plays an important role in the development of liver fibrosis, and it has been shown that several miRNA molecules can modulate these targets to regulate angiogenesis and thus liver fibrosis. In addition, TCM can be used to treat liver fibrosis by modulating miRNA molecules and thereby regulating angiogenesis. Chinese medicine has the advantages of multi-target, good efficacy, low price and high safety, and it has a very broad prospect and in-depth exploration value in the study of the effect and mechanism of action of liver fibrosis treatment.}

To improve the evaluation of the guideline, surveys were sent by the senior author and the WSS to approximately 800 sleep doctors around the world to query the availability of OSA treatments in their respective region. The task force and the WSS guidelines committee endorsed the AASM’s CPAP guidelines with respect to the indications for PAP therapy, utilization of different PAP modalities, and concurrent strategies to improve outcomes, noting appropriate caveats for universal applicability.}

abstract = {Objective
To report on long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) experience and continuation rates in the Adolescent Medicine LARC Collaborative.
Study design
LARC insertion data (682 implants and 681 intrauterine devices [IUDs]) were prospectively collected from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, across 3 Adolescent Medicine practices. Follow-up data through December 31, 2020, were included to ensure at least 1 year of follow-up of this cohort. Continuation rates were calculated at 1, 2, and 3 years, overall and by Adolescent Medicine site, as were descriptive statistics for LARC procedural complications and patient experience.
Results
Implant and IUD insertion complications were uncommon and largely self-limited, with no IUD-related uterine perforations. Uterine bleeding was the most frequently reported concern at follow-up (35% implant, 25% IUD), and a common reason for early device removal (45% of implant removals, 32% of IUD removals). IUD malposition or expulsion occurred following 6% of all insertions. The pooled implant continuation rate at 1 year was 87% (range, 86%-91% across sites; P = .63), 66% at 2 years (range, 62%-84%; P = .01), and 42% at 3 years (range, 36%-60%; P = .004). The pooled IUD continuation rate at 1 year was 88% (range, 87%-90% across sites; P = .82), 77% at 2 years (range, 76%-78%; P = .94), and 60% at 3 years (range, 57%-62%; P = .88).
Conclusions
LARC is successfully provided in Adolescent Medicine clinical settings, with continuation rates analogous to those of well-resourced clinical trials. Uterine bleeding after LARC insertion is common, making counselling imperative. Future analyses will assess whether the medical management of LARC-related nuisance bleeding improves continuation rates in our Adolescent Medicine patient population.}

abstract = {Background
Many researchers have investigated the use of Chinese herbs to delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through their effects on colonic microflora and microbiota-derived metabolites. However, whether FuZhengHuaYuJiangZhuTongLuo (FZHY) has effects that are similar to those of AST-120 on CKD needs to be elucidated.
Methods
In this study, we compared the effects of FZHY and AST-120 on the colonic microbiota and plasma metabolites in the CKD rat model. We developed a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced CKD rat model and then administered FZHY and AST-120 to these model rats. Non-targeted metabolomic LC-MS analysis, 16S rRNA sequencing, and histopathological staining were performed on plasma, stool, and kidney tissues, respectively, and the joint correlation between biomarkers and metabolites of candidate bacteria was analyzed.
Results
Our results showed that administering FZHY and AST-120 effectively ameliorated UUO-induced abnormal renal function and renal fibrosis and regulated the composition of microbiota and metabolites. Compared to the UUO model group, the p_Firmicutes and o_Peptostreptococcales_Tissierellales were increased, while 14 negative ion metabolites were upregulated and 21 were downregulated after FZHY treatment. Additionally, 40 positive ion metabolites were upregulated and 63 were downregulated. On the other hand, AST-120 treatment resulted in an increase in the levels of g_Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group and f_Prevotellaceae, as well as 12 upregulated and 23 downregulated negative ion metabolites and 56 upregulated and 63 downregulated positive ion metabolites. Besides, FZHY increased the levels of candidate bacterial biomarkers that were found to be negatively correlated with some poisonous metabolites, such as 4-hydroxyretinoic acid, and positively correlated with beneficial metabolites, such as l-arginine. AST-120 increased the levels of candidate bacterial biomarkers that were negatively correlated with some toxic metabolites, such as glycoursodeoxycholic acid, 4-ethylphenol, and indole-3-acetic acid.
Conclusion
FZHY and AST-120 effectively reduced kidney damage, in which, the recovery of some dysregulated bacteria and metabolites are probably involved. As their mechanisms of regulation were different, FZHY might play a complementary role to AST-120 in treating CKD.}

abstract = {Background
Herpes simplex virus type-1 and type-2 cause a viral disease named Herpes. Genital herpes is mainly caused by HSV-2 with symptoms of painful and itchy blisters on the vagina, cervix, buttocks, anus, penis, or inner thighs with blisters that rupture and convert into sores. The homeopathic remedy Rhus Tox has been widely used to treat herpes and has shown in vitro anti-inflammatory effects in previous studies.
Purpose
The presented review focuses on relapses and harmful effects caused by acyclovir in modern medicine and the probable antiherpetic activity of Rhus Tox on HSV infection based on its pathophysiology, preclinical findings, on primary cultured mouse chondrocytes, mouse cell line MC3T3e1 and a comparative study of Natrum Mur with Rhus Tox on HSV infection.
Study design
The design of the study focuses mainly on the descriptive data available in various literature articles.
Method
Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline and ScienceDirect were used to search the articles. Articles are selected from 1994 to 2022 focusing solely on the competence of Rhus Tox against herpes. Keywords used for the study are antiviral, Herpes, Rhus Tox, in vitro and homeopathy.
Results
The review includes fifteen articles, including 4 full-text articles on HSV, 6 in vitro studies of homeopathic compounds performed on the herpes virus, and 5 articles based on the pathophysiology and effects of Rhus tox. The review article proposes the anti-inflammatory and antiviral action of the homeopathic remedy Rhus Tox which can be used in crisis conditions when the physician doubts the simillimum, as it prevents further outbreaks of HSV infection.
Conclusion
The homeopathic medicine Rhus Tox has no cytotoxicity observed under in vitro conditions and can be used to treat herpes infection. Further studies are needed to confirm the results under in vitro and in vivo conditions as well as in clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background
Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most widely used antitumor drugs. However, continuous DOX treatment would cause crucial cardiotoxicity side effect, accompanied with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitochondrial functions and increased cardiomyocyte death. Sheng-Mai-San (SMS), a traditional Chinese medicine widely used for cardiovascular diseases, has been clinically used to counteract cardiotoxicity of DOX, yet the underlying mechanism is largely unknown.
Methods
We utilized JC-1 assay to examine the effects of SMS and its components under DOX treatment in rat cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells), and further investigated the functional mechanisms of active components in SMS formula via transcriptome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis and molecular experiments.
Results
We identified three functional components of SMS in protecting cardiomyocytes from DOX-induced damages and revealed the coordinated regulatory mechanisms of these components, namely ginsenoside Rh2 (Rh2), Ophiopogonin D (OpD) and Schisandrin B (SchB). We found that Rh2 mainly acts to restore mitochondrial functions and to decrease ROS generation by enhancing fatty acid metabolism and antioxidant activity, OpD has assistive roles in mitochondrial function repair, and SchB mainly functions by inhibiting cell death, as well as activating cytoskeleton and ECM organization.
Conclusion
This study provides supporting evidence for the clinical application of SMS to reduce the cardiotoxicity effects of DOX treatment, and also sheds light for the mechanistic studies of traditional Chinese medicine.}

Patients hospitalized in internal medicine are frequently malnourished or at risk for malnutrition. The aim of this study, conducted by the Federation of Associations of Hospital Internists (FADOI) and the Italian Society of Artificial Nutrition and Metabolism (SINPE) was to assess the nutritional management of internal medicine inpatients in Italy, to identify critical issues and formulate practical proposals to improve nutritional treatment.
Methods
From February to April 2021, FADOI and SINPE conducted a national web-based survey, including a 13 multiple-choice item questionnaire related to three key areas: screening and assessment of malnutrition and associated/overlapping sarcopenia and dysphagia; specialist consultations; and management of nutritional support.
Results
Responding to the questionnaire were 266 physicians among FADOI members (10.76%). Screening for malnutrition is performed with validated tests, within standardized care pathways, or routinely, only by 22% of participants. Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition criteria for diagnosis of malnutrition are little used (20%). Screening for sarcopenia was insufficient as the systematic use of assessment tools (handgrip/chair test) was minimal (3%). Screening for dysphagia is not a routine procedure for at-risk patients according to 33% of participants. Systematic involvement of clinical nutrition services/units in the management of malnourished/sarcopenic patients was reported by only 17% of internists.
Conclusions
To overcome the critical issues that emerged from the present study, FADOI and SINPE experts proposed practical solutions to promote the application of the most recent guidelines and to improve awareness and sensitivity to nutritional management in internal medicine real-life settings.}

The financial burden on patients is driven by the direct costs of PM for patients and their caretakers, indirect costs while seeking specialized care at high-end setups, and the potential impact on patient outcomes and quality of life, especially while dealing with the after effects of surprise diagnoses. The financial burden on payers and healthcare systems is driven by the impact of high costs on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as the costs associated with providing specialized care and infrastructure for PM. In this chapter, we aim to provide a succinct definition of PM, highlight the importance of personalized approaches to medicine in healthcare, and provide a brief overview of the financial burden of PM. We also underscore the implications for the future of healthcare associated with the potential benefits of PM on healthcare outcomes, challenges of implementing PM on a larger scale, and various strategies for addressing the financial burden of PM and discuss the future directions for research and policy in PM and healthcare finance.}

Children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup is an herbal preparation from a lifetime professor, famous old Chinese doctor, and postgraduate supervisor of medical doctor of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. This herbal preparation promotes lung health, relieves cough, reduces phlegm, and benefits pharynx.
Aim of the study
To verify the clinical efficacy and safety of Zibei Xuanfei syrup for children in treatment of acute trachea bronchitis with wind-heat invading lung syndrome.
Materials and methods
This was an age-stratified, block randomized, double-blind, extremely low dose parallel control, multi-center clinical trial. A total of 453 pediatric patients diagnosed with acute tracheal bronchitis in Western medicine and cough due to exogenous factors with wind-heat invading lung syndrome in Chinese medicine were enrolled. They were divided into three subgroups based on age 1∼3, 4–7, and 8–14 years old, and randomly assigned to children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup and extremely low doses of children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup (control) in a 3:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the decreased values of cough Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score after 7 days of administration. Secondary outcomes included a decrease in cough VAS score after 3 and 5 days of the administration, and the total score of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) syndrome after 3, 5, and 7 days of treatment. The chest X-ray and blood C-reactive protein were examined during screening. The safety assessment included blood urine, and stool routine, liver and kidney function of laboratory tests, and an electrocardiogram at the screening and the last visit.
Results
The subjects of two groups had high administration adherence (completion over 80%) (299/323, 92.6% in children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup group vs 103/107, 96.3% in the control group; p > 0.05). The children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup group was significantly better than the control group in the decreased values of cough VAS score after 7 days of administration(6.35 ± 3.45 vs 3.73 ± 3.98, p < 0.001). The subgroup analysis of the decreased value of cough VAS scores aged 1–3 years old were 5.80 ± 3.43 vs 3.75 ± 4.38 (P = 0.003), 4–7 years old was 6.30 ± 3.69 vs 2.73 ± 3.65 (P < 0.001), and 8–14 years old were 6.91 ± 3.12 vs 4.69 ± 3.75(P = 0.001)respectively. The secondary outcomes decrease values of cough VAS score of children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup group vs control group after 5 days of administration were 5.88 ± 2.90 vs 3.55 ± 3.41(P < 0.001), after 3 days of administration were 3.61 ± 2.53 vs 2.43 ± 2.56 (P < 0.001). The effective rate of the TCM symptom total score of children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup group vs control group was 91.38% vs 54.95%after 7 days of the administration, 86.93% vs 50.94% after 5 days of the administration, and 64.78% vs 40.19% after 3 days administration(each p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in Adverse Event between the two groups (59/331, 17.82% vs 15/111, 13.51%, P > 0.05). The children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup group had 5 Serious Adverse Events (incidence rate 1.21%), all of which were unrelated to the trial drug.
Conclusion
Children's Zibei Xuanfei syrup appears to be extremely effective and safe in the treatment of acute trachea bronchitis with wind-heat invading lung syndrome. Future studies with large sample sizes will need to collect more safety data use for children.}

abstract = {Background
Orbital compartment syndrome is a potentially blinding eye condition. Timely diagnosis and treatment are paramount to optimize visual outcomes. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis is the definitive management and a required competency for emergency physicians and ophthalmologists. Lack of confidence in the procedure can result in delayed treatment and poor outcomes.
Objectives
Our aim was to create a low-cost, realistic, simulation model to ensure trainees were confident in performing lateral canthotomy and cantholysis.
Methods
A model was created using equipment found in the emergency department. This model's efficacy was assessed using pre- and post-teaching questionnaires measuring learner's self-perceived confidence.
Results
Forty-seven emergency medicine and 18 ophthalmology registrars rated their confidence in the procedure using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not very confident, 5 = extremely confident); 42% (n = 27) of participants felt ‘quite confident’ (4 on Likert scale) in carrying out the procedure unsupervised out of hours after the teaching session, compared with 9.23% (n = 6) before (p < 0.01). Our model resulted in significant increases in all three measures of confidence (diagnosing orbital compartment syndrome, locating the necessary equipment and performing canthotomy and cantholysis) and was rated as 4.35 (1 = not at all helpful, 5 = extremely helpful) in understanding the anatomy of the region. Sixty-six percent (n = 43) of participants stated they would like further simulation teaching.
Conclusions
Our model is low cost, easy to assemble, and anatomically correct. The user can ‘strum’ the inferior canthal tendon without cutting the lower lid, appreciating the difference between canthotomy and cantholysis. Use of this model significantly increased the number of learners who felt “quite confident” with performing the procedure. Use of this model should be considered for trainees in ophthalmology and emergency medicine.}

The prevalence of PD is increasing every year, the pathogenesis is complex, and the current treatment is ineffective. Therefore, it has become imperative to find effective drugs for PD. With the advantages of low cost, high safety and high biological activity, Chinese medicine has great advantages in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review systematically summarizes the potential of Chinese medicine for the treatment of PD, showing that Chinese medicine can exert anti-PD effects through various pathways, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways, reducing mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress and iron death, and regulating intestinal flora. These mainly involve HMGB1/TLR4, PI3K/Akt, NLRP3/ caspase-1/IL-1β, Nrf2/HO-1, SIRT1/Akt1, PINK1/parkin, Bcl-2/Bax, BDNF-TrkB and other signaling pathways. In sum, based on modern phytochemistry, pharmacology and genomic proteomics, Chinese medicine is likely to be a potential candidate for PD treatment, which requires more clinical trials to further elucidate its importance in the treatment of PD.}

A three-step group decision-making mechanism is proposed for the CHM problem. First, an analytical method based on interval evidence reasoning is formed to unify different forms of information into the same interval belief structure. Next, a model based on the geometric area method is formed to obtain the weights of the attributes. Third, the extended interval regret theory is used to rank the alternative solutions. Applying perceived utility value and the ranking of the alternatives, an optimal solution for planting CHM is found. Comparative and sensitivity analyses highlight the flexibility and reliability of the suggested solution. By evaluating the various parameters, decision-makers in CHM can prioritize their decisions for maximal benefit.}

abstract = {Purpose
The goal of stratified medicine is to identify subgroups of patients with similar disease mechanisms and specific responses to treatments. To prepare for stratified clinical trials, genome-wide genetic analysis should occur across clinical areas to identify undiagnosed genetic diseases and new genetic causes of disease.
Methods
To advance genetically stratified medicine, we have developed and implemented broad exome sequencing infrastructure and research protocols at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.
Results
We enrolled 4889 adult and pediatric probands and identified a primary result in 572 probands. The cohort was phenotypically and demographically heterogeneous because enrollment occurred across multiple specialty clinics (eg, epilepsy, nephrology, fetal anomaly). New gene-disease associations and phenotypic expansions were discovered across clinical specialties.
Conclusion
Our study processes have enabled the enrollment and exome sequencing/analysis of a phenotypically and demographically diverse cohort of patients within 1 tertiary care medical center. Because all genomic data are stored centrally with permission for longitudinal access to the electronic medical record, subjects can be recontacted with updated genetic diagnoses or for participation in future genotype-based clinical trials. This infrastructure has allowed for the promotion of genetically stratified clinical trial readiness within the Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital health care system.}

There were significant differences in medicines abundance and disposal practices between LDS and HDS for solid and liquid medicines. 37.1% of respondents perceived consequences for the poor UEMs disposal, including accidental ingestion (76.6% vs 26.7%), land pollution (69.6% vs 36.7%), water pollution (72.4% vs 32.8%) and toxicity (58.3% vs 32.8%), respectively in LDS and HDS. Respondents’ good knowledge and positive attitudes contrasted with poor UEMs disposal practices, which compromise public health.

abstract = {Since the identification of various types of stem cells, the field of stem cell research in cardiovascular medicine has rapidly advanced. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were the first type of somatic stem cells to be discovered and have been relatively well characterized. The increasing global demand for myocardial infarction recovery methods has led to growing interest in BMSCs, which are known for their ability to differentiate and their paracrine effect on recovery. Paracrine cytokines and microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from BMSCs, their derivative vesicles, and exosomes have been shown to assist in cardiac repair. Vesicles and exosomes contain cytokines and miRNAs, which can either positively or negatively affect cardiac repair. Consequently, these vesicles and exosomes have garnered substantial interest as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiac diseases. Stem cell regulation is significantly influenced by stem cell niches and chemokines. Additionally, inflammatory cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, play a crucial role in the healing of damaged tissues. The contribution of these inflammatory cells goes beyond activation of inflammation, as they also play a role in regulating the repair process. This has implications as a potential therapeutic target. This chapter provides an overview of stem cells and their role in cardiovascular medicine and biology. Inflammation in the lungs triggered by monocrotaline and hypoxia which induce pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), activates inflammatory cells and chemokines, particularly stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1, also known as CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)12, and its receptor CXC motif Chemokine Receptor (CXCR)4. Previously, we documented the efficacy of the CXCR4 inhibitor, silibinin, in this rat PAH model. The presence of more CXCR4+/CD14+ monocytes/macrophages/neutrophils in cultured bone marrow cells after silibinin treatment implies the participation of these cells in the effect of silibinin on PAH repair, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the involvement of SDF-1/CXCR4 in the communication between inflammatory cells and stem/progenitor cells was explored.}

We have previously reported the usefulness of FC in a undergraduate 'Kampo Medicine (traditional Japanese medicine)' mandatory course, conducted in 2015. However, it was a pilot study and the results were based only on students' subjective evaluations. Therefore, in this study, we have developed the FC program, and implemented FC, and compared it with TC. In the annual year 2018 (AY 2018), the common cold class was implemented as FC model and the women's health class as TC; in AY 2019, all classes were implemented as TC. Between the cohorts, we compared subjective outcomes, as well as objective outcomes. Among the subjective evaluations, the explanatory ability of Kampo characteristics, indications and pharmacological effects were significantly higher in the FC than that in TC. Also, the knowledge retention was higher in FC. Objective evaluation showed that both class attendance and exam scores were significantly higher in FC. The FC model developed in this study has been shown to be effective, however, we planned the further study with multiple institutions in near future.}

abstract = {Membrane technology is a viable alternative to many conventional methods currently used to process traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, membrane fouling is a significant obstacle to the application of membrane technology in TCM. In this study, the ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling from TCM water extracts under constant transmembrane pressure (TMP) and constant flux operation was studied in connection with critical and threshold flux determinations. Meanwhile, the physicochemical foulant–membrane interactions were analyzed using the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. At constant TMP operation, the high pressure resulted in a rapid drop in permeate flux at the start of the filtration period, but the steady-state fluxes did not increase significantly with an increase in TMP. At constant flux operation, the TMP increased somewhat when the permeate flux was below the threshold flux. Fouling was severe above the threshold flux, and the TMP rapidly increased. By displaying fouling resistance as a function of permeate volume, the constant flux operation was compared to a constant TMP operation beginning at the same flux imposed during the constant flux operation. Below the threshold flux, fouling resistance was similar for constant TMP and constant flux operations. However, above the threshold flux, fouling resistance under constant flux operation was much greater than fouling resistance under constant TMP operation. The results of physicochemical interactions showed that there are attractive interactions between hydrophobic membrane and foulants in the TCM water extracts. These interactions should be considered a key factor leading to serious membrane fouling.}

A recent global innovation of guideline development methodology is the proposal of a rapid recommendation framework for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has the potential to add value to the translation of evidence to practice for TCM interventions. Up to now, more than 180 rapid recommendations have been published, but none of them is pertaining to TCM interventions. Due to the nature of multi-dimensional evidence sources for TCM interventions, including classical randomized controlled trials and real world evidence, a more sophisticated methodological approach to synthesize and evaluate the totality of evidence about effects of TCM interventions is required. Therefore, appropriate modification to the rapid recommendation framework is necessary. In the efforts to respond to these needs, we have proposed a specific approach to developing rapid recommendations for TCM interventions the Multi-dimensional Evidence Synthesis, Evaluation and Recommendations for TCM interventions (MESERT).}

Post-infectious cough (PIC) is a respiratory disease with high incidence. It belongs to subacute cough and accounts for as much as 40%–50%. Cough is the main clinical manifestation of PIC. PIC seriously affects people's life quality because of complex etiology, long-term course of disease, treatment difficulties and other characteristics. Western medicines are based on the principle of symptomatic treatment, so they are often difficult to control PIC fundamentally. These factors could due to that PIC is prolonged and unable to heal repeatedly. TCMs have obvious advantages in treating PIC, with accurate curative effects, less side effects and adverse reactions and are effective in improving PIC-related symptoms and indicators, enhancing patients' life quality and reducing pain. TCMs, guided by holistic concept and syndrome differentiation, advocate determine treatment on the basis of pattern types, and have remarkable clinical treatment effects. As for TCMs etiology, pathogenesis and syndrome types of PIC, TCM scholars have not yet reached a unified standard. However, most of them think that wind pathogen can cause PIC alone, or it can be combined with other evils, which might be the main mechanism of PIC. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of TCMs in PIC treatment from etiology, pathogenesis, distribution of syndrome types and treatment of TCMs. This article focuses on the treatment methods and pharmacodynamic material basis of wind pathogen, providing ideas in treating PIC of TCMs clinically and innovative drug development.}

Monomeric compounds from traditional Chinese medicine own various biological activities and high safety. They play a broad part in treating diseases and is also a candidate drug for preventing and treating PF.

These monomeric compounds can attenuate inflammatory response, oxidative stress, epithelial mesenchymal transformation and other processes of lung through many signaling pathways, and inhibit the activation and differentiation of fibroblasts, thus contributing to the treatment of PF.

Most of common online process analytical technologies are based on spectroscopy, making the identification and quantification of specific ingredients still a challenge. Herein, we developed a quality control (QC) system for monitoring TCM pharmaceuticals based on paper spray ionization miniature mass spectrometry (mini-MS). It enabled real-time online qualitative and quantitative detection of target ingredients in herbal extracts using mini-MS without chromatographic separation for the first time. Dynamic changes of alkaloids in Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi) during decoction were used as examples, and the scientific principle of Fuzi compatibility was also investigated. Finally, the system was verified to work stably at the hourly level for pilot-scale extraction. This mini-MS based online analytical system is expected to be further developed for QC applications in a wider range of pharmaceutical processes.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Guidelines recommend routine frailty screening for all hospitalised older adults to inform care decisions, based mainly on studies in elective or speciality-specific settings. However, most hospital bed days are accounted for by acute non-elective admissions, in which the prevalence and prognostic value of frailty might differ, and uptake of screening is limited. We therefore did a systematic review and meta-analysis of frailty prevalence and outcomes in unplanned hospital admissions.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL up to 31/01/2023 and included observational studies using validated frailty measures in adult hospital-wide or general medicine admissions. Summary data on the prevalence of frailty and associated outcomes, measurement tools, study setting (hospital-wide vs general medicine), and design (prospective vs retrospective) were extracted and risk of bias assessed (modified Joanna Briggs Institute checklists). Unadjusted relative risks (RR; moderate/severe frailty vs no/mild) for mortality (within one year), length of stay (LOS), discharge destination and readmission were calculated and pooled, where appropriate, using random-effects models. PROSPERO CRD42021235663.
Findings
Among 45 cohorts (median/SD age = 80/5 years; n = 39,041,266 admissions, n = 22 measurement tools) moderate/severe frailty ranged from 14.3% to 79.6% overall (and in the 26 cohorts with low-moderate risk of bias) with considerable heterogeneity between studies (phet < 0.001) preventing pooling of results but with rates <25% in only 3 cohorts. Moderate/severe vs no/mild frailty was associated with increased mortality (n = 19 cohorts; RR range = 1.08–3.70), more consistently among cohorts using clinically administered tools (n = 11; RR range = 1.63–3.70; phet = 0.08; pooled RR = 2.53, 95% CI = 2.15–2.97) vs cohorts using (retrospective) administrative coding data (n = 8; RR range = 1.08–3.02; phet < 0.001). Clinically administered tools also predicted increasing mortality across the full range of frailty severity in each of the six cohorts that allowed ordinal analysis (all p < 0.05). Moderate/severe vs no/mild frailty was also associated with a LOS >8 days (RR range = 2.14–3.04; n = 6) and discharge to a location other than home (RR range = 1.97–2.82; n = 4) but was inconsistently related to 30-day readmission (RR range = 0.83–1.94; n = 12). Associations remained clinically significant after adjustment for age, sex and comorbidity where reported.
Interpretation
Frailty is common in older patients with acute, non-elective hospital admission and remains predictive of mortality, LOS and discharge home with more severe frailty associated with greater risk, justifying more widespread implementation of screening using clinically administered tools.

However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effects of TCM are not fully understood, especially on cellular metabolic reprogramming. In this review, we summarize the role of glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism in cancer metastasis, which is key in cancer cells and tumor micro-environment (TME) cell metabolism. Furthermore, we reviewed the potential mechanisms by which, most bioactive TCM compounds suppress cancer metastasis by regulating metabolic reprogramming and the possibility of sensitizing other anti-tumor drugs. TCM and its bioactive compounds have huge prospects for clinical application in the treatment of cancer metastasis. Unfortunately, little is currently known about the regulatory effects of Chinese herbal medicines and their bioactive compounds on the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and the combination therapy for cancers. This review provides novel insights into the regulation of metabolic reprogramming by TCM in combination with other anti-tumor drugs against cancer metastasis and the possibility of becoming sensitizers for other anti-tumor drugs.}

abstract = {Background
Pudam is one of the manufacturing processes used extensively in preparing parpam and chenduram in the Siddha healthcare system. The scientific understanding of the process is not fully understood.
Objective
In this work, our objective was to investigate the temperature and pressure profile of the pudam process and also to understand the porous nature and low thermal conductivity of the sealed agal (Earthen vessel) used by replicating the traditional manufacturing process of Padigara parpam medicine in a pit.
Materials and methods
The temperature and pressure profiles were recorded. The size and mass of the cow dung cakes required to conduct the pudam process were discussed. The agal's porosity, thermal conductivity, and thermal diffusivity were experimentally determined. The pressure test of an empty agal was performed in an electric kiln and a pit to find the pressure development inside it and understand the sealed agal's role.
Results
The maximum temperature of the pudam process was recorded as 807 °C, and the maximum heating and maximum cooling rate were calculated to be 30 °C/min and 8 °C/min, respectively. The holding time was found to be 66 min above 600 °C and 51 min above 700 °C. The maximum pressure built during the pudam process was 8.2 mbar.
Conclusion
The test results indicate that the bottom location of the sealed agal is the optimum place to record the temperature of a pudam process. The sealed agal does not allow pressure to build inside, and the pudam process can be considered a heating process that occurs at atmospheric pressure. Increasing the quantity of cow dung cakes for the exact size of the sealed agal and pit increases the raw material's temperature and holding time and reduces the maximum heating rate.}

abstract = {The use of biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications has increased dramatically over recent years. However, the clinical uptake of a wide variety of biomaterials remains limited due to adverse effects commonly exhibited by patients, which are caused by the host immune response. Despite this, current in vitro evaluation standards (ISO-10993) for assessing the host response to biomaterials have limitations in predicting the likelihood of in vivo biomaterial acceptance. Furthermore, endotoxin contamination of biomaterials is rarely considered, despite its ability to significantly affect the performance of biomaterials and engineered tissues. This review highlights the importance of the immune response to biomaterials and discusses existing challenges and opportunities in the development and standardised assessment of the immune response to biomaterials, including the importance of endotoxin levels. In addition, the properties of biomaterials that impact the host immune response and the exploitation of immunomodulatory biomaterials in regenerative medicine are explored. Finally, a standardised in vitro pathway of evaluating the immune response to biomaterials (hydrogels) and their regenerative potential is proposed, aiming to ensure safety and consistency, while reducing costs and the use of animals in the biomaterials research for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
Statement of significance
This review presents a critical analysis of the role of the interactions between the immune system and biomaterials in determining the therapeutic success of biomaterial-based approaches. No such review addressing the lack of understanding of biomaterial-immune system interactions during the developmental and pre-clinical stages of biomaterials, including the impact of the endotoxin levels of biomaterials on the immune response, is published. As there is a lack of in vitro regulations to evaluate the immune response to biomaterials, a standardised in vitro pathway to evaluate the immune response to biomaterials (hydrogels) and their immunomodulatory and regenerative potential for use in tissue engineering/regenerative medicine applications is presented. The aim of the proposed pathway of biomaterial evaluation is to ensure safety and consistency in the biomaterials research community, while reducing costs and animal use (through the concept of the 3R's - reduction, refinement, and replacement of animals).}

Most participants (65 %) had taken liquid dosage forms (e.g., syrups/suspensions) compared to solid dosage forms (34 %). Oral devices most frequently used were oral syringes (42 %), measuring spoons (22 %), and household spoons (18 %), with parents most frequently demonstrating device use to their children. Respiratory devices were used less frequently, and pressurised metered-dose inhalers with/without spacer (pMDIs) were the most commonly used devices (11/13). Instructions on use were provided by healthcare professionals to both caregivers and children. Generally, oral and respiratory devices were considered easy to use and instructions were clear. However, for both oral and respiratory devices, some suggestions for device improvement were provided by participants. Education/training by healthcare professionals and clear supplier instructions (e.g., pictograms) may be especially effective in ensuring that caregivers and children are able to use administration devices appropriately and receive sufficient information on their correct use.}

The mechanism of brain injury is complicated and is a significant cause of disability after ICH. Therefore, it is essential to understand the mechanism of brain injury after ICH to develop drugs to prevent and treat ICH.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Many infancy-onset epilepsies have poor prognosis for seizure control and neurodevelopmental outcome. Ketogenic diets can improve seizures in children older than 2 years and adults who are unresponsive to antiseizure medicines. We aimed to establish the efficacy of a classic ketogenic diet at reducing seizure frequency compared with further antiseizure medicine in infants with drug-resistant epilepsy.
Methods
In this phase 4, open-label, multicentre, randomised clinical trial, infants aged 1–24 months with drug-resistant epilepsy (defined as four or more seizures per week and two or more previous antiseizure medications) were recruited from 19 hospitals in the UK. Following a 1-week or 2-week observation period, participants were randomly assigned using a computer-generated schedule, without stratification, to either a classic ketogenic diet or a further antiseizure medication for 8 weeks. Treatment allocation was masked from research nurses involved in patient care, but not from participants. The primary outcome was the median number of seizures per day, recorded during weeks 6–8. All analyses were by modified intention to treat, which included all participants with available data. Participants were followed for up to 12 months. All serious adverse events were recorded. The trial is registered with the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (2013–002195–40). The trial was terminated early before all participants had reached 12 months of follow-up because of slow recruitment and end of funding.
Findings
Between Jan 1, 2015, and Sept 30, 2021, 155 infants were assessed for eligibility, of whom 136 met inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned; 75 (55%) were male and 61 (45%) were female. 78 infants were assigned to a ketogenic diet and 58 to antiseizure medication, of whom 61 and 47, respectively, had available data and were included in the modifified intention-to-treat analysis at week 8. The median number of seizures per day during weeks 6–8, accounting for baseline rate and randomised group, was similar between the ketogenic diet group (5 [IQR 1–16]) and antiseizure medication group (3 [IQR 2–11]; IRR 1·33, 95% CI 0·84–2·11). A similar number of infants with at least one serious adverse event was reported in both groups (40 [51%] of 78 participants in the ketogenic diet group and 26 [45%] of 58 participants in the antiseizure medication group). The most common serious adverse events were seizures in both groups. Three infants died during the trial, all of whom were randomly assigned a ketogenic diet: one child (who also had dystonic cerebral palsy) was found not breathing at home; one child died suddenly and unexpectedly at home; and one child went into cardiac arrest during routine surgery under anaesthetic. The deaths were judged unrelated to treatment by local principal investigators and confirmed by the data safety monitoring committee.
Interpretation
In this phase 4 trial, a ketogenic diet did not differ in efficacy and tolerability to a further antiseizure medication, and it appears to be safe to use in infants with drug-resistant epilepsy. A ketogenic diet could be a treatment option in infants whose seizures continue despite previously trying two antiseizure medications.

However, this is an inadequate option for women who want to preserve fertility or avoid more extensive surgery. To summarize the medicine and conservative surgery treatment for adenomyosis. An extensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) without language restriction.

There seem to be a number of reasons for this phenomenon, and although the use of next-generation sequencers has resolved some of the past issues, the importance of pathogenicity studies of variants that are identified is growing. To ensure that patients with cardiomyopathy and their relatives can receive precision medicine, the results of genetic analysis linked to clinical information need to be collected, and a database of variants in Japanese people needs to be established.}

abstract = {Objective: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) provides a framework to support clinicians' decision-making processes using the best evidence currently available in the field. The key elements of clinical research can be defined by a framework called PICO, which identifies the sentences in a medical literature text that belong to the four key elements reported in clinical trials: Participants/Problem (P), Intervention (I), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). This study aims to establish an effective detection method for key elements of evidence-based medical research. Methods: Based on the text features of key elements framework, we propose a deep learning model BERTGCN which combined large-scale pretraining model and graph convolution network (GCN) for detecting key elements of evidence-based medicine. In this model, the sentences which are initialized with pre-trained BERT representations and the words in the EBM evidence were recognized as the sentence nodes and word of the graph which were used to train GCN model. At the same time, the sentences were used to fine tune the pretraining model. Results: We tested our proposed approach over PubMed-PICO dataset is a data set containing tens of thousands of EBM key elements extracted from PubMed. The F1-score of P/I/O in the model we proposed reached 91.3%, 85.8% and 90.0% respectively. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the current optimal model. Conclusions: BERTGCN is able to leverage the advantages of both worlds: large-scale pretraining and transudative learning to improve the efficiency of detecting evidence-based medical evidence from research publications.}

This two-paper Series focuses on recent advances and applications of regenerative medicine that could benefit paediatric patients. Innovations in genomic, stem-cell, and tissue-based technologies have created progress in disease modelling and new therapies for congenital and incurable paediatric diseases. Prenatal approaches present unique opportunities associated with substantial biotechnical, medical, and ethical obstacles. Maternal plasma fetal DNA analysis is increasingly adopted as a noninvasive prenatal screening or diagnostic test for chromosomal and monogenic disorders. The molecular basis for cell-free DNA detection stimulated the development of circulating tumour DNA testing for adult cancers. In-utero stem-cell, gene, gene-modified cell (and to a lesser extent, tissue-based) therapies have shown early clinical promise in a wide range of paediatric disorders. Fetal cells for postnatal treatment and artificial placenta for ex-utero fetal therapies are new frontiers in this exciting field.}

abstract = {Background
The holistic view of the ‘The unity of man and nature’ promotes the development and application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Despite the absence of modern pharmacological therapies with robust efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), TCM has exhibited potential utility for treating the disease in clinical practice.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect of TCM treatment intensity (TCMTI) in patients with mild COVID-19. A total of 6120 laboratory-confirmed patients with mild COVID-19 were recruited from temporary isolation facilities. The primary outcome measure was severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid conversion time. In addition, restricted cubic spline models were employed to elucidate nonlinear relationships.
Results
The median age (range) of the study participants was 43.0 (2.0–75.0) years, with a median hospitalization duration of 9.7 (4.1–22.5) days. The median time for achieving SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid negativity was 6.67 days. The restricted cubic spline models revealed a remarkable nonlinear association between TCMTI and the time-to-ribonucleic acid negativity. After adjusting for potential confounders, the high TCMTI group exhibited a markedly shorter median time to SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid negativity and reduced hospitalization duration (P < 0.001) than the low TCMTI group. Moreover, the mean time to achieve SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid negativity was shortened by 1.909 days (P < 0.001) in the high-TCMTI group compared to the low-TCMTI group.
Conclusion
This study suggests that early initiation and intensified use of TCM may accelerate the time required to achieve SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid negativity in patients with COVID-19, bearing considerable implications for public health.}

abstract = {Background
Triphala (TLP), as a Chinese Tibetan medicine composing of Emblica officinalis, Terminalia chebula and Terminalia bellirica (1.2:1.5:1), exhibited hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic and gut microbiota modulatory effects. Nonetheless, its roles in prevention of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the related mechanistic insights involving the interplay of gut microbiota and hepatic inflammation are not known.
Purpose
The present study seeks to determine if TLP would prevent HFD-induced NAFLD in vivo and its underlying mechanisms from the perspectives of gut microbiota, metabolites, and hepatic inflammation.
Methods
TLP was subjected to extraction and chemo-profiling, and in vivo evaluation in HFD-fed rats on hepatic lipid and inflammation, intestinal microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and permeability, and body weight and fat content profiles.
Results
The TLP was primarily constituted of gallic acid, corilagin and chebulagic acid. Orally administered HFD-fed rats with TLP were characterized by the growth of Ligilactobacillus and Akkermansia, and SCFAs (acetic/propionic/butyric acid) secretion which led to increased claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1 expression that reduced the mucosal permeability to migration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into blood and liver. Coupling with hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride lowering actions, the TLP mitigated both inflammatory (ALT, AST, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and pro-inflammatory (TLR4, MYD88 and NF-κB P65) activities of liver, and sequel to histopathological development of NAFLD in a dose-dependent fashion.
Conclusion
TLP is promisingly an effective therapy to prevent NAFLD through modulating gut microbiota, mucosal permeability and SCFAs secretion with liver fat and inflammatory responses.}

abstract = {Summary
Large randomised trials provide the most reliable evidence of effectiveness of new treatments in clinical practice. However, the time and resources required to complete such trials can be daunting. An overarching clinical trial platform focused on a single condition or type of surgery, aiming to compare several treatments, with an option to stop any or add in new treatment options, can provide greater efficiency. This has the potential to accelerate knowledge acquisition and identify effective, ineffective, or harmful treatments faster. The master protocol of the platform defines the study population(s) and standardised procedures. Ineffective or harmful treatments can be discarded or study drug dose modified during the life cycle of the trial. Other adaptive elements that can be modified include eligibility criteria, required sample size for any comparison(s), randomisation assignment ratio, and the addition of other promising treatment options. There are excellent opportunities for anaesthetists to establish platform trials in perioperative medicine. Platform trials are highly efficient, with the potential to provide quicker answers to important clinical questions that lead to improved patient care.}

abstract = {Abstracts
Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel that perturb anion transport across the epithelia of the airways and other organs. To treat cystic fibrosis, strategies that target mutant CFTR have been developed such as correctors that rescue folding and enhance transfer of CFTR to the apical membrane, and potentiators that increase CFTR channel activity. While there has been tremendous progress in development and approval of CFTR therapeutics for the most common (F508del) and several other CFTR mutations, around 10-20% of people with cystic fibrosis have rare mutations that are still without an effective treatment. In the current decade, there was an impressive evolution of patient-derived cell models for precision medicine. In cystic fibrosis, these models have played a crucial role in characterizing the molecular defects in CFTR mutants and identifying compounds that target these defects. Cells from nasal, bronchial, and rectal epithelia are most suitable to evaluate treatments that target CFTR. In vitro assays using cultures grown at an air-liquid interface or as organoids and spheroids allow the diagnosis of the CFTR defect and assessment of potential treatment strategies. An overview of currently established cell culture models and assays for personalized medicine approaches in cystic fibrosis will be provided in this review. These models allow theratyping of rare CFTR mutations with available modulator compounds to predict clinical efficacy. Besides evaluation of individual personalized responses to CFTR therapeutics, patient-derived culture models are valuable for testing responses to developmental treatments such as novel RNA- and DNA-based therapies.}

The Asian NM community has worked together from the beginning of the pandemic. Fortunately, the Asian Regional Cooperative Council for Nuclear Medicine annual general meeting and Asia Nuclear Medicine Board examination was held in Manila from January 28 to February 2, 2020; these were the last face-to-face events of these organizations to date. Members shared information about COVID-19 at the conference, and through online means afterwards. Web-based surveys performed from March to April 2020 for the Asian Regional Cooperative Council for Nuclear Medicine and Asia Nuclear Medicine Board communities showed a significant reduction of NM practice and supply of radioisotopes (RI) at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. A follow-up survey in March to April 2021 clearly showed the recovery of both NM practice and RI supplies. The pattern of recovery is variable according to institutions and countries. Herein, we have reported the case-in-point operational histories of four representative institutions in the East, Southeast, South, and West Asia. The second outbreak in India is ongoing on a worrisome scale. Various communications and educational sessions were actively performed online in the Asian NM community during the pandemic.}

abstract = {Background
Danggui Longhui is a traditional Chinese medicine made from the dried root of Angelica sinensis. It is used in psychiatric patients in China to reduce associated constipation. In a population pharmacokinetic model in olanzapine patients from Beijing Anding Hospital, we demonstrate that dangguilonghui tablets doubled olanzapine clearance, indicating the induction of olanzapine metabolism. Olanzapine metabolism is similar to clozapine metabolism.
Methods
Two cases of possible clozapine induction using dangguilonghui tablets 4 g/day were identified in Beijing Anding Hospital. Dividing the minimum therapeutic concentration of 350 ng/mL by the concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio provides the minimum therapeutic dose.
Results
Case 1 was a female smoker on clozapine for 415 days. The mean of 6 clozapine C/D ratios associated with smoking provided a minimum therapeutic dose of 267 mg/day. There were 6 steady-state concentrations on the combination of valproic acid and dangguilonghui tablets, which provided a much higher minimum therapeutic dose of 833 mg/day. Four steady-state clozapine C/D ratios based on smoking and valproate after 4 months of carbamazepine 200 mg/day provided a minimum therapeutic dose of 603 mg/day. Case 2 was a female non-smoker on clozapine for 58 days. She had 3 clozapine C/D ratios on dangguilonghui tablets with a mean of 0.30 ng/mL providing a minimum therapeutic dose of 1167 mg/day.
Conclusion
Future clinical studies with repeated measures need to replicate the possibility that dangguilonghui tablets are a moderate-to-strong inducer of clozapine metabolism as suggested by these two limited cases.}
