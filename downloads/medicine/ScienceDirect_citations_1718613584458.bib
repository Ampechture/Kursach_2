abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC), a term for both colon and rectal cancer (colorectal), is a heterogeneous disease with multiple etiologies. It is the second leading cause of cancer worldwide, with nearly 915,880 deaths (including both men and women) recorded in 2020, according to cancer net. Many factors contribute to the development of CRC, including lifestyle, age, family history, etc. CRC is triggered by mutations. A mutation is any change in the DNA sequence during replication. Any change in the nucleotide base pairs can lead to a change in a gene’s instructions (variant genes). These instructions are vital to proper protein functioning and are coded based on these genes. Variants have the capability of producing malfunctioning proteins or different proteins altogether. Most genetic mutations are silent and do not affect any particular function of the cells in the body, therefore having little to no effect on individuals. Some mutations are also corrected by the body equipped with DNA repair mechanisms. These mechanisms fix most of these disadvantageous mutations, thereby reducing the chances of disease. In the case of CRCs, most mutations target these DNA repair mechanisms along with tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes- mutated genes that can potentially cause cancer. Specifically, the β-catenin, Smad2, Smad4, KRas, DCC, hMSH2, TGFβRII variants have shown significant expression in patients with CRC. This information can be used in treating CRC by targeting those variants as potential biomarkers. Over the past decade, the burgeoning of research in this field has given rise to many advances in medical science and technology. It has led to a better understanding of the causes, types, and more precise treatments of CRC. This review gives a brief overview of the epidemiology and etiology of CRC and focuses on some of the latest therapeutics and medicaments, including personalized medicine and targeted therapies for treating and possibly curing the disease.}

We aimed to elucidate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of HER2-altered NSCLC and investigate practical approaches for identifying patients who might benefit from HER2-targeted therapies. Using next-generation sequencing data from 1680 individuals, we searched for patients with HER2-altered NSCLCs, including amplifications and mutations. Clinicopathological data and tissue slides were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and silver in situ hybridization were performed according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines. Our analysis identified 89 (5.3%) patients with HER2-altered NSCLCs, comprising 30 (1.8%) with amplification and 59 (3.6%) mutations, and they were compared with 165 control patients. Of the 59 HER2-mutated cases, 52 harbored tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, primarily HER2 exon 20 insertions. HER2 TKD alterations were associated with younger age, female sex, nonsmoking status, adenocarcinoma with a micropapillary pattern, lung-to-lung metastasis, and poor overall survival. The 33 patients with TKD mutations and 3 with non-TKD point mutations showed incomplete or complete membranous HER2 immunoreactivity (1+ and 2+, 61.07%). Six patients exhibiting amplifications had an IHC score of ≤2+ despite their high copy numbers and concomitantly displayed other actionable EGFR, KRAS, SMARCA4, and other HER2 mutations. These HER2-altered NSCLCs with molecular coalterations showed heterogeneous patterns through HER2 IHC and silver in situ hybridization. Therefore, next-generation sequencing should be used to identify HER2 mutations in patients with NSCLC who present with concomitant alterations. In addition, the above clinicopathological characteristics and HER2 IHC results can be valuable determinants for identifying patients with HER2-altered NSCLC. These insights hold promise for the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this complex subset of NSCLC patients.}

PARPis are now used as single agents for patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa. Moreover, combinations of PARPis plus androgen-receptor targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, and earlier applications of PARPis in the metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa are under evaluation, representing the possible upcoming applications of these agents. Mechanisms of sensitization and resistance have been only partially elucidated. In our review, we summarize the current clinical evidence regarding PARPis in mPCa and the future directions of these targeted agents.}

abstract = {Background
This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) on History, Physical Exam, Body Composition and Energy Expenditure is intended to provide clinicians an overview of the clinical and diagnostic evaluation of patients with pre-obesity/obesity.
Methods
The scientific information for this CPS is based upon published scientific citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by the Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
This CPS outlines important components of medical, dietary, and physical activity history as well as physical exams, with a focus on specific aspects unique to managing patients with pre-obesity or obesity. Patients with pre-obesity/obesity benefit from the same preventive care and general laboratory testing as those without an increase in body fat. In addition, patients with pre-obesity/obesity may benefit from adiposity-specific diagnostic testing - both generally and individually - according to patient presentation and clinical judgment. Body composition testing, such as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, bioelectrical impedance, and other measures, each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Some patients in clinical research, and perhaps even clinical practice, may benefit from an assessment of energy expenditure. This can be achieved by several methods including direct calorimetry, indirect calorimetry, doubly labeled water, or estimated by equations. Finally, a unifying theme regarding the etiology of pre-obesity/obesity and effectiveness of treatments of obesity centers on the role of biologic and behavior efficiencies and inefficiencies, with efficiencies more often associated with increases in fat mass and inefficiencies more often associated with decreases in fat mass.
Conclusion
The Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) on History, Physical Exam, Body Composition and Energy Expenditure is one of a series of OMA CPSs designed to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of pre-obesity/obesity.}

The effects of torrefaction, pyrolysis temperature, SiO2/Al2O3 atomic ratio (SAR) and catalyst-to-feedstock (C/F) ratio on the distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) was investigated. The formation of coke and its effects on the catalytic performance of the catalyst were evaluated. The results demonstrated that zeolite can effectively convert the torrefied HMW into AHs. The liquid products were dominated by monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), in which toluene and xylene were formed preferentially over other aromatics. The total content of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, and naphthalene (BTEXN) reached 49.23–76.31%. Temperature, SAR and C/F ratio exhibit a greater influence on AHs formation than the torrefaction agents. A higher pyrolysis temperature and C/F ratio can inhibit coke formation, while higher SAR is beneficial to coke formation. The catalyst with a lower SAR yield more AHs and less coke. Coke was initially formed on the surface of the catalyst at low temperature, but it was more likely to form in the pores of the catalyst at high temperatures. The results show that the combination of torrefaction and catalytic pyrolysis is a potential approach for converting HMW into valuable bio-oils.}

When NGS first became available, the cost and lack of access to these technologies were limiting factors; however, with decreasing sequencing costs and the expanding knowledge base of genetic skin diseases, fundamental awareness of NGS has become prudent. The heritable ichthyoses comprise a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of monogenic keratinization disorders characterized by persistent scaling, with at least 55 distinct genes currently implicated in causing nonsyndromic and syndromic forms of the disease. By providing a simplified overview of available NGS techniques and applying them in the context of ichthyosis, one of the most common genodermatoses, we hope to encourage dermatologists to offer, when appropriate, genetic testing earlier in patients with unsolved presentations. With the aid of NGS, dermatologists can provide diagnostic certainty in cases of suspected genodermatoses and offer potentially life-changing genome-guided and targeted therapies as they become available.}

Objective
To describe the current state of workforce diversity in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) using the 2014-2019 American Urological Association (AUA) census data.
Materials
We evaluated FPMRS workforce diversity using the AUA census data from 2014 to 2019. Underrepresented in medicine (URiM) groups were categorized as individuals who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black/African American, Hispanic, Multiracial, and Other. The FPMRS workforce was then compared to the overall urologic workforce and the other urologic subspecialties (oncology, pediatric urology, and endourology) and assessed by AUA section.
Results
In 2019, 602 urologists self-identified as FPMRS providers. Of these 12.4% (n = 74) were categorized as URiM urologists compared to 8% of the overall urologic workforce. Women who represent 9.9% of all urologists were overrepresented in FPMRS workforce (46.5%). FPMRS had the largest proportion of URiM and women urologists when compared to the other subspecialty areas.
Conclusion
The FPMRS urologic subspecialty has the highest percentage of women and URiM urologists compared to all other urologic subspecialty areas. Engagement initiatives and targeted programs may offer insights into this trend. Further research is required to determine the impact of such programs in attracting URiM and women to FPMRS.}

Particularly with the methods developed in natural language processing (NLP), we can first identify a large number of functional proteins and peptides encrypted in biological big data, for instance microbiome and virome data. Secondly, larger scale mutations and directed evolution can be carried out and facilitated by NLP, to achieve improved function based on known proteins. Lastly, sampling random sequences and applying NLP might reveal the more complete landscape of protein functions and enable de novo protein design.}

The proposed models incorporate the concepts of cost-effectiveness, affordability, innovation, clinical ethics, and social preferences in a unique theoretical/quantitative manner at the same time relaxing previous simplified assumptions used concerning the willingness to pay (λ) in a healthcare system. The chapter provides a practical tool based on which policymakers could ensure the sustainability of funding for genome-guided interventions, their adoption and coverage by health insurance funds, and prioritization of genomic medicine research, development, and innovation, given the restriction of budget, particularly in developing countries and low-income healthcare settings in developed countries.

The identification and quantification of representative components in Di-Long extracts (DL) were carried out by HPLC analysis. The anti-RA effects and mechanisms of DL were studied in CIA mice, RAW 264.7 macrophages and spleen T lymphocytes. The Th1/Th2 cell ratio in CIA mice spleens were determined by Flow cytometry. The cytokine levels were determined by ELISA method. The expressions of p-NF-κB p65 in ankle joints of CIA mice were detected by Immunohistochemistry analysis. The phosphorylation of NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW 264.7 macrophages and expressions of T-bet and GATA-3 in CIA mice spleens were determined by Western blots. The treatment with DL significantly decreased the paw thickness, arthritis scores and inflammatory cells infiltration in CIA mice. The TNF-α, IL-6 concentrations in both mice serum and macrophages secretion were markedly reduced with the treatment of DL, as well as the phosphorylation of NF-κB pathway. DL inhibited the expressions of T-bet and GATA-3 and decreased Th1/Th2 cells ratio in CIA mice spleens. DL reduced IFN-γ, IL-2 levels in mice serum and spleen T lymphocytes, and increased IL-4 levels in CIA mice serum. Chinese medicine Di-Long have significant anti-RA effects.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of anovulatory infertility. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has many advantages in treating PCOS. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the effects of CHM (Bu-Shen-Tian-Jing Formula, BSTJF) on the outcomes of IVF in Chinese patients with PCOS and the potential underlying mechanism.
Methods
A total of 111 patients with PCOS who undergone IVF between November 2009 and July 2018 were included. Fifty-four patients received a three-month BSTJF therapy before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, while the other 57 patients didn't. The data of the PCOS patients was collected. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8) levels in the follicular fluid were evaluated.
Results
BSTJF helped patients with PCOS to get more retrieved oocytes (P<0.05) and fertilized oocytes (P<0.05). The clinical cumulative pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and term delivery rate were significantly higher in the same stimulated cycle of the PCOS patients with BSTJF treatment (P<0.05). No significant differences existed between the two groups in the rate of fertilization, hospitalization rate of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome and obstetrical or neonatal complications. BSTJF significantly decreased the AMH levels in the follicular fluids (P<0.05).
Conclusion
BSTJF significantly may improve the outcomes of IVF in Chinese patients with PCOS through decreasing AMH levels in follicular fluids. However, the evidence is limited due to the small sample size and the several potential bias.}

Androgens in FtM transgender persons are effective to lower voice frequency, increase facial hair-growth, and increase hematocrit and hemoglobin levels to adult male reference ranges. A 1.2-fold–3.7-fold higher rate of myocardial infarction has been reported retrospectively, compared to cisgender women. Blood pressure, glycaemic control and body mass index remained unchanged in FtM transgender persons. Androgens in FtM transgender persons have important cardio-metabolic implications.

However, the defect of easy degradation or loss of active ingredients limits its application in traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) loaded textiles. In this work, TCH extracts containing different active ingredients were innovatively proposed as the core material of microcapsules. The feasibility of microencapsulation of multi-component TCH extracts in the essential oil state was initially demonstrated. Polyacrylate was also used as a binder to load the microcapsules onto the fabric to improve the durability and wash resistance of the treated fabric. Modeling the oil release of microcapsules for controlled release under different conditions may provide new possible uses for the materials. Results show that the constructed microcapsule has a smooth surface without depression and can be continuously released for over 30 days. The release behavior of microcapsules follows different release mechanisms and can be modulated by temperature and water molecules. The incorporation of microcapsules and polyacrylate does not significantly change the fabric's air permeability, water vapor transmission and hydrophilicity. The washing durability and friction properties of the microcapsule-based fabric are greatly improved, and it can withstand 30 washing tests and 200 friction tests. Moreover, the results of methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) release assay using human dermal papilla cells (HDP) as an in vitro template confirm that the microcapsule has no toxic effects on human cells. Therefore, the successful microencapsulation of multi-component TCH extracts indicates their potential application in the field of TCM-loaded textiles.}

abstract = {Objective
It has been shown that stress in the workplace can contribute to the development or worsening of mental health conditions, as well as having a negative impact on personal relationships and life outside of work. Therefore, prolonged job stress can be damaging to an individual's mental health and wellbeing, potentially leading to burnout. There is limited research surrounding the wellbeing of nuclear medicine technologists practicing globally, and more specifically in Australia. This interpretative phenomenological study seeks the lived experience of nuclear medicine technologists within a large metropolitan city in Australia, how these experiences and COVID-19 has impacted their wellbeing.
Methods
Five participants were recruited who had greater than five years working experience as a nuclear medicine technologist. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews conducted online via Zoom to accommodate COVID-19 restrictions. The data was transcribed and analysed according to interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) protocols.
Results
One superordinate theme: systemic regard, demoralizing burnout, protective maturity, overarched four subordinate themes: staying physically and psychologically safe; risk of burnout; maturity as protective against burnout; and COVID-19 drain. Pressures both prior to and during COVID-19 leave the participants feeling undervalued, discredited, and at risk of burnout. However, maturity brings confidence to incorporate their strengths in a more holistic view of life. Glimmers of positivity come from choices to alter their career path and the unexpected opportunities to spend time with family through COVID-19 restrictions.
Discussion
Overall, the participants of this study expressed a lack of positivity about their own individual experiences within their career. Occupational stress, caused by workplace bullying, increased workload and understaffing increased their risk of burnout. Although as the participants matured, their ability to cope with occupational stressors improved. The recent COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the participants’ risk of burnout.
Conclusion
Due to a number of contributing workplace factors, exacerbated by the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic, participants in this study appeared to have an increased risk of developing burnout. However, maturity and life experience has helped mitigate this risk.
Résume
Objectif
Il a été démontré que le stress au travail peut contribuer au développement ou à l'aggravation de troubles de la santé mentale, et avoir une incidence négative sur les relations personnelles et la vie en dehors du travail. Par conséquent, un stress professionnel prolongé peut être préjudiciable à la santé mentale et au bien-être d'un individu, et peut conduire à l'épuisement professionnel. Il existe peu de recherches sur le bien-être des technologues en médecine nucléaire dans le monde, et plus particulièrement en Australie. Cette étude phénoménologique interprétative s'intéresse à l'expérience vécue par les technologues en médecine nucléaire dans une grande ville métropolitaine d'Australie, et à la façon dont ces expériences et la pandémie de COVID-19 ont eu une incidence sur leur bien-être.
Méthodologie
Cinq participants ayant plus de cinq ans d'expérience professionnelle en tant que technologue en médecine nucléaire ont été recrutés. Les données ont été recueillies au moyen d'entretiens semi-structurés menés en ligne via Zoom pour tenir compte des restrictions liées à la COVID-19. Les données ont été transcrites et analysées selon les protocoles de l'analyse phénoménologique interprétative.
Résultats
Un thème superordonné : regard systémique, épuisement démoralisant, maturité protectrice, surplombe quatre thèmes subordonnés : rester en sécurité physiquement et psychologiquement; risque d'épuisement; maturité comme protection contre l'épuisement; et l'épuisement découlant de la COVID-19. Les pressions exercées avant et pendant la pandémie de COVID-19 donnent aux participants le sentiment d'être sous-estimés, discrédités et de risquer le burnout. Cependant, la maturité apporte la confiance nécessaire pour intégrer leurs forces dans une vision plus holistique de la vie. Des lueurs de positivité proviennent du choix de modifier leur parcours professionnel et des opportunités inattendues de passer du temps avec leur famille grâce aux restrictions liées à la COVID-19.
Discussion
Dans l'ensemble, les participants à cette étude ont exprimé un manque de positivité quant à leurs expériences individuelles au sein de leur carrière. Le stress professionnel, causé par l'intimidation au travail, l'augmentation de la charge de travail et le manque de personnel, a augmenté leur risque d'épuisement professionnel. Bien que les participants aient mûri, leur capacité à faire face aux facteurs de stress professionnel s'est améliorée. La récente pandémie de COVID-19 a exacerbé le risque d'épuisement professionnel des participants.
Conclusion
En raison d'un certain nombre de facteurs liés au lieu de travail, exacerbés par la pandémie inattendue de COVID-19, les participants à cette étude semblaient avoir un risque accru de développer un épuisement professionnel. Cependant, la maturité et l'expérience de vie ont contribué à atténuer ce risque.}

To describe the social needs of families screened by the Community Health Advocates Team (CHAT) Desk, situated within a pediatric emergency department (PED); and to evaluate the effectiveness of this help desk in connecting families to community resources.
Methods
Trained undergraduates, onsite in the PED 30 hours/week during daytime and evening hours, weekdays and weekends, screened a convenience sample of families of patients in the PED for social needs, and provided information on available community resources. Families were offered a follow-up phone call several weeks after their PED visit to assess program satisfaction and success, and identify remaining social needs.
Results
Between January 2019 and March 2020, CHAT Desk screened and assisted 682 families. CHAT routinely provided resources about free outdoor recreational activities for families, but after that, the most commonly provided informational resources pertained to: health care (n = 200), housing (n = 143), and food (n = 137). Of families who completed the follow-up phone call (n = 294), almost half (n = 134, 46%) reported being able to contact at least one of the resources; 100 reported that the resource was able to assist them, and 99 families planned to continue using the resource. When asked about satisfaction, 93% (n = 274) reported being very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with CHAT; 94% (n = 276) said they would recommend it to others.
Conclusions
The PED of a busy tertiary care children's hospital is an opportune location to screen families for social needs, and provide them with information on requested community resources.}

: To explore the driving and resisting forces to the use of digital medicines information in the context of the British National Formulary (BNF) and British National Formulary for Children (BNFc).
Methods
: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were carried out with 25 doctors, pharmacists and nurses. Data were analysed via thematic analysis.
Results
: Key drivers identified included organisations making digital use of BNF/BNFc easier through measures such as electronic prescribing systems, compatible handheld devices and training/induction sessions for staff. The COVID-19 pandemic had expedited the shift to digital BNF/BNFc usage in some settings. A strong driver of digital usage was the desire by staff to use the most up-to-date information. Reduced access to print copies was a common initial driver of digital usage, whilst ease of searching and speed of access often acted to consolidate digital usage. Important resisting forces included lack of supporting organisational digital infrastructure and an onus on individuals to obtain access to digital platforms, particularly through personal smartphones. Poor prior experience of earlier digital BNF/BNFc platforms had also prevented participants from using them again.
Conclusions
: More driving than resisting forces were identified and, in most settings, a transition to digital BNF/BNFc usage is underway, which has been expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this is not happening uniformly across the NHS and there continue to be strong resisting forces to digital BNF/BNFc usage, particularly at organisational level.
Public interest summary
: The British National Formulary (BNF) and British National Formulary for Children (BNFc) provide information about all medicines prescribed in the UK. They are available as a book, a website and an app. As healthcare information becomes increasingly digital, it is important to understand how this is used by healthcare staff and we spoke to doctors, nurses and pharmacists about how they use the BNF/BNFc. We found that staff are increasingly using the digital BNF/BNFc and that the COVID-19 pandemic has speeded up this transition. Staff are likely to use the digital BNF/BNFc where their organisation makes it easy to do so, such as through access to IT equipment and electronic prescribing systems. However, many NHS organisations lack the facilities for widespread digital usage and staff are not routinely trained in using digital resources. Future efforts should focus on the digital technology itself, and on upskilling healthcare staff to use it.}

Materials are the key component of regenerative medicine approaches because the material can imitate the native extracellular matrix of those tissues and improve both the physical behavior and the properties of new tissue. However, most of the available materials used for that purpose fail to provide adequate mechanical properties to replicate the behavior of the original tissue. Thus, most of these applications are still far from being enduring. This project aims to determine the multi-scale mechanical properties of some biopolymers with potential use in regenerative medicine. In this very first part, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) was performed using shear mode on different type VII agarose-based biopolymers at room temperature during 10 min cycles at 1 Hz frequency. On one hand, samples of fibrine-agarose were tested, and on the other, different compositions of chitosan-agarose, while pure type VII agarose was used as control. Computed values for the storage and loss modulus and the small values for Tan delta ratio (tan δ) show that all materials become elastic, and they have a good capacity to dissipate energy per cycle of deformation. This fact means that all materials are suitable for being used as a scaffold for cell culture, a possible material for bioprinting applications and they could have potential use in regenerative medicine.}

abstract = {Background
Diabetes may be a cultural experience for many First Nations patients. In this study, we explore the potential role for traditional medicine in the treatment of diabetes.
Methods
A responsive interviewing qualitative methodology was used for 10 First Nations key informant interviews. The first objective was to accurately “re-tell” participants' stories. The second was to develop an overview of traditional medicine and its role in health and diabetes management by synthesizing academic literature, pre-existing local knowledge and perspectives, and stories shared by elders and traditional healers. The traditional medicine healers gave specific permission for this study and its publication.
Results
There is a strong cultural and historic context for the experience of diabetes in First Nations. Political and cultural suppression, lifestyle change and ongoing social determinants of health place diabetes in a unique context and generate a sense of fatalism. Traditional medicine can facilitate individual empowerment by connecting a patient with the lessons of previous generations and traditional beliefs and practices.
Conclusions
Traditional medicine can be a valuable resource for First Nations patients living with diabetes and should be considered as a therapeutic modality.
Résumé
Introduction
De nombreux patients des Premières Nations se représentent le diabète comme une expérience culturelle. Dans la présente étude, nous examinons le rôle potentiel de la médecine traditionnelle dans le traitement du diabète.
Méthodes
Nous avons utilisé une méthodologie qualitative fondée sur l’entretien ouvert lors d’entrevues menées auprès des principaux informateurs des Premières Nations. Le premier objectif était de raconter de nouveau avec précision les récits des participants. Le second objectif était d’obtenir une vue d’ensemble de la médecine traditionnelle et de son rôle dans la prise en charge de la santé et du diabète par la synthèse de la documentation universitaire, des connaissances et des points de vue locaux préexistants, et des récits partagés par les aînés et les guérisseurs traditionnels. Les guérisseurs traditionnels nous ont donné une autorisation spéciale pour réaliser cette étude et la publier.
Résultats
L’expérience du diabète au sein des Premières Nations s’inscrit dans un contexte culturel et historique fort. La répression politique et culturelle, les changements dans le mode de vie et les déterminants sociaux actuels de la santé placent le diabète dans un contexte particulier et suscitent un sentiment de fatalisme. La médecine traditionnelle peut favoriser l’autonomisation individuelle en mettant en connexion le patient avec les leçons des générations précédentes et les croyances et les pratiques traditionnelles.
Conclusions

abstract = {Objectives
This study assessed traditional herbal medicine (THM) and conventional medicine (CM) utilization among participants with noncommunicable disease in South Africa.
Methods
A cross-sectional study of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological study collected data through face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires in 2014. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine the effect of sociodemographic and economic factors on THM and CM use. All statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical computing and graphics language “R.”
Results
Of the total 417 randomly selected participants in this study, 85% were females, 95% with no health insurance, and 81% with monthly incomes of <2000 rand (R) ($137 equivalent) per month. Moreover, 73% spend <R100 per month (6.85 US dollar conversion) on THM compared with 46% of families spending <R100 on CM last year; 7% spent >5% of their income on THM, and 10% say they are willing to pay >R500 per year on THM to feel better. Age was significantly associated with different spending patterns after controlling for other demographic factors, given that older adults were 82% (odds ratio 0.18; 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.93) less likely to pay >R100 for THM whereas younger adults were 59% (odds ratio 0.41; 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.97) less likely to pay for CM.
Conclusions
The cost of using THM and CM largely differed by age. The economic insight into this study reveals individuals more willing to pay for THM to payors, which can ultimately clue payors into areas for medication optimization from potential drug-drug interactions and adverse events and, therefore, reduce healthcare costs.}

These advancements however are largely owed to improved computational capabilities and statistical modeling techniques which can handle increasingly large datasets acquired from the human brain. Thus, it seems to make intuitive sense that in order to apply connectomic information, one should have a good understanding of machine learning (ML)-based analyses. However, for the average clinician, such ML-based information can become rather daunting, take years to master, and is ultimately not completely necessary to have a strong understanding for the purpose of treating patients and examining the connectome. In this chapter, we attempt to discuss some of the most important basic concepts of ML-based brain analyses so that one could appropriately interpret and apply connectome-based analyses.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate active social media use among members of the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA) and investigate differences in social media use based on joint-specific subspecialization.
Methods
The AANA membership directory was queried to identify all active, residency-trained orthopaedic surgeons within the United States. Sex, practice location, and academic degrees earned were recorded. Google searches were conducted to find professional Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube accounts along with institutional and personal websites. The primary outcome was the Social Media Index (SMI) score, an aggregate measure of social media use across key platforms. A Poisson regression model was constructed to compare SMI scores across joint-specific subspecializations: knee, hip, shoulder, elbow, foot & ankle, and wrist. Specialization in the treatment of each joint was collected using binary indicator variables. Since surgeons were specialized in multiple groups, comparisons were made between those who do and do not treat each joint.
Results
In total, 2,573 surgeons within the United States met the inclusion criteria. 64.7% had ownership of at least 1 active account, with an average SMI score of 2.29 ± 1.59. Western practicing surgeons had a significantly greater presence on at least 1 website than those in the Northeast (P = .003, P < .001) and South (P = .005, P = .002). Social media use by knee, hip, shoulder, and elbow surgeons was greater relative to those who did not treat those respective joints (P < .001 for all). Poisson regression analysis demonstrated that knee, shoulder, or wrist specialization was a significant positive predictor of a greater SMI score (P ≤ .001 for all). Foot & ankle specialization was a negative predictor (P < .001), whereas hip (P = .125) and elbow (P = .077) were not significant predictors.
Conclusions
Social media use widely varies across joint subspecialties within orthopaedic sports medicine. Knee and shoulder surgeons had a greater social media use than their counterparts, whereas foot & ankle surgeons had the lowest social media use.
Clinical Relevance
Social media is a vital source of information for both patients and surgeons, providing a means for marketing, networking, and education. It is important to identify variations in social media use by orthopaedic surgeons by subspecialty and explore the differences.}

Consequently, those affected have comparatively few treatment options, and their prognosis is worse than that of patients with more common entities. Here we review two relevant groups of rare cancers, bone and soft-tissue sarcomas and neuroendocrine tumours (NET), to illustrate recent efforts towards individualised, biology-guided clinical management to improve long-term outcomes. Specifically, we address how comprehensive, multi-layered molecular analyses, including the assessment of predisposing hereditary factors, and innovative imaging approaches can improve the diagnosis of these diseases, allow for better prognostic assessment, and provide new targets for pharmacologic and, in the case of NET, nuclear medicine interventions, whose clinical value must be determined in controlled trials optimally tailored to the particular patient population most likely to benefit. Furthermore, we describe the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in dedicated reference centres for rare cancers and the increasingly acknowledged potential of networking across institutions at a national and international level. Finally, we illustrate the value of a learning health system based on the systematic collection and sharing of the biological and clinical profiles of patients with rare cancers to achieve continuous cross-fertilisation of scientific and clinical efforts, making the vision of stratified precision medicine in these long-overlooked diseases a reality.}

abstract = {Objective
Some epidemic diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused many physical, psychological, and social challenges, despite the existence of treatment strategies. Many people are looking for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to prevent such diseases. The present study was performed to determine how some types of CAM were being used during the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran.
Methods
The present study had a cross-sectional descriptive correlational design. All Iranian residents above 17 years old were eligible to participate in the study. A total of 782 participants completed a demographic information questionnaire, a questionnaire about their use of CAMs and a questionnaire about their satisfaction with the CAMs they used. Web-based sampling was conducted from 20 April 2020 to 20 August 2020.
Results
Of the participants, 84% used at least one type of CAM during the COVID-19 outbreak. The most used CAMs were dietary supplements (61.3%), prayer (57.9%), and herbal medicines (48.8%). The majority of the participants (50%–66%) have used CAMs to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 or to reduce anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. CAM use was associated with sex, having children, place of residence, COVID-19 status, and source of gathering information about CAM (P < 0.05). All 32 participants who had been infected with COVID-19 used at least one type of CAM for treatment or alleviation of the disease symptoms.
Conclusion
During the COVID-19 outbreak, some types of CAM, particularly nutritional supplements, medicinal herbs, and prayer, were commonly used to prevent COVID-19 and reduce pandemic-related anxiety.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
The prevalence of anxiety in patients with chronic constipation is particularly high and these individuals are not necessarily satisfied by normal treatments targeting the gastrointestinal tract. Kamikihito, a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, has been widely used to date in treating anxiety and neurosis in Japan. We conducted a single-arm, open-label pilot study of female patients with intractable chronic constipation and anxiety who took kamikihito by mouth for 12 weeks.
Materials and methods
Validated symptom questionnaires on anxiety and gastrointestinal symptoms [the Profile of Mood States, second edition (POMS2); the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)] were completed at each study visit. Plasma, salivary, and stool samples were also assessed to evaluate levels of clinical bioactive substances linked to stress and inflammation, oxidative levels, the metabolome profile, and gut microbiota.
Results
Twenty-four patients completed this study. Anxiety was significantly reduced at four and 12 weeks (Tension–Anxiety subscale of the POMS2, p = 0.006 and p = 0.039; Trait anxiety score of the STAI, p < 0.001 and p = 0.034), while the total GSRS score was improved at 12 weeks (p = 0.039). Targeted metabolomics in plasma showed significant alterations in some metabolites associated with psychological symptoms, such as O-phosphoethanolamine. No significant differences were found between pre- and posttreatment levels of clinical bioactive substances related to stress and inflammation, oxidative levels, and the gut microbiota in this cohort. No serious adverse events occurred.
Conclusion
Kamikihito ameliorated psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with chronic constipation. In parallel with the onset of efficacy, kamikihito modulated some anxiety-related metabolites. Kamikihito was safe and well-tolerated.}

Safety information of antiseizure medication (ASM) during breastfeeding is scarce and conflicting. We aimed to identify characteristic traits of safety concerns among healthcare professionals by reviewing enquiries to the Norwegian Regional Medicines Information and Pharmacovigilance Centres (RELIS).
Method
Enquiries related to breastfeeding, epilepsy, and ASM identified by their ATC-numbers were retrieved from the RELIS database of question-and-answer pairs (QAPs) by combining indexed and Boolean database searches and manual inspection. 112 QAPs were analyzed retrospectively using descriptive statistics.
Results
Hospital-employed physicians and nurses were puzzled by ambiguous or conflicting drug information advice and called for general information about the compatibility of an ASM with breastfeeding, mainly related to lamotrigine and levetiracetam. Other enquiries were related to co-medication with other drugs, mainly antidepressants. Half of the enquiries were posed after birth, 12 of these motivated by suspected adverse events in the infants.
Conclusion
Healthcare professionals with acknowledged high competence in the topic were uncertain about the prevailing safety information of ASM during breastfeeding. The fear to harm the infant may lead to the decision not to recommend breastfeeding. Future information strategies should aim to reach these professions, and support their information need on this topic.}

We investigated the potential transfer of veterinary flea products from dogs to the environment in a ‘proof of principle’ experiment. For this purpose, samples of hair, urine, and water after swimming were investigated. Nine dogs were recruited for this study, eight of which had been recently treated with an ectoparasiticide product. Hair and urine samples were tested for afoxalaner, fluralaner, fipronil and imidacloprid. Interestingly, contamination with ectoparasiticides was frequently demonstrated in samples from dogs untreated with these particular substances, suggesting widespread secondary transfer. In addition, hair retrieved from a bird's nest contained fipronil, fluralaner and imidacloprid, indicating a potential pathway for the exposure of juvenile birds. Three of the dogs also participated in a swimming experiment. One had been treated with oral fluralaner, whilst the remaining two had received other compounds not included in our study. However, in all three dogs, both fluralaner and imidacloprid were detected in hair samples. Fluralaner concentrations in the swimming water exceeded Dutch water quality standards, indicating a potential risk to the aquatic environment. Imidacloprid levels increased after each swimming dog, but did not breach Dutch water quality standard levels. These findings all call for improvements in the current risk assessment and management for veterinary medicines, by including companion animals and their exposure pathways into ecosystems.}

Statement of significance
Pancreas or islet transplantation is a means of providing insulin-independence in diabetes patients. However, due to the shortage of viable pancreata, whole-organ decellularization and recellularization is emerging as a promising solution to overcome organ shortage for transplantation. Several studies on decellularization and recellularization of rodent, porcine, and human pancreata have shown promise for generating usable decellularized pancreas scaffolds for subsequent recellularization and transplantation. In this state-of-the-art review, we highlight the latest advances in pancreas decellularization, recellularization, and revascularization. We also discuss clinical considerations such as potential transplantation sites, donor source, and immune considerations. We conclude with future work that needs to be done in order to realize clinical translation of bioengineered pancreata for transplantation in diabetes patients.}

The most common conditions patients report using medical marijuana for are pain, muscle spasms, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Despite medical cannabis’s apparent safety and efficacy, there are roadblocks in its path to acceptance, since medical cannabis does not conform to many of the standards of traditional Western medicine. Cannabis medicine is not as consistent and replicable as standard pharmaceuticals, and many physicians have not been educated as to its effects and use. However, the use of medical cannabis may itself influence Western medicine, by encouraging healthcare professionals to recognize the complexity inherent in all systems; appreciate the uniqueness of everybody; honor the patient, not the pill; encourage inwardly focused attention; increase the acceptance of whole plant medicine; encourage inquiry into psychedelic drugs; and recognize the importance of critical thinking.}

abstract = {Objective
Regofinib is a novel, oral, anticancer target which greatly improves survival of patients with colorectal cancer. However, it causes 47%–71% patients occur hand–foot skin reaction (HFSR), which affects the quality of life (QOL) or prognosis of patients. However targeted and effective methods are rare. The study attempted to test the efficacy of the compound traditional Chinese medicine (CTCM) oil in relieving HFSR and improving the QOL.
Methods
The present study was conducted in 85 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer presenting with HFSR from July 2019 to June 2020. These patients were divided into the control group (n = 42) and the intervention group (n = 43). The HFSR in the control group was managed using traditional methods, whereas that in the intervention group was treated with a CTCM oil comprising five selected herbs. This oil functions by regulating the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, inflammatory factors, and immune status, and it was provided to the patients to apply externally twice a day. HFSR remission and QOL were evaluated in both groups after 2 weeks of intervention.
Results
The post-intervention HFSR remission rate was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (65.1% vs. 16.7%) (P < 0.01). The overall QOL, physical function, social function, and emotional function of the patients in the intervention group were significantly improved (P < 0.05), whereas the pain symptoms were more significantly improved (P < 0.01).
Conclusions
The CTCM oil can effectively alleviate HFSR and improve the QOL of patients using regorafenib.}

Approximately half of the patients with histopathologically confirmed MOGHE carry a brain somatic variant in the SLC35A2 gene encoding a UDP-galactose transporter. Previous research showed that D-galactose supplementation results in clinical improvement in patients with a congenital disorder of glycosylation due to germline variants in SLC35A2. We aimed to evaluate the effects of D-galactose supplementation in patients with histopathologically confirmed MOGHE, with uncontrolled seizures or cognitive impairment and epileptiform activity at the EEG after epilepsy surgery (NCT04833322). Patients were orally supplemented with D-galactose for 6 months in doses up to 1.5 g/kg/day and monitored for seizure frequency including 24-h video-EEG recording, cognition and behavioral scores, i.e., WISC, BRIEF-2, SNAP-IV, and SCQ, and quality of life measures, before and 6 months after treatment. Global response was defined by > 50% improvement of seizure frequency and/or cognition and behavior (clinical global impression of “much improved” or better). Twelve patients (aged 5–28 years) were included from three different centers. Neurosurgical tissue samples were available in all patients and revealed a brain somatic variant in SLC35A2 in six patients (non-present in the blood). After 6 months of supplementation, D-galactose was well tolerated with just two patients presenting abdominal discomfort, solved after dose spacing or reduction. There was a 50% reduction or higher of seizure frequency in 3/6 patients, with an improvement at EEG in 2/5 patients. One patient became seizure-free. An improvement of cognitive/behavioral features encompassing impulsivity (mean SNAP-IV − 3.19 [− 0.84; − 5.6]), social communication (mean SCQ − 2.08 [− 0.63; − 4.90]), and executive function (BRIEF-2 inhibit − 5.2 [− 1.23; − 9.2]) was observed. Global responder rate was 9/12 (6/6 in SLC35A2-positive). Our results suggest that supplementation with D-galactose in patients with MOGHE is safe and well tolerated and, although the efficacy data warrant larger studies, it might build a rationale for precision medicine after epilepsy surgery.}

To evaluate the association between self-rated evidence-based medicine (EBM) competencies and the prescription of drugs without scientific evidence against mild COVID-19 (present with any of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 but who do not have shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging) among recently graduated physicians in Peru.
Methods
We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study where we evaluated a non-probability sample of recently graduated physicians during June and July 2021 (end of second wave of COVID-19 in Peru). Self-rated EBM competencies were assessed by four domains (formulation of a clinical question, search, analysis, and application) using a Likert scale with scores from zero to four (“Very inadequate” = 0, to “Very Adequate” = 4), it was considered as “Adequate” if the score was three or four. In addition, the variable “General competence on EBM” was rated as “Adequate” if in all domains evaluated it presented an adequate self-rating. For the outcome, drug prescription, we considered the use of ivermectin, azithromycin, other antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, and anticoagulants (drugs with no efficacy demonstrated for patients with mild COVID-19). To assess the association, we used Poisson regression models with robust variances and obtaining crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
Results
Of a total of 239 physicians included 70.7% prescribed at least one drug without scientific evidence. A total of 51.1% reported adequate ratings in all evaluated domains of EBM. Self-rating the “Clinical Question Formulation” competency as adequate was associated with a lower frequency of prescribing medications for mild COVID-19 (aPR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.91–0.95). While self-rating as adequate the competency of “Identify possible implications of investigations” was associated with an increase in the prescription of such drugs (aPR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.09–1.20). Additionally, self-rating all domains as adequate were associated with less prescription (aPR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.90–0.96).
Conclusion
Seven out of ten recently graduated physicians prescribed some type of medication without scientific evidence to treat patients with mild COVID-19. Having adequate self-perceived EBM competencies was associated with a lower frequency of prescribing medications without scientific evidence to manage patients with mild COVID-19.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of 6 Traditional Chinese patent medicines combined with lifestyle modification in the treatment of prediabetes with network meta-analysis.
Method
The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Shen qi jiang tang capsule/granule (Shenqi), Tian mai xiao ke tablet (Tianmai), Tian qi capsule (Tianqi), Jin qi jiang tang tablet (Jinqi), Jin li da granule (Jinlida), Tang mai kang granule (Tangmaikang) in the treatment of prediabetes in PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, EMbase, China Knowledge Network (CNKI), WanFang and Weipu databases were searched. Three reviewers independently conducted the screening, extracted the data and assessed methodological quality. Data analysis was performed using Rev Man 5.3 and STATA 15.0 software.
Results
A total of 50 RCTs, including 4594 patients, were included. The addition of Shenqi (OR 0.19 [95 %CI: 0.07, 0.52]) and Jinqi (OR 0.32 [95 %CI: 0.15, 0.71]) to existing lifestyle modification resulted in significant lower incidence rate of DM compared with none/placebo added to lifestyle modification. The addition of Jinlida (SMD −0.41% [95 %CI:−0.81, −0.01]) and Tangmaikang (SMD −0.83%[95 %CI: −1.46,-0.20]) resulted in significant additional HbA1c reductions compared with none/placebo added to lifestyle modification. The addition of all CTPMs except Tianqi resulted in significant additional FBG reductions and the addition of Shenqi (SMD −1.96[95 %CI: −3.64, −0.28]) resulted in significant additional PBG reductions.
Conclusion
For patients with prediabetes, Shenqi + LM was among the most effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes for patients with prediabetes, while Jinlida + LM was among the least effective. Jinqi + LM and Tianqi + LM might be among the most effective, while western oral drugs + LM, Tianmai + LM, Tangmaikang + LM and Placebo + LM might be among the least effective. In addition, Tangmaikang + LM and Jinlida + LM might be among the most effective in reducing HbA1c, while Tianmai + LM, Tangmaikang + LM, Shenqi + LM, Jinlida + LM and Jinqi + LM might be among the most effective in reducing FPG for patients with prediabetes.

abstract = {Contemporary genomic medicine pipelines are enabled by integration of genomic and therapeutic knowledge bases for clinical decision support systems. Human curators are expected to synthesize these data to predict how patient tumors will respond to potential therapeutics. In some tumors, the presence of a single mutation can be enough to promote sensitivity to a particular treatment. While gene specific drug interaction information is readily available through many resources, therapeutic ontologies and vocabularies supporting these data are not well aligned. In addition, many resources do not have structured concept identifiers associated with therapeutic terms, instead describing them as free-text names. For such resources, the task of linking therapeutic vocabulary to other sources becomes largely reliant on the error-prone process of free text string matching. The same therapeutic concept can hold a handful of valid identifiers across different research domains- from molecular structures to brand names to therapeutic formulations. We have addressed these challenges through development of a Python-based therapy normalization library (TheraPy). We demonstrate how use of this tool enables extraction of relevant therapeutic knowledge from the literature using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. These tools also provide a framework for enriching therapeutic concepts with regulatory approval status from the FDA. We leveraged this tool to harmonize data across 40 resources of the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb), and demonstrate how this work improves our ability to find and link therapeutic concepts across resources.}

abstract = {Objective
Visual aids such as drawings have been reported to improve patient comprehension, retention, and adherence. We sought to determine the feasibility of teaching live drawing for clinical communication to medical students.
Design
We designed a course to teach basic drawing skills and visual communication of health information to senior medical students. Data was gathered from both an intervention and control group via written pre- and post-course surveys. The intervention group also completed a survey six months after the course.
Setting
The course was offered as an elective at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine during February 2020.
Participants
The intervention group consisted of 17 enrolled students, while 17 students not taking the course served as a control group. Third year, fourth year, and research year medical students were invited to enroll in the course.
Results
The intervention group had significantly greater comfort with visual communication for patient care and increased objective drawing and visual communication scores compared to the control group. Visual abilities not targeted by the curriculum did not change between the intervention and control groups. At 6-months follow-up, course participants reported persistently elevated comfort in visual communication, as well as utilization of visual communication skills in their clinical practice.
Conclusions
These data provide initial evidence of the efficacy of an elective course aimed at developing the skill and confidence to draw for visual communication in medicine as well as support for continued efforts to further develop and disseminate this type of curriculum.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate the trend of scientific production in relation to the modalities of CAM adopted for the treatment of common mental disorders (CMD), and the evolution and distribution of relevant articles.
Material and methods
A bibliometric analysis of studies published between 2001 and 2020 was performed, extracted from the Scopus database, using the terms: integrative medicine, complementary therapy, common mental disorders, anxiety and depression, and synonyms. The relationship between the number of publications, and the years studied were analyzed using Pearson's correlation, followed by linear regression to estimate the number of articles along with the year. The VOSviewer software was used to analyze scientometric data. The study looked at countries with the highest number of publications and citations, co-authorships, most frequent keywords, and leading research organizations.
Results
In the analysis of the two decades, we identified a high positive correlation between the number of publications and year (r = 0.945). In trend analysis, the linear regression equation predicted the growth of publications along with the year, with R2 = 0.8949 explaining most of the data variability. Spirituality was the most frequent term among the modalities. The concentration of publications and the number of citations were significantly higher in developed countries.
Conclusion
The rise in the number of publications in the past two decades on the application of CAM among individuals with CMD suggests a growing scientific interest in Integrative practices. These bibliometric indicators suggest that new studies are warranted, as well as improvements in public health policies.}

It exhibits, at the mesoscopic scale, phenotypic characteristics that are generally indiscernible to the human eye but can be captured non-invasively on medical imaging as radiomic features, which can form a high dimensional data space amenable to machine learning. Radiomic features can be harnessed and used in an artificial intelligence paradigm to risk stratify patients, and predict for histological and molecular findings, and clinical outcome measures, thereby facilitating precision medicine for improving patient care. Compared to tissue sampling-driven approaches, radiomics-based methods are superior for being non-invasive, reproducible, cheaper, and less susceptible to intra-tumoral heterogeneity.

BBD is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine widely used in clinic to treat viral hepatitis, cholecystitis, angiocholitis and urinary tract infection. According to traditional medicinal theory, BBD exerts the effects of “clearing and humid heat, activating blood and removing toxicity, curing jaundice and relieving pain”, the signs of which are recognized as common symptoms of inflammation during infectious diseases in modern medicine.
Aim of the study
To determine the therapeutic effect of BBD on bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced sepsis and to investigate the relevant pharmacological and molecular mechanisms of action whereby BBD mitigates inflammation.
Materials and methods
In vivo, a mouse sepsis model was induced by intraperitoneally injection of LPS; the BBD were formulated as drug suspension for intragastric administration. The survival rate, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines of IL-1β and TNF-α, and multiple organ injury of lung, liver and spleen were examined. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages (PMs) were stimulated with LPS plus ATP for NLRP3 inflammasome activation; polar gradient extractions of BBD from ultrapure water (sample 1) followed by 70% ethanol (sample 2) were added as interventions. In addition to detect the secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α, the activation of NF-κB, ASC-speck formation and ASC oligomerization were examined by western blotting and immunofluorescent stainning. Eventually, the extractions of BBD were applied for UPLC-QTOF-MS analyses; refer to the identified chemicals, the bioactive compounds in BBD with anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activities were discussed.
Results
BBD improved the survival of sepsis mice accomplished with diminished inflammatory cytokines production and multiple organ injury. Mechanistically, BBD inhibited both the NF-κB pathway and the assembly of NLRP3 complex in PMs. There were 29 chemical compounds identified from sample 1 and 20 from sample 2. Both samples contained bile acids and saponins and sample 2 contained 2 extra chemicals in the category of bile acids.
Conclusions
BBD presents therapeutic role of endotoxin induced sepsis by inhibiting NLRP3-medaited inflammasome activation, which supports its traditional use for the treatment of infectious diseases. The bile acids and saponins are most likely related to the anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activation effect of BBD.}

1. Identify currently addressed topics in pediatric palliative and hospice medicine and differentiate these from topics that represent gaps in their resident education.
Background
A recent scoping review revealed that although primary palliative care resident education has improved, gaps in content, delivery, learner assessment, and evaluation remain. Moreover, published complex care (CC) entrustable professional activities (EPAs) and American Board of Pediatrics content specifications mandate inclusion of goals-of-care discussions, pain management, critical care, and end-of-life decision making in pediatric resident training. Our program has an established CC curriculum addressing the care of children with medical complexity (CMC) that does not include a dedicated hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) curriculum. We aimed to identify priorities in HPM curriculum design by first conducting a needs assessment within our pediatric residency program.
Methods
Using CC EPAs, we designed an HPM curriculum needs assessment. The needs assessment presented 19 Likert-scale type questions, assessing pediatric resident confidence when engaging in activities related to HPM competencies for CMC.
Results
Of 36 residents, 24 (66%) completed the needs assessment. Residents reported feeling “extremely confident” or “quite confident” in shared decision making, patient empowerment, and facilitating conversations with families, topics delivered via the CC curriculum. However, residents reported feeling “a little confident” or “not confident at all” when self-assessing confidence in competencies related specifically to HPM. Questions with the greatest frequency of low responses included describing hospice care in pediatric populations (91.7%), helping families navigate grief associated with health changes (83.3%), and ensuring adequate documentation related to goals of care discussions (62.5%).
Conclusions
Our HPM needs assessment demonstrates a gap in pediatric HPM education. Results support an augmentation of the current CC curriculum to include a HPM curriculum that will address these remaining gaps.}

During the treatment of diseases, histone deacetylases (HDAC) may have side effects such as strong immune inhibition and drug resistance, which may lead to damage of heart, liver and kidney. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a valuable and unique resource in China, which has good efficacy and safety. At present, it has been found that Chinese herbal compounds and active ingredients can effectively inhibit the expression of HDAC. Moreover, pharmacological studies have shown that these TCMs have shown therapeutic effects in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, orthopedic diseases and skin diseases. Aim of the review: This article reviews the mechanism of action of HDAC, and introduces the epigenetic correlation between TCM and HDAC. We expounded the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)-like inhibitory effect and clinical application of natural drugs, and summarized the research progress of TCM on HDAC in recent years.
Materials and methods
We collected relevant information published before March 2022 by searching the literature in various online databases such as PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang Database, Elsevier, Web of Science and China Biomedical Database. Search terms include “HDAC” or “HDACi”, as well as “herb” or “herbal ingredient".
Results
A large number of studies have proved that many TCMs and their chemical components have the effect of inhibiting HDAC activity, which is highly selective, acts on different HDAC subtypes, and plays a certain therapeutic effect in cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, orthopedic diseases, skin diseases and other diseases by inhibiting the process of HDAC.
Discussion and conclusions
The review of this paper is helpful to understand and excavate the active components of TCM, further explore the role of plant drugs with HDACi-like effect in diseases, and provide ideas for the development of new HDACi.}

1. Utilizing simulation technology and patient actors, participants will learn basic communication skills utilized in palliative care, which can be applied in the emergency department setting. 2. Utilizing simulation technology and small group discussions, participants will be able to demonstrate improved knowledge in the management of common symptoms at the end of life.
Background
Palliative care (PC) improves quality of life for seriously ill patients nearing the end of life. Given that over 75% of older adults visit the ED during last 6 months of life, emergency medicine (EM) clinicians should have a robust understanding of PC. However, EM residents feel underprepared to utilize PC in their practice. To address this need, we created a simulation-based PC curriculum for the ED.
Methods
Key PC topics for EM were identified, and learning objectives and simulation cases/lectures were created. The curriculum was implemented in an EM residency with 84 residents who serve an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patient population. Lectures and simulations on the same topics occurred on the same day, and residents were randomly assigned to simulations. A pre- and postintervention survey assessed resident comfort level and knowledge of PC topics.
Results
Seven PC topics were identified: goals-of-care (GOC) discussions, cancer complications, hospice care, pain management, communicating bad news, legal/ethical issues, and end-of-life symptom management. Presurvey data revealed 72.3% of residents agree/strongly agree that PC is important to emergency clinicians; 86.2% never/rarely consulted PC; 46.2% didn't feel comfortable giving death notification; 58.3% had been trained to give bad news. Advance directives were regularly discussed by 30.6%, and 11.1% assured accurate code status in the EMR. 80.6% of residents didn't feel comfortable having GOC conversations. Postsurvey data is still being analyzed.
Conclusion
Prior to the intervention, residents confirmed the importance of PC but reported discomfort in key areas of ED practice (death notification, GOC conversations). Utilizing simulation allowed for practice and feedback on communication skills required for these difficult conversations. Applied longitudinally, this curriculum may increase resident knowledge of PC and improve quality of life and mitigate suffering for patients near the end of life seen in emergency medicine practice.}

The Innovative Medicines Initiative–funded, multistakeholders project Healthcare Alliance for Resourceful Medicine Offensive Against Neoplasms in Hematology (HARMONY) created a task force involving patient organizations, medical associations, pharmaceutical companies, and health technology assessment/regulator agencies’ representatives to evaluate the suitability of previously established value frameworks (VFs) for assessing the clinical and societal impact of new interventions for hematologic malignancies (HMs).
Methods
Since the HARMONY stakeholders identified the inclusion of patients’ points of view on evaluating VFs as a priority, surveys were conducted with the patient organizations active in HMs and part of the HARMONY network, together with key opinion leaders, pharmaceutical companies, and regulators, to establish which outcomes were important for each HM. Next, to evaluate VFs against the sources of information taken into account (randomized clinical trials, registries, real-world data), structured questionnaires were created and filled by HARMONY health professionals to specify preferred data sources per malignancy. Finally, a framework evaluation module was built to analyze existing clinical VFs (American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society of Medical Oncology, Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale, Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, National Comprehensive Cancer Network Evidence Blocks, and patient-perspective VF).
Results
The comparative analysis describes challenges and opportunities for the use of each framework in the context of HMs and drafts possible lines of action for creating or integrating a more specific, patient-focused clinical VF for HMs.
Conclusions
None of the frameworks meets the HARMONY goals for a tool that applies to HMs and assesses in a transparent, reproducible, and systematic way the therapeutic value of innovative health technologies versus available alternatives, taking a patient-centered approach and using real-world evidence.}

In this study, a complete quality control system for four-dimensional fingerprinting of TCM was innovatively constructed based on multiple detection techniques, and the quality of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL) was evaluated. Electrochemical fingerprinting (ECFP) as an emerging method without pretreatment provides rich and quantifiable information for SHL samples. The first quantitative ECFP of SHL was developed by the B-Z oscillation system. Eight characteristic parameters were analyzed and a good linear relationship was found between the oscillation lifetime and sample volume, by which the calculated values of the added sample volume (VL) showed different fluctuations between samples. What is more, high-performance liquid chromatography five-wavelength fusion fingerprint (HPLC-FWFP), GC fingerprint (GC-FP), and UV quantum fingerprint (UV-QFP) was established. Meanwhile, the purity of the peaks of the HPLC-FWFP was verified by the dual-wavelength absorption coefficient ratio spectrum (DWAR). Equal weighted ratio quantitative fingerprinting method (EWRQFM) was successfully proposed to extract all potential features for the overall quality assessment of the samples. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation strategy was proposed, namely the variation coefficient weighting algorithm (VCWA). The results of qualitative and quantitative evaluation of HPLC-FWFP, GC-FP, electrochemical quantum fingerprints (EC-QFP), and UV-QFP were integrated by this method. The established evaluation system is also a suitable strategy to control the quality of other TCM preparations.}

abstract = {With recent advancements in nanomedicines and their associated research with biological fields, their translation into clinically-applicable products is still below promises. Quantum dots (QDs) have received immense research attention and investment in the four decades since their discovery. We explored the extensive biomedical applications of QDs, viz. Bio-imaging, drug research, drug delivery, immune assays, biosensors, gene therapy, diagnostics, their toxic effects, and bio-compatibility. We unravelled the possibility of using emerging data-driven methodologies (bigdata, artificial intelligence, machine learning, high-throughput experimentation, computational automation) as excellent sources for time, space, and complexity optimization. We also discussed ongoing clinical trials, related challenges, and the technical aspects that should be considered to improve the clinical fate of QDs and promising future research directions.}

abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most frequent cause of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a progressive decline in cognitive function that is associated with the formation of amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Gut microbiota comprises of a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal ecosystem. These microorganisms can participate in gut–brain axis activities, thereby affecting cognitive function and associated behaviours. Increasing evidence has indicated that gut dysbiosis can jeopardise host immune responses and promote inflammation, which may be an initiating factor for the onset and evolution of AD. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a promising resource which encompasses immense chemical diversity and multiple-target characteristics for the treatment of AD. Many TCMs regulate the gut microbiota during treatment of diseases, indicating that gut microbiota may be an important target for TCM efficacy. In this review, we summarised the role of the microbiota–gut–brain axis in the development of AD and the effects of TCM in treating AD by regulating the gut microbiota. We anticipate that this review will provide novel perspectives and strategies for future AD research and treatments.}

abstract = {Introduction
The Tibetan formula Jiuwei Qingpeng San (JWQPS) has been applied for severe respiratory infection with a centuries-old history and contemporarily applied for influenza induced pneumonia. Although it is empirically effective, its antiviral efficacy and the underlying mechanisms against influenza A (IAV) virus induced lung injury have not been elucidated yet.
Methods
The in vitro anti-viral activity of JWQPS against H1N1 was reflected by the detection of cell viability of PR8 infected BEAS-2B cells. A replication competent PR8 carrying Gaussia luciferase (PR8-Luci) was further utilized to infect BEAS-2B cells to determine the inhibitory activity of virus replication by detection of the intensity of bioluminescence that correlates with viral load. Transcriptome was utilized to analyze the differences of the gene expression profiles in BEAS-2B cell line between the groups with or without JWQPS treatment after PR8 infection. BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with 60 or 150 p.f.u. of PR8 and intragastric administered with JWQPS (400 mg/kg/day, 200 mg/kg/day, 100 mg/kg/day). The mice infected with lethal dosages of 60 p.f.u. were monitored and weighed daily for 14 days and the survival rates were calculated. Concentrations of Nucleoprotein (NP) of IAV in BALF that stand for viral load were determined at 3 or 6 d.p.i. by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Interferons and lymphotactin in the BALF collected at 3 d.p.i. were detected with the corresponding ELISA kits. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF collected at 6 d.p.i. were detected using Th1/Th2 Cytokine 11-Plex Mouse ProcartaPlex Panel. The numbers of leukocyte in BALF were counted by an automated blood cell counter. The lung tissues of mice that were not subjected to BALF collection were harvested at 6 d.p.i. to check lung lesions by hematoxylin-eosin staining and lung coefficient calculation.
Results
JWQPS inhibited IAV replication in vitro, down regulated NP in BALF of H1N1 infected BALB/c mice and protected the mice from IAV caused death. The elevated level of lymphotactin, IFN-γ and lymphocytes in BALF were observed 3 days post infection after JWQPS administration. The improved lung lesions, the alleviated leukocytes infiltration, and the decreased pro-inflammatory levels were observed 6 days post infection. Transcriptomic analysis of H1N1 infected lung epithelial cell line revealed JWQPS treatment could dramatically regulate the genes involved in defense response to virus and interferon associated signaling pathways.
Discussion
Our study indicated that JWQPS could promote the chemotactic effect of lymphocytes towards site of infection to eliminate the pathogen at early phase of infection and alleviate the development of inflammation thereafter by reducing the occurrence of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the pulmonary alveoli by a rather complicated regulatory network in immune responses.}
