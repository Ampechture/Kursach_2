abstract = {Health policy studies usually conceptualise access to medicines as a result of the institutional configuration of policies, legislation, and pharmaceutical markets. This study adopts a different approach that stems from the sociology of health and Science and Technology Studies (STS). Based on an ethnographically inspired qualitative research of access practices of patients with oncological and rare diseases in Russia, we argue that access to medicines is a fluid and unstable trajectory constructed by the everyday practices of patients. Instead of seeing patients as passive recipients of institutionally arranged access, we focus on their practices of building access and identify four types of work they do to steer their access trajectories in the desired direction. These types of work include persisting work, complying work, adjusting work, and knowing work. In many studies of access, these types of work remain invisible, and thus the efforts and skills that patients need to make access possible remain unnoticed, undervalued, and unaccounted for.}

abstract = {Background
Quality of care in nursing homes (NHs), and especially the quality of the medicines’ pathway, remains a concern.
Objectives
To develop a quality assessment instrument to support NHs to evaluate the quality of their medicines’ pathway, and to formulate recommendations for its implementation.
Methods
A stepwise approach was used. First, a performance questionnaire for coordinating physicians, pharmacists and head nurses was developed, alongside a set of quality indicators (QIs). Next, a feasibility study regarding the QIs was performed in 4 NHs, followed by two pilot studies to optimize the instrument (in 14 and 9 NHs, respectively). Focus groups were held to formulate recommendations for instrument implementation.
Results
The QI feasibility and first pilot study showed that the clarity and feasibility of QIs was insufficient. All QIs were therefore integrated in the performance questionnaire. The first pilot study also showed low response rates for certain questions in the performance questionnaire and resulted in a revision of questions with the aim to target the right type of healthcare professional, including quality coordinators and general practitioners. The final instrument targets all involved healthcare professionals (i.e. coordinating physicians, pharmacists, head nurses, general practitioners, and quality coordinators), and applies a sequential approach: a quick scan to set priorities, followed by a detailed scan to detect specific working points. The second pilot study showed appreciation for this approach. Last, five recommendations were made to promote the instrument's implementation.
Conclusions
A series of feasibility and pilot studies allowed the stepwise optimization of a quality assessment instrument for the medicines' pathway in NHs and resulted in modifications to improve its clarity and feasibility. Participants’ recommendations will promote the successful implementation of the quality assessment instrument.}

The ethnic knowledge on controlling and treating internal parasites is of value to sustainable and organic product production which are essential for long-term prosperity of goat farmers. Using participatory approaches, this study identified and documented popular plants used by farmers to control internal parasites in goats in the Ngamiland region of Botswana. A total of 120 communal farmers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of demographic parameters and ethnobotanical information. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and the most popular plants were identified using fidelity levels (FL). Most of the informants were secondary educated males of 50 to 60 years and relied on livestock for their livelihoods. It was recorded that a total of 13 local plant species from 11 families are commonly used in the treatment of intestinal parasites in goats. The plant family Fabaceae (27.3 %) was common among the farmers. The roots (76.9 %) were the most frequently used plant part while decoction (46 %) was popular in medicinal preparations. The prepared plant-based medicine is often administered orally. The highest FL values were found for the following plant species; Terminalia sericea, Gnidia capitata and Aloe ferox, scoring 89.3 %, 88.0 % and 86.3 %, respectively. The safety and efficacy of these plants should be validated to inform strategic utilization and alternative cost-effective strategy in managing internal parasites in Botswana.}

Bayh-Dole’s passage provided the means and incentive that would shape the development of both Intellectual Property policy and the fields of biotechnology and precision medicine. We examined the legislative history and relevant judicial review to clarify the considerations and circumstances surrounding the transformation of the legal schema that serves as the foundation and framework of US Intellectual Property. Followed by an inspection of pivotal patent portfolios to demonstrate the utility and merits of the legal implementation, as well as the extralegal influence these patents had on the progression of IP in Precision Medicine. Intellectual Property is generally categorized into four main types consisting of: Patent, Copyright, Trademark and Trade Secret. Through a combination of these mediums with other legal devices such as the contract, we form an Intellectual Property toolbox and cover proprietary strategies and their considerations on how to navigate the patent application process.}

Using local plant leaves as therapeutic agents, this research explores the importance of traditional Tamil medicine. Traditional healers and practitioners can benefit from technological advances and collaborate with modern healthcare systems through these advances. Based on deep learning models, a novel approach for recognizing leaves of traditional Tamil medicinal plants is presented. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly paying attention to plants that contain medicinal factors that have fewer side effects during treatment. By identifying plants with medicinal factors and identifying their medicinal uses, this work addresses the identification of plants with medicinal factors. To classify medicinal plants and their uses, we will use deep learning models and image processing techniques to identify Tamil Traditional Medical Plant (TTMP). The input dataset for this work includes 18 different traditional Tamil plant leaves such as Azadirachta Indica (Neem), Ocimum Tenuiflorum (Tulsi) and Trigonella Foenum-graecum (Fenugreek). Pre-processing steps are performed on the input plant image, including RBZR Augmentation, noise removal and grayscale conversion, to detect the image area that is important for plant type identification. To identify the core area of the plant, this work using the HGAW Segmentation algorithm. Deep learning model is trained with segmented plants and their labels as inputs. The aim is to digitize and make accessible ancestral medical knowledge by incorporating deep learning-based leaf recognition with 96.71% accuracy for the proposed EEXR model.}

Studies show that although the presence of women in the medical field has risen, there is a lesser representation of women within editorial boards of journals. Studies on this subject have mostly been carried out related to the medical field of the researcher. It is not known what position the emergency medicine department is in this regard compared to other departments. We aimed to investigate whether gender disparity exists within the editors and editorial board members of medical journals, especially in those related to emergency medicine.
Methods
In the present cross-sectional study, we searched medical journals using the Scimago Journal/Country Rank journal system for comparison. The websites of the journals included in the study were searched, and gender data of the editor and editorial board, associate editors, consultant editors, and section editors for each journal were obtained.
Results
The total number of journals examined in this study was 276. The median percentage of female editorial board members (20.8%; 50–100) was lower in emergency medicine journals compared to other branches of medicine (31%; 0–100) (p < .001). The median percentage of female editorial board members and editors was also lower in the emergency medicine field (20.6%; 0–50) (p < .001) than in other branches of medicine. The percentage of female editorial board members of emergency medicine journals was 19.5% with the third-lowest ranking among 26 branches. When both the editors and editorial board members were considered, the highest female percentage was found in pediatrics (50.7%) followed by geriatric medicine (43.4%).
Conclusion
There is a significant gender disparity within editors and editorial board members in emergency medicine journals. The proportion of women within the editorial board was found to be lower in emergency medicine journals among all the journals included in the study.}

abstract = {Objectives
In 2017, the government of Ukraine introduced the new Affordable Medicines Program (AMP) for outpatient prescription medicines reimbursement. Despite the evident program implementation benefits, it is highly important to examine the AMP framework to reveal its current tendencies, strengths, and shortcomings that might be useful to support further development and improvement of reimbursement models. This study aimed to evaluate how the pricing strategies applied by the AMP framework might affect the potential to provide patients with affordable medicines.
Methods
The AMP framework has been evaluated by several parameters characterizing the pricing mechanisms, pharmaceutical manufacturers, the scope of medicines covered by the program, and consumption volumes. The data were collected from official government databases and open sources. The statistics assessment was applied.
Results
In 2017 to 2021, the AMP demonstrated extensive growth of the number of medicines covered, consumption volumes, and the scope of international nonproprietary names reimbursed. The pricing limits used by the AMP framework proportionally were correlated with the number of manufacturers involved. At the same time, the number of medicines containing reimbursed international nonproprietary names but not being covered by the program has been decreasing.
Conclusions
The AMP framework significantly influences the pharmaceutical market and the potential to provide patients with a wider scope of essential medicines while effectively managing government and patients’ healthcare spending. There is a need for the AMP re-evaluation tool enabling timely diagnosing of its shortcomings, assessing the effectiveness and helping to implement its targeted development according to pharmaceutical market tendencies and achievement of desirable patient’s health outcomes.}

The immune inflammatory response throughout the course of AS has been evidenced by studies, in which a large number of immune cells and inflammatory factors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AS. The inflammation related to AS is mainly mediated by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α, hs-CRP, SAA), inflammatory enzymes (Lp-PLA2, sPLA2-IIA, MMPs), and inflammatory signaling pathways (P38 MAPK signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, TLR2/4 signaling pathway). It is involved in the pathophysiological process of AS, and the degree of inflammation measured by it can be used to evaluate the risk of progression of AS plaque instability. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown the advantage of minimal side effects in immune regulation and has made some progress in the prevention and treatment of AS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as self-renewal, highly differentiated, and pluripotent stem cells with anti-inflammatory properties and immune regulation, have been widely used for AS treatment. They also play an important inflammation-immune regulatory function in AS. Notably, in terms of regulating immune cells and inflammatory factors, compared with TCM and its compound, the combination therapy has obvious anti-inflammatory advantages over the use of MSCs alone. It is an important means to further improve the efficacy of AS and provides a new way for the prevention and treatment of AS.}

During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals were caring for increasing numbers of patients with a novel and highly contagious respiratory illness, forcing adaptations in care delivery. The objective of this study was to understand the impact of these adaptations on patient safety in hospital medicine.
Methods
The authors conducted a nationwide survey to understand patient safety challenges experienced by hospital medicine clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed to members of the Society of Hospital Medicine via an e-mail listserv. It consisted of closed- and open-ended questions to elicit respondents’ experience in five domains: error reporting and communication, staffing, equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation practices, and infrastructure. Quantitative questions were reported as counts and percentages; qualitative responses were coded and analyzed for relevant themes.
Results
Of 196 total responses, 167 respondents (85.2%) were attending physicians and 85 (43.8%) practiced at teaching hospitals. Safety concerns commonly identified included nursing shortages (71.0%), limiting patient interactions to conserve PPE (61.9%), and feeling that one was practicing in a more hazardous environment (61.4%). In free-text responses, clinicians described poor outcomes and patient decompensation due to provider and equipment shortages, as well as communication lapses and diagnostic errors resulting from decreased patient contact and the need to follow isolation protocols.
Conclusion
Efforts made to accommodate shortages in staff and equipment, adapt to limited PPE, and enforce isolation policies had unintended consequences that affected patient safety and created a more hazardous environment characterized by less efficient care, respiratory decompensations, diagnostic errors, and poor communication with patients.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate whether the process of conferring academic rank or components of the promotion packet contribute to the lack of parity in academic advancement for women and individuals underrepresented in medicine (URMs).
Patients and Methods
We retrospectively reviewed prospective promotion applications to the position of associate professor or professor at Mayo Clinic from January 2, 2015, through July 1, 2019. Individuals with doctorate degrees who applied for either rank were included in the study. Data collected included demographic characteristics, curriculum vitae at time of application, committee score sheets, and deferral and approval decisions. Deferral rates for women compared with men and for URMs compared with non-URMs was the primary outcome.
Results
Of 462 people who applied for associate professor, 10% (n=46) were deferred. Those promoted had worked longer at Mayo Clinic (median, 6 years vs 2 years; P=.01), had more mentees (median, 6 vs 4; P=.02), authored more publications (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 39 [32-52] vs 30 [24-35]; P<.001), and were more likely to be on a National Institutes of Health or institutional grant (P<.05). Of the 320 people who applied for professor, 8.8% (n=28) were deferred. Those promoted had authored more publications (median [IQR], 77 [60-99] vs 56 [44-66]; P<.001) and were less likely to hold an elected office to a professional society (22.6% vs 39.3%; P=.05). There was no significant association between deferral status and sex (P>.4) or race/ethnicity (P>.9) for either rank.
Conclusion
The process for academic advancement for professorships does not contribute to the gap in promotion rates for women and URMs.}

abstract = {Aims
To examine national trends in glucose lowering medicine (GLM) use among older people with diabetes in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) during 2009–2019.
Methods
A repeated cross-sectional study of individuals ≥65 years with diabetes in Australian LTCFs (n = 140,322) was conducted. Annual age-sex standardised prevalence of GLM use and number of defined daily doses (DDDs)/1000 resident-days were estimated. Multivariable Poisson or Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs).
Results
Prevalence of GLM use remained steady between 2009 (63.9%, 95 %CI 63.3–64.4) and 2019 (64.3%, 95 %CI 63.9–64.8) (aRR 1.00, 95 %CI 1.00–1.00). The percentage of residents receiving metformin increased from 36.0% (95 %CI 35.3–36.7) to 43.5% (95 %CI 42.9–44.1) (aRR 1.01, 95 %CI 1.01–1.01). Insulin use also increased from 21.5% (95 %CI 21.0–22.0) to 27.0% (95 %CI 26.5–27.5) (aRR 1.02, 95 %CI 1.02–1.02). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor use increased from 1.0% (95 %CI 0.9–1.1) to 21.1% (95 %CI 20.7–21.5) (aRR 1.24, 95 %CI 1.24–1.25), while sulfonylurea use decreased from 34.4% (95 %CI 33.8–35.1) to 19.3% (95 %CI 18.9–19.7) (aRR 0.93, 95 %CI 0.93–0.94). Similar trends were observed in DDDs/1000 resident days.
Conclusions
The increasing use of insulin and ongoing use of sulfonylureas suggests a need to implement evidence-based strategies to optimise diabetes care in LTCFs.}

Sri Lankan traditional medicine uses Vernonia zeylanica and Mallotus repandus broadly for the treatment of a multitude of disease conditions, including wound healing.
Aim of the study
We aimed to scientifically validate the safety and efficacy of wound healing of an aqueous distillate of Vernonia zeylanica and Mallotus repandus (ADVM) mature leaves, tested on primary human dermal fibroblasts.
Materials and methods
Human dermal fibroblasts isolated from clinical waste from circumcision surgery were characterized by flowcytometry and trilineage differentiation. The MTT dye reduction assay, and the ex vivo wound healing scratch assay established wound healing properties of ADVM using the primary human dermal fibroblast cell line. Upregulation of genes associated with wound healing (MMP3, COL3A1, TGFB1, FGF2) were confirmed by RT qPCR. GC-MS chromatography evaluated the phytochemical composition of ADVM.
Results
Compared to the synthetic stimulant, β fibroblast growth factor, ADVM at 0.25% concentration on the primary dermal fibroblast cell line exhibited significant ex vivo, (i) 1.7-fold % cell viability (178.7% vs 304.3 %, p < 0.001), (ii) twofold greater % wound closure (%WC) potential (47.74% vs 80.11%, p < 0.001), and (iii) higher rate of % WC (3.251 vs 3.456 % WC/h, p < 0.05), sans cyto-genotoxicity. Up regulated expression of FGF2, TGFB1, COL3A1 and MMP3, genes associated with wound healing, confirmed effective stimulation of pathways of the three overlapping phases of wound healing (P < 0.05). GC-MS profile of ADVM characterized four methyl esters, which may be posited as wound healing phytochemicals.
Conclusions
Exceeding traditional medicine claims, the ex vivo demonstration of rapid skin regeneration, reiterated by upregulated expression of genes related to wound healing pathways, sans cytotoxicity, propounds ADVM, cued from traditional medicine, as a potential safe and effective natural stimulant for rapid wound-healing. Additionally, it may serve as an effective proliferative stimulant of dermal fibroblasts for cell therapy, with potential in reparative and regenerative therapy of skin disorders.}

abstract = {Under physiological or pathological conditions, transient receptor potential (TRP) channel vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) possess the ability to detect a vast array of stimuli and execute diverse functions. Interestingly, increasing works have reported that activation of TRPV1 and TRPA1 could also be beneficial for ameliorating postoperative ileus (POI). Increasing research has revealed that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is rich in TRPV1/TRPA1, which can be stimulated by capsaicin, allicin and other compounds. This activation stimulates a variety of neurotransmitters, leading to increased intestinal motility and providing protective effects against GI injury. POI is the most common emergent complication following abdominal and pelvic surgery, and is characterized by postoperative bowel dysfunction, pain, and inflammatory responses. It is noteworthy that natural herbs are gradually gaining recognition as a potential therapeutic option for POI due to the lack of effective pharmacological interventions. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on the TRPV1/TRPA1 channel, and an analysis and summary of the processes and mechanism by which natural herbs activate TRPV1/TRPA1 to enhance GI motility and relieve pain are provided, which will lay the foundation for the development of natural herb treatments for this disease.}

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. In Hong Kong, the proportion of deaths caused by cerebrovascular disease accounted for approximately 6.8% of total deaths. Although integrative medicine approaches are widely adapted by patients, there is a lack of guideline to support the corresponding clinical practice for stroke management and rehabilitation. Therefore, we design this framework for the development of an integrative medicine clinical practice guideline (CPG) for stroke.
Methods
The framework follows the instructions of World Health Organization (WHO) handbook for guideline development, Guideline International Network (GIN), Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II), and Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare (RIGHT). Three stages with ten steps are conducted.
Conclusion
Clinical practice guidelines are essential to provide optimal recommendations for patients’ prognosis. With proper methodology, this framework will facilitate the formation of clinical practice guideline for stroke through synthesizing evidences in the scope of integrative medicine.}

To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the utilization of Lianhua Qingwen in COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, a meta-analysis was performed to assess its effects. Our findings indicate that when used in conjunction with western medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, Lianhua Qingwen may potentially reduce the duration of fever, minimize adverse events, lower the risk of progression to severe disease, and contribute to improved symptom recovery and chest radiographic signs of pneumonia.}

The worldwide use of natural remedies is an alternative therapeutic solution to strengthen immunity, fight, and prevent this disease. The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease worldwide has promoted the search for therapeutic solutions following different approaches. China and Benin have seen the use of natural remedies such as Chinese herbal medicine and local endemic plants as alternative solutions in treating COVID-19.
Aim of the study
The present study was designed to identify the prevalence of medicinal plant use in four municipalities of Benin most affected by COVID-19 and compare them with traditional Chinese medicine and finally verify the efficacy of the main components of the six plants most frequently used, via in vitro experiments.
Materials and methods
This study targeting market herbalists and traditional healers was conducted in the form of an ethnomedicinal survey in four representative communities (Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Zè, and Ouidah) of southern Benin. The chemical compositions of the six most commonly used herbs were investigated using network pharmacology. Network-based global prediction of disease genes and drug, target, function, and pathway enrichment analysis of the top six herbs was conducted using databases including IPA and visualised using Cytoscape software. The natural botanical drugs involved three medicines and three formulas used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China from the published literature were compared with the top six botanical drugs used in Benin to identify similarities between them and guide the clinical medication in both countries. Finally, the efficacy of the common ingredients in six plants was verified by measuring the viability of BEAS-2B cells and the release of inflammatory factors after administration of different ingredients. Binding abilities of six components to COVID-19 related targets were verified by molecular docking.
Results
According to the medication survey investigation, the six most used herbs were Citrus aurantiifolia (13.18%), Momordica charantia (7.75%), Ocimum gratissimum (7.36%), Crateva adansonii (6.59%), Azadirachta indica (5.81%), and Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides (5.42%). The most represented botanical families were Rutaceae, Lamiaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Meliaceae, and Capparaceae. The network pharmacology of these six herbal plants showed that the flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, and β-sitosterol were the main active ingredients of the Benin herbal medicine. Chinese and Beninese herbal medicine are similar in that they have the same targets and pathways in inflammation and oxidative stress relief. Mild COVID-19-related targets come from C. aurantiifolia and M. charantia, and severe COVID-19-related targets come from A. indica A. Juss. Cell viability and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results confirmed that six major compounds could protect BEAS-2B cells against injury by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors, among which quercetin and isoimperatorin were more effective. Docking verified that the six compounds have good binding potential with COVID-19 related targets.
Conclusions
These results suggest that Benin herbal medicine and Chinese herbal medicine overlap in compounds, targets, and pathways to a certain extent. Among the commonly used plants in Benin, C. aurantiifolia and M. charantia may have a good curative effect on the treatment of mild COVID-19, while for severe COVID-19, A. indica can be added on this basis.}

abstract = {Rationale & Objective
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intake is widely prevalent in many parts of India. Heavy metals are known ingredients in some of these formulations. We studied the spectrum of glomerular diseases in patients using CAM.
Study Design
Case series.
Setting & Participants
Patients with proteinuria or unexplained acute kidney injury, who underwent a kidney biopsy between May 2021 and September 2022, and who provided a history of recent CAM intake were included in the study. For patients enrolled prospectively, blood and urine samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry for the presence of mercury, lead, arsenic and cadmium. The CAM formulation, when available, was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy.
Results
Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in the study, with a median duration of CAM intake of 4 months (interquartile range, 2-6 months). Heavy metal screening was performed in 17 patients, of whom 15 had elevated urine mercury levels, 10 had elevated blood mercury levels, and 1 had elevated blood and urine arsenic levels. Of the 6 CAM formulations that were analyzed, all had high levels of mercury. Kidney biopsy findings were membranous nephropathy (n=19), minimal change disease (n=8), and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (n=1). Of the 19 patients with membranous nephropathy, 14 were associated with neural epidermal growth factor-like protein 1 (NELL-1). With conservative management alone, 17 patients achieved complete remission.
Limitations
Not all patients underwent blood and urine mercury testing, and only 6 patients provided the CAM samples for analysis. Furthermore, occupational and residential exposure to mercury could not be excluded.
Conclusions
The most common kidney pathology noted in our study was membranous nephropathy, which was predominantly associated with neural epidermal growth factor-like protein 1. A significant proportion of the patients recovered completely after withdrawal of the offending agent and initiation of renin-angiotensin system blockade.
Plain Language Summary
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intake is widely prevalent in many parts of India, and heavy metals are known ingredients in some of these formulations. We describe the clinical spectrum of kidney disease, among patients who had recently ingested CAM. All patients underwent a kidney biopsy, and the most common finding was an entity called “NELL-1-associated membranous nephropathy,” which is known to be associated with heavy metal toxicity and CAM intake. Of 17 patients screened for such heavy metals, 15 had greater-than-permissible levels of mercury. Furthermore, 6 patients provided the CAM formulations that they had consumed for analysis: all contained high levels of mercury. Most such patients recovered following withdrawal of the offending CAM agent.}

We provide a review of anthropological work in primary care and offer empirical data from two ethnographic case studies based in the United States, one focused on social risk screening in primary care and the other examining the diagnosis and care of people with dementia in primary care. Through these cases, we demonstrate how research of and within primary care can open important avenues for the study of the multidimensionality of primary care. This multidimensionality is apparent in the ways the medical field addresses the social and structural experiences of patients, scope of practice and disciplinary boundaries, and the intersection of ordinary and extraordinary medicine that emerge in the care of patients in primary care.}

abstract = {Objective
To perform a bibliometric analysis of published research related to the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods
Research documents related to the use of TCM for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 published up to September 19, 2021, were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Bibliometrix R 4.0 software package was used to analyze data, including countries of publication, research institutions, journals, citations, and keywords. Further analysis was conducted to identify co-occurrence of keywords in the documents, including their titles and abstracts. Cooperative network analyses of authors, institutions, and countries of publication were also conducted. The classification types were statistically analyzed and the research progress of key TCMs was reviewed.
Results
A total of 417 documents were included in our analysis. Of these, 85.13% originated in China. Of the 417 documents, 148 (35.5%) were published in journals with impact factors in quartile 1 and 164 (39.3%) in journals in quartile 2. The documents were mainly published in journals categorized as Medicine. The results of network analysis showed close cooperation between institutions and countries. Excluding disease- and drug-related keywords, the top four keywords were ‘Systematic review’, ‘Network pharmacology’, ‘Medicine’ and ‘Molecular docking’. Keyword co-occurrence analysis showed 4 main keywords association groups. Statistical analysis of the TCM studies showed that Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Qingfei Paidu decoction, Shufeng Jiedu capsules and ReDuNing injection were the most studied Chinese medicines. Lianhua Qingwen capsules, Qingfei Paidu decoction, ReDuNing injection, and Shufeng Jiedu capsules were used in clinical, bioinformatics, and basic research. Toujie Quwen granule, Jinhua Qinggan granule, Shuanghuanglian oral liquid, Tanreqing injection, and Xuanfei Baidu decoction were used in clinical and bioinformatics research, although basic research on their mechanisms of action is lacking.
Conclusion
Research intensity and recognition, as well as cooperation, in the field of Chinese medicine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has increased. Research types are generally comprehensive, and investigated several TCM formulations that are specifically recommended by Chinese COVID-19 guidelines. However, comprehensive, in-depth research on their molecular mechanisms of action is still lacking. More basic research is thus needed to identify therapeutic mechanisms to standardize and validate the use of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.}

Patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 were randomly allocated to a control group receiving symptomatic therapy or a Kampo group receiving kakkonto (2.5 g) with shosaikotokakikyosekko (2.5 g) three times daily in addition to symptomatic therapy. The data of 161 patients (Kampo group, n = 81; control group, n = 80) were analyzed post hoc for the time to symptom disappearance. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard estimates of disappearance of symptoms showed that all and each symptom targeted in this study disappeared faster in the Kampo group than in the control group, although not statistically significant (all symptomatic cases; hazard ratio [HR] 3.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46−29.98, log-rank p = 0.1763).

abstract = {Summary
Diabetes is a highly heterogeneous condition; yet, it is diagnosed by measuring a single blood-borne metabolite, glucose, irrespective of aetiology. Although pragmatically helpful, disease classification can become complex and limit advances in research and medical care. Here, we describe diabetes heterogeneity, highlighting recent approaches that could facilitate management by integrating three disease models across all forms of diabetes, namely, the palette model, the threshold model and the gradient model. Once diabetes has developed, further worsening of established diabetes and the subsequent emergence of diabetes complications are kept in check by multiple processes designed to prevent or circumvent metabolic dysfunction. The impact of any given disease risk factor will vary from person-to-person depending on their background, diabetes-related propensity, and environmental exposures. Defining the consequent heterogeneity within diabetes through precision medicine, both in terms of diabetes risk and risk of complications, could improve health outcomes today and shine a light on avenues for novel therapy in the future.}

abstract = {Purpose
Viral myocarditis (VMC) is a life-threatening disease that can affect all ages and genders, with middle-aged adults being particularly susceptible. Numerous systematic reviews have been conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in treating adult viral myocarditis (AVM). The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the efficacy and safety of CHM for AVM.
Methods
A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across 8 electronic databases from their inception to June 23, 2022, augmented by manual searches of the gray literature. Systematic reviews were independently selected and data extracted in accordance with predetermined criteria by 2 reviewers. Included systematic reviews were assessed for methodologic and reporting quality using Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The quality of evidence relating to outcome measures was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool. Recalculation of effect sizes and subsequent determination of 95% CIs were conducted with either a fixed-effects or random-effects model.
Findings
The current overview of systematic reviews included a total of 6 systematic reviews, which reported on 67 RCTs with a participant pool of 5611 individuals. The findings of our study indicate that the combination of CHM and Western medications had positive effects on the effective rate, cure rate, ECG recovery, atrial premature contraction/premature ventricular contraction, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial enzymes, and improvement of clinical symptoms for AVM. The adverse drug reactions in the combination therapy group were generally less than or lighter than that in the Western medication group (relative risk = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.44-1.40; P > 0.05, I2 = 0).
Implications
Our research results provide evidence that combining CHM with Western medicine could offer potential benefits for patients with AVM. However, the number of studies included in our review is limited and the methodologic quality of these studies is modest. Therefore, there are potential uncertainties regarding the conclusion that CHM with Western medication may benefit patients with AVM. We call for more large-scale, high-quality studies with standardized designs to further verify and support our findings. This would promote a better understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of CHM and provide reliable reference evidence for clinical practice and policy making. Moreover, future research should explore optimal drug combinations, examine therapeutic doses and durations of CHM combination therapy, and evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety.}

When false results are reported, these can lead to an adverse reaction to blood components. Good performance assessment practices are essential for this kind of scenario, and they still remain as one of the many unmet high-priority challenges in this area. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current trends in this field. A review of the IFCC-IUPC. qualitative vocabulary was carried out, and a particular focus was given to the evaluation protocols CLSI EP12-A3 and Eurachem AQA, such as the European Union Regulation for class D in vitro diagnostic medical devices. There is a consistency between the current protocols and recognized performance assessment principles, which are mandatory in transfusion service labs. We believe that a revised imprecision interval approach and models based on emerging qualitative test types may prove beneficial in the long run. It is also important to emphasize the uncertainty of proportions to mitigate the risk of misclassification.}

abstract = {Background
About 30% of pulmonary stage IV adenocarcinomas die within 3 months of diagnosis. Western medical treatments with Platinum-Based Chemotherapy=PBC and tyrosine-kinase inhibitors Targeted Therapy=TT can improve prognosis. In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine herbal treatments (TCM) are often used in addition to PBC and TT. A considerable number of patients refuse Western medical treatments and use TCM alone. However, the survival impact of the latter is unknown.
Hypotheses tested
Treatment with TCM alone is prognostically superior to PBC alone. Addition of PBC or TT or both TT to TCM improves survival.
Methods
In this prospective observational, non-interventional study of 1017 consecutive first-onset stage IV NSCLC patients with up to 10 years follow-up, 261 who Died of Disease (DOD) within 3 months were omitted, as they never got the optimal Western medical therapies. All 218 non-adenocarcinomas were also omitted, leaving 538 stage IV adenocarcinomas treated by TCM alone (n = 29), PBC alone (N = 19) and TCM and other Western medical combinations (299 TCM and PBC, 50 TCM and TT, 141 TCM and PBC and TT) with 3 – 120 months follow-up. Survivals were compared using Alive with Disease (AWD) and DOD as endpoints.
Results
The patients treated only with TCM had 7 months better median survival than those that received PBC alone (17 and 10 months). The patients that received TCM and PBC had a better median survival (24 months) than TCM alone and much better than PBC alone. None of the patients that received TCM alone survived > 54 months, whereas 18% of TCM and PBC patients survived much longer. Over the observation period of 3 – 120 months, survivals of TCM and TT, TCM and PBC and TT, and TCM and PBC were not different and therefore grouped as TCM and Western medicines. Median survival times of PBC alone and TCM alone were lower than that of TCM and Western medical treatments (p < 0.0001, 10, 17 and 27 months).
Conclusions
Pulmonary stage IV adenocarcinoma patients with at least 3 months survival, treated with TCM alone have a significantly better survival than those treated with PBC alone. Adding Western PBC, TT or both to TCM further improves prognosis.}

abstract = {Purpose
This multidisciplinary study seeks to determine the nature and structure of the informal markets for counterfeit medicines, the co-factors underpinning the demand and supply of counterfeit Western allopathic medicines (WAM), traditional and alternative medicines (TAM), and potential institutional responses in Ghana.
Method
This study is based on an interpretive research approach. It deploys a synthesis of a longitudinal ethnographic fieldwork, with multiple repeated visits for observations, analysis of documents, interviews, and focus group discussions.
Findings
The study identifies five major inter-related discoveries that point to the need for urgent institutional responses: Approaches to global health governance pay little attention to the complex economic gamut of TAM, including herbal medicines. The rise in necessity entrepreneurship and the availability of easy-to-use packaging and advertising technologies have made TAM a major competitor of WAM. The informal markets for WAM and TAM are structured in ways that allow them to evade formalized interventions and regulations. Standardization allows destructive entrepreneurs to derive advantage from economies of scale and reduce production costs, allowing the sector to flourish with little economic risk while inflicting violence on consumers. Personalization and co-creation of medicine with consumers has the added psychological effect of increasing consumer confidence. This, however, enlists consumers in the market violence against themselves.
Social implications
Destructive entrepreneurship, whether inadvertent or criminal creates benefits for groups and individuals but negatively affects public health on various levels.
Originality
Mitigation and interventions that ignore the informal TAM market of destructive entrepreneurship only answer a part of the big question of how to guarantee patient/consumer safety from the threats of all counterfeits.}

abstract = {Study objective
The influence of workplace mistreatment on the well-being and career satisfaction of emergency medicine residents is unknown. This study examined the relationships between burnout, career choice regret, and workplace mistreatment in a national sample of emergency medicine residents.
Methods
This was a secondary analysis of a survey study on the prevalence of workplace mistreatment among emergency residents. Residents who reported emotional exhaustion or depersonalization at least once per week were considered to have burnout. Residents who reported dissatisfaction with their decision to become an emergency physician were considered to have career choice regret. Respondents also reported the type (discrimination, abuse, sexual harassment) and frequency of mistreatment over the academic year. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for program characteristics, was used to examine resident characteristics associated with burnout and career choice regret, with the frequency of mistreatment as a covariate.
Results
Of the 8,162 eligible residents, 7,680 (94.1 %) participated. About a third of respondents reported burnout (2,188 of 6,902, 31.7%), whereas a minority (224 of 6,923, 3.2%) reported career choice regret. Of the 7,087 responses on mistreatment frequency, 2,117 (29.9%) reported “a few times per year,” and 1,296 (18.3%) reported “a few times per month or more.” Compared with residents who never experienced mistreatment, residents who reported increasing frequencies of mistreatment were associated with having burnout—from mistreatment a few times per year (OR [odds ratio],1.6; 99% CI [confidence interval], 1.3 to 1.9) to a few times per month or more (OR, 3.3; 99% CI, 2.7 to 4.1). Compared with residents without burnout, residents who reported burnout were associated with having career choice regret (OR, 11.3; 99% CI, 7.0 to 18.1). After adjusting for burnout, there were no significant relationships between the frequency of mistreatment and career choice regret.
Conclusions
Workplace mistreatment is associated with burnout, but not career choice regret, among emergency medicine residents. Efforts to address workplace mistreatment may improve emergency medicine residents’ professional well-being.}

Through ongoing collaboration with modern medicine, TCM has recently achieved many remarkable advancements in theoretical investigation, mechanistic research, and clinical applications related to kidney diseases. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic summary of TCM that focuses on sirtuins as the intervention target for kidney diseases is necessary. This review introduces the relationship between abnormal sirtuins levels and common kidney diseases, such as diabetic kidney disease and acute kidney injury.

Time has weakened strong foundations laid by Dame Cicely Saunders in research, education and clinical excellence. Clinical knowledge gaps are wide, and widening. Palliative medicine research is underfunded and underrepresented in discourse. Despite huge advances in modern medicine, there is still clinical uncertainty about simple interventions, such as whether artificial hydration at the end of life is helpful or harmful. Where good quality data do exist, the pace of change is slow, if change is happening at all. Trial design often fails to assess the holistic impact of interventions, using primary endpoints that are inconsistent with outcomes most valued to the patient. Recent years have seen a rapid expansion in innovation and investment in digital technologies, embraced by many in palliative medicine. Experience shows that caution must be applied where the evidence base is sparse. While as a specialty we must remain forward looking and progressive in our mindset, it cannot be assumed that these new interventions alone will provide the solutions to the old problems that exist in palliative medicine.

Bibliometrix R packages (3.1.4) and CiteSpace (6.0.R2) were used to extract and analyze co-citation reference networks, co-occurring keyword networks, co-authorship network, co-cited institutions, and co-cited journals. We retrieved a total of 2499 documents, published between 1975 and 2022. Co-cited reference networks showed four main clusters of highly cited topics: evidence synthesis of publications on sleep disorders in children and adolescents, sleep and neurological disorders, non-pharmacological treatments of sleep disturbances, and sleep and Covid-19 in youth. Co-occurring keyword networks showed an earlier focus on the neurophysiology of sleep/neurological disorders, followed by a trend on the association of sleep disturbances to neurodevelopmental disorders and behavioral aspects. Co-authorship network showed that Italian researchers in the field of pediatric sleep medicine tend to be highly collaborative internationally. Overall, Italian researchers have provided a crucial contribution to pediatric sleep medicine across a number of specific topics, spanning from neurophysiology to treatment, and from neurological to behavioral/psychopathological aspects.}

abstract = {Background
Antimicrobial resistance is a rapidly growing global issue affecting the effective treatment of infectious diseases. This provides a window of opportunity for the use and implementation of well researched effective complementary therapies such as herbal medicines. In this literature review, an overview is provided of the effectiveness of herbal medicine to control symptoms of urinary tract infections and reduce antibiotic use.
Methods
PubMed, CAM-Quest, CORE-Hom, ScienceDirect, CAMBase, Anthromedics.org and AnthroMedLibrary databases were searched for peer-reviewed meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials from 2005 till 8 October 2020. Included were clinical studies on the use of herbal medicine for clinically diagnosed urinary tract infection with any control group except another herbal medicine. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools.
Results
Of the 408 citations identified, 23 met the inclusion criteria: 5 meta-analyses, 3 systematic reviews and 15 randomized controlled trials. Of these studies 13 involved the use of cranberry products, 4 studies concerned traditional Chinese herbal medicines, and 6 studies dealt with other herbal medicines.
Conclusions
The latest published meta-analysis including 28 trials reports a clear benefit of Cranberry products for the prevention of recurrent UTIs in women. Five TCM formulas were found to be equally or more effective than antibiotics in the treatment of UTIs. Furthermore, Rosa canina seems to have the potential to prevent UTI in women undergoing a caesarean section. ‘Acidif Plus Tablets’ as well as ‘Canephron’ seem to be promising candidates for treating women with uncomplicated recurrent UTI.}

Antibiotics are one group of medicines where worries about access have been raised. Access to the right antibiotic at the right time is important not only for curing infections of individual patients, but also for curbing antibiotic resistance globally. Reliable pharmaceutical supply is key to ensuring access to medicines. The global supply of generic medicines has over the last decades been transformed by the rise of India's pharmaceutical industry. In this paper, I trace the changing role of this industry for the global export of antibiotics, by mapping and describing changes in Indian antibiotic exports and discussing these in light of historical processes and events. The paper offers a novel approach to analyse global antibiotic trajectories by using international trade data from publicly available resources combined with a secondary literature review. I show that India's pharmaceutical industry today holds a key role as one of the world's biggest exporters of antibiotic medicines, but with an increasing dependency on China as a supplier of antibiotic ingredients. This produces both opportunities and concerns for access to antibiotics globally.}

abstract = {Objectives
This work had the objective to evaluate the antiglycation and antioxidant potential of Cimicifuga racemosa L., Trifolium pratense L., Humulus lupulus L. and Morus nigra L., commonly used in traditional medicine for the treatment of climacteric symptoms.
Methods
Antioxidant activity was evaluated by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power, inhibition of lipid peroxidation thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging and inhibition of oxidative haemolysis test. The evaluation of antiglycation activity was performed by the determination of relative electrophoretic mobility of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with ribose and BSA with methylglyoxa in the presence and absence of Cu2+ ion. Total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were determined by spectrophotometric methods.
Results
The highest antioxidant activity for DPPH and ferric reducing antioxidant power test was detected in Humulus lupulus (83.56% and 46.95 µM TE/g dry extract, respectively). For the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, the lowest percentages of TBARS were found in M. nigra (4.82%) and H. lupulus (18.26%). C. racemosa presented the lowest nitrite formation (34.57 µmol/mL nitrite formed) in nitric oxide test. T. pratense presented the highest polyphenol (24.61 mg GAE/g dry extract) and flavonoid (22.79 mg RE/g dry extract) contents. For the oxidative haemolysis assay, the extracts showed concentration-dependent inhibitory capacity, while for the antiglycation activity all extracts showed antiglycation potential against glycation of BSA promoted by Ribose evaluated by the electrophoretic profile.
Conclusions
In view of the results obtained in this study, it was possible to verify that the dry extracts of herbal medicines used for climacteric symptoms present antioxidant and antiglycation activities, mainly due to the presence of phenols compounds in their composition.}

To maximize the potential applications of MSCs, materials science could provide natural extracellular matrices and provide an effective means to understand the various mechanisms of differentiation for the growth of MSCs. Pharmaceutical fields are represented among the research on biomaterials by macromolecule-based hydrogel nanoarchitectonics. Various biomaterials have been used to prepare hydrogels with their unique chemical and physical properties to provide a controlled microenvironment for the culture of MSCs, laying the groundwork for future practical applications in regenerative medicine. This article currently describes and summarizes the sources, characteristics, and clinical trials of MSCs. In addition, it describes the differentiation of MSCs in various macromolecule-based hydrogel nanoarchitectonics and highlights the preclinical studies of MSCs-loaded hydrogel materials in regenerative medicine conducted over the past few years. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MSC-loaded hydrogels are discussed, and the future development of macromolecule-based hydrogel nanoarchitectonics is outlined by comparing the current literature.}

abstract = {Introduction
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is significantly influenced by patient attitudes and beliefs. However, in Morocco, there is a lack of research specifically focusing on examining these attitudes and beliefs, which might differ in the local context. This study's main objective was to describe the attitudes and beliefs of cancer patients towards CAM and to identify the factors that influence these attitudes and beliefs within the Moroccan context.
Methods
Between February and July 2021, a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Beni Mellal regional oncology center in Morocco. The survey employed the validated tool known as the "Attitudes and Beliefs about Complementary and Alternative Medicine (ABCAM)" questionnaire. A total of 530 cancer patients participated in the survey, and their responses were analyzed using SPSS software. The analysis aimed to identify associations between independent variables and patients' attitudes and beliefs towards CAM.
Results
In our study, patients expressed a positive belief in the potential benefits but also perceived barriers associated with using CAM. The expected benefits of CAM were related to gender, problems accessing care, the presence of disease symptoms (P< 0.05), and comorbidities (P< 0.01). The perceived barriers were associated with the level of education, problems accessing care (P< 0.01), patients' economic status, treatment method (P = 0.000), health status (P < 0.05), and disease duration (P< 0.05). Subjective norms were associated with sex, place of residence, duration of cancer (P < 0.01), age, and problems accessing care (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Cancer patients exhibited high scores in both expected benefits and perceived barriers concerning CAM. These attitudes were significantly correlated to the socioeconomic and clinical characteristics of the patients, particularly their access to conventional medical care.}

To evaluate the risk factors of osteoporosis and establish a risk prediction model based on routine clinical information and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes.
Methods
Adults aged 30–82 who lived in 12 grass-roots communities or rural towns in Shanghai, Jilin Province, and Jiangsu Province from December 2019 to January 2022 through a multi-stage sampling method were included in this study. The risk factors and risk prediction of osteoporosis in women and men were explored and established by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression model. ROC curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to evaluate the prediction model.
Results
A total of 3000 subjects including 2243 females (75 %) and 757 males (25 %) were included in this study. The logistic prediction model of osteoporosis in women was Logit (P) = −2.946 + 0.960 (age ≥50 years old) + 0.633 (BMI ≥24 kg/m2) - 0.545 (daily exposure to sunlight >30 min) + 0.519 (no intake of dairy products) + 0.827 (coronary heart disease) + 0.383 (lumbar disc herniation) + 0.654 (no intake of calcium tablets and vitamin D) - 0.509 (insomnia) + 0.580 (flushed face and congested eyes) + 1.194 (thready and rapid pulse) + 1.309 (sunken and slow pulse). The logistic prediction model of osteoporosis in men was Logit (P) = −1.152–0.644 (daily exposure to sunlight >30 min) + 0.975 (no intake of calcium tablets and vitamin D) - 0.488 (insomnia). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of female and male osteoporosis prediction models was 0.743 and 0.679, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was >0.5.
Conclusions
There are some significant differences in risk factors between female and male patients with osteoporosis. The risk of osteoporosis are found to be associated with TCM syndromes, and osteoporosis risk prediction models based on routine clinical information and TCM syndrome is effective.}

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is widely used for treating coronary heart disease complicated with heart failure (CHD-HF). However, the exact mechanisms involved are still not fully understood.
Aim of the study
To assess the clinical effectiveness and potential pharmacological mechanisms of CHM for treating CHD-HF.
Methods
Eight databases were retrieved for Randomized Controlled Trials of CHM for CHD-HF published from their inception to March 2023. Quality assessment of include studies was performed by the Cochrane risk-of-bias. Meta-analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of CHM for CHD-HF, and then core drugs and active ingredients were selected by data mining and network pharmacology. Finally, cluster and enrichment analysis were adopted to explore the potential targets and signaling pathways.
Results
A total of 52 studies enrolling 5216 patients were included. Meta-analysis revealed that CHM treatment groups significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 6-min walk test (6-MWT), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) than control groups: [LVEF: SMD = 0.7, 95%CI (0.54, 0.87), p < 0.00001, I2 = 80%; 6-MWT: SMD = 0.72, 95%CI (0.58, 0.86), p < 0.0001, I2 = 67%; LVEDD: SMD = −0.79, 95%CI (−0.89, −0.69), p < 0.0001, I2 = 49%; LVESD: SMD = −0.6 (-0.74, −0.46), p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%]. The results of various biological information analysis showed the internal relationship between prescriptions, core drugs, active ingredients and therapeutic targets. Twelve core herbs with the most commonly use and high correlation were selected from 110 CHMs of 52 prescriptions for CHD-HF treatment, and further 65 effective components were screened out according to the most strength value, which were divided into 12 compounds such as terpenoids, flavonoids, steroids and alkaloids and etc. At the same time, 67 therapeutic targets of active ingredients in CHD-HF were filtrated. On these bases, cluster and enrichment analysis of the components and targets were used to explore relevant pharmacological mechanisms, mainly including anti-myocardial cell damage, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, anti-fibrosis, regulation of oxidative stress, anticoagulation and angiogenesis, and improvement of glucose and fatty acid metabolism.
Conclusion
CHM are effective in treating CHD-HF compared with conventional treatment. Some of the included studies have high risks in the implementation of blinding, so more high-quality studies are needed. The active ingredients of CHM could protect the myocardium and improve pathological environment of CHD-HF in various ways. And CHM has the advantage of multi-component and multi-target treatment for complex diseases.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Compassion fatigue is secondary traumatic distress experienced by providers from ongoing contact with patients who are suffering. Compassion satisfaction is emotional fulfillment from caring for others. Burnout is distress related to dissonance between job demands and available resources. Although burnout is well-studied, compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue are neglected components of physician well-being. Because of recurrent exposure to adverse outcomes, maternal–fetal medicine providers may be at particular risk for compassion fatigue.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to better characterize both clinical and nonclinical drivers of work-related distress vs satisfaction.
STUDY DESIGN
The modified Compassion Fatigue and Satisfaction Self-Test and a questionnaire of professional and personal characteristics were distributed electronically to maternal–fetal medicine providers nationally. Multivariable regression models were constructed for compassion fatigue, burnout, and compassion satisfaction as a function of potential predictors.
RESULTS
The survey response rate was 24% (n=366), primarily consisting of White physicians working in academic medical centers. Significant predictors of lower burnout scores included employment at 1 institution for >20 years, discussing work-related distress with friends, and having one's most recent involvement in decision-making for a periviable fetus >6 months ago; distress because of coworkers and personal factors predicted higher scores. Female sex, self-report of significant emotional depletion, use of mental health services, and having other maternal–fetal medicine physicians as part of the care team for a fetus with severe anomalies were significant predictors of higher compassion fatigue scores, whereas White race and having social work as part of the care team for a maternal mortality predicted lower scores. Personal spiritual practice was a significant predictor of higher compassion satisfaction score, whereas employment at current institution for <5 years predicted lower scores.
CONCLUSION
Compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout are associated with several modifiable risk factors, such as practice type, having a multidisciplinary team, and emotional support outside of the workplace; these are potential targets for intervention.}

This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) provides an overview of the mechanisms and treatment of obesity and hypertension.
Methods
The scientific support for this CPS is based upon published citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by the Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
Mechanisms contributing to obesity-related hypertension include unhealthful nutrition, physical inactivity, insulin resistance, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, renal dysfunction, vascular dysfunction, heart dysfunction, increased pancreatic insulin secretion, sleep apnea, and psychosocial stress. Adiposopathic factors that may contribute to hypertension include increased release of free fatty acids, increased leptin, decreased adiponectin, increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, increased 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, reduced nitric oxide activity, and increased inflammation.
Conclusions
Increase in body fat is the most common cause of hypertension. Among patients with obesity and hypertension, weight reduction via healthful nutrition, physical activity, behavior modification, bariatric surgery, and anti-obesity medications mostly decrease blood pressure, with the greatest degree of weight reduction generally correlated with the greatest degree of blood pressure reduction.}

abstract = {Background
Hypertension has become a part of the lives of many people worldwide. With the development, an increasing number of people have begun to control their hypertension through products of medicine food homology, such as Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD). However, there has been no objective review of the regulation of hypertension by BYHWD.
Methods
As of 9 October 2023, this review made a detailed search of nine databases to look for random controlled trials (RCTs) focused on the use of BYHWD for treating hypertension. This was followed by network pharmacological analysis, and molecular docking assessment using AutoDockTools to explore the mode of action.
Results
BYHWD was effective in reducing SBP (MD: 0.767; 95 % CI: 0.629, 0.905; p = 0.000), DBP (MD: 0.427; 95 % CI: 0.292, 0.561; p = 0.000), 24h SBP (MD: 0.665; 95 % CI: 0.368, 0.962; p = 0.000), 24h DBP (MD: 0.547; 95 % CI: 0.318, 0.777; p = 0.000), dSBP (MD: 0.625; 95 % CI: 0.395, 0.855; p = 0.000), dDBP (MD: 0.632; 95 % CI: 0.401, 0.862; p = 0.000), nSBP (MD: 0.859; 95 % CI: 0.340, 1.377; p = 0.001), nDBP (MD: 0.704; 95 % CI: 0.297, 1.112; p = 0.001), pv (MD: 1.311; 95 % CI: 0.363, 2.259; p = 0.007) and NIHSS (MD: 1.149; 95 % CI: 0.100, 2.199; p = 0.032), and elevating CER (OR = 2.848; 95 % CI: 1.388, 5.843; p = 0.004). However, BYHWD did not significantly reduce HCY, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of AE. In terms of the mechanism of action, the main active ingredient of BYHWD is quercetin, and the core targets are AKT1, MMP9, and others. Molecular docking also showed that quercetin mainly interacts with the amino acid residue CYS-28 of MMP2. Second, the KEGG analysis showed that BYHWD mainly act on HIF-1, Apelin, and cGMP-PKG signalling pathways, and GO analysis showed that it related to the apical part of the cell, circulatory system processes, and nuclear receptor activity. Conclusion: BYHWD can lowered blood pressure, reduced plasma viscosity, and restored neurological function with good tolerability, and had no significant effect on HCY levels. This study further demonstrated that quercetin is the main active ingredient of BYHWD that acts via the AKT1 and HIF-1 signalling pathways. These results provide new guidance for people's dietary choices by the general public.}

and purpose: Pregnant and breastfeeding women commonly use complementary medicine products (CMPs), including dietary supplements and herbal medicines. This study investigated women's reasons for use.
Materials and methods
A national, cross-sectional, online survey conducted between July–September 2019 investigated reasons for CMP use during pregnancy and lactation. Australian women who were currently pregnant and/or breastfeeding participated. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Chi-square and principal component analyses.
Results
Of the 810 women surveyed (n = 354 pregnant; n = 456 breastfeeding), most reported prior CMP use and felt that CMPs had been beneficial to maintaining and optimising their own and their children's health. However, when ill, they preferred medicines prescribed by doctors or pharmacists. Perceived benefits to their unborn or breastfeeding babies' health and their own health (both cohorts), the health of their pregnancy (pregnant participants), and benefits to the breastfeeding process and breastmilk supply (breastfeeding participants) were important reasons for women's CMP use.
Conclusion
Women's reasons for CMP use centred on perceived benefits to their own health and the health of their babies. Women's prior positive experiences with CMP use, combined with preferences for pharmaceutical use when ill, indicates their use of CMPs can be considered complementary, rather than alternative, to biomedical health care.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The use of herbal medicines for prophylaxis, prevention, and treatment of various ailments is rising throughout the world because they are thought to be safer than allopathic treatments, which they are. However, several investigations have documented the toxicity and adverse drug reactions (ADR) of certain formulations and botanicals if not consumed wisely.
Aim of the study
The goal of the current study is to address herbal medication pharmacovigilance (PV) modeling and related considerations for improved patient safety. Also, focus is laid on the comprehensive and critical analysis of the current state of PV for herbal medications at the national and international levels.
Materials and methods
Targeted review also known as focused literature review methodology was utilized for exploring the data from various scientific platforms such as Science Direct, Wiley Online Library, Springer, PubMed, Google Scholar using “pharmacovigilance, herbal medicine, traditional medicine, ADR, under reporting, herb toxicity, herb interactions” as keywords along with standard literature pertaining to herbal medicines that is published by the WHO and other international and national organizations etc. The botanical names mentioned in the present article were authenticated using World Flora Online database.
Results
The historical developments paving the way for PV in regulatory setup were also discussed, along with various criteria's for monitoring herbal medicine, ADR of herbs, phytoconstituents, and traditional medicines, herb-drug interactions, modes of reporting ADR, databases for reporting ADR's, provisions of PV in regulatory framework of different nations, challenges and way forward in PV are discussed in detail advocating a robust drug safety ecosystem for herbal medicines.
Conclusion
Despite recent efforts to encourage the reporting of suspected ADRs linked to herbal medicines, such as expanding the programme and adding community pharmacists and other healthcare professionals as recognized reporters, the number of herbal ADR reports received by the regulatory bodies remains comparatively low. Since users often do not seek professional advice or report if they have side effects, under-reporting, is anticipated to be significant for herbal medications. There are inadequate quality control methods, poor regulatory oversight considering herbs used in food and botanicals, and unregulated distribution channels. In addition, botanical identity, traceability of herbs, ecological concerns, over-the-counter (OTC) herbal medicines, patient-physicians barriers requires special focus by the regulatory bodies for improved global safety of herbal medicines.}

The main compounds, gallic acid, chebulagic acid, rutin, and eugenol, were determined following the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. The method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantitation (LOQ), and found to be linear, with a correlation coefficient (R2) ranging from 0.9995 to 0.9998. The LOD and LOQ values calculated from the calibration curve ranged from 7.29 to 20.29 and 22.09 to 61.48 µg/mL, respectively. The method also exhibited acceptable precision, with relative standard deviation values lower than 2%. The accuracy of the method was evaluated based on the recovery percentages, and found to be within an acceptable range (90.12–105.39%). The validated protocol developed in this study was employed to analyze the concentration levels of gallic acid, chebulagic acid, rutin, and eugenol in eight different Thatbunjob products commercially available in Thailand. The performance parameters show that the developed and validated method is appropriate for the quantitative determination of gallic acid, chebulagic acid, rutin, and eugenol in Thatbunjob.}

abstract = {Introduction
Diatom tests are rarely used during autopsy to confirm drowning as the cause of death (COD) because of limitations of the current literature involving these techniques. Instead, experts rely on physical examination by the pathologist. Due to interpretive concerns regarding Diatom tests, they are often insufficient in establishing a diagnosis, but offer the potential to be an extremely useful diagnostic tool with further understanding. The aim of study is to optimize “Diatom Tests” for use in forensic medicine in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Methods
A randomized prospective experimental study was conducted, using albino Wistar rat models (Rattus norvegicus), at the Veterinary Facility, University of Sarajevo. Thirty-two adult albino rats, were used and distributed into groups as follows: Group A (6 deceased rats with COD other than drowning, but due to mechanical asphyxia, which were then submerged for 1 h after death); Group B (6 deceased rats with COD other than drowning, but due to mechanical asphyxia, which were then submerged for 72 h after death); Group C (6 rats that were immediately autopsied after drowning, with COD determined as drowning); Group D (6 rats that underwent a 48-hour postmortem period after drowning); Group E (COD: drowning, post-mortem 72hrs after death, remained submerged in water until PM). Live algological material was collected for the research of the systematics of algae from the Bosna river, Sarajevo, and transported to the University of Sarajevo (Department of Biology, Faculty of Science). Periphyllon, epiphyllon and epipelon were used to collect phytobenthos. The material was fixed with 4% formalin solution. Laboratory processing of diatoms was performed using the methods described by Hustedt (16). In the process of obtaining pure diatom valves, part of the material is digested with potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and oxalic acid (C2H2O4). In the next step, the cleaned diatom valves were mounted in Canadian balsam. A light microscope under 1000x magnification (Best Scope 2020) was used to evaluate and analyze the species. The identification of diatoms was performed using the reference of Cantonati et al (17). The nomenclature of diatom species was performed according to Guiry & Guiry's worldwide electronic internet database.
Results
No diatoms were found in Groups A and B. However, Navicula sp. and Sellaphora sp. cf., were discovered during bone analysis of Group C where rats were immediately autopsied after drowning. Hantzschia amphioxus taxon was present in Group D, which underwent a 48-hour postmortem period after drowning and before samples were taken. In Groups C and D, where drowning was the COD, Diatoma vulgaris i Pinnularia major, Achnanthidium minutissimum i Melosira varians were present in the tooth samples.
Conclusion
Optimization of the “Diatom Test” method could potentially lead to its future use as a routine method within experimental settings. This experimental study is a starting point that guides forenscic medicine pracitioners towards the optimization of tests and sampling in cases of unexplained etiology, where preserved soft tissue structures is not available. In these cases, teeth and bones serve as accessible materials for diagnosing COD, alongside standardized nonspecific findings in the absence of organs for micro- and macroanalysis.}

As surgeon compensation has experienced increased downward pressure, it has become of growing importance to those in academic medicine/surgery. Competitive compensation is necessary, even if not sufficient, for successful faculty recruitment and retention. The optimal compensation system should encourage the best possible patient care, inspire teamwork, maximize the department’s or physician practice’s ability to recruit and retain faculty, support all missions, and be viewed as equitable and transparent. The goal of an optimal compensation system is to have faculty minds focused on things other than compensation—those elements of their job that are most important, such as career development, multidisciplinary clinical programs, research, and education. One way to ensure that compensation stays in the background for academic surgeons is for leadership to keep this front and center. Compensation plans can influence behavior and time management and affect the clinical, academic, and educational contributions of surgeons and physicians of all specialties. As we strive to optimize the productivity and engagement of a health system’s most valuable resource—those who deliver surgical care and create new knowledge—compensation is an important variable in need of constant attention.}

abstract = {Background and objective
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a common practice among patients, who experience functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). Among the Saudi population, less is known about CAM use for FGID. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of CAM utilization for FGID amongst the Saudi population and determine the types of CAM used for treatment.
Method
A cross-sectional study was carried out in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during February 2023 through social media platforms using questionnaires adopted from the literature. There were three sections in the questionnaire including demographic information, questions to determine the prevalence of CAM use for FGID, the types of FGID, and the types of CAM utilization, and questions on the sources of information about CAM. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to find factors associated with CAM use. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.
Results
A total of 828 people participated in this study. The overall prevalence of CAM use for FGID problems was 87.2 %. There were no significant differences in CAM use for FGID problems between men (87.5 %) and women (86.3 %) (P = 0.727). The most commonly used types of CAM for FGID were ginger (73.4 %), chamomile (66.6 %), mint (61.6 %), turmeric (59.0 %), anise (55.5 %), fennel (43.1 %), and Activia yogurt©️ (42.7 %). The most common FGID disorders for utilizing CAM were IBS (29.9 %), followed by constipation (29.8 %), dyspepsia (22.7 %), and bloating (17.0 %). In the multivariable regression, age, gender and employment status did not have an impact on the odds of using CAM. The subjects who had high school, university, and postgraduate education had significant odds ratios of CAM use (OR = 2.73; 95 % CI: 1.22–6.13), (OR = 4.18; 95 % CI: 2.03–8.58), and (OR = 20.85; 95 % CI: 5.51–78.80), respectively, compared to subjects who did not complete high school. Participants who had private insurance had a significant odds ratio (OR = 0.27; 95 % CI: 0.14–0.55) compared to governmental insurance.
Conclusion
The use of CAM among the Saudi population is alarmingly high; however, the lack of standardized medical recommendations and treatment options may be the cause. Although there were no significant gender differences, participants with higher educational levels and private insurance coverage were more likely to use CAM for FGID. Patients suffering from FGID and limited access to medical advice and treatment options are vulnerable to being exposed to dubious and incredible information sources. Expanding access to preventative medical services, funding governmental medical websites to provide credible information, educating healthcare professionals about FGID, and conducting more research in safe and effective treatments for FGID is recommended.}

abstract = {Introduction
Inpatient addiction medicine services (AMS) were developed in response to the growing needs of hospitalized individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs). AMS aim to enable timely initiation of pharmacologic treatment, build hospital capacity to support patients who use substances, and facilitate transition to community services. As an emerging service being adopted in hospitals across North America, the model of care, populations served, substance use trends, and clinical trajectory has not been widely described. This work aims to characterize patients accessing care through the AMS, establishing predictors for clinical trajectories in hospital including patient-initiated discharge (PID) and hospital re-admission.
Methods
Using a retrospective cohort design, we describe all patients seen by the AMS between 2018 and 2022 across four hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario. Patients seen by AMS were hospitalized and qualified for a SUD based on DSM-V criteria. The study used descriptive statistics to describe the cohort, where appropriate adjusted time-to-event survival models were constructed to identify predictors for hospital re-admission.
Results
Patients seen by the AMS (n = 695) frequently lacked access to primary care (47.0 %) and less than half (44.3 %) were receiving community addiction services on admission. The majority met criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD), with injecting being the primary consumption route (54.8 %). Patients exhibited high acuity, with 34.2 % requiring critical care measures. Provision of OAT substantially increased to 77.9 % of patients (29 % on admission). PID occurred in 17.8 % of patients and was significantly associated with an admitting diagnosis of suicidal ideation, infection, heart failure, and distinct substance use profiles including methamphetamine, fentanyl, and heroin use (p < 0.05). PID conferred a 66 % increased risk for re-admission (Hazard-Ratio: 1.66; 95 % CI: 1.08, 2.54; p = 0.02).
Conclusion
Patients served by AMS primarily include individuals with OUD presenting with the associated medical complications and substantial deficits in the social determinants of health (e.g., high housing insecurity, poverty, and disability). PID occurs among 1 in 5 people and is associated with higher rates of re-admission. By identifying individuals at higher risk of adverse outcomes, these results provide an opportunity to improve outcomes in this high-risk, high-vulnerability population.}

abstract = {Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, including Question-Answering (QA) and dialogue systems. However, most models are trained on English data and lack strong generalization in providing answers in Chinese. This limitation is especially evident in specialized domains like traditional Chinese medical QA, where performance suffers due to the absence of fine-tuning and high-quality datasets. To address this, we introduce MedChatZH, a dialogue model optimized for Chinese medical QA based on transformer decoder with LLaMA architecture. Continued pre-training on a curated corpus of Chinese medical books is followed by fine-tuning with a carefully selected medical instruction dataset, resulting in MedChatZH outperforming several Chinese dialogue baselines on a real-world medical dialogue dataset. Our model, code, and dataset are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/tyang816/MedChatZH) to encourage further research in traditional Chinese medicine and LLMs.}

Inhaled sedatives offer benefits such as faster awakening and extubation, decreased total opioid and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB) doses, as well as bronchodilator, anticonvulsant, and cardiopulmonary and neurological protective effects. Inhaled sedation is administered using a specific vaporizer. Isoflurane is the recommended agent due to its efficacy and safety profile. Inhaled sedation is recommended for moderate and deep sedation, prolonged sedation, difficult sedation, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), status asthmaticus, and super-refractory status epilepticus. By offering these significant advantages, the use of inhaled sedatives allows for a personalized and controlled approach to optimize sedation in the ICU.

Instead, they relied on printed or digital media for information. Over the past few years, many graduate medical education programs have increased the use of social media to disseminate information to attract and retain faculty, staff, and trainees. Previous studies have quantified the relative presence of social media in residency programs, but there has been limited work on the assessment of social media platforms that applicants use to evaluate internal medicine programs. To more effectively target residency applicants through social media, we sought to understand the use of social media in general and specifically in the residency application process of an incoming intern class recruited during the 2020-2021 interview season. We administered an anonymous survey after matching to a single institution’s 2021 class of 40 internal medicine interns in both categorical and preliminary tracks. The group surveyed came from US medical schools (MD and DO degrees) and international programs. The group surveyed comprised 66% women and 16.7% underrepresented groups as defined by Association of American Medical Colleges guidelines. Our data found that the internal medicine residency applicants mostly used hospital websites and Instagram to evaluate programs. Twitter, which is often assumed to be highly used in academic circles, was rarely used. Our work suggests that a better understanding of the use of digital resources by applicants can allow programs to reach residency applicants in a meaningful way.}

Significant advancements have been made in diagnosing and treating GC over the past few decades, resulting in tremendous improvements in patient survival. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has garnered considerable attention as an alternative therapeutic approach for GC due to its multicomponent and multitarget characteristics. Consequently, natural products found in TCM have attracted researchers’ attention, as growing evidence suggests that these natural products can impede GC progression by regulating various biological processes. Nevertheless, their molecular mechanisms are not systematically uncovered. Here, we review the major signaling pathways involved in GC development. Additionally, clinical GC samples were analyzed. Moreover, the anti-GC effects of natural products, their underlying mechanisms and potential targets were summarized. These summaries are intended to facilitate further relevant research, and accelerate the clinical applications of natural products in GC treatment.}

abstract = {Context
Rotator cuff tear is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain and has become a prominent disease most frequently treated by surgery.
Objectives
To investigate the long-term therapeutic effect of integrative Korean medicine (KM) as a conservative treatment in treating rotator cuff tears.
Design
A multicenter observational study.
Settings
The settings involve four regional network KM hospitals.
Patients
The study participants are 288 patients aged 19-70 with rotator cuff tear identified by radiologist based on magnetic resonance imaging who received integrative KM treatment for the chief complaint of shoulder pain between 1 January 2015 and 31 March 2020.
Intervention
None.
Main outcomes
The primary outcome was the pain score in the affected shoulder, measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS). The secondary outcomes were Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), 5-Level Quality of life: EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D-5L), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and range of motion (ROM) scores.
Results
Eligible patients for MCID achievement analysis for minimally clinical important change were 167, and 109 completed the follow-up survey. The mean NRS pain score in the affected shoulder was 5.80 ± 1.27 at admission, 3.50 ± 1.32 at discharge, and 3.83 ± 2.04 at follow-up.The mean SPADI score was 51.48 ± 20.18 at admission, 37.76 ± 19.23 at discharge, and 24.26 ± 21.80 at follow-up. The improvement at discharge (P-value < 0.001) and follow-up (P-value < 0.001) compared to those at admission was statistically significant. The results also presented a significant improvement in ROM for all motions at discharge after treatment (P-value < 0.001). The number of patients who achieved minimal clinically important difference in NRS was 116 (69.5%) at discharge and 71 (65.1%) at follow-up, and in SPADI was 82 (50.9%) at discharge and 77 (70.6%) at follow-up.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggested that integrative KM treatment can help improve pain, functional impairment, QoL, and ROM in patients with a rotator cuff tear

abstract = {Objective
Xiaotan Sanjie recipe (XTSJ), a Chinese herbal compound medicine, exerts a significant inhibitory effect on gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. This work investigated the mechanism underlying the XTSJ-mediated inhibition of GC metastasis.
Methods
The effect of XTSJ on GC metastasis and the associated mechanism were investigated in vitro, using GC cell lines, and in vivo, using a GC mouse model, by focusing on the expression of Glc-N-Ac-transferase V (GnT-V; encoded by MGAT5).
Results
The migration and invasion ability of GC cells decreased significantly after XTSJ administration, which confirmed the efficacy of XTSJ in treating GC in vitro. XTSJ increased the accumulation of E-cadherin at junctions between GC cells, which was reversed by MGAT5 overexpression. XTSJ administration and MGAT5 knockdown alleviated the structural abnormality of the cell–cell junctions, while MGAT5 overexpression had the opposite effect. MGAT5 knockdown and XTSJ treatment also significantly increased the accumulation of proteins associated with the E-cadherin-mediated adherens junction complex. Furthermore, the expression of MGAT5 was significantly lower in the lungs of BGC-823-MGAT5 + XTSJ mice than in those of BGC-823-MGAT5 + solvent mice, indicating that the ability of gastric tumors to metastasize to the lung was decreased in vivo following XTSJ treatment.
Conclusion
XTSJ prevented GC metastasis by inhibiting the GnT-V-mediated E-cadherin glycosylation and promoting the E-cadherin accumulation at cell–cell junctions.

abstract = {Objective
Pediatric-neonatal transport research projects are presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Transport Medicine (SOTM) scientific abstract program annually. Journal publication increases the impact of these projects. Our objectives were to determine the publication rate of transport abstracts and to identify factors predictive of publication success.
Methods
We reviewed all AAP SOTM abstracts accepted for presentation from 2011 to 2020 and assessed presentation format (oral/platform vs. poster), authors’ professional degree (physician vs. nonphysician), and first author's trainee status. We searched PubMed, Ovid, and ResearchGate for publications by abstract title and authors and then compared published versus unpublished abstracts. Categorical variables were expressed as proportions and compared using the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, whereas continuous variables were summarized using medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) and compared using the Student t-test or the Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. A linear probability model was performed.
Results
Of 194 presented abstracts, 67 (34.5%) were published. The publication rate was significantly higher for oral/platform versus poster abstracts (P < .01), if the abstract was an oral/platform (probability increase by 19.5%, P < .01), and if the first author was a trainee (probability increase by 25.6%, p < 0.05). The constant was estimated as 24.9% probability of publication. Hence, if the first author was a physician, a trainee, and had an oral/platform presentation, there was an 85.8% chance of being published. The median (IQR) time to publication was 2 years (IQR: 2-4 years), with articles published the longest having the most citations. Articles were published in 27 different journals, with nearly half (33/67, 49.3%) being published in 3 journals.
Conclusion
AAP SOTM abstracts have a 34.5% publication rate over the past 10 years, which is consistent with other medical specialties. Oral abstracts, physician first authors, and trainee first authors had a significantly higher success rate. Special emphasis should be placed nationally on supporting nonphysician transport professionals to publish their work.}

Although a large number of experimental results suggest that anti-MF drug therapy has made great progress, the conclusions of relevant clinical trials are still not optimistic, and it is urgent to find new effective anti-MF medicine. The clinical efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of MF in HHD is obvious, and some achievements have been made in the mechanism research. Studies have confirmed that a variety of TCM compound prescription and natural compounds play different degrees of inhibitory effect on MF. In this study, we reviewed the pathogenesis of MF in HHD and the current drug treatment strategies, summarized the latest research progress of TCM in the treatment of MF in HHD, and demonstrated the mechanism of its cardiac protective effect.

PCOS is a risk factor for cardiometabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke in addition to exhibiting signs of hyperandrogenism and anovulation. However, there is no known cure for PCOS, and medications have only ever been used symptomatically, with a variety of adverse effects. Drugs made from natural plant products may help treat PCOS because several plant extracts have been widely recognized to lessen the symptoms of PCOS. In light of this, 72 current studies on natural products with the potential to control PCOS were examined. By controlling the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and decreasing NF-κB and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), certain plant-derived chemicals might reduce inflammation. Other substances altered the HPO axis, which normalized hormones. Additionally, other plant components increased glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels to reduce radiation-induced oxidative stress. The other substances prevented autophagy by impairing beclin 1, autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 - II (LC3- II). The main focus of this comprehensive review is the possibility of plant extracts as natural bio-resources of PCOS treatment by regulating inflammation, hormones, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or autophagy.}

From the hundreds of publications released over the past few years, the key results from representative clinical studies of XBJ in the treatment of severe pneumonia were selected and summarized. XBJ was observed to effectively suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, counter the effects of endotoxin, and assert an anticoagulation effect in most clinical trials, which are consistent with experimental studies.

abstract = {Objective
This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the effects of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) on hematologic manifestations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Data sources
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Airiti Library were searched for the period January 2000 to February 2022.
Study selection
RCTs involving CHMs in patients with SLE with available hematologic data.
Data extraction
The primary outcomes included white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the included RCTs. Sensitivity analysis of RCTs with abnormal hematologic data before intervention was performed to verify the robustness of the results. Subgroup analysis was also applied for results with high heterogenicity. Core patterns of used herbal drug pairs had also been analyzed and visualized.
Data synthesis
Fifteen RCTs involving 1183 participants were included. The effects of elevating WBC count (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.33–1.06; p <0.001), hemoglobin levels (WMD: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.31–0.97; p <0.001), and platelet count (WMD: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.48–0.74; p <0.001) in the CHM group were significantly greater than those in the control group. In total, 23 single herbs and 152 herbal drug pairs were identified for core patterns network analysis.
Conclusions
We demonstrated significantly superior therapeutic effects achieved with CHMs and conventional therapy regarding leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia compared to that of conventional therapy alone in patients with SLE.}

Haematitum, a time-honored mineral-based Chinese medicine, has been used medicinally in China for over 2000 years. It is now included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and used clinically for treating digestive and respiratory diseases. The Chinese Materia Medica records that it is toxic and should not be taken for a long period, but there are few research reports on the toxicity of Haematitum and its potential toxicity mechanisms.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of Haematitum and calcined Haematitum, including organ toxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. Further, it is also necessary to explore the mechanism of Haematitum toxicity and to provide a reference for the safe clinical use of the drug.
Materials and methods
The samples of Haematitum and calcined Haematitum decoctions were prepared. KM mice were treated with samples by gavage for 10 days, and lung damage and apoptosis were assessed by HE staining and TUNEL staining of lung tissues respectively. Metabolomics analysis was performed by HPLC-MS. Metallomics analysis was performed by ICP-MS. In addition, C. elegans was used as a model for 48 h exposure to examine the neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity-related indices of Haematitum, including locomotor behaviors, growth and development, reproductive behaviors, AChE activities, sensory behaviors, apoptosis, and ROS levels.
Results
The use of large doses of Haematitum decoction caused lung damage in mice. Neither calcined Haematitum decoction nor Haematitum decoction at clinically used doses showed organ damage. Metabolomics results showed that disorders in lipid metabolic pathways such as sphingolipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism may be important factors in Haematitum-induced pulmonary toxicity. High doses of Haematitum decoction caused neurological damage to C. elegans, while low doses of Haematitum decoction and calcined Haematitum decoction showed no significant neurotoxicity. Decoction of Haematitum and calcined Haematitum did not show reproductive toxicity to C. elegans. Toxicity was also not observed in the control group of iron (Ⅱ) and iron (Ⅲ) ions in equal amounts with high doses of Haematitum.
Conclusions
Haematitum is relatively safe for routine doses and short-term use. Calcination can significantly reduce Haematitum toxicity, and this study provides a reference for safe clinical use.}

abstract = {Herbal medicines (HMs) have been traditionally used for the prophylaxis/treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Their use is steadily increasing and many patients with CVDs often combine HMs with prescribed cardiovascular medications. Interestingly, up to 70% of patients do not notify cardiologists/physicians the use of HMs and up to 90% of cardiologists/physicians may not routinely inquire them about the use of HMs. There is limited scientific evidence from well-designed clinical trials supporting the efficacy and safety of HMs and because they do not reduce morbidity and mortality are not recommended in clinical guidelines for the prophylaxis/treatment of CVDs. There is also a great deal of confusion about the identification, active constituents and mechanisms of action of HMs; the lack of standardization and quality control (contaminations, adulterations) represent other sources of concern. Furthermore, the widespread perception that unlike prescription drugs HMs are safe is misleading and some HMs can cause clinically relevant adverse events and interactions, particularly when used with narrow therapeutic index prescribed cardiovascular drugs (antiarrhythmics, antithrombotics, digoxin). Cardiologists/physicians can no longer ignore the problem. They must improve their knowledge about the HMs their patients consume to provide the best advice and prevent adverse reactions and drug interactions. This narrative review addresses the putative mechanisms of action, suggested clinical uses and safety of most commonly used HMs, the pivotal role of cardiologists/physicians to protect consumers and the main challenges and gaps in evidence related to the use of HMs in the prophylaxis and treatment of CVDs.}
