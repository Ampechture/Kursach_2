Although since its inception in the 1990s its strong theoretical foundations remain unaltered, a lot has changed in its practical implementation due to the electronic explosion of information and the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this article is to succinctly provide the reader with an update on the major changes in EBM, including the important most recent ones that were “fast-tracked” due to the COVID-19 challenge.}

abstract = {Summary
With the advent of innovative therapeutics for and the rising costs of cancer management, low-income and middle-income countries face increasing challenges to deliver effective and sustainable health care. Understanding of how countries are selecting and prioritising essential cancer interventions is poor, including in the formulation of policies for essential medicines. We did an in-depth subanalysis from a global dataset of national cancer control plans (NCCPs), aiming to identify possible determinants of inclusion of policies related to essential medicines in the NCCP. The results showed poor global comprehensiveness of NCCPs, and substantial deficits in policies for financial hardships due to cancer care, specifically for access to cancer medicines. Specification of budget allocations, policy of protection from catastrophic health expenditure, and national treatment guidelines in the NCCPs contributed to more consistent policies on essential cancer medicines. The bedrock to deliver effective cancer programmes resides in the assurance of comprehensive, consistent, and coherent policy formulation, to orient resource selection and health investments, ultimately delivering equitable health for all.}

In the UK more women than men are practicing medicine, and for the first time in the history of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA), the president of the RCoA, Dean of the Faculty of Pain Medicine, and Dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine are all women. However, within the subspecialty of pain medicine, there are significantly more men practicing than women, with the most recent UK estimates identifying that only 26.7% of current pain physicians are women. Both historical and modern perspectives illustrate how women often prefer to be cared for by other women, highlighting the importance of increased representation of women in pain clinics and interventional suites. We discuss current trends in pain medicine recruitment within the UK, where most pain physicians are recruited from anaesthesia training programs, including the barriers to women's representation and reasons women enter the subspecialty. We advocate for speaker gender quotas at conferences, diversity considerate workforce planning, peer support groups, adjustments to training programs, and further research to help narrow the gender gap.}

The standard path of health education is a standardised health education method formulated according to the characteristics of the disease in question. This study aimed to explore the effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nursing combined with the health education standard path in terms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Methods
Sixty patients with AML at Shijiazhuang Ping'an Hospital were recruited and divided into the control group (n = 30) and the intervention group (n = 30). Both groups received the same chemotherapy treatment, while the control group received routine nursing and the intervention group received a combined TCM–health education standard path intervention. The scores for the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Spitzer quality of life index (QLI), self-rating depression scale (SDS), awareness of TCM health education standard path content and nursing satisfaction were then compared.
Results
The SAS and SDS scores of the patients decreased following the intervention, while the QLI score increased, with the intervention group significantly improved compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The awareness of TCM health education standard path content was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05), and the nursing satisfaction was also higher in the former than in the latter (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the hospitalisation cost and length of stay were lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). There were no statistical differences in the median survival time between the intervention group and the control group (P > 0.05).
Conclusion
The application of TCM combined with the health education standard path has an effect in terms of reducing patients' anxiety and depression, improving their awareness of health education content and enhancing their nursing satisfaction.}

Integrative Medicine (IM) is a well-established patient centered health care vision which might benefit patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). Case reports were collected from patients with MUPS treated by IM physicians in the Netherlands in order to illustrate IM treatment approaches and demonstrate potential benefits to patients.
Methods
Case reports were classified according to the CARE guidelines from IM physicians who are members of the Medical Doctors Association for Integrative Medicine (AVIG). Data are presented and the quality was assessed using the JBI tool for case reports.
Results
21 case reports were submitted by 14 IM physicians, most of high quality. Most patients presented with multiple symptoms, of which the most frequently reported were pain (n = 14) and fatigue (n = 7). The average duration of the symptoms before the first consultation with the IM physician was 36 months (range 1.5 weeks up to 11 years). The average treatment duration was 20 months (range instantaneous up to 10 years). The most frequently used treatment modalities were supplements (n = 8), homeopathy (n = 5), neural therapy (n = 4), dietary advice (n = 4). The causality between the IM treatment and the outcome was judged to be very likely in 10 of the case reports, likely in 5 cases, possible in 1 case, unclear in 1 case and could have been the result of natural disease development in 4 of the cases.
Conclusion
The case reports demonstrate that Integrative Medicine provides a highly personalized approach which may be beneficial for MUPS patients.}

abstract = {Abstract
Objective
Pediatric interfacility transports are frequent. Despite the absence of a formal pediatric transport curriculum in eastern Canada, directly managing patients during transport and medical direction of the referring center and transport team are part of the pediatric critical care medicine (PCCM) and pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) program requirements. The authors developed a pediatric interfacility transport curriculum and measured its impact on fellows’ confidence and performance.
Methods
This was a pilot interventional prospective study in Montreal, Canada. Postcurriculum surveys were used to measure confidence, and high-fidelity simulations were used to measure performance. A target threshold for confidence was defined before implementation, and pre- and post values were compared. The simulation scenario and assessment checklist were locally developed.
Results
The participants were 11 PCCM and 3 PEM fellows. The content of the curriculum and educational methods were selected based on the literature and a needs assessment survey. All participants rated themselves as confident at the end of the curriculum. Eighty-three percent of the participants were deemed proficient with a perfect interrater agreement.
Conclusion
The pediatric transport curriculum had a positive impact on PEM and PCCM fellows’ confidence and performance in transport. Further studies should look at the impact of such a curriculum on participants’ real-life performance and patient care.}

This review provides a brief discussion on the historical use of psychedelic medicines, the status of the empirical evidence, and numerous significant policy considerations that must be thoughtfully addressed regarding standards-of-practice, consumer protection, engagement of communities, safeguarding access for all, and developing data standards, which supports the responsible, accountable, safe, and ethical uses of these medicines in clinical, faith-based, and other contexts.

Whole-systems traditional Chinese medicine (WS-TCM) therapy has been widely used as a multi-dimensional intervention for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) during clinical practice in China. This study aimed to assess the impact of WS-TCM on IVF-ET outcomes.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 2733 patients at a tertiary-referral academic university hospital from January 2018 to June 2021. We compared the outcomes of WS-TCM therapies, including acupuncture, moxibustion, Chinese herbs, as well as dietary and lifestyle recommendations (WS-TCM group) with conventional IVF-ET care alone (Non-WS-TCM group) during fresh IVF (n = 1048) and frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles (n = 1685). The live birth rate (LBR) per ET was the primary endpoint. Propensity score (PS) matching and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to adjust for potential confounders.
Results
The LBR per ET was comparable between the WS-TCM and Non-WS-TCM groups (39.9% versus 38.0%, P = 0.604) in fresh IVF cycles after PS matching, while significant differences in cumulative LBR (60.5% versus 52.7%, P = 0.045) were detected. Meanwhile, for patients that underwent FET cycles, significant differences in LBR were detected between the WS-TCM and Non-WS-TCM groups (42.7% versus 35.3%, p = 0.019, after PS matching). These findings were validated by multivariate logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.63, p = 0.044).
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that WS-TCM therapy may improve the LBRs and cumulative LBRs of subfertile women undergoing IVF-ET. Nonetheless, more comprehensive, rigorous, large-scale prospective comparative studies are needed to verify these findings.}

A cross-sectional survey of practicing physicians with a minimum of five years' experience across the main secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Bahrain was conducted. An online questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, knowledge of AI, attitudes towards the use of AI in 10 tasks of daily clinical practice, and opinions on the benefits and drawbacks of AI. A total of 114 physicians participated in the survey. Among them, 43 (37.7%) were registered psychiatrists, 15 (13.2%) were pathologists, 17 (14.9%) were radiologists, and 39 (34.2%) were surgical specialists. The participants' attitudes were overall positive towards AI. Pathologists were particularly in favor of using AI to “Formulate personalized medication and/or treatment plans for patients” and to “Interview patients in a range of settings to obtain medical history.” Most participants agreed that AI would reduce the time needed to establish a diagnosis and negatively affect employment rates. There were no correlations between the responses and the participants’ age, gender, years of experience, or AI knowledge. This study demonstrates that the attitudes towards the use of AI in medicine among practicing physicians in Bahrain are similar to those of physicians in developed countries in that they are positive and welcoming of AI implementation in practice. However, the potential effects of AI on job security are a major concern.}

Abnormal deposition of low-density lipoproteins in the arterial wall stimulates the activation of immune cells, including the adhesion and infiltration of monocytes, the proliferation and differentiation of macrophages and lymphocytes, and the activation of their functions. The complex interplay between immune cells coordinates the balance between pro- and anti-inflammation and plays a key role in the progression of AS. Therefore, targeting immune cell activity may lead to the development of more selective drugs with fewer side effects to treat AS without compromising host defense mechanisms. At present, an increasing number of studies have found that the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can regulate the function of immune cells in multiple ways to against AS, showing great potential for the treatment of AS and promising clinical applications. In this paper, we review the mechanisms of immune cell action in AS lesions and the potential targets and/or pathways for immune cell regulation by the active ingredients of TCM to promote the understanding of the immune system interactions of AS and provide a relevant basis for the use of active ingredients of TCM as natural adjuvants for AS immunotherapy.}

Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ) is a patent medicine that is a traditional Chinese medicine compound preparation with comprehensive effects for the prevention and treatment of glycolipid metabolic diseases under the guidance of “modulating liver, starting pivot and cleaning turbidity”. FTZ was proposed by Professor Guo Jiao and is used for the clinical treatment of hyperlipidemia. This study was designed to explore the regulatory mechanisms of FTZ on heart lipid metabolism dysfunction and mitochondrial dynamics disorder in mice with DCM, and it provides a theoretical basis for the myocardial protective effect of FTZ in diabetes. In this study, we demonstrated that FTZ protected heart function in DCM mice and downregulated the overexpression of free fatty acids (FFAs) uptake-related proteins cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Moreover, FTZ treatment showed a regulatory effect on mitochondrial dynamics by inhibiting mitochondrial fission and promoting mitochondrial fusion. We also identified in vitro that FTZ could restore lipid metabolism-related proteins, mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins and mitochondrial energy metabolism in PA-treated cardiomyocytes. Our study indicated that FTZ improves the cardiac function of diabetic mice by attenuating the increase in fasting blood glucose levels, inhibiting the decrease in body weight, alleviating disordered lipid metabolism, and restoring mitochondrial dynamics and myocardial apoptosis in diabetic mouse hearts.}

abstract = {Introduction
United States emergency medicine (EM) post-graduate training programs vary in training length, either 4 or 3 years. However, it is unknown if clinical care by graduates from the two curricula differs in the early post-residency period.
Methods
We performed a retrospective observational study comparing measures of clinical care and practice patterns between new graduates from 4- and 3-year EM programs with experienced new physician hires as a reference group. We included emergency department (ED) encounters from a national EM group (2016–19) between newly hired physicians from 4- and 3- year programs and experienced new hires (>2 years' experience) during their first year of practice with the group. Primary outcomes were at the physician-shift level (patients per hour and relative value units [RVUs] per hour) and encounter-level (72-h return visits with admission/transfer and discharge length of stay [LOS]). Secondary outcomes included discharge opioid prescription rates, test ordering, computer tomography (CT) use, and admission/transfer rate. We compared outcomes using multivariable linear regression models that included patient, shift, and facility-day characteristics, and a facility fixed effect. We hypothesized that experienced new hires would be most efficient, followed by new 4-year graduates and then new 3-year graduates.
Results
We included 1,084,085 ED encounters by 4-year graduates (n = 39), 3-year graduates (n = 70), and experienced new hires (n = 476). There were no differences in physician-level and encounter-level primary outcomes except discharge LOS was 10.60 min (2.551, 18.554) longer for 4-year graduates compared to experienced new hires. Secondary outcomes were similar among the three groups except 4- and 3-year new graduates were less likely to prescribe opioids to discharged patients, −3.70% (−5.768, −1.624) and − 3.38% (−5.136, −1.617) compared to experienced new hires.
Conclusions
In this sample, measures of clinical care and practice patterns related to efficiency, safety, and flow were largely similar between the physician groups; however, experienced new hires were more likely to prescribe opioids than new graduates. These results do not support recommending a specific length of residency training in EM.}

To explore the differences in the anti-inflammatory efficacy and mechanisms of the Miao medicine, both raw and after processing, using the “sweat soaking method” of Radix Wikstroemia indica (RWI).
Aim of the study
The purpose of this study was to explore the differences in the anti-inflammatory efficacy and mechanism of action before and after the processing of the Miao medicine (RWI) using the “sweat soaking method.”
Materials and methods
Network pharmacology technology was used to construct the “drug-component target-pathway–disease” network, and the main anti-inflammatory pathways of RWI were identified. Rat models of collagen-induced arthritis were established. The changes in body weight, swelling rate of the foot pad and ankle joint, arthritis index, thymus index, spleen index, pathological changes of the ankle joint, and the content of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and NO) were used as indices to evaluate the effect of RWI on rats with collagen-induced arthritis before and after its processing. Plasma and urine samples were collected from the rats, and the potential biomarkers of, and metabolic pathways underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of RWI before and after processing were identified using 1H-Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics combined with a multivariate statistical analysis.
Results
Eleven key anti-inflammatory targets of IL6, IL-1β, TNF, ALB, AKT1, IFNG, INS, STAT3, EGFR, TP53, and SRC were identified by network pharmacology. The PI3K–Akt signaling pathway, steroid hormone biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and other pathways were mainly involved in these effects. Pharmacodynamic studies found that both raw and processed RWI products downregulated inflammatory factors in rats with collagen-induced arthritis and alleviated the pathological changes. A total of 41 potential pathways for the anti-inflammatory effects of raw RWI products and 36 potential pathways for the anti-inflammatory effects of processed RWI products were identified by plasma and urine metabolomics. The common pathways of network pharmacology and metabolomics were steroid hormone biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism.
Conclusions
The anti-inflammatory effect of RWI was mainly related to the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. Finally, the “sweat soaking method” enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of RWI.}

It is highly desirable to have reliable detection and determination of suspected pesticide residues for understanding of their overall quality. However, inherent metabolites abundant in herbal medicines typically make screening of trace-level pesticide residues arduous. Taking Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF) as an example, the current study investigated the capability of a three-dimensional separation system, ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem ion mobility/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-IM/Q-TOF MS), for qualitative detection of numerous pesticides when suffering from complex matrix interferences. The comparison of collision gases was first performed to improve unwanted dissociations of pesticides, particularly labile ones, and nitrogen was ultimately chosen instead of argon. Further optimization of key MS parameters resulted a data-independent high-definition MSE (HDMSE) method was developed. Then, an in-house pesticide scientific library (PSL) containing 438 pesticides was constructed following a four-step workflow. Based on multi-dimensional information in this library, different identification criteria were compared and an enhanced qualitative screening approach for 432 targeted pesticides was finally proposed and validated. By its application to 104 batches of LJFs, the approach was demonstrated effective in resolving complex matrix interferences. Moreover, collision cross section (CCS) for identification purpose was favorable to improve detection sensitivity while maintain ideal accuracy.}

abstract = {Facing increasing economization in the health care sector, clinicians have to adapt not only to the ever-growing economic challenges, but also to a patient-oriented health care. Treatment costs are the most important variable for optimizing success when facing scarce human resources, increasing material- and infrastructure costs in general, as well as low revenue flexibility due to flat rates per case in Germany, the so-called Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG). University hospitals treat many patients with particularly serious illnesses. Therefore, their share of complex and expensive treatments, such as liver cirrhosis, is significantly higher. The resulting costs are not adequately reflected in the DRG flat rate per case, which is based on an average calculation across all hospitals, which increases this economic pressure. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to review cost and revenue structures of the management of varices in patients with cirrhosis at a university center with a focus on hepatology. For this monocentric study, the data of 851 patients, treated at the Gastroenterology Department of a University Hospital between 2016 and 2020, were evaluated retrospectively and anonymously. Medical services (e.g., endoscopy, radiology, laboratory diagnostics) were analyzed within the framework of activity-based-costing. As part of the cost unit accounting, the individual steps of the treatment pathways of the 851 patients were monetarily evaluated with corresponding applicable service catalogs and compared with the revenue shares of the cost center and cost element matrix of the German (G-) DRG system. This study examines whether university-based high-performance medicine is efficient and cost-covering within the framework of the G-DRG system. We demonstrate a dramatic underfunding of the management of varicose veins in cirrhosis in our university center. It is therefore generally questionable whether and to what extent an adequate care for this patient collective is reflected in the G-DRG system.
Zusammenfassung
Angesichts der zunehmenden Ökonomisierung im Gesundheitswesen müssen sich Krankenhäuser ständig wachsenden wirtschaftlichen Herausforderungen stellen und gleichzeitig auch eine patientenorientierte Gesundheitsversorgung gewährleisten. Bei knappen Personalressourcen, steigenden Material- und Infrastrukturkosten sowie geringer Erlösflexibilität aufgrund von DRG-Fallpauschalen sind die Behandlungskosten derzeit die wichtigste Variable zur Erfolgsoptimierung. Universitätskliniken behandeln viele Patienten mit besonders schweren Erkrankungen. Daher ist ihr Anteil an aufwendigen und teuren Behandlungen, wie etwa bei Leberzirrhose, deutlich höher. Die daraus resultierenden Kosten werden in der Diagnosis-Related-Group(DRG)-Fallpauschale, die auf einer Durchschnittsberechnung über alle Krankenhäuser basiert, nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt, was diesen wirtschaftlichen Druck verstärkt. Ziel dieses Manuskripts ist es daher, die Kosten- und Erlösstrukturen der Varizenbehandlung bei Patienten mit Leberzirrhose an einem Universitätszentrum mit Schwerpunkt Hepatologie zu analysieren. Für diese monozentrische Studie wurden die Daten von 851 Patienten, die zwischen 2016 und 2020 an der Gastroenterologischen Abteilung eines Universitätsklinikums behandelt wurden, retrospektiv und anonym ausgewertet. Medizinische Leistungen (z. B. Endoskopie, Radiologie, Labordiagnostik) wurden mittels Prozesskostenrechnung analysiert und mit den Erlösanteilen der Kostenstellen- und Kostenartenmatrix des deutschen (G-)DRG-Systems verglichen. In dieser Studie wird untersucht, ob universitäre Hochleistungsmedizin im Rahmen des G-DRG-Systems sowohl effizient als auch kostendeckend leistbar ist. Wir verdeutlichen die dramatische Unterfinanzierung der Behandlung von Varizen bei Leberzirrhose in unserem universitären Zentrum. Es ist daher grundsätzlich fraglich, ob und inwieweit eine adäquate Versorgung dieses Patientenkollektivs im G-DRG-System abbildbar ist.}

We searched PubMed using the search terms cigarette/cigarettes, tobacco products, smoking, smoking cessation, Preventive Medicine. Titles and abstracts were reviewed in duplicate, excluding reports not addressing cigarette smoking. Included reports were categorized by study type (original study, commentary, review). Experimental articles were assessed for impact using iCite, a National Institutes of Health web application that provides bibliometric information for articles in defined topic areas. The review identified 1181 articles on cigarette smoking: 1018 original studies (86.2%), 107 literature reviews (9.1%), and 56 commentaries (4.7%); 166 of the 1018 original studies (16%) were experimental reports. In the iCite analysis these 166 experimental articles received 6366 total citations, a mean (standard error) citation rate/article of 38.35 (±3.21) and mean relative citation ratio of 1.85 (±0.17) which is at the 73rd percentile for NIH-funded field- and time-normalized reports.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is widely used to treat MS in China. However, to date, CHM treatments are not supported with conclusive evidence. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of CHM in people with MS.
Methods
We will search medical databases for randomised controlled trials or cross-over trials published from inception to the current date with no language restrictions. We will include studies involving adults diagnosed with MS, comparing all forms of CHM with placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention. Outcomes of interest include the number of disability worsening, relapse, quality of life, magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive function, the change of fatigue, TCM Syndrome Differentiation Efficacy Scales, and adverse event. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two reviewers will independently screen the studies, assess eligibility, and extract data from each study. Any disagreements will be resolved by the third reviewer. Heterogeneity will be investigated using a combination of visual inspection of the forest plot along with consideration of the I2 and χ2 tests. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias 2′ tool. The quality of evidence for each outcome will be assessed using GRADE. RevMan V.5.4.1 will be used for synthesis and subgroup analysis.
Discussion
This protocol for a systematic review will provide a summary of the evidence regarding the effectiveness and adverse effects of CHM in the treatment of patients with MS.

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Approval of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the manufacture of cell therapies to support clinical trials is now becoming realized after 20 years of research and development. In 2022 the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT) established a Working Group on Emerging Regenerative Medicine Technologies, an area in which iPSCs-derived technologies are expected to play a key role. In this article, the Working Group surveys the steps that an end user should consider when generating iPSCs that are stable, well-characterised, pluripotent, and suitable for making differentiated cell types for allogeneic or autologous cell therapies. The objective is to provide the reader with a holistic view of how to achieve high-quality iPSCs from selection of the starting material through to cell banking. Key considerations include: (A) intellectual property licenses; (B) selection of the raw materials and cell sources for creating iPSC intermediates and master cell banks; (C) regulatory considerations for reprogramming methods; (D) options for expansion in 2D vs. 3D cultures; and (E) available technologies and equipment for harvesting, washing, concentration, filling, cryopreservation, and storage. Some key process limitations are highlighted to help drive further improvement and innovation, and includes recommendations that close and automate current open and manual processes.}

abstract = {The prognosis of infectious diseases is determined by host-pathogen interactions. Control of pathogens has been the central dogma of treating infectious diseases in modern medicine, but the pathogen-directed medicine is facing significant challenges, including a lack of effective antimicrobials for newly emerging pathogens, pathogen drug resistance, and drug side effects. Here, a mathematic equation (termed equation of host-pathogen interactions, HPI-Equation) is developed to dissect the key variables of host-pathogen interactions. It shows that control of pathogens does not necessarily lead to host recovery. Instead, a combination of promoting a host's power of self-healing and balancing immune responses provides the best benefit for host. Moreover, the HPI-Equation elucidates the scientific basis of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a host-based medicine that treats infectious diseases by promoting self-healing power and balancing immune responses. The importance of self-healing power elucidated in the HPI-Equation is confirmed by recent studies that the tolerance mechanism, which is discovered in plants and animals and conceptually similar to self-healing power, improves host survival without directly attacking pathogens. In summary, the HPI-Equation describes host-pathogen interactions with mathematical logic and precision; it translates the ancient wisdoms of TCM into apprehensible modern sciences and opens a new venue for integrating TCM and modern medicine for a future medicine.

In 2014, the Geriatric Emergency Department (GED) Guidelines were published and endorsed by four major medical organizations. The multidisciplinary GED Guidelines characterized the complex needs of the older emergency department (ED) patient and current best practices, with the goal of promoting more cost-effective and patient-centered care. The recommendations are extensive and most EDs then and now have neither the resources nor the hospital administrative support to provide this additional service.
Discussion
At the 2021 American Academy of Emergency Medicine's Scientific Assembly, a panel of emergency physicians and geriatricians discussed the GED Guidelines and the current realities of EDs’ capacity to provide best practice and guideline–recommended care of GED patients. This article is a synthesis of the panel's presentation and discussion. With the substantial challenges in providing guideline-recommended care in EDs, this article will explore three high-impact GED clinical conditions to highlight guideline recommendations, challenges, and opportunities, and discuss realistically achievable expectations for non–GED-accredited institutions.
Conclusions
In 2014, the GED Guidelines were published, describing the current best practices for GED patients. Unfortunately, most of the EDs worldwide do not provide the level of service recommended by the GED Guidelines. The GED Guidelines can best be termed aspirational for U.S. EDs at the present time.}

Effective treatments against COVID-19 remain urgently in need although vaccination significantly reduces the incidence, hospitalization, and mortality. At present, antiviral drugs including Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid™), Remdesivir, and Molnupiravir have been authorized to treat COVID-19 and become more globally available. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for the treatment of epidemic diseases for a long history. Currently, various TCM formulae against COVID-19 such as Qingfei Paidu decoction, Xuanfei Baidu granule, Huashi Baidu granule, Jinhua Qinggan granule, Lianhua Qingwen capsule, and Xuebijing injection have been widely used in clinical practice in China, which may cause potential herb–drug interactions (HDIs) in patients under treatment with antiviral drugs and affect the efficacy and safety of medicines. However, information on potential HDIs between the above anti-COVID-19 drugs and TCM formulae is lacking, and thus this work seeks to summarize and highlight potential HDIs between antiviral drugs and TCM formulae against COVID-19, and especially pharmacokinetic HDIs mediated by metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters. These well-characterized HDIs could provide useful information on clinical concomitant medicine use to maximize clinical outcomes and minimize adverse and toxic effects.}

abstract = {Study objective
We compare intubation first-attempt success with the direct laryngoscope, hyperangulated video laryngoscope, and standard geometry video laryngoscope among emergency medicine residents at various postgraduate years (PGY) of training.
Methods
We analyzed prospective data from emergency department (ED) patients enrolled in the National Emergency Airway Registry from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 using mixed-effects logistic regression to assess the association between PGY of training and first-attempt success by the device.
Results
Among 15,204 intubations performed by emergency medicine trainees, first-attempt success for PGY-1, PGY-2, and PGY3+ residents, respectively were: 78.8% (95% CI, 75.0 to 82.2%), 81.3% (79.4 to 83.0), and 83.6% (95% CI, 82.1 to 85.1) for direct laryngoscope; 87.2% (95% CI, 84.2 to 89.7), 90.4% (95% CI, 88.8 to 91.9%), and 91.2% (95% CI, 89.8 to 92.5%) for hyperangulated video laryngoscope; and 88.7% (95% CI, 86.1 to 90.9), 90.2% (95% CI, 88.7 to 91.5%), and 94.6% (95% CI 93.9 to 95.3%) for standard geometry video laryngoscope. Direct laryngoscope first-attempt success improved for PGY-2 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],1.41; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.82) and PGY-3+ (aOR, 1.76; 1.36 to 2.27) trainees compared to PGY-1. Hyperangulated video laryngoscope success also improved for PGY-2 (aOR, 1.51; 1.1 to 2.05) and PGY-3+ (aOR, 1.56; 1.15 to 2.13) trainees compared to PGY-1. For the standard geometry video laryngoscope, only PGY-3+ (aOR, 1.72; 1.25 to 2.36) was associated with improved first-attempt success compared to PGY-1.
Conclusion
Each laryngoscopy device class was associated with improvement in first-attempt success as training progressed. The video laryngoscope outperformed the direct laryngoscope for all operator groups, and PGY-1 trainees achieved higher first-attempt success using a standard geometry video laryngoscope than PGY-3+ trainees using a direct laryngoscope. These findings support the conjecture that in adult patients, a direct laryngoscope should not be routinely used for the first intubation attempt unless clinical circumstances, such as the presence of a soiled airway, would favor its success. These findings need to be validated with prospective randomized clinical trials.}

Using placeboes rather than control drugs is increasingly popular in clinical trials of TCMs, as the therapeutic effects of the tested TCMs can be more properly judged. The basic attributes of TCM placeboes include similarity, safety, applicability and controllability. In particular, it is necessary to have similarities in appearance, color, smell and taste between the tested TCMs and placeboes. This is quite difficult for some TCMs due to their distinctive smell and taste. On the other hand, according to the TCM theory on homology of medicine and food, many foods also have certain bioactivities, potentially further complicating the selection of materials for TCM placeboes. In this review, firstly, studies on the special smell and taste of TCMs were introduced. Then, the preparation quality evaluation processes for TCM placeboes were summarized and discussed, based on the relevant literature published in recent years and the research results from our own lab. This review will facilitate the further research and development of TCM placeboes.}

abstract = {Purpose
Complementary health approaches (CHAs) equip patients to self-manage radiation therapy (RT)–related symptoms and fulfill unmet needs, but few disclose CHA use to their radiation oncologist. An integrative medicine educational program (IMEP) was developed to assess its ability to improve patient self-efficacy for symptom management and CHA use disclosure.
Methods and Materials
The IMEP included 4 1-hour sessions covering topics of (1) meditation, (2) yoga, (3) massage therapy, and (4) nutrition. Individuals over age 18 years and actively receiving RT were administered presession and postsession surveys. The primary outcomes were intention to disclose CHA use and self-efficacy. Qualitative data were assessed with a thematic approach.
Results
Overall, 23 patients attended 1 or more sessions, yielding 43 completed surveys. Compared with 35.9% of participants who had disclosed CHA use before the session, 67.4% intended to disclose after the session. Of the 5 self-efficacy statements, there were significant improvements in “I have ownership over my health” (increase of 0.42; 95% CI, 0.07-0.77; P = .01), “I have tools to manage my disease on my own” (1.14; 95% CI, 0.42-1.87; P = .001), and “I have control over my cancer” (0.96; 95% CI, 0.39-1.53; P < .001). Barriers to involvement included transportation, timing relative to RT appointment, and poor performance status.
Conclusions
A radiation-specific IMEP resulted in a high rate of intention to disclose CHA use and improvements in patients’ reported self-efficacy to manage radiation-related symptoms. However, substantial resources were needed to deliver the IMEP. Future work must focus on increasing accessibility through telehealth and flexible timing.}

Burnout is a psychosocial syndrome caused by stressful situations in the workplace. It affects 30%–60% of medical professionals. The aim of this study is to carry out a comparative analysis of its frequency before and after the COVID-19 outbreak in Spanish internal medicine attending physicians.
Methods
Surveys that included the Maslach Burnout Inventory were sent via email and associated social networks to physicians who were members of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine in 2019 and 2020.
Results
A non-significant increase in burnout was observed (38.0% vs. 34.4%). However, an increase in low personal fulfilment was observed (66.4% vs. 33.6%; p = 0.002), a dimension associated with the prevention of psychiatric morbidity, in addition to two others: emotional fatigue and depersonalization, which can negatively affect patient care.
Conclusions
It is essential to address this syndrome individually and institutionally.

abstract = {Introduction
Although Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM) is used by about one third of Moroccan patients with cancer, no study has examined attitudes and opinions about it. Thus, the goal of our study was to validate and adapt the ABCAM (Attitudes and Beliefs about Complementary and Alternative Medicine) scale to the Moroccan context.
Methods
The ABCAM's initial version was obtained through contact with its author and translated into the Moroccan dialect. After having been validated with professionals from oncology centers, the questionnaire was administered to 50 adult cancer patients to test and contextualize through an exploratory study. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess its reliability, and principal component analysis was used to assess its validity. Construct validity was also assessed by a non-parametric test of association between the scale variables and the T&CM use variable.
Results
The contextualized Moroccan version of the questionnaire was composed of 20 items. It was reliable as Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.78 for "Perceived socioeconomic barriers" to 0.96 for "Expected benefits". Three factors in the scale were associated with T&CM use.
Conclusion
This exploratory study showed that the ABCAM instrument in Darija (a Moroccan dialect) was reliable and valid for measuring cancer patients' attitudes and beliefs towards T&CM use.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to estimate and analyze the effects of out-of-pocket expenditure attributed to medicine on catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment. Our study also explored the determinants of CHE for Tunisian households.
Methods
CHE and impoverishment were estimated using the representative sample of 25 087 households’ survey of Budget, Consumption, and Living Standards in 2015. Logistic regression was applied to determine factors associated with the CHE.
Results
The occurrence of catastrophic expenditure on health and medicine from the total population was, respectively, estimated to be 18.4% and 8.0%, whereas the impoverishment was 2.8% and 1.8%. The catastrophic expenditure was high in households having a chronic disease, disability, elderly, and children younger than 5 years and those living in a rural area. The rich and insured households are also experiencing financial hardship.
Conclusions
Out-of-pocket expenditure for medicine generates high levels of catastrophic and impoverishment in Tunisia. To achieve universal and affordable access to medicine, policy makers should remove fees at public facilities for patients with chronic diseases and disabilities, consolidate public procurement and distribution, and ensure effective reimbursement of health insurance.}

abstract = {Outcomes
1. Demonstrate a need for the creation of medical humanities curricula at other institutions to support hospice and palliative medicine fellows in their personal growth. 2. Discuss how to structure a longitudinal arts and ethics curriculum by collaborating with community members and faculty.
Introduction
Trainees in hospice and palliative medicine bear witness to the full range of human emotions while caring for patients with serious illness. While there have been efforts to incorporate arts and humanities into medical education, most hospice and palliative medicine fellowship curricula only include one-time experiences, and few curricula to date engage with art forms beyond the written word and/or incorporate expertise from practitioners outside of medicine. We hypothesized that integrating the humanities into the formal curriculum would enhance coping skills and would grant fellows space to be more reflective, analytical, and empathetic. The Arts and Ethics curriculum was created to train fellows with necessary skills in humanism, ethics, and burnout prevention.
Methods
This curriculum targets education in humanist values, narrative medicine, ethical principles, and the arts. The goal of this curriculum is for fellows to look to the arts for insights into how better to process and cope with the difficulties of practicing medicine, particularly the unique stressors of hospice and palliative medicine. We conducted a survey of the 4 years of fellows (12) that have participated in the curriculum.
Curriculum
The curriculum involves active fellow participation and is divided into monthly large and small group sessions. For small group sessions, fellows are assigned various readings on a theme, participate in a discussion on the readings, and engage in reflective writing around a specific prompt. In large group sessions, an invited speaker presents on a topic relevant to the arts and bioethics followed by group discussion.
Results
Participants valued the variety of art forms presented, exposure to different writing styles and techniques, discussion and opportunities for bonding amongst fellows and faculty, examination of the fellows’ reactions to patient encounters, and exploration of the patient's perspective on experiencing illness.}

abstract = {The article discusses the historical evolution of asthma treatment and highlights recent advancements in personalized medicine, specifically the use of biologics in severe asthma therapy and its potential combination with allergen immunotherapy (AIT). One of the major breakthroughs of biologics is their potential effect on airway remodeling, a crucial aspect of asthma chronicity. The article introduces the concept of disease-modifying antiasthmatic drugs, which aim to modify the course of asthma and possibly modulate or prevent airway remodeling. Furthermore, the critical importance of patient-centered outcome measures to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of asthma treatments is emphasized, with the innovative concept of asthma remission introduced as a potential outcome. Recent studies suggest that AIT can be used as an additional therapy to biologic agents for the treatment of allergic asthma. The combination of these treatments has been shown to induce improved clinical outcomes. However, AIT is actually not recommended for use in patients with severe asthma, but encouraging results from studies investigating the combined use of AIT and biologics indicate a novel approach to exploring these treatment modalities. In conclusion, the introduction of biologics and AIT has changed the scenario of respiratory allergy treatment, from a “one size fits all” approach to embracing “individual treatments.”}

abstract = {Background
To explore the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Methods
A systematic search was made of eight databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Sinomed) and two trial registries (WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov) from inception to September 2022. The effect size was presented as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with their 95% confidence interval (CI). The Cochrane Risk of Bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) tools were used for quality appraisal.
Results
Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 732 participants were included. Comparing CHM alone with routine treatment, the CHM group showed lower aspartate aminotransferase (MD=-11.47 U/L, 95%CI[-13.05, -9.89], low certainty), lower alanine aminotransferase (MD=-2.68 U/L, 95%CI[-4.27, -1.08], low certainty), lower total bilirubin (MD=-4.31 mmol/L, 95%CI[-5.66, -2.96], low certainty), lower bilirubin direct (MD=-3.19 mmol/L, 95%CI[-3.87, -2.51], low certainty), and higher effective rate (assessed by symptoms and liver indicators) (RR=1.13, 95%CI[1.06, 1.20], low certainty). A significant difference was also found in CHM plus routine treatment versus routine treatment in the previous outcomes. No significant difference was found on helper T cells among these comparisons. Only one RCT reported safety of CHM and found no adverse reaction during the trial.
Conclusions
CHM may improve the liver function indices and effective rate for HIV/AIDS patients with DILI. However, the sample size was small and quality was low. Larger-samples of high-quality trials are needed.}

Due to the multiple components of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the exact mechanisms of their effects on the human body remain unclear. This review aimed to summarize the TCM formulas that have modulatory effects on gut microbiota structure.
Methods
Since TCM is usually taken orally, TCM can exhibit direct modulatory effects on gut microbiota. In recent years, a growing amount of research has focused on the regulatory effects of TCM on structural alteration of gut microbiota. PubMed, web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data Knowledge Platform (Wanfang) were used to search related articles published in recent years.
Results
In this review, we summarize the TCM formulas that have modulatory effects on gut microbiota structure according to their classification. Future directions of research on the regulation of gut microbiota by TCM and its application are also discussed.
Conclusion
This review summarized the TCM formulas that have modulatory effects on gut microbiota structure and their interaction mechanisms, which may help to support the effective exploration and application of herbal medicines.}

This research aims to propose a more efficient and effective practitioner-wise model for medicine purchasing strategic management in the healthcare industry. For such, this study combined action research with a case study to develop a Purchasing Portfolio Model based on the Kraljic Purchasing Matrix in the context of a central hospital. Analytic Hierarchy Process techniques were used for criteria prioritization and direct measurement to score each criterion. Multi-Dimensional Scaling was used to position the items in the quadrants of the Kraljic Purchasing Matrix. The Purchasing Portfolio Models developed allows the classification of different classes of medicine in terms of strategic impact and supply risk, enabling the development of differentiated purchasing strategies. The results confirmed the model's value in defining medicine purchasing strategies in a central hospital and provided guidelines for applying the model.}

This study aimed to perform a comprehensive review of modeling approaches and methodological and policy challenges in the economic evaluation (EE) of precision medicine (PM) across clinical stages.
Methods
First, a systematic review was performed to assess the approaches of EEs in the past 10 years. Next, a targeted review of methodological articles was conducted for methodological and policy challenges in performing EEs of PM. All findings were synthesized into a structured framework that focused on patient population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Time, Equity and ethics, Adaptability and Modeling aspects, named the “PICOTEAM” framework. Finally, a stakeholder consultation was conducted to understand the major determinants of decision making in PM investment.
Results
In 39 methodological articles, we identified major challenges to the EE of PM. These challenges include that PM applications involve complex and evolving clinical decision space, that clinical evidence is sparse because of small subgroups and complex pathways in PM settings, a one-time PM application may have lifetime or intergenerational impacts but long-term evidence is often unavailable, and that equity and ethics concerns are exceptional. In 275 EEs of PM, current approaches did not sufficiently capture the value of PM compared with targeted therapies, nor did they differentiate Early EEs from Conventional EEs. Finally, policy makers perceived the budget impact, cost savings, and cost-effectiveness of PM as the most important determinants in decision making.
Conclusions
There is an urgent need to modify existing guidelines or develop a new reference case that fits into the new healthcare paradigm of PM to guide decision making in research and development and market access.}

The use of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and predictive analytics, has shown great promise in health care. Despite its strong potential, there has been limited use in health care settings. In this systematic review, we aim to determine the main barriers to successful implementation of AI in healthcare and discuss potential ways to overcome these challenges.
Methods
We conducted a literature search in PubMed (1/1/2001–1/1/2023). The search was restricted to publications in the English language, and human study subjects. We excluded articles that did not discuss AI, machine learning, predictive analytics, and barriers to the use of these techniques in health care. Using grounded theory methodology, we abstracted concepts to identify major barriers to AI use in medicine.
Results
We identified a total of 2,382 articles. After reviewing the 306 included papers, we developed 19 major themes, which we categorized into three levels: the Technical/Algorithm, Stakeholder, and Social levels (TASS). These themes included: Lack of Explainability, Need for Validation Protocols, Need for Standards for Interoperability, Need for Reporting Guidelines, Need for Standardization of Performance Metrics, Lack of Plan for Updating Algorithm, Job Loss, Skills Loss, Workflow Challenges, Loss of Patient Autonomy and Consent, Disturbing the Patient-Clinician Relationship, Lack of Trust in AI, Logistical Challenges, Lack of strategic plan, Lack of Cost-effectiveness Analysis and Proof of Efficacy, Privacy, Liability, Bias and Social Justice, and Education.
Conclusion
We identified 19 major barriers to the use of AI in healthcare and categorized them into three levels: the Technical/Algorithm, Stakeholder, and Social levels (TASS). Future studies should expand on barriers in pediatric care and focus on developing clearly defined protocols to overcome these barriers.}

The delivery of pharmaceutical care – and what that means – has been at the centre of many transformations of the pharmacy profession in the last century. Today, the exponential growth of pharmacies which provide pharmaceutical care exclusively online has placed increased scrutiny on the quality of the care they provide.
Aim
As more patients are managed by remote pharmaceutical care (via medicines delivery services), we sought to critically evaluate this service to identify new research directions.
Methods
The COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research and Standards for reporting qualitative research guideline provided the methodological framework throughout this process.
Results
We reveal that although home delivery services ensure that many patients have access to their medicines, it may reduce time available to provide comprehensive pharmaceutical care, particularly in traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies.
Conclusion
We highlight a critical need for research in this area and suggest a variety of research directions: is remote pharmaceutical care a matter of convenience? Does remote pharmaceutical care help patients adhere to their medicines? How do digital health innovations impact care across patient demographics? What does comprehensive pharmaceutical care mean for patients?}

abstract = {The explosion of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the widespread use of genomic data in precision medicine. Currently, several neonatal genome projects have emerged to explore the advantages of NGS to diagnose or screen for rare genetic disorders. These projects have made remarkable achievements, but still the genome data could be further explored with the assistance of phenotype collection. In contrast, longitudinal birth cohorts are great examples to record and apply phenotypic information in clinical studies starting at the neonatal period, especially the trajectory analyses for health development or disease progression. It is obvious that efficient integration of genotype and phenotype benefits not only the clinical management of rare genetic disorders but also the risk assessment of complex diseases. Here, we first summarize the recent neonatal genome projects as well as some longitudinal birth cohorts. Then, we propose two simplified strategies by integrating genotypic and phenotypic information in precision medicine based on current studies. Finally, research collaborations, sociological issues, and future perspectives are discussed. How to maximize neonatal genomic information to benefit the pediatric population remains an area in need of more research and effort.}

abstract = {Introduction
The perceived COVID-19 risk may lead to the use of various complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities to reduce the potential risks of this disease. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between individuals' use of complementary and alternative medicine during the pandemic in Turkey and their attitudes towards perceived COVID-19 risk.
Methods
The study was conducted in Turkey between November 2021 and March 2022 and 1003 individuals voluntarily participated. The Personal Information Form, Attitude Towards Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicine Scale (HCAMS), and Perceived COVID-19 Risk Scale (PCRS) were used for data collection. To evaluate the data descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation, and Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis were used.
Results
In the study, 54.2% of the individuals were found to use CAM during the pandemic, and 56.2% believed that CAM practices were useful in preventing or recovering from COVID-19. It was revealed that 53.8% of the individuals drank herbal tea, 55.2% used religious and spiritual healing to manage, 6.6% used massage, and 10.1% applied aromatherapy. The mean total score of the HCAMS was 28.29 ± 4.99, and the mean total score of the perceived COVID-19 risk scale was 27.78 ± 6.35. A statistically significant positive correlation was identified between the CAM subscale and the emotional risk subscale (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Individuals had a positive attitude towards using CAM during the pandemic period, the risk perception of COVID-19 was high and CAM methods were widely used.The literature should be supported by increasing the current and scientific studies in which CAM methods are questioned and their benefits are investigated during epidemic periods.}

Blueprint provides a base for assessment by assigning proportionate weightage to various content areas and helps the paper setter to construct a uniform and valid assessment. This study aimed to design and validate a blueprint for theory in Community Medicine as per the new curriculum for Medical Undergraduates in India.
Methods
Blueprint in community medicine was designed by assigning impact score (I) and frequency score (F) for the competencies. Blueprint was validated using the Content Validity Index (CVI), and inter-rater agreement for subject experts using Fleiss' kappa statistics was calculated. Feedback from faculty and students was obtained afterward to assess the postimplementation response.
Results
Blueprint was designed by an expert group where impact score and frequency score were assigned to 146 competencies in the theory of Community Medicine. In Delphi survey I, 63.2% of subject experts responded, while in Delphi survey II, a response rate of 58.3% was achieved. Value of the Fleiss' Kappa test for an inter-rater agreement was 0.68, i.e. “substantial agreement,” while CVI among the raters came out to be 0.86, i.e. overall valid assessment. Feedback of faculty (n = 11) suggested that the blueprint was helpful and standardized the paper setting, whereas feedback from students (n = 138) depicted that it helped in preparing for exams, and they would recommend it to other students.
Conclusion
Validated blueprint by consensus of subject experts has impact score and frequency score along with topic-wise distribution of marks for the convenience of faculty and its utility is well proven among learners too.}

We evaluated the willingness of Family Medicine residents to engage in SDM, before and after an educational intervention.
Methods
We delivered a lecture and a workshop for residents on implementing SDM in preventive health care. Before the lecture (T1), participants completed a measure of their willingness to engage in SDM. Six months later, participants completed the measure a second time (T2).
Results
At T1, 64 of 73 residents who attended the educational session completed incorpoRATE. Six months later, 44 of 64 participants completed the measure a second time (T2). The range of incorpoRATE sum scores at T1 was from 4.9 to 9.1 out of 10. Among the 44 participants who completed incorpoRATE at both time points, the mean scores were 7.0 ± 1.0 at T1 and 7.4 ± 1.0 at T2 (t = −2.833, p = 0.007, Cohen’s D = 0.43).
Conclusion
Among Family Medicine residents, the willingness to engage in SDM is highly variable. This suggests a lack of consensus in the mind of these residents about SDM. Although mean scores at T2 were significantly higher, we question the educational importance of this change.
Practice implications
incorpoRATE is a promising measure for educators. Understanding how willing a particular physician audience is to undertake SDM, and which elements require attention, could be helpful in designing more targeted curricula. Further research is needed to understand how the perceived stakes of a clinical situation influence physician willingness to engage in SDM.}

abstract = {Background
A supplementary chapter on the diagnostic patterns of Traditional Medicine, including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), was introduced into the latest edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). However, evidence-based rules are yet to be developed for pattern differentiation in patients with specific conventional medicine diagnoses. Without such standardised rules, the level of diagnostic agreement amongst practitioners is unsatisfactory. This may reduce the reliability of practice and the generalisability of clinical research.
Purpose
Using cross-sectional study data from patients with functional dyspepsia, we reviewed and illustrated a quantitative approach that combines TCM expertise and computer algorithmic capacity, namely latent tree analysis (LTA), to establish score-based pattern differentiation rules.
Review of methods
LTA consists of six major steps: (i) the development of a TCM clinical feature questionnaire; (ii) statistical pattern discovery; (iii) statistical pattern interpretation; (iv) TCM diagnostic pattern identification; (v) TCM diagnostic pattern quantification; and (vi) TCM diagnostic pattern differentiation. Step (i) involves the development of a comprehensive questionnaire covering all essential TCM clinical features of the disease of interest via a systematic review. Step (ii) to (iv) required input from TCM experts, with the algorithmic capacity provided by Lantern, a dedicated software for TCM LTA.
Motivational example to illustrate the methods
LTA is used to quantify the diagnostic importance of various clinical features in each TCM diagnostic pattern in terms of mutual information and cumulative information coverage. LTA is also capable of deriving score-based differentiation rules for each TCM diagnostic pattern, with each clinical feature being provided with a numerical score for its presence. Subsequently, a summative threshold is generated to allow pattern differentiation. If the total score of a patient exceeded the threshold, the patient was diagnosed with that particular TCM diagnostic pattern.
Conclusions
LTA is a quantitative approach to improving the inter-rater reliability of TCM diagnosis and addressing the current lack of objectivity in the ICD-11. Future research should focus on how diagnostic information should be coupled with effectiveness evidence derived from network meta-analysis. This will enable the development of an implementable diagnostics-to-treatment scheme for further evaluation. If successful, this scheme will transform TCM practice in an evidence-based manner, while preserving the validity of the model.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Complementary medicine, which refers to therapies that are not part of conventional medicine, comprising both evidence-based and non-evidence-based interventions, is increasingly used following a diagnosis of cancer. We aimed to investigate out-of-pocket spending patterns on complementary medicine and its association with adverse financial outcomes following cancer in middle-income countries in southeast Asia.
Methods
In this prospective cohort study, data on newly diagnosed patients with cancer were derived from the ASEAN Costs in Oncology (ACTION) cohort study, a prospective longitudinal study in 47 centres located in eight countries in southeast Asia. The ACTION study measured household expenditures on complementary medicine in the immediate year after cancer diagnosis. Participants were given cost diaries at baseline to record illness-related payments that were directly incurred and not reimbursed by insurance over the 12-month period after study recruitment. We assessed incidence of financial catastrophe (out-of-pocket cancer-related costs ≥30% of annual household income), medical impoverishment (reduction in annual household income to below poverty line following subtraction of out-of-pocket cancer-related costs), and economic hardship (inability to make necessary household payments) at 1 year.
Findings
Between March, 2012, and September, 2013, 9513 participants were recruited into the ACTION cohort study, of whom 4754 (50·0%) participants were included in this analysis. Out-of-pocket expenditures on complementary medicine were reported by 1233 households. These payments constituted 8·6% of the annual total out-of-pocket health costs in lower-middle-income countries and 42·9% in upper-middle-income countries. Expenditures on complementary medicine significantly increased risks of financial catastrophe (adjusted odds ratio 1·52 [95% CI 1·23–1·88]) and medical impoverishment (1·75 [1·36–2·24]) at 12 months in upper-middle-income countries only. However, the risks were significantly higher for economically disadvantaged households, irrespective of country income group.
Interpretation
Integration of evidence-supported complementary therapies into mainstream cancer care, along with interventions to address use of non-evidence-based complementary medicine, might help alleviate any associated adverse financial impacts.
Funding
None.}

The hazards associated with spaceflight, and their corresponding medical problems, are first briefly discussed. Subsequently, the infeasibility of present-day medicines provision systems for supporting deep space exploration is examined. The existing knowledge gaps on the altered clinical effects of medicines in space are evaluated, and suggestions are provided on how clinical trials in space might be conducted. An envisioned model of on-site production and delivery of medicines in space is proposed, referencing emerging technologies (e.g. Chemputing, synthetic biology, and 3D printing) being developed on Earth that may be adapted for extra-terrestrial use. This review concludes with a critical analysis on the regulatory considerations necessary to facilitate the adoption of these technologies and proposes a framework by which these may be enforced. In doing so, this commentary aims to instigate discussions on the pharmaceutical needs of deep space exploration, and strategies on how these may be met.}

Pueraria Flos (PF), a traditional herbal medicine, is botanically from the dried flowers of Pueraria lobate (Willd.) Ohwi. (Chinese: 野葛) or Pueraria thomsonii Benth. (Chinese: 粉葛). It has a long history of thousands of years in China for awakening the spleen, clearing the lungs, relieving alcohol.
Aim of the review
This review aims to report the up-to-date research progress in ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology, metabolism and therapeutic application of PF, so as to provide a strong basis for future clinical treatment and scientific research.
Materials and methods
Relevant information on PF was collected from scientific literature databases including PubMed, CNKI and other literature sources (Ph.D. and M.Sc. dissertations and Chinese herbal classic books) by using the keyword “Puerariae”.
Results
Briefly, phytochemical research report has isolated 39 flavonoids, 19 saponins and 25 volatile oils from PF. Flavonoids and saponins are the most important bioactive compounds, and most of the quality control studies focus on these two types of compounds. Modern pharmacological studies have revealed their significant biological activities in relieving alcoholism, hepatoprotective, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidation, which provides theoretical support for the traditional use.
Conclusions
Comprehensive analysis showed that pharmacological activity of most purified compounds from PF had not been reported. Kakkalide, tectoridin and their deglycosylated metabolites (irisolidone and tectorigenin) has been focused on excessively due to their higher content and better activities. This leads to low development and resources waste. Interestingly, PF made a breakthrough in the field of food. Many kinds of fat-lowering foods such as PILLBOX Onaka have been popular in Japan market, which received extensive attention. Therefore, we suggest that future research can be paid attention on the development of the plant's function in the field of food and medicine, as well as the transformation from experimental to clinical.}

abstract = {Across the world traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) product use is prevalent with some countries reporting greater than 50% of the population using these products. T&CM products are primarily self-selected through retail outlets including pharmacies. Pharmacists across the world generally agree they should play a role in ensuring the appropriate and safe use of T&CM products but report being time and resource poor to do so. In this commentary, it is proposed that pharmacy technicians as members of the pharmacy workforce, who with adequate education, and supportive technologies could support pharmacists in providing guidance to consumers and patients about the appropriate and safe use of T&CM products. Pharmacy technicians play a crucial role in the pharmacy workforce, serving as integral members of healthcare teams fulfilling a wide array of tasks essential for the efficient functioning of pharmacies and ensuring the safe dispensation of medications. They have been described by pharmacists as the “the face of the pharmacy” in the community setting and relied on not only for mitigating and triaging problems, but also be primarily responsible for developing rapport, eliciting trust and even loyalty from pharmacy patrons. As such, there is a momentous opportunity for pharmacy technicians to play a role in providing T&CM advice and triaging the need for pharmacists’ intervention where harm, or risk of is identified.}

Ruyi Zhenbao Pill (RYZBP) is a traditional Tibetan medicine that has been used for over 300 years in China to treat neurological diseases, specifically neuropathic pain (NP). However, its characteristics and mechanism of action in treating NP remains unclear.
Aim of the study
Based on animal experiments and transcriptomics to evaluate the characteristics and mechanism of RYZBP in treating NP.
Methods
Mice were divided into six groups using random assignment: sham-operation group, spinal nerve ligation (SNL) group, RYZBP low (0.65 g kg−1), medium (1.30 g kg−1), high (2.60 g kg−1) doses groups, and positive drug pregabalin (PGB, 0.05 g kg−1) group. Mice received intragastrical administered for 14 consecutive days. SNL and intrathecal injection models were employed. The analgesic effects were assessed using the Von Frey test, Acetone test, and Hot Plate test. L5 spinal dorsal horns were collected for transcriptomics on day 15. The potential signaling pathways and Hub genes of RYZBP to ameliorate NP were obtained through transcriptomics and network pharmacology. Molecular docking was utilized to evaluate the binding ability of candidate active ingredients with the Hub genes. Finally, western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to validate the predicted targets.
Results
RYZBP demonstrated a dose-dependent alleviation of mechanical allodynia, cold and heat stimulus-induced pain in SNL mice. Transcriptomics analysis identified 24 differentially expressed genes, and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the CXCL10-CXCR3 signal axis may be the primary biological pathway through which RYZBP relieve NP. Molecular docking test indicated that the active ingredient in RYZBP exhibit a strong affinity for the target protein CXCL10. WB and IF tests showed that RYZBP can significantly inhibit CXCL10 and CXCR3 and its downstream molecules expression in the spinal dorsal horn of SNL mice. Additionally, intrathecal injection of rmCXCL10 worsened pain hypersensitivity, while RYZBP was able to suppress the pain hypersensitivity response induced by rmCXCL10 and reduce the expression levels of CXCL10 and CXCR3 and its downstream molecules.
Conclusion
RYZBP had a significant analgesic effect on NP model, and this effect may be related to inhibiting the CXCL10-CXCR3 pathway in the spinal dorsal horn.}

Effectiveness of different tele-medicine strategies varies in different medical conditions. Use of basic tele-medicine strategy like mobile health (m-health) can be an effective option in different medical conditions in a resource-poor setting.
Aims
To study effectiveness and satisfaction of tele-medicine among persons with epilepsy (PWE) in a developing nation during COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Persons with epilepsy aged 18 years or more who have attended epilepsy clinic at least once physically and were asked for regular follow-up were included. A cross-sectional telephonic survey was conducted to assess effectiveness of tele-medicine over past 1 year. Satisfaction was assessed by tele-medicine satisfaction questionnaire.
Result
31.9% of PWE have used tele-medicine facility in last 1 year and 58.2% were unaware of the availability of such a facility. Among those who utilized tele-medicine, 95.3% were able to explain their concerns satisfactorily during tele-consultation and change in prescription was done in 42.8%. None experienced any new adverse event. Overall, more than 95% were satisfied with tele-consultation and more than 80% wanted to use it again.
Conclusion
Even basic tele-medicine strategies can be a very effective and satisfactory mode of follow-up for PWE in resource-poor settings. Steps should be undertaken to make people aware of the availability of such a facility.}

Here, the combination of organ-on-a-chip and bioprinting into engineering high-content in vitro tissue models is envisioned to address some precision medicine challenges. This strategy could be employed to tackle the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has made a significant impact and paradigm shift in our society. Nevertheless, despite that vaccines against COVID-19 have been successfully developed and vaccination programs are already being deployed worldwide, it will likely require some time before it is available to everyone. Furthermore, there are still some uncertainties and lack of a full understanding of the virus as demonstrated in the high number new mutations arising worldwide and reinfections of already vaccinated individuals. To this end, efficient diagnostic tools and treatments are still urgently needed. In this context, the convergence of bioprinting and organ-on-a-chip technologies, either used alone or in combination, could possibly function as a prominent tool in addressing the current pandemic. This could enable facile advances of important tools, diagnostics, and better physiologically representative in vitro models specific to individuals allowing for faster and more accurate screening of therapeutics evaluating their efficacy and toxicity. This review will cover such technological advances and highlight what is needed for the field to mature for tackling the various needs for current and future pandemics as well as their relevancy towards precision medicine.}
