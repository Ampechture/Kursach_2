While some continue to believe medicine is apolitical and grounded purely in science, history and research reveal that medicine is inseparable from underlying systems, laws, and policies. Obesity is a useful case study. Weight loss trials have shown the immense difficulty in achieving and sustaining weight loss without addressing overlying systems. Barriers are double for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) with obesity, who must contend with multiple layers of oppressive systems. Increasingly, illness is not a matter of bad luck, but is a function of oppressive structures. COVID-19 likely originates in a deteriorating environment, we have an increasing global burden of disease from oppressive sales of food, sugar, alcohol, guns, nicotine, and other harmful products, and social inequality and resource hoarding are at a peak. Medicine can and must participate in redefining these systems. In doing so, it must center the experiences of BIPOC and push change that alleviates power disparities.}

abstract = {Screening and identification of potential compounds from herbal medicine is a prevailing way to find a lead for the development of innovative drugs. This promotes the development of new methods that are feasible in complex matrices. Here, we described a one-step reversible methodology to immobilize nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) onto amino microsphere coated with a DNA strand specifically binding to the receptor. The specific interaction allowed us to achieve the immobilization of PPARγ by mixing the DNA modified microspheres with E. coli lysates expressing the receptor. Characterization of the immobilized receptor was carried out by morphology and binding specificity analysis. Feasibility of immobilized PPARγ in the drug-receptor interaction analysis was performed by an injection amount-dependent method. Besides, immobilized PPARγ was also applied in screening modulators of the receptor from Coptidis Rhizoma extract. The binding of the screened compounds to PPARγ was examined by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The results showed that immobilized PPARγ was stable for thirty days with a high-specificity of ligand recognition at the subtype receptor level. Berberine and palmatine were the bioactive compounds of Coptidis Rhizoma specifically binding to PPARγ. The two compounds exhibited half maximal inhibitory concentrations of 4.11 and 2.98 μM during their binding to the receptor. We concluded that the current method is possible to become a common strategy for the immobilization of nuclear receptors, and the immobilized receptor is a high throughput method for recognizing and separating the receptor modulators from complex matrices including herbal medicine.}

The aim of this review is to address those threats and discuss the health issues that impact seabirds in Brazil through the lens of conservation medicine. In total, 93 records were selected, regarding the previously mentioned threats, as well as the interaction between seabirds and etiologic agents and chemical compounds. The most studied species was the Spheniscus magellanicus and most of the records were published in the last 10 years, which indicates that although the health status of this group is still poorly addressed in Brazil, the studies have been increasing and created a background for the development of new research on this topic. This manuscript also highlights the urgency in performing transdisciplinary studies to better understand the health risks for seabirds and human populations associated with marine ecosystems.}

Barriers to success include small numbers of clinical academic researchers across all professions focussing on older people, and lack of career pathways, role models and support for non-medical clinical researchers. The workshop identified strengths in the tradition of multidisciplinary working in the care of older people, research questions that lend themselves naturally to multidisciplinary working, increasing interest from funders in multidisciplinary research, and untapped opportunities for greater commercial engagement. Initiatives to improve engagement of students and trainees, mentorship, career pathways, networking across research centres and possibly developing a national School of Older People's Care Research are all ways that we can ensure the growth of multidisciplinary research to best serve older people's health and social care in the future.}

We provide a mutational landscape of GA highlighting a) germline pathogenic variants associated with hereditary GA, b) germline risk variants associated with sporadic GA, and c) somatic variants present in sporadic GA in LATAM, and analyze how this landscape can be applied for precision medicine. We found that Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela are the countries with more published studies from LATAM explicitly related to GA. Our analysis displayed that different germline pathogenic variants for the CDH1 gene have been identified for hereditary GA in Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, and Mexican populations. An increased risk of developing somatic GA is associated with the following germline risk variants: IL-4, IL-8, TNF-α, PTGS2, NFKB1, RAF1, KRAS and MAPK1 in Brazilian; IL-10 in Chilean; IL-10 in Colombian; EGFR and ERRB2 in Mexican, TCF7L2 and Chr8q24 in Venezuelan population. The path from mutational landscape to precision medicine requires four development levels: 1) Data compilation, 2) Data analysis and integration, 3) Development and approval of clinical approaches, and 4) Population benefits. Generating local genomic information is the initial padlock to overcome to generate and apply precision medicine.}

: The persistent inflammatory skin condition psoriasis disorder poses a significant health burden globally. This review explores recent advancements in treating psoriasis by harnessing the therapeutic potential of flavonoids, naturally occurring substances having anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.
Methods
The following keywords were used to search the online databases: Flavonoid, psoriasis, traditional applications, Chinese herb; Scopus, web of science, and PubMed. Consequently, this review set out to compile a synopsis of the documented phytochemistry and recent advancement of the selected plant species.
Results
: Specifically, flavonoids like quercetin and kaempferol have demonstrated promising results in mitigating psoriatic symptoms by targeting key molecular pathways. In conjunction with these advancements, a novel drug delivery system has been introduced to optimize flavonoid efficacy. This innovative approach employs nanocarrier systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLnp) and liposomes, to enhance the bioavailability and stability of flavonoids. By ensuring controlled release and targeted delivery, these systems address the challenges of poor solubility and maximize the therapeutic impact on psoriatic lesions. This dual strategy, integrating flavonoid-based treatment advancements with an innovative drug delivery system, presents a comprehensive and promising avenue for improving psoriasis management.
Discussion
: Future research and clinical validation are crucial to establishing the safety and efficacy of this integrated approach, potentially reshaping the landscape of psoriasis therapeutics.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The main clinical manifestations of eczema include itching, erythema, swelling and pain. Currently, allergies and TH1/TH2 cytokine imbalances are significant causes of eczema. TCM believes that eczema is mainly caused by incongruity between dry and wet. Wenguanmu ointment is a classic Mongolian medicine, which mainly composed of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge, Coptis chinensis Franch and Bezoar. These ingredients can clear heat and dampness, dispel wind and dehumidification, anti-inflammatoryad analgesic. In this study, it was found that Wenguanmu ointment can treat eczema with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipruritic.
Aim of the study
In this study, the content of main components in Wenguanmu ointment was tested. Moreover, the therapeutic effect and mechanism of Wenguanmu ointment on eczema model mice were studied.
Materials and methods
Kunming mice (25 ± 2 g) were randomly divided into 6 groups: Control group; Model group; Vehicle group; Wenguanmu ointment group; Compound dexamethasone acetate cream group; Chushizhiyang ointment group. The eczema mouse model was established by DNCB. HPLC and TLC tests were used to determine the content of the main components in Wenguanmu ointment. HE staining was used to assess skin damage in mice. In order to detect the anti-inflammatory effect of Wenguanmu ointment on eczema, The levels of IgE, TNF-α, IFN-γ, COX-2 and IL-4 in serum was measured by ELISA. Genecards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man databases were used to analyze potential target gene predictions, and it was speculated that Wenguanmu ointment was associated with NF−κB signaling pathway and chemokine signaling pathway. To detect this inference, RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to detect protein and mRNA levels of CKLF-1, IκB-α, and NF-κB.
Results
Wenguanmu ointment can repress the symptoms of eczema caused by 2, 4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and inhibit the level of serum immunoglobulin E. Simultaneously it restrain the elevation of miscellaneous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as reducing the expression of CKLF-1 and NF-κB protein in the nucleus, and increasing the protein expression of IκB to improve eczema.
Conclusions
The ameliorating effect of Wenguanmu ointment on eczema lesions can play a importment role by inhibiting the CKLF-1/NF-κB pathway.}

abstract = {Objective
Huangqi Decoction (HQD), a classical traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been used as a valid treatment for alleviating liver fibrosis; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown. Although our previous studies showed that microRNA-663a (miR-663a) suppresses the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the transforming growth factor-β/small mothers against decapentaplegic (TGF-β/Smad) pathway, whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in HSC activation via the miR-663a/TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway has not yet reported. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of lncRNA lnc-C18orf26-1 in the activation of HSCs and the mechanism by which HQD inhibits hepatic fibrosis.
Methods
The expression levels of lnc-C18orf26-1, miR-663a and related genes were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. HSCs were transfected with the miR-663a mimic or inhibitor and lnc-C18orf26-1 small interfering RNAs. The water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 assay was used to assess the proliferation rate of HSCs. Changes in lncRNA expression were evaluated in miR-663a-overexpressing HSCs by using microarray to identify miR-663a-regulated lncRNAs. RNA hybrid was used to predict the potential miR-663a binding sites on lncRNAs. Luciferase reporter assays further confirmed the interaction between miR-663a and the lncRNA. The expression levels of collagen α-2(I) chain (COL1A2), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway-related proteins were determined using Western blotting.
Results
Lnc-C18orf26-1 was upregulated in TGF-β1-activated HSCs and competitively bound to miR-663a. Knockdown of lnc-C18orf26-1 inhibited HSC proliferation and activation, downregulated TGF-β1-stimulated α-SMA and COL1A2 expression, and inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. HQD suppressed the proliferation and activation of HSCs. HQD increased miR-663a expression and decreased lnc-C18orf26-1 expression in HSCs. Further studies showed that HQD inhibited the expression of COL1A2, α-SMA, TGF-β1, TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-βRI) and phosphorylated Smad2 (p-Smad2) in HSCs, and these effects were reversed by miR-663a inhibitor treatment.
Conclusion
Our study identified lnc-C18orf26-1 and miR-663a as promising therapeutic targets for hepatic fibrosis. HQD inhibits HSC proliferation and activation at least partially by regulating the lnc-C18orf26-1/miR-663a/TGF-β1/TGF-βRI/p-Smad2 axis.}

Based on clinical and molecular features of breast tumors, patients are treated with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and/or radiotherapy and more recently with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. These different therapeutic options have markedly improved patient outcomes. However, further improvement is needed to fight against resistance to treatment. In the rapidly growing area of research for personalized medicine, predictive biomarkers - which predict patient response to therapy - are essential tools to select the patients who are most likely to benefit from the treatment, with the aim to give the right therapy to the right patient and avoid unnecessary overtreatment. The search for predictive biomarkers is an active field of research that includes genomic, proteomic and/or machine learning approaches. In this review, we describe current strategies and innovative tools to identify, evaluate and validate new biomarkers. We also summarize current predictive biomarkers in breast cancer and discuss companion biomarkers of targeted therapy in the context of precision medicine.}

However, introducing artificial entities in the healthcare context poses some challenges and risks that must be considered to avoid negative influence on clinical practice and doctor–patient relationships. This contribution pointed attention to these aspects, focusing on the psychological aspects related to the implementation of AI in the healthcare context. The active role of “human doctors” is also discussed, highlighting the relevance of psychological skills in the process of care, such as emotional intelligence (a human ability to regulate, recognize, and manage one's and other's emotions).}

The present study was aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of TTKFY, on dopaminergic neuron development, antioxidant activities, and gene expression involved in the dopaminergic pathway in the MPTP-treated zebrafish model. Zebrafish larvae were treated with MPTP (70 μM) to induce PD and then by different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 4 ml/L) of TTKFY. Transgenic zebrafish Vmat: GFP at 5 dpf were used to observe the development of dopaminergic neurons. The activities of T-Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), malonaldehyde (MDA) and mRNA gene expression of dopamine pathway were quantified. MPTP-treated zebrafish larvae showed degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, locomotion dysfunction, diminished activities of antioxidant enzymes, MDA accumulation, and altered gene expression of dopamine pathway. In contrast, TTKFY protected dopaminergic neurons, ameliorated behavioral impairments, antioxidant activities and mRNA gene expression of dopamine pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, TTKFY confers protective effects against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and the mechanisms of protection may be related to the recovery of dopaminergic neurons by reducing oxidative stress via restoring cellular defense mechanisms and thereby highlighting its therapeutic potential to prevent the progression of PD. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of action of TTKFY on neuroprotection in the MPTP-induced PD model.}

The mechanisms of US in different diagnosis and treatment are different, and the functional application of commercial US is also expanding. In particular, recent developments in nanotechnology have led to a wider use of US in precision medicine. In this review, we focus on US in combination with versatile micro and nanoparticles (NPs)/nanovesicles for tumor theranostics. We first introduce US-assisted drug delivery as a stimulus-responsive approach that spatiotemporally regulates the deposit of nanomedicines in target tissues. Multiple functionalized NPs and their US-regulated drug-release curves are analyzed in detail. Moreover, as a typical representative of US therapy, sonodynamic antitumor strategy is attracting researchers' attention. The collaborative efficiency and mechanisms of US and various nano-sensitizers such as nano-porphyrins and organic/inorganic nanosized sensitizers are outlined in this paper. A series of physicochemical processes during ultrasonic cavitation and NPs activation are also discussed. Finally, the new applications of US and diagnostic NPs in tumor-monitoring and image-guided combined therapy are summarized. Diagnostic NPs contain substances with imaging properties that enhance US contrast and photoacoustic imaging. The development of such high-resolution, low-background US-based imaging methods has contributed to modern precision medicine. It is expected that the integration of non-invasive US and nanotechnology will lead to significant breakthroughs in future clinical applications.}

To study the influencing factors of blood stasis constitution and provide a basis for treating blood stasis-related diseases by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution identification.
Methods
Data were collected using the self-developed TCM constitution identification platform based on B/S model by the project team. The obtained data were divided into blood stasis constitution and normal constitution groups. The differences of the categorical type influencing factors (gender, birth mode, feeding mode within four months of birth, family history, marital status, eating habits, sleeping habits, exercise habits, emotional state, stress situation, and living environment) and the quantitative type influencing factors (sleep time, age, and mother's age at birth) on the constitution of the two groups were analyzed. In the single-factor analysis, the Pearson's chi-square test was selected for the categorical variable, and the independent sample t test and Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test were selected for the quantitative variables according to whether they conformed to the positive-terrestrial distribution; the binary logistic stepwise regression method was selected for the multi-factor analysis.
Results
The data of 318 cases were collected from the TCM composition identification platform, and 159 cases of blood stasis constitution were used as the experimental group and 159 cases of normal constitution were used as the control group. The Pearson's chi-square test yielded significant differences (P < 0.05) in the effects of gender, pressure situation, family history, living environment, emotional state, exercise habits, and dietary habits on blood stasis constitution. The independent samples t test yielded differences in sleep duration between the blood stasis constitution and normal constitution populations (P < 0.05), which meant sleep duration of the blood stasis constitution population was less than that of the normal constitution population. The Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test results accepted the original hypothesis that there was no difference in the distribution of age and mother’s age at birth across constitution types (P > 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that gender, family history, marital status, living environment, exercise habits, and emotional state were risk factors for blood stasis constitution (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Gender, family history, living environment, emotional state, and exercise habits were significant influencing factors of blood stasis constitution. Blood stasis constitution populations can pay more attention to these influencing factors in their daily life for the prevention and reconciliation of blood stasis constitution.}

As such, GM rabbits that express human genes have been extensively used as models of cardiovascular disease. Rabbits are genetically modified via prokaryotic microinjection. Through this process, genes are randomly integrated into the rabbit genome. Moreover, gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells is a powerful tool for understanding gene function. However, rabbits lack stable ES cell lines. Therefore, ES-dependent gene targeting is not possible in rabbits. Nevertheless, the RNA interference technique is rapidly becoming a useful experimental tool that enables researchers to knock down specific gene expression, which leads to the genetic modification of rabbits. Recently, with the emergence of new genetic technology, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), major breakthroughs have been made in rabbit gene targeting. Using these novel genetic techniques, researchers have successfully modified knockout (KO) rabbit models. In this paper, we aimed to review the recent advances in GM technology in rabbits and highlight their application as models for cardiovascular medicine.}

abstract = {Background: Definitive diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma (IOL) is often challenging, at least partially due to limited accessibility to the lesion and the rarity of tumor cells, with pathologically false-negative results reportedly occurring in approximately 30% of cases. Delayed diagnosis is often an important clinical issue, and the average time to diagnosis is approximately 1.5 years.Because of delayed diagnosis, IOLs are often found only after central nervous system (CNS) invasion has occurred, possibly leading to worse treatment outcomes. In this study, we tried to overcome diagnostic difficulties by using gene panel diagnostics of IOL. Furthermore, genetic analysis of IOLs may be able to predict the risk of recurrence.in Japan, a second-generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, tirabrutinib, has been approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CNS lympoma. Herein, we present a case of IOL and CNS lesion with MYD88 mutation treated with tirabrutinib as part of precision medicine. Methods: We have developed a digital polymerase chain reaction-based system for multiplex gene panel testing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from intraocular liquid biopsies (patent number 7149000, 2022/9/30). Our system can detect specific gene mutations in minute cfDNA by amplifying specific gene loci in bubbles, even from an extremely small number of cells. Using this multiplex gene panel testing, we analyzed genetic mutations in nine regions of four genes, MYD88, CD79B, BTG2, and PIM1, using cfDNA obtained from intraocular liquid biopsies. The diagnostic performance of the novel system was evaluated in 86 samlpes of patients with IOL. We also retrospectively analyzed the prognostic potential of the genetic mutations for IOL. Lastly, in the case of CNS lymphoma and IOL, we presented the MYD88 mutation treated with tirabrutinib. Results: Among the four disease-specific genes, the MYD88 mutation was present in 55 of 86 cases (64%), and frequencies of the CD79B, BTG2, and PIM1 mutations were 47%, 38%, and 29%, respectively. At least one of these mutations was found in 83 of the 86 IOL cases examined (97%), making this assay highly sensitive (Fig. 1). The MYD88 mutation was not associated with recurrence in patients with recurrent and refractory CNS lymphoma and IOL. Conversely,patients with the CD79B mutation had high rates of relapse for CNS lymphoma: the 4-year rate of recurrence-free survival was 35%, compared to 79% in patients without the CD79B mutation (p=0.012). Patients with the BTG2 mutation also had high rates of relapse (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we present a case of CNS lynphoma and IOL. By testing IOL gene panel, only MYD88 mutation was detected in the vitreous sample of IOL patient. We have experienced this case in which the second-generation BTK inhibitor,tirabrutinib, was effective not only for central but also for intraocular lesions. Conclusion: Our panel enables rapid and accurate diagnosis of IOL with only a small sample of intraocular liquid. We believe that this multiplex gene panel testing may aid in the diagnosis of IOL in difficult-to-diagnose patients, including those with chronic uveitis, by preventing CNS invasion due to diagnostic delay. Moreover, genetic profiling panels of IOL can help to stratify clinical outcomes.CD79B and BTG2 mutation is a potent predictive marker for relapse. In the clinical setting, we experienced a case of IOL with MYD88 mutation in which tirabrutinib was effective. Potentially, tirabrutinib also penetrates directly into the eye in intraocular lesions. Oral drug, tirabrutinib as eye dripping drug, might be effective as a therapeutic option for IOL and should be assessed in future clinical trials of precision medicine for IOL.}

Overview methodology, a comparatively new technique, identifies, integrates and updates relevant evidence from multiple systematic reviews (SRs), the unit of analysis being the individual SR. Overviews can help facilitate the translational gap between research and practice. This paper aims to provide a researchers' guide to the structure of an overview by highlighting its essential elements.
Methods
A narrative literature review was conducted to identify publications on methodology used to conduct overviews of SRs and to provide a synthesis of essential guidance for researchers on the critical steps required. Additionally, examples were identified for analysis and comparison from (T&CM) overview articles published in the European Journal of Integrative Medicine (EuJIM) between 2015 and 2021.
Results
Three methodological quality assessment tools were identified and analysed and six published overviews in EuJIM evaluated. Essential elements were identified for inclusion in a T&CM overview. The three key elements highlighted as the most important were; defining a clear aim, detecting overlapping studies and choosing the most appropriate and practical methodological assessment tool. Overviews published in EuJIM demonstrated heterogeneity in the reporting of quality assessment and data synthesis, reflecting the current lack of clear guidance for conducting an overview.
Conclusion
This article provides a useful methodological guide highlighting the key items required by researchers wishing to conduct an overview of SRs in T&CM. Note, researchers should be aware that an overview needs to focus on summarizing the best quality existing evidence, but does not provide advice or recommendations on healthcare decision making.}

To assess the role of influential figures within social media (SoMe) in driving future citations.
Methods
All original articles published in the Journal of Urology and European Urology in 2018 were identified. For each article, number of mentions on any SoMe platform, article’s Twitter reach, and total citations were collected. Article characteristics such as type of study, article topic, and open access status were identified. Total academic research output was obtained for first and last authors of included articles. Influential SoMe figures were defined as users that tweeted about included articles and had over 2000 followers. For these accounts, we collected total followers, total tweets, engagement statistics, verification status, and academic characteristics such as total citations and total prior publications. The impact of SoMe, article, and academic characteristics on future citations was assessed using panel data regression analysis.
Results
We identified 394 articles with 8895 total citations and 460 SoMe influencers. On panel data regression modeling, tweets about a specific article were associated with future citations (0.17 citations per tweet about an article, P < .001). SoMe influencer characteristics were not associated with increased citations (P > .05). The following non-SoMe-associated characteristics were predictive of future citations (P < .001): study type (prospective studies received 12.9 more citations than cross-sectional studies), open access status (4.3 citations more if open access, P < .001), and previously well-published first and last authors.
Conclusion
While SoMe posts are associated with increased visibility and higher future citation rates, SoMe influencers do not appear to drive these outcomes. Instead, high quality and accessibility were more predictive of future citability.}

abstract = {Medical radiation accidents and unintended events may lead to accidental or unintended medical exposure of patients and exposure of staff or the public. Most unintended exposures in nuclear medicine will lead to a small increase in risk; nevertheless, these require investigation and a clinical and dosimetric assessment. Nuclear medicine staff are exposed to radiation emitted directly by radiopharmaceuticals and by patients after administration of radiopharmaceuticals. This is particularly relevant in PET, due to the penetrating 511 keV γ-rays. Dose constraints should be set for planning the exposure of individuals. Staff body doses of 1-25 µSv/GBq are reported for PET imaging, the largest component being from the injection. The preparation and administration of radiopharmaceuticals can lead to high doses to the hands, challenging dose limits for radionuclides such as 90Y and even 18F. The risks of contamination can be minimized by basic precautions, such as carrying out manipulations in purpose-built facilities, wearing protective clothing, especially gloves, and removing contaminated gloves or any skin contamination as quickly as possible. Airborne contamination is a potential problem when handling radioisotopes of iodine or administering radioaerosols. Manipulating radiopharmaceuticals in laminar air flow cabinets, and appropriate premises ventilation are necessary to improve safety levels. Ensuring patient safety and minimizing the risk of incidents require efficient overall quality management. Critical aspects include: the booking process, particularly if qualified medical supervision is not present; administration of radiopharmaceuticals to patients, with the risk of misadministration or extravasation; management of patients' data and images by information technology systems, considering the possibility of misalignment between patient personal data and clinical information. Prevention of possible mistakes in patient identification or in the management of patients with similar names requires particular attention. Appropriate management of pregnant or breast-feeding patients is another important aspect of radiation safety. In radiopharmacy activities, strict quality assurance should be implemented at all operational levels, in addition to adherence to national and international regulations and guidelines. This includes not only administrative aspects, like checking the request/prescription, patient's data and the details of the requested procedure, but also quantitative tests according to national/international pharmacopoeias, and measuring the dispensed activity with a calibrated activity meter prior to administration. In therapy with radionuclides, skin tissue reactions can occur following extravasation, which can result in localized doses of tens of Grays. Other relevant incidents include confusion of products for patients administered at the same time or malfunction of administration devices. Furthermore, errors in internal radiation dosimetry calculations for treatment planning may lead to under or over-treatment. According to literature, proper instructions are fundamental to keep effective dose to caregivers and family members after patient discharge below the Dose constraints. The IAEA Basic Safety Standards require measures to minimize the likelihood of any unintended or accidental medical exposures and reporting any radiation incident. The relative complexity of nuclear medicine practice presents many possibilities for errors. It is therefore important that all activities are performed according to well established procedures, and that all actions are supported by regular quality assurance/QC procedures.}

abstract = {Introduction
Women comprise nearly half of all residents in training, yet there is a significant disparity of women in academic leadership. Surgical subspecialties are dominated by men in both percentages of physicians and leadership positions. We sought to examine the association of advanced non-medical degrees with academic rank and gender in academic surgery departments.
Methods
Faculty from 126 ACGME-accredited academic medical centers were analyzed to identify faculty gender as described in online biographical information, advanced non-medical degrees, academic rank, and additional leadership positions held. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses.
Results
4536 surgeons were identified, 69.3% men, 27.3% female, and 3.3% unlisted. Female surgeons were more likely to hold advanced non-doctoral degrees than men (18.2% vs. 13.8%, p ​< ​0.002). Among those with advanced degrees, PhDs were held by 3.3% of women and 5.7% of men (p ​< ​0.001). Female surgeons were less likely to hold the rank of Professor than male surgeons (15.8% vs 30.3%, p ​< ​0.001), and more likely to hold the rank of Assistant Professor than male surgeons (51.9% vs 36.1%, p ​< ​0.001). This likelihood remained true when analyzing only surgeons with one or more advanced non-medical degrees. Men were more likely to be Chair of Surgery (3.0%), Division Chief (9.6%), and Research Chair (0.5%); compared to women (1.3%; 4.8%; 0.2%; p ​= ​0.001, <0.001, 0.21 respectively).
Conclusions
There continues to be a significant male predominance in general surgery. Gender discrepancy is also seen in professional rank and academic title despite women holding more advanced degrees. Advanced degrees are currently considered academic qualifications, but this does not reflect surgical academic leadership roles or rank.}

abstract = {Instead of diminishing with the spectacular advancement of medical expertise in the country , unqualified biomedical practice in India has been strengthened by the growth of the pharmaceutical production in the twenty first century. In public health discourse, the view that the informal health practitioners have to be punished and abolished has been countered by the recommendation that they could be trained and incorporated in primary health care where public health amenities are inadequate. The quality of care provided by the informal health care practitioners has also been subject to clinical assessment based on standardized patient vignettes. Based on a sociological approach, this paper examines the time line of chronically ill patients under lived conditions to arrive at an understanding of the role of informal health practitioners in long term treatment and highlights the setbacks.
Methods
This paper draws on 253 household surveys from two villages in Madhya Pradesh, in depth interviews with four unqualified practitioners in the area, twenty five unstructured interviews of chronic patients, twenty five structured interviews on the cases of untimely death and FGDs with health workers in 2021.
Conclusion
Informal health care practitioners offer consultation cum dispensing of medicines and are the primary source of biomedical care in the remote study area without any public transport. But they are ‘for profit’ economic actors who are ill-equipped to handle chronic diseases. What sets them aside from the qualified private doctors in the town is their social obligation to balance their profit motive with the ethics of proximity and neighborly ties with the villagers amidst whom they reside. These features of the market and community place the informal health care practitioners at the cusp of economy and society and defy simple binaries that they are either crooks or assets.}

Social networks are a means for disseminating scientific information. Alternative metrics assessing the impact of scientific publications on social networks have been created. Our study aims to assess the correlation between the activity of internal medicine journals on social networks and traditional metrics based on citations.
Methods
Internal medicine journals were identified in the SCImago-Scopus database and information on traditional impact metrics was extracted. In addition, alternative metrics of activity were determined for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. The correlation was assessed through Spearman's correlation coefficient.
Results
Of 134 Internal Medicine journals, 17 had a presence on the social networks evaluated. The SJR index was higher in journals with a presence on social networks vs. those without (59 vs. 18, p < .0001). The overall correlation between the SJR index and the number of followers/year was very strong for Facebook (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.95, p < .05) and strong for Twitter (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.54 p < .05).
Conclusions
Our study suggests that there is a very strong correlation between social network activity metrics (mainly Facebook and Twitter) compared to traditional metrics based on the number of citations of internal medicine journals.

Identify strategies to form and maintain friendtorships with peers in palliative medicine Cultivating mentoring relationships is a key component of professional development. Hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) clinicians risk burnout from the demands of emotionally intense clinical work and high expectations of scholarly productivity for many. Pressures are particularly applicable to female clinicians, individuals from underrepresented cultural groups, and those who act as primary caregivers for family members. To thrive, HPM clinicians require the support of effective mentors. However, the finite number of seasoned mentors and variability in mentor approaches and skill can make successful pairings challenging to establish. “Friendtorship,” a neologism of “friend-mentorship,” is a novel model of mentorship that may have unique benefits for HPM clinicians. Friendtors are peers with shared interests who enjoy a personal connection while also intentionally supporting each other's career development. When compared to traditional mentorship between novice and senior clinicians, friendtorships may be less hierarchical, allow for more honest and frequent dialogue, and invite more authentic discussion of personal and professional challenges. Friendtors can provide guidance on diverse topics, including clinical quandaries, professional opportunities, parenting challenges, and the vicissitudes of a partner's career. Such insights may be invaluable to HPM clinicians, as they face shifting personal and professional priorities throughout the career trajectory. In this session, a group of interdisciplinary HPM clinicians will describe how they have cultivated effective friendtorships. They will share how they innovated a friendtorship structure to nurture their professional growth and personal well-being. They will propose strategies for establishing one's own friendtor relationships, including formalizing relationships with admired peers, establishing mutual accountability and trust, and regularly checking in to discuss the impact and goals of the relationship. The group will center the mentorship needs of physician and non-physician HPM clinicians, as well as those of underrepresented backgrounds. Attendees will leave with tools to forge and maintain their own friendtorships in HPM.}

abstract = {Quality control for Chinese patent medicine (CPM) containing animal-derived crude drug(s) is rather difficult. The methods based on chemical composition analysis, which are commonly used in CPM consisted of plant-derived crude drugs, are often not applicable for CPM containing animal-derived crude drug, because the effective constituents of most animal-derived crude drugs remain unknown. Even if there are such methods, they are usually qualitative rather than quantitative, and the specificity is generally poor. Here we proposed a molecular quantification method for CPM containing animal-derived crude drug, based upon the hypothesis that the amount of remnant DNA fragments could reflect feeding quantity of the crude drugs and thus ensure the quality of the CPM. Take Jinlong capsule [a hepatocellular carcinoma-resisting Chinese patent medicine comprising of three fresh animal drugs, i.e. Shougong (Peking gecko, Gekko swinhonis), Qi She (sharp-snouted pitviper, Deinagkistrodon acutus), and Jinqian Baihua She (many-banded krait, Bungarus multicinctus)] as an example, we established a qPCR assay for Qi She in the capsule, which verified the feasibility of the quality control method based on molecular quantification. Species-specific primers and TaqMan probe for Qi She were designed, and the qPCR assay system was then established. The assay exhibited a good specificity; there’s a good linearity between Ct values and logarithm of the target amplicon copy numbers within the range of 8.8 × 101 to 8.8 × 106 copies/μL, and the limit of detection was 88 copies/μL. The method was validated through reproducibility, stability assessment. Recovery of spiked samples was between 91.59% and 101.69%. It was verified that the copy numbers reflected the original feeding amount of an animal-derived crude drug by self-made Jinlong capsules. The assay was successfully applied in Qi She-specific amplicon determination in 20 batches of Jinlong capsule. The study was expected to provide a new strategy for quality control of CPM containing animal-derived crude drug.}

Rodent dermal papilla cells have been shown to induce de novo hair follicle generation in the skin of recipients following transplantation, suggesting that dermal papilla cells can reprogram epidermal microenvironments. However, human DPCs (hDPCs) lose their ability to generate de novo hair follicles under conventional culture methods. We investigated the effects of electrical stimulation (ES) on hDPCs to restore the depressed trichogenic activity. We demonstrated that ES with a polypyrrole (PPy)-modified electrode upregulated trichogenic gene expression in hDPCs in vitro, and the activated cells when transplanted into mice generated double the number of hairs compared to that without the ES. Using specific inhibitors, we revealed that the mechanisms behind the electrical activation are associated with voltage-gated ion channels. Further, ES can be adapted for hDPCs from a patient with androgenic alopecia. Thus, this approach is potentially beneficial in preparing hDPCs for hair regenerative medicine.}

Spices, derived from plant products, contain distinct aromatic substances that enhance the flavor, taste, and overall quality of food. The rich diversity in flora, fauna, and culture in the Northeastern states of India is reflective of unique food habits. In addition to utilizing wild edible plants in their cuisine, these communities incorporate certain plant species for food preservation and flavor enhancement in traditional food preparation.
Methods
This review aims to shed light on the often-overlooked anticancer properties of locally available spice plants. The focus is on identifying bioactive compounds within these plants that contribute to their potential health benefits. The study assesses the anticancer activities of crude extracts and bio-active compounds obtained from 17 spices against various types of cancer.
Results
Among 34 bioactive compounds from spices, 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde, thymoquinone, piperine and Isoegomaketone exhibit the highest anticancer activity. The primary mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of these spices involve inducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation and metastasis, and modulating the expression of apoptotic genes, proteins, and associated pathways. Notably, specific bioactive compounds have yet to be reported for Pimpinella anisum L, Persicaria odorata (Lour) Sojak, Zanthoxylum acanthopodium DC, and Zanthoxylum armatum DC.
Conclusions
This comprehensive review contributes valuable insights for the identification and standardization of active plant-based pharmaceutical ingredients with promising anticancer potentials.}

Male infertility is a significant health concern that affects approximately 10% to 15% of couples trying to conceive. Various factors, including genetic abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, environmental factors, and lifestyle habits, can cause infertility. As a result, managing male infertility requires a comprehensive approach that involves a thorough diagnostic work-up, identification of underlying causes, and appropriate interventions to address these factors. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), American Urological Association (AUA), and European Association of Urology (EAU) are leading organizations in the field of male infertility management. These organizations have developed clinical practice guidelines to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing male infertility. In this chapter, we strive to provide an overview of the guidelines developed by ASRM, AUA, and EAU for managing male infertility. We also discuss the diagnostic work-up, evaluation of semen parameters, and treatment options, including medical and surgical interventions. Additionally, we will review the role of assisted reproductive technologies in managing male infertility. By following these guidelines, healthcare professionals can provide optimal care for their patients with male infertility, resulting in improved outcomes and higher success rates for assisted reproductive technologies.}

abstract = {Purpose
The goal of regenerative medicine is to replace or restore missing, dysfunctional, or damaged cells, tissues and organs of a person to reproduce their normal function. The main approaches are cell therapy, tissue engineering, and gene therapy. Postnatal neural crest-derived multipotent stem cells (NC-MSC) are a promising cell type for use in regenerative medicine. This is due to the specific features of their embryonic origin and the role of the neural crest in phylogeny and ontogeny of vertebrates.
Methods
The study used research in vitro culture (monolayer cell culture, 3D culture based on hydrogels, organotypic culture of hippocampal slices, spherogenesis, directed differentiation); flow cytometry; cytochemical, immune-cytochemical and histomorphometric analysis; molecular genetic (RNA (ribonucleic acid) isolation, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with reverse transcription, real-time PCR, nucleic acid electrophoresis); microscopy (transmitted light, phase contrast, fluorescent, confocal laser scanning); microsurgical; statistical analysis.
Results
In this systematic review, the results showed that recently the neural crest-derived cells have been isolated from a wide range of tissues and organs of mammals at the postnatal stage of development. These cells, at least in vitro, demonstrate the ability to self-repair and multilinear differentiation into neurons, Schwann cells, melanocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and other types of cells, that is, according to their functional characteristics, they are multipotent stem cells.
Conclusion
According to the obtained results, tissue sources of postnatal neural crest-derived multipotent stem cells differ considerably in the degree of invasiveness of biopsy sampling, as well as the possibility of obtaining a homogeneous population of NC-MSCs, which is important for further clinical use.}

We propose a method, network pharmacology combined with two iterations of PageRank algorithm, to make use of these information. It takes prescription-disease system as a whole, calculates PageRank score of targets in the prescription-disease system, which means an importance in the system, and the score is used to rank the analysis results of GO and KEGG pathway which help us to analyze the mechanism of a prescription on a disease.

Presently, there are around 17,001 practitioners in Thai Traditional medicine; 23,409 practitioners in Thai traditional pharmacy; 5735 practitioners in Thai traditional midwifery; 332 practitioners in Thai massage and 660 practitioners in Applied Thai traditional medicine. Moreover, 74 herbal remedies are implemented in the National List of Essential Medicines 2018 and divided into two categories: (1) Thai Traditional Remedy and (2) Herbal Product. Therefore, the development of medicinal plants for use in primary health care is needed to be concerned. In 2018, Thai Herbal Pharmacopoeia was established providing 80 monographs on herbal drugs and herbal drug preparations. Thai Traditional medicine is gaining popularity and has become a part of the National Health Development Plan. The Ministry of Public Health has taken important steps toward the development, promotion, and protection of traditional medicine in Thailand.}

abstract = {Objective
To develop new diagnostic criteria for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) that are appropriate for use across the lifespan and in sports, civilian trauma, and military settings.
Design
Rapid evidence reviews on 12 clinical questions and Delphi method for expert consensus.
Participants
The Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Task Force of the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine Brain Injury Special Interest Group convened a Working Group of 17 members and an external interdisciplinary expert panel of 32 clinician-scientists. Public stakeholder feedback was analyzed from 68 individuals and 23 organizations.
Results
The first 2 Delphi votes asked the expert panel to rate their agreement with both the diagnostic criteria for mild TBI and the supporting evidence statements. In the first round, 10 of 12 evidence statements reached consensus agreement. Revised evidence statements underwent a second round of expert panel voting, where consensus was achieved for all. For the diagnostic criteria, the final agreement rate, after the third vote, was 90.7%. Public stakeholder feedback was incorporated into the diagnostic criteria revision prior to the third expert panel vote. A terminology question was added to the third round of Delphi voting, where 30 of 32 (93.8%) expert panel members agreed that ‘the diagnostic label ‘concussion’ may be used interchangeably with ‘mild TBI’ when neuroimaging is normal or not clinically indicated.’
Conclusions
New diagnostic criteria for mild TBI were developed through an evidence review and expert consensus process. Having unified diagnostic criteria for mild TBI can improve the quality and consistency of mild TBI research and clinical care.}

Reproducibility of artificial intelligence (AI) research has become a growing concern. One of the fundamental reasons is the lack of transparency in data, code, and model. In this work, we aimed to systematically review the radiology and nuclear medicine papers on AI in terms of transparency and open science.
Materials and Methods
A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed to identify original research studies on AI. The search was restricted to studies published in Q1 and Q2 journals that are also indexed on the Web of Science. A random sampling of the literature was performed. Besides six baseline study characteristics, a total of five availability items were evaluated. Two groups of independent readers including eight readers participated in the study. Inter-rater agreement was analyzed. Disagreements were resolved with consensus.
Results
Following eligibility criteria, we included a final set of 194 papers. The raw data was available in about one-fifth of the papers (34/194; 18%). However, the authors made their private data available only in one paper (1/161; 1%). About one-tenth of the papers made their pre-modeling (25/194; 13%), modeling (28/194; 14%), or post-modeling files (15/194; 8%) available. Most of the papers (189/194; 97%) did not attempt to create a ready-to-use system for real-world usage. Data origin, use of deep learning, and external validation had statistically significantly different distributions. The use of private data alone was negatively associated with the availability of at least one item (p<0.001).
Conclusion
Overall rates of availability for items were poor, leaving room for substantial improvement.}

keywords = {Public Health, Cosmetic Surgery, MHRA, Complications, Adverse Events},
abstract = {Summary
Background
Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) injection is one of the most frequently undertaken procedures in aesthetic medicine. The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the government body in the United Kingdom (UK) mandated to ensure that the provision and administration of medicines is safe. We analyzed adverse events of facial cosmetic BoNT-A injections reported to the MHRA and assessed whether the incidence of reported adverse events in this government registry is comparable to published retrospective and prospective studies.
Methods
A freedom of information (FOI) request was submitted to the MHRA to obtain recorded complications of BoNT- A. Complications reported to the MHRA between 1991 and 2020 were analyzed. Only cases with BoNT-A where the indication was specified as for facial cosmetics were included in the analysis. Additionally, the literature was reviewed on adverse events of facial cosmetic BoNT- A injections, and a statistical meta-analysis of complication rates was carried out.
Results
A total of 188 adverse events of aesthetic BoNT-A injections were reported to the MHRA. The literature search resulted in 30 studies and a total of 17,352 injection sessions, where the complication rate was 16% (95% CI = 8% to 25%). Frequent adverse events included localized skin reactions such as bruising with an incidence of 5% (95% CI = 3% to 7%), headache in 3% (95% CI = from 1% to 5% ), and facial paresis in 2% (95% CI = 1% to 3%) of injection sessions.
Conclusions
This is the first paper to obtain and evaluate data on adverse events of BoNT-A from the MHRA. An estimate of the likely complication rate of aesthetic BoNT-A in the UK, according to the MHRA database, is significantly lower than the rate recorded from our meta-analysis of the international literature. This suggests that the MHRA may be underestimating the adverse events of aesthetic BoNT-A treatment, which would have implications for patient safety and informed consent. Therefore, legislative changes may be required to ensure more robust reporting of aesthetic BoNT-A in the UK.}

Moreover, exposure behavior of complex components in vivo is a necessary way to elucidate active substances in TCMs. However, the effective discovery of active ingredients from MF in vivo is still a challenge for researchers. In this study, an integrated strategy with chemical characterization, in vivo metabolism, chemical isolation, and activity evaluation was established and applied in targeted discovery of potential lipid-lowering substances in MF. First, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was established to characterize various chemical components in MF extract. Second, with the automatic matching (in-house database), discriminant ions analysis and metabolite software prediction, the metabolic profiling of different types of MF was elucidated in vivo. And the compounds from MF with high MS response in vivo were discovered. Third, according to LC-MS information of fractions, these compounds were isolated and identified by NMR. Finally, the isolated compounds were evaluated for the lipid-lowering activity on determination of triglyceride levels in high fructose-induced HepG2 cells at different concentrations. And PCSK9 inhibitory and LDL-R promoting activity were measured by western blot experiment. As a result, a total of 72 constituents were characterized in MF. After oral administration of MF extract, 16 prototypes and 33 metabolites were rapidly screened out. And the metabolism features of alkaloids, flavonols and organic acids were further revealed. Six alkaloids (morusimic acid A-D, G, F), with high MS response in vivo and no reference standards on the market, were isolated guided by LC-MS and identified by NMR. Among them, morusimic acid A, B, G and F could reduce triglyceride levels in fructose-induced HepG2 cells. Moreover, with western blot experiment, morusimic acid A, B, G and F could inhibit the expression of PCSK9 protein. And morusimic acid A, B and F could increase the expression of LDL-R protein. This work provides meaningful information for the discovery of potential compounds in MF for the treatment of obesity and hyperlipidemia, along with a new approach for exploring effective compounds from complex systems.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), as a significant part of the global pharmaceutical science, the abundant molecular compounds it contains is a valuable potential source of designing and screening new drugs. However, due to the un-estimated quantity of the natural molecular compounds and diversity of the related problems drug discovery such as precise screening of molecular compounds or the evaluation of efficacy, physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics, it is arduous for researchers to design or screen applicable compounds through old methods. With the rapid development of computer technology recently, especially artificial intelligence (AI), its innovation in the field of virtual screening contributes to an increasing efficiency and accuracy in the process of discovering new drugs.
Purpose
This study systematically reviewed the application of computational approaches and artificial intelligence in drug virtual filtering and devising of TCM and presented the potential perspective of computer-aided TCM development.
Study design
We made a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Then screening the most typical articles for our research.
Methods
The systematic review was performed by following the PRISMA guidelines. The databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI were used to search for publications that focused on computer-aided drug virtual screening and design in TCM.
Result
Totally, 42 corresponding articles were included in literature reviewing. Aforementioned studies were of great significance to the treatment and cost control of many challenging diseases such as COVID-19, diabetes, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), etc. Computational approaches and AI were widely used in virtual screening in the process of TCM advancing, which include structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) and ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS). Besides, computational technologies were also extensively applied in absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) prediction of candidate drugs and new drug design in crucial course of drug discovery.
Conclusions
The applications of computer and AI play an important role in the drug virtual screening and design in the field of TCM, with huge application prospects.}

In this paper, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor with sample preparation apparatus for headspace adsorption of SO2 has been developed, which was successfully applied to detect illegal adulteration of sulfur dioxide in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Functional membrane substrate of Si@Ag@PEI composite was synthesized to enhance the adsorption and Raman signal of SO2. A 3D-printed headspace extraction device was designed to adsorbed SO2 by Si@Ag@PEI membrane after micro-extraction of TCM samples in 15 min. The content of sulfur dioxide was subsequently quantitatively measured by SERS sensor. The linear range of sensor is between 2.5 and 250 mg/kg with limit of detection of 0.25 mg/kg, which is lower than the strictest standard of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (10 mg/kg). The proposed approach was used to detect the SO2 residue in TCMs including ginseng, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and bitter almonds. The fabricated sensor exhibited satisfied sensitivity and stability, which provide a simple approach for on-site detection of illegal adulteration of sulfur dioxide.}

There is a need for evidence-based guidance on complementary medicines and therapies (CMT) use during pregnancy due to high prevalence of use and lack of guidance on the balance of benefit and harms.
Aim
Evaluate the extent to which current clinical practice guidelines relevant to Australian healthcare professionals make clear and unambiguous recommendations about CMT use in pregnancy, and synthesise these recommendations.
Methods
The search included EMBASE, PubMed, the National Health and Medical Research Council’s Clinical Practice Guidelines Portal, and websites of Australian maternity hospitals and professional/not-for-profit organisations for published guidelines on pregnancy care. Data were synthesised narratively. Guidelines were appraised by two independent reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument.
Findings
A total of 48 guidelines were found, of which 41% provided recommendations that were not limited to routine vitamin and mineral supplementation. There were wide variations in recommendations, particularly for vitamin D and calcium. There was some consensus on recommending ginger and vitamin B6 for nausea and vomiting, and additional supplementation for women with obesity. Guidelines generally scored poorly in the domains of editorial independence and rigour of development.
Discussion
There is a lack of guidance with regard to appropriate CMT use during pregnancy, which may result in less-than-optimal care. Inconsistency between guidelines may lead to variations in care.
Conclusion
Guidelines should include clear and unambiguous guidance on appropriate CMT use during pregnancy, be based on a structured search of the evidence and informed by stakeholder engagement.}
