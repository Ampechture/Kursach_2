Phytochemical investigation on the fruits of Cydonia oblonga Mill., a traditional Uighur medicine, led to the isolation of seven undescribed and nine known megastigmane glycosides. Their structures including absolute configurations were characterized by an extensive analysis of spectroscopic data including HRESIMS and NMR, combined with ECD calculations. Additionally, compounds 1, 2, 4, and 6‒16 exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the secretion of cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) with inhibitory rates of 10.79%‒44.58% at 20 μM.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chronic insomnia in adults affects the health and quality of life of patients. Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) combined with benzodiazepines/non-benzodiazepines (BZDs/N-BZDs) are used frequently in routine clinical practice. However, evidence on the efficacy and safety of these combined interventions is lacking. A multiple treatment meta-analysis (MTMA) was conducted to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of 16 CPMs combined with BZDs/N-BZDs for the treatment of chronic insomnia in adults.
Methodology
We systematically reviewed 171 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 16,874 participants (8506 in intervention groups and 8368 in control groups) from the inception of several databases to 2023. This review encompassed electronic databases, regulatory-agency websites, and international registers of published trials involving adult patients with chronic insomnia who received CPM + BZDs/N-BZDs therapies. A random-effects MTMA was undertaken using Stata/MP17, RevMan (5.3), and R. Outcome measures were the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), overall efficacy rate, as well as the incidence of dry mouth, dizziness, and somnolence.
Results
Our MTMA showed that BZD/N-BZD therapy as a co-intervention for Tianmengjiaonang (TMJN) was likely to be the optimal option for improving the PSQI (surface under the cumulative sorting curve (SUCRA) = 95.00 %), whereas shensongyangxinjiaonang (SSYXJN) had the highest probability of improving overall effectiveness (SUCRA = 88.20 %). Jiaotaiwan (JTW), Bailemian (BLMJN), and Wulinjiaonang (WLJN) had the highest probability of reducing the incidence of somnolence (SUCRA = 90.00 %), dry mouth (SUCRA = 72.90 %), and dizziness (SUCRA = 84.40 %).
Conclusions
All CPMs in combination with BZDs/N-BZDs were more efficacious and safer than using BZDs/N-BZDs alone in adults with chronic insomnia. SSYXJN + BZDs/N-BZDs and TMJN + BZDs/N-BZDs are likely to be optimal CPMs because they improve overall efficacy and sleep quality and reduce the risk of adverse effects. However, the effects of these interventions may vary from person to person. Hence, patients, carers, and clinicians should carefully consider the efficacy, safety, and risk–benefit profile of all active interventions for patients with insomnia based on real-world data.}

Environmental, social, and financial sustainability are directly influenced by the specifics of how pharmaceutical waste should be disposed of or recycled. Hence, this study provides a comprehensive approach that employs text mining with the inclusion of 894 participants for preliminary research to extract consumer-centric waste medicine awareness criteria, and proposes a Fermatean Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (F-FCM) approach to examine the relationships among the concepts to identify the most important ones, and compares F-FCM with the classical FCM to demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved approach. The findings of the example from Turkey reveal that waste medicine management applications prioritize (1) establishing a trusted system for collecting and recycling medicine, (2) ensuring the reliability of business models, and (3) increasing societal awareness. The F-FCM ranking differs slightly from the classical FCM ranking when uncertainty is introduced. The present study contributes to the literature by proposing a novel approach and utilizing text mining as a data-extracting tool. A practitioner can also understand the perspectives of real consumers, identify long-term plans, and comprehend the requirements of a service network with several stakeholders.}

abstract = {Background
Palmoplantar warts (PWs) are a usual skin disease associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) that can affect patients’ quality of life. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Weiren Xiaoyou formula (WRXYF) is a relatively gentle and effective therapy that has achieved good therapeutic effects in clinical practice, but its mechanism has not yet been studied.
Methods
A meta-analysis was carried out to identify the potential advantages of topical TCM for PW treatment. Clinical cases suggested that WRXYF was an effective therapeutic agent against PWs. Network pharmacology was utilized to predict potential targets for the main bioactive compound, tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), in WRXYF. High-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) was applied to detect major components. The bioactivity of Tan IIA against PWs was then validated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), electron microscopy and Western blotting.
Results
A meta-analysis was conducted on 10 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 2260 participants suggested that topical TCM could more effectively treat PWs than conventional medications. Network pharmacology identified Tan IIA as a candidate agent from 17 major compounds assessed by HPLC/ESI-MS because of its stable binding with 10 PW targets. HPV2, HPV27, and HPV57 were the main infectious strains in tissues obtained from PW patients and in HPV-infected HaCaT cells. Tan IIA treatment effectively destroyed viral particles and reduced the viral copy numbers of the three HPV subtypes. The results shown that Tan IIA has the ability to halt the cell cycle of HPV-infected HaCaT cells specifically in the G0/G1 phase. A total of 6 cell cycle-related proteins were regulated after Tan IIA treatment, demonstrating the role of Tan IIA in inhibiting the cell cycle.
Conclusion
The TCM prescription WRXYF is an effective treatment against PWs. Tan IIA is the primary bioactive constituent in WRXYF, which is shown to alleviate PWs significantly by halting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase via the modulation of the p53 signalling pathyway.}

The pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases is associated with a myriad of genetic defects, epigenetic alterations (DNA methylation, histone/chromatin remodeling, miRNA dysregulation), and environmental factors. The emergence of new sequencing technologies and tools to study the epigenome has led to identifying predictive biomarkers for earlier diagnosis, opening up the possibility of prophylactical interventions. As a result, advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacoepigenomics now allow for personalized treatments based on the profile of each patient and the specific genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved. This Review highlights the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases and the variability in patient responses to pharmacotherapy, emphasizing the influence of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs used to treat those conditions. We specifically discuss the potential modulatory effect of several genetic polymorphisms associated with an increased risk of developing different neurodegenerative diseases. We explore genetic and genomic technologies and the potential of analyzing individual-specific drug metabolism to predict and influence drug response and associated clinical outcomes. We also provide insights into the mechanism of action of the drugs under investigation and their potential impact on disease-modifying pathways.

A wide range of infectious challenges can induce sepsis, resulting in an even wider range of maladaptive immune responses. This makes sepsis a syndromic diagnosis without a unifying, underlying molecular mechanism. The next step toward personalized medicine for sepsis is to resolve the heterogeneity across the universe of septic patients in order to establish pathobiologically homogenous sepsis “endotypes” that have uniformly defined changes in physiology and immunology. Defining the mechanisms of immune dysfunction within these endotypes will provide a roadmap for the application of immunomodulatory therapies for sepsis. This approach can drive in a paradigm shift in sepsis treatment, moving beyond supportive care and toward active efforts to restore normal immune function.}

Methodologies were systematically reviewed and analyzed concerning evidence-based TCM guidelines worldwide. A survey questionnaire was developed based on the literature review and open-end expert interviews. Then, we performed expert consensus, discussion meeting, opinion collection, external examination, and the GRADE-TCM was formed eventually.
Results
265 Chinese and English TCM guidelines were included and analyzed. Five experts completed the open-end interviews. Ten methodological entries were summarized, screened and selected. One round of consensus was conducted, including a total of 22 experts and 220 valid questionnaire entries, concerning 1) selection of the GRADE, 2) GRADE-TCM upgrading criteria, 3) GRADE-TCM evaluation standard, 4) principles of consensus and recommendation, and 5) presentation of the GRADE-TCM and recommendation. Finally, consensus was reached on the above 10 entries, and the results were of high importance (with voting percentages ranging from 50 % to 81.82 % for “very important” rating) and strong reliability (with the Cr ranging from 0.93 to 0.99). Expert discussion meeting (with 40 experts), opinion collection (in two online platforms) and external examination (with 14 third-party experts) were conducted, and the GRADE-TCM was established eventually.
Conclusion
GRADE-TCM provides a new extended evidence-based evaluation standard for TCM guidelines. In GRADE-TCM, international evidence-based norms, characteristics of TCM intervention, and inheritance of TCM culture were combined organically and followed. This is helpful for localization of the GRADE in TCM and internationalization of TCM guidelines.}

We collected 544 questions and quantitatively analysed and grouped them according to the Standardised Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine–Core Outcomes Measures in Perioperative and Anaesthetic Care (StEP–COMPAC) endpoints. Using multicriteria decision-making software, workshops combining the population will be conducted to determine the top 10 priorities for perioperative medicine research for the Australian population.
Ethics and dissemination
Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Alfred Health (Australia) Human Research Ethics Committee (ID: 171/19). The findings will be disseminated in peer review publications, conferences, and dissemination across perioperative research networks. The top 10 priorities will be available to inform research funders, grant submissions, guidelines, and the population.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which have potent clinical therapeutic efficacy, are commonly used in treating various diseases in China. The TCM include not only the single bioactive molecules like tanshinone, salvianolic acid and curcumin, but also those Chinese herbal formulas. In the past decades, the researchers keep working on the scientific basis of these herbs. Clearly, TCM herbs hit diverse biological targets associated with multiple diseases. Growth factors including VEGFs, FGFs, PDGFs are a class of biological targets in human bodies, which play vital roles in many physiological processes. A number of studies demonstrated either inhibiting or enhancing effects of the TCM on growth factors-triggered biological activities.
Objective
Herein, we review the effects of TCM on growth factors, attempting to explore the roles of TCM in regulating the functions of growth factors.
Methods
To review the effects of TCM on growth factors, we focused on studies involved in the therapeutic use and pharmacological activity of TCM and performed a comprehensive search of several scientific databases using various relevant keywords. Some inclusion and exclusion criteria were strictly followed to obtain the most relevant articles.
Results
This review screened 289 papers, of which 93 provided in-depth analyses of TCM and growth factors, focusing on the effects of TCM targeting growth factors on inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, tumor growth, and liver fibrosis. In addition, development of dressings or patches combining TCM and growth factors to enhance the activity of growth factors in clinic usage is also discussed.
Conclusions
These findings indicate that various TCM extracts, including polysaccharides, and TCM formulations play potentially beneficial roles, through effects on the growth factors in the treatment of a range of diseases and can be used to treat inflammation and other diseases.}

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a recurrent and chronic inflammatory disorder that impacts the gastrointestinal tract. It is distinguished by a multiple etiology, including various complicated factors. The global prevalence of IBD has increased in recent years, leading to a need for novel strategies in its management. This has sparked interest in exploring alternative medicines, such as herbal medicine, for the treatment of IBD. In this context, Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM), which has a strong foundation in traditional practices, has garnered attention as a potentially successful exploration route owing to its diverse medicinal characteristics.
Methodology
Different keywords, including IBD, CHM and Gut microbiota, were employed in searches across online databases like Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Duplicate references, inappropriate articles, and incomplete data were debarred which lies outside the scope of this artcle.
Results
Although conventional treatments have demonstrated efficacy in certain patients, they frequently entail undesirable side effects and inherent constraints. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing research literature about the effectiveness of several Chinese herbal formulations in reducing the symptoms associated with IBD and influencing the composition of the gut microbiota. Significant importance is attributed to comprehending the deep interrelationship between host-microbiota interactions and the intricate microbial populations that inhabit the gastrointestinal system.
Discussion
The discussion delves into a comprehensive exploration of Chinese Herbal Medicine as a potential treatment option for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. This comprehensive review examines the diverse facets of complementary and alternative medicine in the management of IBD, encompassing its historical background, fundamental principles, the scientific rationale behind its effectiveness, and its practical implementation in clinical settings.}

Cataract is the most common cause of blindness worldwide, a visual disorder caused by a clouded lens that seriously affects People's Daily lives. Age-related cataract (ARC) is the most common type of cataract due to long-term combined effects of many factors, and its pathogenesis is varied. At present, the surgery is the main treatment for cataracts, but it is still limited to the prevention, treatment of early cataracts and the postoperative complications care. While, its drug treatments are still in the stage of exploration and research. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a unique resource in China, is conceived under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine theory and has little toxicity and side effects, but it has made great progress in the treatment and prevention of ARC.
Aim of this review
This review presents an overview of the pathogenesis of ARC in both traditional and modern medicines and summarizes the history and therapeutic effect of TCM on ARC including their formula, crude drugs and active components, and also the other auxiliary methods.
Methods
A number of recognized databases like SciFinder, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were extensively explored by using keywords and phrases such as “cataract”, “age-related cataract”, “traditional medicine”, “ethnopharmacology”, “herbs”, “medicinal plants”, or other relevant terms, and the plants/phytoconstituents that are evaluated in the models of age-related cataract. As well as the current TCM adjuvant therapy used in the clinical treatment were summarized.
Results
TCM revealed to plays an active role in treating age-related cataract, via multi-pathway and multi-target, and can treat or delay ARC by inhibiting abnormal glucose metabolism, antioxidant damage, inhibiting LEC apoptosis, and so on, which is in concordance with the good effects of the global use of TCM in clinical application. Concerning the early prevention and treatment of cataract and postoperative complications, TCM and auxiliary methods remain to achieve better clinical effects.
Conclusion
ARC belongs to the category of "Yuan Yi Nei Zhang" in TCM theory, showing that there are many causes of ARC including aging, and kidney-yang, spleen, sperm and blood deficiencies. At the same time, the viscera gradually decline, as well as yin or yang progressively become weak, especially in the elder people. So, TCM could be mainly based on liver, kidney, and spleen syndrome differentiation, personalizing diagnosis and treatment, following multiple targets, regulating fundamentally yin and yang, and thus justifying the advantages of Chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of ARC.}

Currently, it is the standard treatment for patients with GLUT1 deficiency and the latest NICE guidelines highlight ketogenic diet as a therapeutic option for multi-drug resistant epilepsy patients. Ketogenic diet is presumed to be a precision medicine tool when applied to the treatment of seizures secondary to GLUT1 transporter deficiency. In contrast, the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms modulated by ketogenic diet and underlying its efficacy in other epilepsy types can only be hypothesized to relate to mechanisms of neuroprotection, neuromodulation, and reduction of neuroinflammation. Early ketogenic diet initiation in well-selected patients, would allow immediate action in the direction of neuroprotection and modulation of neuroinflammation, ensuring higher success rates and lower “cost” to the patient in terms of quality of life and comorbidities. These considerations have fueled an increasing interest in investigating the efficacy, side effects, and adherence to long-term use of the ketogenic diet in epilepsy treatment in large contemporary cohorts, available within the scope of multicentric collaborations, such as the European Network for Therapy in Rare Epilepsies (NETRE). Future directions should involve the use of precision medicine, applied to each patient with the help of “omics”, whose use should be expanded and inclusive.}

abstract = {Introduction
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) declines with aging and is associated with age-related diseases. The decline in CRF among older adults has not been reported in China. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) believes that CRF is related to Qi and blood status, but there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Therefore, the purpose of our study was 1) to observe the decline in CRF in Chinese older adults, and 2) to investigate the association between CRF and TCM Qi and blood status.
Methods
Eligible older adults underwent the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Qi and Blood Status Questionnaire (QBSQ) assessment. Data encompassed general information, demographic and anthropometric details, underlying medical conditions, and results of the 6MWT and QBSQ. Data were analyzed for normal and abnormal 6MWD cohorts, and the correlation between 6MWD and QBSQ scores was explored.
Results
Among the 277 participants included, 77 individuals walked a distance of ≤450 m. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) for the normal-6MWD group was 472 (16) m and 420 (50) m for the abnormal-6MWD group. Comparative analysis between groups revealed disparities in age, sex, height, weight, BMI, education level, and the prevalence of chronic diseases such as hypertension, type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), and hyperlipidemia (P < 0.05). Moreover, a significant negative linear correlation was observed between 6MWD and the QBSQ scores (P < 0.01). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated the potential diagnostic value of QBSQ scores in identifying abnormal 6MWD. The combined model exhibited optimal validity, evidenced by an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95 % confidence interval: 0.768–0.879), a sensitivity of 0.87, a specificity of 0.71, and a cut-off total score value of 45.
Conclusion
The initial findings suggest a considerable percentage of Chinese older adults, including those with chronic diseases, exhibited abnormal 6MWD. We observed negative linear correlations between 6MWD and QBSQ scores, indicating that CRF is related to TCM Qi and blood status. However, future multi-center studies with lager sample sizes are still needed.}

The literature about individuals' preferences for and perceptions of the different routes of administration is sparse, but indicates a potential influence of culture. Our aim was to determine: (i) any association between one's culture and one's preferred route of medicine administration and (ii) individual perceptions of pain, efficacy, speed of action and acceptability when medicines are swallowed or placed in the mouth, under the tongue, in the nose, eye, ear, lungs, rectum, vagina, on the skin, or areinjected. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey of adults was conducted in 21 countries and regions of the world, namely, Tunisia, Ghana, Nigeria, Turkey, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Malta, Brazil, Great Britain, United States, India, Serbia, Romania, Portugal, France, Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, mainland China and Estonia, using the Inglehart–Welzel cultural map to ensure coverage across all cultures. Participants scored the pain/discomfort, efficacy, speed of onset and acceptability of the different routes of medicine administration and stated their preferred route. Demographic information was collected. A total of 4435 participants took part in the survey. Overall, the oral route was the most preferred route, followed by injection, while the rectal route was the least preferred. While the oral route was the most preferred in all cultures, the percentage of participants selecting this route varied, from 98% in Protestant Europe to 50% in the African-Islamic culture. A multinomial logistic regression model revealed a number of predictors for the preferred route. Injections were favoured in the Baltic, South Asia, Latin America and African-Islamic cultures while dermal administration was favoured in Catholic Europe, Baltic and Latin America cultures. A marked association was found between culture and the preference for, and perceptions of the different routes by which medicines are taken. This applied to even the least favoured routes (vaginal and rectal). Only women were asked about the vaginal route, and our data shows that the vaginal route was slightly more popular than the rectal one.}

Introduction
The gynecological symptoms treated with Chinese herbal medicines containing phytoestrogen are similar to fibroid-related symptoms. The objective of this study is to estimate the risk of herbs and formulas in relation to surgeries of the uterine.
Methods
A case-control study with propensity score matching was conducted to estimate the risk of uterine surgeries among women with fibroids. In all, 34 435 women with fibroids (over 20 years of age) were recruited from a nationwide 1-million-person representative sample of those covered by National Health Insurance in Taiwan and were followed from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012. The age-specific hazard ratios of subsequent fibroid-related surgeries in connection with either phytoestrogens or herbs having estrogen activity were calculated with multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression.
Results
Nearly 67% of the women with uterine fibroid eventually used traditional Chinese medicine. The adjusted hazard ratios for subsequent fibroid-related surgery were 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26–0.32), 0.30 (95% CI: 0.27–0.32), and 0.30 (95% CI: 0.28–0.32) in women consuming phytoestrogen, Panax ginseng, and Angelica Sinensis, respectively. Phytoestrogen, Panax ginseng, and Angelica sinensis appear to decrease the risk of subsequent fibroid-related surgeries.
Conclusions
Although the mechanism of action of phytoestrogen, Panax ginseng, and Angelica sinensis is uncertain, their use in accordance to traditional Chinese medicine theory as a pre-emptive agent for subsequent fibroid-related surgeries might be taken into account.}

Occupational risk for burnout in nuclear medicine technologists globally, and particularly during disaster demands on the profession, is poorly researched. This idiographic study explored the lived experience of nuclear medicine technologists during COVID-19 in a regional city in Australia.
Methods
Data was collected from five participants using semi-structured interviews and transcribed and analysed according to the protocols of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).
Results
Four group experiential themes were identified: Systemic Contraindications, Professional Strengths and Limitations, Pragmatic Growth, and Covid Rollercoaster. For these participants a dichotomous health care system, impacted by COVID-19, risked career longevity and burnout. Through empathic connection with vulnerable patients, they redefined their priorities, re-engaged in supportive connections with colleagues, and sought new pathways.
Conclusion
Multiple workplace stressors compounded by COVID-19, risked mental wellbeing, in these participants. Nevertheless, these challenges provided opportunities for reflection around career trajectory and longevity precipitating personal growth, job satisfaction and work-life balance.
Implications for practice
This study provided a lens on the risk factors inherent for nuclear medicine technologists in Australia, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Current, and disaster protective practices, to ensure wellbeing and prevent burnout risk are recommended for future research.}

abstract = {Background
Horizon scanning (HS) is the systematic identification of emerging therapies to inform policy and decision-makers. We developed an agile and tailored HS methodology that combined multi-criteria decision analysis weighting and Delphi rounds. As secondary objectives, we aimed to identify new medicines in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer most likely to impact the Australian government’s pharmaceutical budget by 2025 and to compare clinician and consumer priorities in cancer medicine reimbursement.
Method
Three cancer-specific clinician panels (total n = 27) and a consumer panel (n = 7) were formed. Six prioritisation criteria were developed with consumer input. Criteria weightings were elicited using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Candidate medicines were identified and filtered from a primary database and validated against secondary and tertiary sources. Clinician panels participated in a three-round Delphi survey to identify and score the top five medicines in each cancer type.
Results
The AHP and Delphi process was completed in eight weeks. Prioritisation criteria focused on toxicity, quality of life (QoL), cost savings, strength of evidence, survival, and unmet need. In both curative and non-curative settings, consumers prioritised toxicity and QoL over survival gains, whereas clinicians prioritised survival. HS results project the ongoing prevalence of high-cost medicines. Since completion in October 2021, the HS has identified 70 % of relevant medicines submitted for Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee assessment and 60% of the medicines that received a positive recommendation.
Conclusion
Tested in the Australian context, our method appears to be an efficient and flexible approach to HS that can be tailored to address specific disease types by using elicited weights to prioritise according to incremental value from both a consumer and clinical perspective.
Policy summary
Since HS is of global interest, our example provides a reproducible blueprint for adaptation to other healthcare settings that integrates consumer input and priorities.}

Similarly, the samples analyzed were rich in some of the essential minerals such as sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) which are necessary for the proper functioning of the body. The hazard quotient (HQ) values were measured for toxic heavy metals to determine their safe ranges for human body. The HQ values were above the permissible range for arsenic (As) in all detected samples while for cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), the values ware above in 50 % of the analyzed samples. The detection of toxic metals and their HQ values beyond the permissible limits in different dosage forms raised questions about their quality. This study suggests that evaluation of traditional herbal remedies for the metals contents and their standardization are strongly recommended for quality assurance and protection of public health.}

Each year, approximately 58,000 hospitalizations in the United States are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus. Infants aged ≤6 months experience the most severe morbidity and mortality. Until recently, prevention with the monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, was only offered to infants with high-risk conditions, and treatment primarily consisted of supportive care. Currently, 2 products are approved for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in infants. These include the Pfizer bivalent recombinant respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein subunit vaccine, administered seasonally to the pregnant person between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, and the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, administered to infants aged up to 8 months entering their first respiratory syncytial virus season. With few exceptions, administering both the vaccine to the pregnant person and the monoclonal antibody to the infant is not recommended. All infants should be protected against respiratory syncytial virus using one of these strategies. Key considerations for pregnant individuals include examining available safety and efficacy data, weighing accessibility and availability, and patient preferences for maternal vaccination vs infant monoclonal antibody treatment. It will be critical for maternal–fetal medicine physicians to provide effective and balanced counseling to aid patients in deciding on a personalized approach to the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in their infants.}

Nevertheless, the frequent identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) with the use of genome-scale next-generation sequencing has created a bottleneck in the return of results to patients. This review highlights the importance of incorporating functional genomics into the PSGT framework as a proposed initiative. Here, we explore various model systems and experimental methods available for conducting functional studies in South Africa to enhance both variant classification and clinical interpretation. We emphasize the distinct advantages of using in vitro, in vivo, and translational ex vivo models to improve the effectiveness of precision oncology. Moreover, we highlight the relevance of methodologies such as protein modelling and structural bioinformatics, multi-omics, metabolic activity assays, flow cytometry, cell migration and invasion assays, tube-formation assays, multiplex assays of variant effect, and database mining and machine learning models. The selection of the appropriate experimental approach largely depends on the molecular mechanism of the gene under investigation and the predicted functional effect of the VUS. However, before making final decisions regarding the pathogenicity of VUSs, it is essential to assess the functional evidence and clinical outcomes under current variant interpretation guidelines. The inclusion of a functional genomics infrastructure within the PSGT framework will significantly advance the reclassification of VUSs and enhance the precision medicine pipeline for patients with breast carcinomas in South Africa.}

A lack of consistency in how these terms are defined remains a challenge for researchers, clinicians, and national and international organizations (e.g., World Health Organization, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health) alike. In the present article, we provide a brief history of the use of these terminologies, and then outline the process we took to develop and create an operational definition of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine. Our operational definition is the first to be informed by a systematic search of four quality-assessed information resource types, ultimately yielding 604 unique CAIM therapies. We then developed a single search string for the most common bibliographic databases using the finalized operational definition list of CAIM therapies. These CAIM therapies were searched against the Therapeutic Research Center's “Natural Medicines” database for all 604 therapies, whereby each item's scientific name and/or synonym was included as a keyword or phrase in the search string. While the current definition is not without limitations and ongoing debates still surround the field, this work is arguably a steppingstone towards enabling increased collaboration and communication amongst healthcare clinicians, researchers, and the public. This operational definition provides a foundation for developing well-coordinated research efforts that will assist in the acceptance and understanding of this field, while also focusing on adopting knowledge translation techniques and efforts for further research advancement and use.}

Although urolithiasis can be cured, its high recurrence rate and the development of chronic kidney disease in some patients have drawn the attention of nephrologists. Although the application of extracorporeal lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy and other minimally invasive techniques have made the treatment of urolithiasis more efficient, pharmacotherapy plays an indispensable role in reducing their morbidity and recurrence rates. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for treatment and prevention of urolithiasis in developing countries for centuries, known for its unquestionable efficacy and safety. This article reviews the progress of clinical trials and pharmacological studies on the treatment of urolithiasis with Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs). The mechanism of CHMs in the treatment of urolithiasis mainly involve preventing further growth and aggregation of urolithiasis, reducing the PH of urine, promoting calculus dissolution. Furthermore, some CHMs can increase urine output, relax smooth muscles, and promote the removal of calculus. These findings provide new treatment strategies and options for urolithiasis and secondary kidney damage.}

abstract = {Background
Many cancer patients seek adjunctive therapies to biomedical cancer treatments at some point of their disease trajectory. While acupuncture is increasingly recommended by leading oncological associations, limited evidence exists concerning the evidence-informed practice and adherence to current guidelines of traditional complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) practitioners treating cancer patients.
Methods
An international online-survey assessed the demographical data, clinical practice, and sources of information used by TCIM practitioners in Austria, Germany, United States of America, Australia, and New Zealand.
Results
In total, 404 respondents completed the survey, of which 254 (62.9%) treated cancer patients. Most practitioners were acupuncturists and herbalists (57.1%), had (16.8 ± 9.9) years of clinical experience and see a median of 2 (1, 4) cancer patients per week. Breast cancer (61.8%) is the most common cancer type seen in TCIM clinics. Adjunctive TCIM treatments are frequently concurrent with the patient’s cancer specific treatment (39.9%), which is also reflected by the main goal of a TCIM treatment to alleviate side effects (52.4%). However, only 28.0% of the respondents are in contact with the treating oncologist. According to the respondents, pain is most effectively treated using acupuncture, while herbal medicine is best for cancer-related fatigue. TCIM practitioners mostly use certified courses (33.1%) or online databases (28.3%) but often believe that experts are more reliable to inform their practice (37.0%) than research publications (32.7%).
Conclusion
Acupuncturists and herbalists commonly treat cancer patients. Most practitioners use TCIM as an adjunct to biomedicine as supportive care and use it largely in accordance with current oncological guidelines.

abstract = {Background
Generic medicines have been associated with less efficacy compared to originator products. Educational videos explaining generic medicines can have a positive effect on perceptions of generic drugs and their pain-relieving effect. The central aim of the current study was to examine whether trust in the governmental approval process of medicines mediates the effect of educational video interventions on the pain-relieving effect induced by a generic medicine and whether trust can be built by improving individuals’ understanding of generic medication.
Methods
This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial where participants with frequent tension headaches were randomly assigned to either watching a video explaining generic drugs (n = 69) or a video informing about headaches (control group: n = 34). After watching the video, participants took an originator and a generic pain analgesic in a randomized order to treat their next two consecutive headaches. Pain severity was measured before and 1 h after taking the medicine.
Results
A multiple serial mediator model showed that improving individuals' understanding of generic medicines is associated with increased trust in medicines. Both factors together, understanding and trust, significantly mediated the effect of the video education about generic drugs on the generic's pain-relieving effect (total indirect effect: coefficient: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.42, −0.0001).
Conclusion
Results of this study show that improving individuals’ understanding of generic medication and trust in the process of approving medicines should be considered as important mechanisms of future educational interventions about generic medicines.}

This paper aimed to evaluate the levels of contamination by mycotoxins and toxigenic fungi in herbal medicines and establish a rapid method for detecting toxin-producing fungi. Herein, 62.92%, 36.25%, and 64.17% of herbal medicines were contaminated by aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxins, and fumonisins, respectively. Aspergillus (43.77%), Fusarium (5.17%), and Cladosporium (4.46%) were the three predominant genera. Spearman's correlation results showed that Aspergillus and Fusarium were significantly and positively correlated with mycotoxin content (R > 0.5, P < 0.05). In addition, 323 fungal strains were isolated from herbal medicines, and 20 species were identified, mainly belonging to Aspergillus and Penicillium. Analysis of potential mycotoxin-producing fungi showed that Aspergillus flavus can produce AFs, and Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus niger can produce ochratoxin A (OTA). Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that A. flavus harbored AF synthesis genes (aflR), and A. ochraceus and A. niger harbored OTA synthesis genes (aoksl). With these synthesis genes, 67.07% and 37.20% of 164 herbal medicines were positive for toxigenic genes. Furthermore, an excellent correlation was found between the above gene copies and mycotoxin content (R2 = 0.99). Our results confirmed the high detection rate of mycotoxins in herbal medicines and identified pivotal AF- and OTA-producing fungi. In conclusion, this paper provided the contamination status of fungi and mycotoxins in herbal medicines and established a rapid method for detecting toxigenic fungi.}

To evaluate the peer-reviewed orthopaedic sports medicine literature for reference errors within 2 high-impact journals.
Methods
In total, 769 references with 1,082 in-line citations were assessed from 20 randomly selected peer-reviewed articles published in 2 high-impact orthopaedic sports medicine journals, Arthroscopy and the American Journal of Sports Medicine. Full-text copies of references were obtained through online literature subscription databases. Two investigators evaluated each citation for agreement between the reference’s study design, methods, data, discussion, and conclusion with the citing authors’ claims. Error rates, interobserver agreement, and association between error rates and journal demographics were assessed.
Results
Cohen’s κ coefficient representing interobserver agreement was 0.61. The mean citation error rate across 20 articles from 2 orthopaedic sports medicine journals was 6.6%. The most common error was failure to support the authors’ assertions within the citing article, accounting for 32% of errors. There was no significant association between error rate and journal impact factor, number of cited references or total references, ratio of in-line citations to cited references (citation ratio), and number of authors. There was no significant relationship between error rate and journal, study type, and level of evidence.
Conclusions
Inaccurate claims and citations are common within the orthopaedic sports medicine literature, occurring in every reviewed article and 6.6% of all in-line citations. Failure to support the assertions of the article in which a reference is cited is a common error. Authors should take care to rigorously assess references with particular attention to accurate citation of primary sources.
Clinical Relevance
This study highlights the prevalence of citation errors within a random sampling of high-level orthopaedic sports medicine articles. Given science is cumulative, these errors perpetuate inaccuracies and are at odds with evidence-based practice.}

abstract = {The gut microbiota, known as the “forgotten organ” and “human second genome,” comprises a complex microecosystem. It significantly influences the development of various tumors, including colorectal, liver, stomach, breast, and lung cancers, through both direct and indirect mechanisms. These mechanisms include the “gut-liver” axis, the “lung-intestine” axis, and interactions with the immune system. The intestinal flora exhibits dual roles in cancer, both promoting and suppressing its progression. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can alter cancer progression by regulating the intestinal flora. It modifies the intestinal flora’s composition and structure, along with the levels of endogenous metabolites, thus affecting the intestinal barrier, immune system, and overall body metabolism. These actions contribute to TCM’s significant antitumor effects. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes TCM components, enhancing their antitumor properties. Therefore, exploring the interaction between TCM and the intestinal flora offers a novel perspective in understanding TCM’s antitumor mechanisms. This paper succinctly reviews the association between gut flora and the development of tumors, including colorectal, liver, gastric, breast, and lung cancers. It further examines current research on the interaction between TCM and intestinal flora, with a focus on its antitumor efficacy. It identifies limitations in existing studies and suggests recommendations, providing insights into antitumor drug research and exploring TCM’s antitumor effectiveness. Additionally, this paper aims to guide future research on TCM and the gut microbiota in antitumor studies.}

abstract = {Background
Post-viral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is the common symptoms of long COVID, lacking of effective treatments. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is claimed to be effective in treating olfactory dysfunction, but the evidence has not yet been critically appraised. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TCM for PVOD.
Methods
We searched eight databases to identified clinical controlled studies about TCM for PVOD. The Cochrane risk of bias tools and GRADE were used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Risk ratio (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95 % confidence interval (CI), were used for effect estimation and RevMan 5.4.1 was used for data analysis.
Results
Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (545 participants), two non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) (112 participants), and one retrospective cohort study (30 participants) were included. The overall quality of included studies was low. Acupuncture (n = 8) and acupoint injection (n = 3) were the mainly used TCM therapies. Five RCTs showed a better effect in TCM group. Four trials used acupuncture, and three trials used acupoint injection. The results of two non-RCTs and one cohort study were not statistically significant. Two trials reported mild to moderate adverse events (pain and brief syncope caused by acupuncture or acupoint injection).
Conclusions
Limited evidence focus on acupuncture and acupoint injection for PVOD and suggests that acupuncture and acupoint injection may be effective in improving PVOD. More well-designed trials should focus on acupuncture to confirm the benefit.

The objective of this systematic review was to determine the global prevalence of complementary medicine (CM) use among children and adolescents.
Method
Seven databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched for pertinent observational studies. Studies were limited to those published in English from July 1, 2013. Included studies were appraised using the JBI checklist for prevalence studies.
Results
Twenty studies were eligible for inclusion (385,527 participants). Most studies were assessed as having low risk of bias. Meta-analyses revealed a 23.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.226–0.234; 17 studies) short-term (≤ 12 month) prevalence and a 77.7% (95% confidence interval, 0.760–0.794; six studies) lifetime prevalence of CM use in children and adolescents. Differences in CM use were evident across countries and regions.
Discussion
The findings of this review indicate that the use of CM in children and adolescents is high and widespread and may be increasing.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent female endocrine condition that significantly affects women of all age groups and is characterized by metabolic dysfunction. The efficacy of existing pharmaceutical interventions for the treatment of PCOS remains inadequate. With a rich history and cultural significance spanning thousands of years, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is extensively employed for treating a variety of ailments and can serve as a supplementary therapy for managing PCOS. Multiple clinical observations and laboratory tests have unequivocally demonstrated the substantial effectiveness and safety of TCM formulae in treating PCOS, and further investigations are currently in progress.
Aim of the study
To summarize the TCM formulae commonly employed in the clinical management of PCOS, examine their therapeutic benefits, investigate their mechanism of action, active constituents, and establish the correlation between efficacy, mechanism of action, and active constituents.
Materials and methods
We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed, Web of Science, and China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI) using the following keywords: "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome", "Traditional Chinese Medicine Decoctions", "Traditional Chinese Medicine formulae", "Traditional Chinese Medicine", "Clinical Observation", "Mechanism", "Treatment", "Pharmacology", and various combinations of these terms. From January 1, 2006 until October 7, 2023, (inclusive).
Results
This paper summarized the clinical effectiveness, mechanism of action, and active components of 8 TCM formulae for the treatment of PCOS. Our research indicates that TCM formulae can potentially treat PCOS by enhancing the levels of hyperandrogenism and other endocrine hormones, decreasing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and controlling chronic low-grade inflammation, among other modes of action. In addition, we found an association between epigenetics and TCM formulae for the treatment of PCOS.
Conclusion
TCM formulae have specific advantages in the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). They achieve therapeutic benefits by targeting several pathways and connections, attracting considerable interest and playing a vital role in the treatment of PCOS. TCM formulae can be used as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of PCOS.}

Patient mindsets influence health outcomes; yet trainings focused on care teams’ understanding, recognizing, and shaping patient mindsets do not exist. This paper aims to describe and evaluate initial reception of the “Medicine Plus Mindset” training program.
Methods
Clinicians and staff at five primary care clinics (N = 186) in the San Francisco Bay Area received the Medicine Plus Mindset Training. The Medicine Plus Mindset training consists of a two-hour training program plus a one-hour follow-up session including: (a) evidence to help care teams understand patients’ mindsets’ influence on treatment; (b) a framework to support care teams in identifying specific patient mindsets; and (c) strategies to shape patient mindsets.
Results
We used a common model (Kirkpatrick) to evaluate the training based on participants’ reaction, learnings, and behavior. Reaction: Participants rated the training as highly useful and enjoyable. Learnings: The training increased the perceived importance of mindsets in healthcare and improved self-reported efficacy of using mindsets in practice. Behavior: The training increased reported frequency of shaping patient mindsets.
Conclusions
Development of this training and the study’s results introduce a promising and feasible approach for integrating mindset into clinical practice. Practice Implications Mindset training can add a valuable dimension to clinical care and should be integrated into training and clinical practice.}

Persistent neuroinflammation plays an important role in the development of PD, and activation of microglia and astrocytes within the central nervous system leads to an inflammatory response and production of pro-inflammatory factors, and activation of NF-κB is key to neuroglial activation in chronic inflammation in PD and a hallmark of the onset of neuroinflammatory disease. Therefore, inhibiting NF-κB activation to prevent further loss of dopaminergic nerves is a more effective means of treating PD. It has been found that an increasing number of active ingredients in Chinese medicines, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids, phenols and phenylpropanoids, have anti-inflammatory properties that can regulate neuroglia cell activation and ameliorate neuroinflammation through the NF-κB pathway, and increase dopamine release or protect dopaminergic neurons for neuroprotection to improve behavioural dysfunction in PD. The active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine are expected to be good candidates for the treatment of PD, as they provide holistic regulation through multi-targeting and multi-level effects, and are safe, inexpensive and readily available. Therefore, this paper summarises that the active ingredients of some relevant Chinese medicines ameliorate the symptoms of PD and delay the development of PD by inhibiting glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation through the NF-κB pathway, which may provide new ideas for exploring the molecular mechanism of PD pathogenesis and developing new anti-PD drugs.}

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at every therapeutic stage, even before tumor formation. However, the efficacy of TCM in reducing the incidence of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B-related cirrhosis remains unclear. This study aims to address this gap.
Methods
Publications were collected from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Sino Med, VIP, and Wan Fang Databases. Relative risk (RR) was calculated with a 95 % confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias.
Results
10 studies with 2702 patients showed that the combination therapy significantly reduced the incidence of HCC in patients with post-hepatitis B cirrhosis at 1, 3, and 5 years. However, the preventive effects of TCM were in compensated cirrhosis, but not the decompensated cirrhosis. Furthermore, TCM correlated with improved liver function and enhanced virological response.
Conclusion
Combination therapy with TCM demonstrated the certain potential in reducing the incidence of HCC in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis. This is attrinuted to the improvement of liver function and enhancement of the viral response. However, the efficacy of TCM in the field still needs more high-quality RCTs to provide stronger evidence in the future.}

abstract = {Background
Older adults deserve special healthcare provision in every branch of medicine. Turkey currently does not have geriatric emergency medicine (GEM) subspecialty training. Thus, interprofessional training for healthcare professionals involved in GEM services is required. Team-based learning (TBL) seems suitable to implement such training. We aimed to develop and implement a training program for healthcare professionals engaged with GEM services, and evaluate the program considering teacher and learner satisfaction and knowledge retention.
Methods
This was a design-based study in which a one-day GEM training program was developed based on the literature and expert opinions. The program was applied to 54 physicians, 98 nurses, 70 health officers, and 102 paramedics using a modified version of TBL. Teams included at least one representative from each profession. TBL was modified by adding a 1-h lecture and eliminating peer evaluation. Feedback forms, individual and group tests of TBL, and a retention test conducted six months later were used for program evaluation.
Results
The mean group test score was higher than that of individual tests in all professions. Physicians’ individual test scores were higher than those of other professions, but this difference disappeared in the group test. The retention test mean score was higher than the individual test mean score but lower than that of the group test. Teacher and learner satisfaction was high.
Conclusion
We implemented a training program using a modified TBL approach to teach GEM to relevant healthcare professionals; it yielded promising results regarding knowledge gain and retention, as well as teacher and learner satisfaction. The instruction design and method used in this study can be applied to multidisciplinary team training.}

abstract = {Background
Turning Point Analysis (TPA) is a methodological approach that allows scholars to retrospectively capture change over time by identifying instances of critical change (i.e., turning points) encountered across a given time period. While TPA has been used to examine time as a variable in health and illness experiences, the use of the method in behavioral medicine scholarship may be limited by the lack of understanding of TPA procedures and applicability.
Objective
To describe how TPA has been used and enhance its accessibility by identifying and synthesizing methods of TPA data collection and analysis.
Methods
A systematic search of electronic databases, including Academic Source Premier, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, APA PsycInfo, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Database, was conducted in May 2020. In July 2020, we used hand searching to identify additional articles, including forward and back tracking seminal articles on TPA. Studies were screened in duplicate.
Results
Of the 1184 studies screened for this review, we included 52. Studies used TPA to examine relational (k = 40), organizational (k = 6), and individual (k = 6) variables and included an analysis of either turning points (k = 28), the trajectories of change over time created by the turning points (k = 3), or both (k = 21). Turning points and trajectories were captured and analyzed using qualitative and quantitative analytic approaches, with most studies using either purely qualitative (k = 26) or mixed methods (k = 21).
Conclusions
The findings of this review provide insight into the varied applications of TPA and suggest the potential value of this methodological approach in better understanding health experiences across time. By synthesizing the procedural and analytic steps to conducting a TPA, this review could also increase the accessibility and use of TPA in behavioral medicine research.}

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting more than 10 million people worldwide and is characterized by the progressive loss of Daergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. It has been reported that signaling pathways play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD, while the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been found to possess a protective effect against PD. TCM has demonstrated significant potential in mitigating oxidative stress (OS), neuroinflammation, and apoptosis of DA neurons via the regulation of signaling pathways associated with PD.
Aim of the review
This study discussed and analyzed the signaling pathways involved in the occurrence and development of PD and the mechanism of active ingredients of TCM regulating PD via signaling pathways, with the aim of providing a basis for the development and clinical application of therapeutic strategies for TCM in PD.
Materials and methods
With "Parkinson's disease", "Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease", "Lewy Body Parkinson's Disease", "Parkinson's Disease, Idiopathic", "Parkinson Disease, Idiopathic", "Parkinson's disorders", "Parkinsonism syndrome", "Traditional Chinese medicine", "Chinese herbal medicine", "active ingredients", "medicinal plants" as the main keywords, PubMed, Web of Science and other online search engines were used for literature retrieval.
Results
PD exhibits a close association with various signaling pathways, including but not limited to MAPKs, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Nrf2/ARE, Wnt/β-catenin, TLR/TRIF, NLRP3, Notch. The therapeutic potential of TCM lies in its ability to regulate these signaling pathways. In addition, the active ingredients of TCM have shown significant effects in improving OS, neuroinflammation, and DA neuron apoptosis in PD.
Conclusion
The active ingredients of TCM have unique advantages in regulating PD-related signaling pathways. It is suggested to combine network pharmacology and bioinformatics to study the specific targets of TCM. This not only provides a new way for the prevention and treatment of PD with the active ingredients of TCM, but also provides a scientific basis for the selection and development of TCM preparations.}

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease with intestinal tract as the main site. The pathogenic of UC has not yet been clarified, and multiple mechanisms can lead to the pathogenesis of UC. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers an opportunity for UC treatment. TCM has become the preferred treatment for UC with characteristics of multiple targets, multiple pathways and high safety. This review attempted to summarize the characteristics of TCM (compound prescriptions, single Chinese herbs, and active ingredients) for UC treatment and discussed their pathogenesis based on analyzing the UC-related gut microbiota, signaling pathway and cytokine. In order to provide more systematic and diverse reference for TCM in the prevention and treatment of UC, and provide theoretical reference for clinical treatment of UC.
Materials and methods
The information was acquired from different databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases. We then focused on the recent research progress in UC treatment by TCM. Finally, the deficiencies and future perspectives are proposed.
Results
Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the compound prescriptions (strengthening spleen, clearing heat and removing dampness, clearing heat and removing toxin), single Chinese herbs (replenishing Qi, clearing heat, tonifying blood, etc.), and active ingredients (alkaloids, polysaccharides, flavonoids, polyphenols, terpenes, etc.) have an efficiency in UC treatment by regulating gut microbiota, signaling pathway and cytokine.

Here, we present a case of a woman in her forties who had two successful live births after treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine. At her initial visit (at age 43), the patient presented with a short menstrual cycle and signs of a diminished ovarian reserve (FSH: 26.2 mIU/mL; AMH: 0.23 ng/mL). Three years after her first delivery (at age 47), the patient showed signs of further diminished ovarian reserve (FSH: 27.1 mIU/mL; AMH: 0.07 ng/mL). Notably, after five months of Chinese herbal medicine treatment, she achieved another successful pregnancy, and resulted in a live birth. This case demonstrates that Chinese herbal medicine can have a positive clinical impact on improving hormonal balance and fecundity. Further research is needed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Chinese herbal medicine in improving fecundity for women of advanced maternal age.}

In recent years, an increasing number of databases related to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or gut microbes have been established. However, a database combining the two has not yet been developed. To accelerate TCM research and address the traditional medicine and micro ecological system connection between short board, we have developed the most comprehensive micro-ecological database of TCM. This initiative includes the standardization of the following advantages: (1) A repeatable process achieved through the standardization of a retrieval strategy to identify literature. This involved identifying 419 experiment articles from PubMed and six authoritative databases; (2) High-quality data integration achieved through double-entry extraction of literature, mitigating uncertainties associated with natural language extraction; (3) Implementation of a similar strategy aiding in the prediction of mechanisms of action. Leveraging drug similarity, target entity similarity, and known drug-target entity association, our platform enables the prediction of the effects of a new herb or acupoint formulas using the existing data. In total, MicrobeTCM includes 171 diseases, 725 microbes, 1468 herb-formulas, 1032 herbs, 15780 chemical compositions, 35 acupoint-formulas, and 77 acupoints.

abstract = {Introduction
Although general physicians (GPs) considerably affect herbal medicines (HMs) consumption, there is not enough insight into their attitude and behaviour towards prescribing HMs. This study investigated the GPs’ attitudes towards HMs, the relationship between their attitude and the general preference for HMs, and the effect of the following variables on their prescription decisions for HMs: (1) GP’s experience regarding the effectiveness of that HM, (2) access to the side effects information, (3) patient's payment capacity, and (4) patient’s attitude towards HMs.
Methods
A survey was conducted in Hamadan, Iran. GPs’ demographics, attitude, and decision towards prescribing HMs were asked. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis, logistic regression, and correlation.
Results
SSixty GPs’ data were analyzed. Their attitude was not very positive; only 16.6% often or always preferred HMs. The likelihood of prescribing HMs was increased by positive experiences with effectiveness (OR=11.2, p-value=0.000, CI: 5.2-24.4) and access to side effects information (OR=6.9, p-value=0.000, CI: 3.5-13.9). Affordability problems reduced the chance of HM prescription for mild (OR=1.8, p-value=0.012, CI: 1.1–2.9) and severe problems (OR=6.9, p-value=0.000, CI: 3.6–13.3). Patient’s positive opinion about HMs increased the probability of HMs prescription compared to neutral (OR=2.6, p-value= 0.002, CI: 1.4 – 4.8) and negative opinion (OR=9.4, p-value=0.000, CI: 4.1–21.3). No significant influence was observed for GP’s sex, age and experience. The model correctly predicted 80.89% of stated decisionss.
Conclusions
Enhancement of GPs and patients’ trust in HMs’ effectiveness and safety and improve these products’ affordability is suggested to increase HMs’ prescription by GPs.}

abstract = {Introduction
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) boosts immunity, aids self-repair, and supports elderly health. Despite government efforts, older adults underutilize TCM preventive health services. This study aimed to develop a reliable and valid Social Cognitive Factor Scale (SCFS) to understand this from a behavioral psychology perspective.
Methods
The SCFS, a self-report questionnaire rooted in Bandura's social cognitive theory, was developed by an expert panel using insights from current literature, focus group qualitative research, and scale testing. Twenty experts in TCM public health research and 840 community-dwelling older adults were included in this study. Scale development involved a literature review to establish the initial item pool, two Delphi expert consultations for item screening and revision, and comprehensive testing for reliability and effectiveness.
Results
The SCFS consisted of 22 items classified into six dimensions: perceived environment, social support, belief and knowledge, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulation. The overall Cronbach's alpha of the scale was 0.946, and the split-half reliability of the total scale was 0.828, showing good reliability. A total of six factors were extracted, explaining 78.85 % of the total variation. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the scale had good construct validity. Scores on the SCFS were significantly and positively correlated with the utilization rate of TCM preventive health services for older adults (r = 0.537, p < 0.01).
Conclusion
TCM plays a significant role in actively addressing the challenges of aging. The SCFS provides a reliable and valid tool for understanding the underutilization of TCM preventive health services among older adults. A positive correlation with service utilization rates highlights its potential for guiding interventions.}

The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has negatively impacted the lives of people globally. To date, no specific treatment has emerged to combat the disease. Hence, there is an urge for immediate therapy against infections like COVID-19 through the inclusion of various traditional medicines including Ayurveda.
Methods
This retrospective study was performed on 300 patients who were treated using the Holistic Ayurveda protocol at the COVID Health Care (CHC) centre. Out of 300 patients, 258 who took the AYURAKSHA Kit regularly along with the other Ayurvedic medicines for treatment were selected for this study. Demographic distribution, viral clearance, and haematological parameters of COVID-19 patients were analysed.
Results
The maximum number of COVID-19 positive cases (31.4%) were found in the age group 20–29 years whereas the age group 40–49 years (11.52 days) and ≥ 60 years (11.5 days) took the maximum time (P = 0.035) for viral clearance. The haematological investigations showed that the Ayurveda treatment maintained the admitted patients' blood profile and coagulation profile. Strikingly, liver and kidney profiles improved post-treatment as Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase (P = 0.000), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (P = 0.000), Urea (P = 0.000), and Creatinine (P = 0.002) levels were significantly reduced. Likewise, a significant reduction in inflammation markers like C-reactive Protein (P = 0.000), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (P = 0.003), and serum Ferritin (P = 0.000) was also observed. No adverse treatment effects were observed during follow-up of the patients.
Conclusion
The above outcomes showed that the Holistic Ayurveda Protocol in treating COVID-19 patients is safe, acceptable and effective. Thus, suggesting the possible integration of Ayurvedic treatment in combating such deadly diseases.}

Obesity, mainly caused by excessive accumulation of visceral fat, excessive fat metabolism will cause hormone secretion imbalance and inflammation and other diseases. is extremely detrimental to human health. Although many treatments are available for obesity, most treatments fail to exert a radical effect or are associated with several side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for regulating the intestinal flora, lipid content and inflammation is considered effective. Based on previous studies, Artemisia capillaris, Astragalus propinquus, Phellodendron amurense, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Poria cocos, and Anemarrhena asphodeloides were selected to prepare an innovative herbal formula.
Methods
TCM was characterized by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS. The anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects of the TCM formula prepared were evaluated in a high-fat diet-fed obese mouse model. The effects of the TCM formula on the intestinal flora were also investigated.
Results
Weights and insulin resistance, as well as inflammation, decreased in the mice after treatment. At the same time, lipid metabolism increased after the mice were gavaged with the TCM formula for 2 weeks. The intestinal motility of the drug administration group was enhanced, with partial restoration of the intestinal flora.
Conclusion
In summary, our innovative Chinese herbal formula significantly reduced weight, reduced intestinal inflammation, improved intestinal motility, and improved lipid metabolism in obese mice. Furthermore, the innovative formula effectively prevented relevant obesity-induced metastatic diseases in the mice.}

To investigate the cost-avoidance associated with implementation of an overnight emergency medicine pharmacist (EMP) through documented clinical interventions.
Design
Retrospective evaluation of prospectively tracked interventions in a single Level I Trauma, Comprehensive Stroke Center, from November 25, 2020 through March 12, 2021 during expanded emergency medicine service hours (2300–0700).
Interventions
One of 45 clinical patient-care recommendations associated with cost-avoidance were available to be selected and documented by the EMP; more than one intervention was allowed per patient, though one clinical intervention could not be counted as multiple items. Documented services were associated with monetary cost avoidance based upon available literature assessing pharmacy clinical interventions. Differences in time from imaging to systemic thrombolytics and percentage of patients meeting door-to-alteplase benchmarks were compared with and without the availability of EMPs.
Results
Overnight EMPs documented 820 interventions during 107 overnight shifts with a cost avoidance of $612,974. The most common interventions were bedside monitoring (n = 127; $50,694), drug information consultation (97; $11,269), and antimicrobial therapy initiation and streamlining (95; $60,101). When categorizing interventions, 378 (46%; $292,484) were input as hands-on care, 216 (26%; $94,899) as individualization of patient care, 135 (17%; $25,897) as administrative and supportive tasks, 84 (10%; $121,746) as adverse drug event prevention, and 7 (1%; $77,964) as resource utilization. All patients (n = 6) with an acute ischemic stroke during the evaluation period received systemic thrombolytics ≤45 min in the presence of EMPs compared with 50% receiving thrombolytics ≤45 min without EMPs.
Conclusions
Expanded overnight coverage by EMPs provided clinical bedside pharmacotherapy expertise to critically ill patients otherwise not available prior to study implementation. Clinical interventions were associated with substantial cost-avoidance.}

abstract = {Background
In 2004, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) adopted a Statement of Professional Standard on the supply of medicines affecting driving performance, transformed to FIP guidelines in 2014. In 2011, the final report from the European initiative on Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines (DRUID) was published. Both documents provided recommendations for improving dispensing guidelines for driving-impairing medicines for patients who use psychoactive medicines.
Objective
This study investigated the extent that European professional organizations of pharmacists (POPs) implemented existing guidelines and DRUID results.
Methods
An online questionnaire survey was conducted in April–May 2022. Questionnaires were sent by e-mail to POPs in 46 European countries. The questionnaire addressed the following topics: awareness of FIP guidelines and DRUID outcomes (a), development of dispensing guidelines (b), target groups for information materials (c), evaluations of dispensing practices (d), examples of projects on medicines affecting driving fitness (e), development of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) -support (f), collaboration with organizations of physicians (g), and patients (h). The data were analyzed by indicating implementation initiatives in different countries. Open-ended questions were assessed qualitatively.
Results
POPs in 23 European countries responded to the invitation (response rate: 50%). Guidelines for improving dispensing practices were available in 5 countries targeted at professionals, patients, and the general population. Patient and physician organizations were involved in 4 and 3 countries, respectively. Implementation was supported by computerized dispensing systems (5 countries) and public campaigns (5 countries).
Conclusions
Twenty years after the introduction of FIP guidelines and ten years after the DRUID outcomes, only 5 European POPs have implemented this knowledge. Different activities were performed to support implementation, resulting in examples of successful use of recommendations for driving-impairing medicines in pharmacy practice. Implementation needs further attention. The successful practices that have been developed are an example for dissemination to other countries.}

abstract = {Background
Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (Baizhu in Chinese, BZ) is a typical traditional edible-medicinal herb used for thousands of years. Known as “the spleen-reinforcing medicine”, it is often used clinically to treat reduced digestive function, abdominal distension, and diarrhoea, which are all caused by spleen deficiency. Among BZ's processing products, honey bran-fried BZ (HBBZ) is the only processed product recorded in BZ in the 2020 Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP). There are differences in effectiveness, traditional application, and clinical indications between them.
Purpose
This review reviewed BZ and its main product HBBZ from botany, ethnopharmacology, chemical composition, pharmacological effectiveness, and safety. The changes in chemical composition and pharmacological effectiveness of BZ induced by the processing of traditional Chinese medicine were emphatically described.
Methods
Keywords related to Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz., honey bran frying, essential oil, lactones, polysaccharide and combinations to include published studies of BZ and HBBZ from 2004–2023 were searched in the following databases: Pubmed, Chengdu University of TCM Library, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang database. All studies, published in English or Chinese, were included. However, in the process of chemical composition collection, we reviewed all available literature on the chemical composition of BZ and HBBZ.
Conclusion
Honey bran frying processing methods will affect BZ's chemical composition and pharmacological effectiveness. The types and contents of chemical components in the HBBZ showed some changes compared with those in BZ. For example, the content of volatile oil decreased and the content of lactones increased after stir-fried bran. In addition, new ingredients such as phenylacetaldehyde, 2-acetyl pyrrole, 6- (1,1-dimethylethyl) -3,4-dihydro-1 (2H) -naphthalone and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural appeared. Both BZ and HBBZ have a variety of pharmacological effectiveness. After stir-fried with honey bran, the "Zao Xing" is reduced, and the efficacy of tonify spleen is strengthened, which is more suitable for patients with weak spleen and stomach.}

abstract = {Background
We explored the mechanisms of Sanguotang (SGT), a Tibetan medicine, in treating gout arthritis (GA).
Methods
The main active components, action targets, and disease targets of SGT were identified through TCMSP databases. The gene functions were analyzed using protein interaction (PPI) networks, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and molecular docking. A GA model induced by monosodium urate was established in rats. The ankle joint swelling was observed. The levels of uric acid (UA) and albumin (ALB) in rat serum were measured. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was conducted to examine the pathological changes in rat ankle joints.
Results
Twenty-nine active components of SGT with proven efficacy and 66 intersection targets were identified, primarily involved in inflammation and immune regulation pathways. The PPI results revealed that the key targets of SGT against GA included ALB, IL6, TNF, TP53, and PTGS. Molecular docking showed favorable binding energy between the ALB protein and the active components. The results from animal experiments demonstrated that SGT effectively alleviated the inflammatory reaction in ankle joints, and decreased UA and ALB levels. Furthermore, SGT effectively inhibited the proliferation of synovial cells in the ankle joint cavity, prevented infiltration of inflammatory cells, and protected synovial tissue, thereby improving GA.
Conclusions
SGT comprehensively contributes to the treatment of GA by regulating UA metabolism, reducing the release of inflammatory factors, and modulating immune and inflammatory pathways.}

The limitations of conventional management options (i.e., invasive monitoring, adverse effects of pharmacological treatments and challenges with maintaining dietary restrictions) may lead people with EGIDs to seek other treatment options, such as complementary medicine (CM). Although there is mounting evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of some complementary medicines (CMs) for the management of gastrointestinal diseases, the evidence of effectiveness of CMs for EGIDs has not yet been systematically reviewed. A systematic review of controlled clinical trials and randomised controlled trials, including cross-over trials, examining the safety and/or efficacy of any CM, against any comparator, was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of CMs in adults with EGIDs and to explore potential candidate interventions. The search identified 4304 references. After title and abstract screening, 4297 studies were excluded. The 7 identified studies were retrieved as full-text and assessed for eligibility. All 7 studies were excluded due to wrong study design (n = 1; retrospective study), and wrong patient population (n = 6; e.g., patients with functional dyspepsia or heartburn). No studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. While there is a paucity of clinical studies examining the effectiveness of CM for EGID, findings from observational and experimental studies highlight possible directions for future research. These studies point to a number of CMs (i.e., nutritional supplements and herbal medicines) that show promise as a treatment for EGID; the clinical safety and efficacy of these interventions therefore warrants further investigation. Identifying safe, effective and acceptable treatment options for people living with an EGID may help to reduce disease and treatment burden in this population, and in turn, improve quality of life.}

During the last decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has gradually replaced most other methods for precision cancer diagnostics, spanning from targeted tumor-informed assays and gene panel sequencing to global whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing analyses. The shift has been impelled by a clinical need to assess an increasing number of genomic alterations with diagnostic, prognostic and predictive impact, including more complex biomarkers (e.g. microsatellite instability, MSI, and homologous recombination deficiency, HRD), driven by the parallel development of novel targeted therapies and enabled by the rapid reduction in sequencing costs.

abstract = {Introduction
Angina pectoris is very common worldwide, and effective prevention and treatment of angina pectoris are important. Gelanxinning Soft Capsules (GXSC), a Chinese patent medicine, has been used for angina pectoris. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the efficacy and safety of GXSC for angina pectoris in adults.
Methods
PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, SinoMed, Wanfang, and VIP databases and clinical trials registries were searched up to April 2023. Primary outcomes were effective rate for angina pectoris and effective rate for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome improvement. Secondary outcomes were lipid panel and adverse events. The Cochrane ROB-2 tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) were adopted for assessing study risk of bias and evidence quality, respectively.
Results
Twelve studies involving 1417 participants were included. Angina effective rates were higher for GXSC compared to control (RR = 1.12, 95%CI = [1.07,1.18], P < 0.0001, RCTs = 10, n = 1177), (RR = 1.12 of ≥ 30% angina symptom improvement, 95%CI = [1.05,1.19], P = 0.0003, RCTs = 4, n = 569), (RR = 1.10 of ≥ 50% fewer angina attacks, 95%CI = [1.00,1.21], P = 0.04, RCTs = 3, n = 342) and (RR = 1.16 of others, 95%CI = [1.04,1.28], P = 0.005, RCTs = 3, n = 266), and also for GXSC combined with Western medicine compared to Western medicine alone (RR = 1.13, 95%CI = [1.07,1.19], P < 0.0001, RCTs = 5, n = 617) and GXSC compared to other types of Chinese patent medicines (RR = 1.12, 95%CI = [1.03, 1.20], P = 0.005, RCTs = 5, n = 560). There were no significant differences in TCM syndrome improvement when GXSC combined with Western medicine was compared to Western medicine alone (RR = 1.70, 95%CI = [0.40,7.16], P  =  0.47, RCTs = 2, n = 280) or when GXSC was compared to other Chinese patent medicines (RR = 1.18, 95%CI = [0.99,1.40], P = 0.07, RCTs = 2, n = 150). The incidence of adverse events was underreported. Adverse events were lower when GXSC was combined with Western medicine compared to Western medicine alone (RR = 0.25, 95%Cl = [0.08,0.82], P = 0.02, RCT = 1, n = 76), but no statistical difference was found between GXSC and other Chinese patent medicine (RR = 0.33, 95%Cl = [0.04,3.16], P = 0.34, RCTs = 2, n = 146).
Conclusions
There is low to very low certainty in the evidence, reflecting the small sample sizes and high risk of bias of included studies. Based on this limited evidence, GXSC may be an effective and safe adjunctive Chinese patent medicine for angina pectoris.}

However, successful blinding in clinical trials of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is hard to achieve, and the evaluation of blinding success through blinding assessment lacks established guidelines. Taking into account the challenges associated with blinding in the TCM field, here we present a framework for assessing blinding. Further, this study proposes a blinding assessment protocol for TCM clinical trials, building upon the framework and the existing methods. An assessment report checklist and an approach for evaluating the assessment results are presented based on the proposed protocol. It is anticipated that these improvements to blinding assessment will generate greater awareness among researchers, facilitate the standardization of blinding, and augment the blinding effectiveness. The use of this blinding assessment may further advance the quality and precision of TCM clinical trials and improve the accuracy of the trial results. The blinding assessment protocol will undergo continued optimization and refinement, drawing upon expert consensus and experience derived from clinical trials.

Since 1977, the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines (EML) have been a benchmark to guide the procurement of medicines at the national level, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Aiming to include the most effective, safe, and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions, WHO updates the EML for adults and the EML for children every 2 years. Over the past 45 years, updates to the EML mental health section have been infrequent, in most cases with additions of individual medicines. A comprehensive revision of the entire section has never been attempted. With the aim of increasing the use of the WHO EML to expand the selection of the most effective and safe medicines for mental disorders, a series of evidence-based applications were submitted to the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines in 2022, recommending a substantial revision of the entire mental health section. In this Health Policy, we summarise the recommended update and the evidence justifying it. We also discuss challenges in the update process, suggesting possible solutions. The requested comprehensive revision of the WHO EML mental health section aligns the list with the latest evidence. The revision offers an opportunity for countries to promote access to the most effective, safe, and cost-effective medicines for mental disorders, contributing to universal health coverage and global mental health equity.}

Thus, this study reports four cases of pain amelioration and resorption of FJCs through noninvasive integrative Korean Medicine treatment.
Methods
For intervention, four patients with symptomatic FJCs underwent integrative Korean medicine treatment with acupuncture, herbal medicine, pharmacopuncture, and Chuna manual therapy; after completion of the series of treatment sessions, patients were re-examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Results
: Pain disappeared within 2 months for all four patients; the amelioration of pain was sustained for more than 6 months. Furthermore, the disappearance of FJCs was confirmed by MRI after a certain period from the time of pain disappearance.
Conclusions
This study reported the effectiveness of non-invasive, integrative Korean medicine treatment for patients with FJCs; this method shows promise as a conservative treatment option for patients with FJCs.}

abstract = {Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Conventional and advanced treatments currently used for cancer are known for adverse effects and are expensive. Therefore, the search for alternative medicines is necessary. Homeopathy is one of the common complementary and alternative medicine used worldwide for treating and managing various cancers, as it has negligible side effects. However, only a few homeopathic drugs have been validated using various cancer cell lines and animal models. Over the last two decades, an increasing number of validated and reported homeopathic remedies have been developed. Despite the diluted remedies of homeopathic medicine making it controversial clinically, it was found to be more significant as an adjunct therapy for cancer treatment. Hence we aimed to review and summarize the research studies carried out on homeopathic remedies to explore the possible molecular mechanism behind its mode of action against cancer and its effectiveness.}

abstract = {Objective
Exposure to neurosurgery is important for knowledge of neurosurgical conditions that physicians may encounter. The current status of neurosurgery nonsubinternship clerkships in the United States is unknown; this study determined the availability and format of non-subinternship neurosurgery clerkships in DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine)-granting and MD (Doctor of Medicine)-granting U.S. medical schools.
Methods
Association of American Medical Colleges and American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine websites were used to obtain contact information for all U.S. medical schools. Respondents were asked whether their school offered a non-subinternship neurosurgery clerkship, if it was required, clerkship length, and whether the clerkship was embedded in another clerkship. Nonsubinternship clerkships/electives/selectives were defined as an exploratory neurosurgery rotation. For nonresponding schools, data were collected from school websites.
Results
Data were obtained for 180/199 U.S. medical schools; 142 (79%) provided neurosurgery non-subinternships, including 125/150 (83.3%) MD-granting and 17/30 (57%) DO-granting schools. Four MD-granting schools (2.8%) required the clerkship; 87/142 (61%) offered a stand-alone clerkship, 34/142 (24%) an embedded clerkship, and 21/142 (15%) offered both. In total, 200 clerkships were offered across 142 schools. Most were either >1–2 weeks or >3–4 weeks (69/200, 35% and 89/200, 45%, respectively).
Conclusions
Most U.S. medical schools provide elective neurosurgery non-subinternships. Fewer, although still a majority, of DO-granting schools offer a neurosurgery non-subinternship compared with MD-granting schools.}

Background
The national Network Genomic Medicine (nNGM) Lung Cancer provides comprehensive and high-quality multiplex molecular diagnostics and standardized personalized treatment recommendation for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) in Germany. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the nNGM precision medicine program in terms of overall survival (OS) using real-world data (RWD).
Methods
A historical nationwide cohort analysis of patients with aNSCLC and initial diagnosis between 04/2019 and 06/2020 was conducted to compare treatment and OS of patients with and without nNGM-participation. Patients participating within the nNGM (nNGM group) were selected based on a prospective nNGM database. The electronic health records (EHR) of the prospective nNGM database were case-specifically linked to claims data (AOK, German health insurance). The control group was selected from claims data of patients receiving usual care without nNGM-participation (non-nNGM group). The minimum follow-up period was six months.
Findings
Overall, n = 509 patients in the nNGM group and n = 7213 patients in the non-nNGM group met the inclusion criteria. Patients participating in the nNGM had a significantly improved OS compared to the non-nNGM group (median OS: 10.5 months vs. 8.7 months, p = 0.008, HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74–0.95). The 1-year survival rates were 46.8% (nNGM) and 41.3% (non-nNGM). The use of approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in the first-line setting was significantly higher in the nNGM group than in the non-nNGM group (nNGM: 8.4% (43/509) vs. non-nNGM: 5.1% (366/7213), p = 0.001). Overall, patients receiving first-line TKI treatment had significantly higher 1-year OS rates than patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and/or chemotherapy (67.2% vs. 40.2%, p < 0.001).
Interpretation
This is the first study to demonstrate a significant survival benefit and higher utilization of targeted therapies for aNSCLC patients participating within nNGM. Our data indicate that precision medicine programs can enhance collaborative personalized lung cancer care and promote the implementation of treatment innovations and the latest scientific knowledge into clinical routine care.
Funding
The study was funded by the AOK Federal Association Germany.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
The Westhoff collection of Chinese materia medica (c. 1870) at the Utrecht University Museum in Utrecht, the Netherlands, contains an original, handwritten catalogue, which was putatively ascribed to a Chinese medicine practitioner. It provides a detailed record of the Chinese names, plant parts, preparations, and applications of the specimens contained in glass bottles, which probably reflects the physician's personal interpretation of Chinese medicine in Indonesia at the end of the 19th century. Such individual catalogues can reveal historical changes and regional variations in the use of traditional Chinese medicine, which can lead to a better understanding of the history and development of this field.
Aim of the study
We addressed the following questions: 1) What are the contents of the Westhoff catalogue? 2) What medicinal preparations and applications were recorded in the catalogue, and which ones are dominant? 3) How similar is the use of Chinese materia medica in Westhoff catalogue compared to the modern Chinese Pharmacopeia? 4) What other specific information is contained in the Westhoff catalogue?
Materials and methods
The catalogue had been digitized previously, and all handwritten Dutch text has been transcribed and translated into English. The information for each entry was summarized and analyzed, the medicinal applications were compared to modern Chinese pharmacopeia or other monographs on Chinese materia medica.
Results
The catalogue contains 436 entries, for which 395 corresponding specimens still exist in the Westhoff collection of Chinese materia medica. Each entry contains a serial number, a Chinese name, a phonetic Dutch transcription of the Chinese name, a description of the plant, animal, or mineral origin of the medicinal product, the preparation method, and the medical indication for which it should be used. The dominant preparation method is decoction (79% of the entries). The most frequently mentioned applications are fever, skin diseases, strengthening and wounds. Around 80% of the medicinal applications in the catalogue were also listed for the same CMM in modern monographs. The catalogue also sheds light on typical characteristics of popular medicine, their geographic origin, and social aspects of traditional Chinese medicine in Indonesia around 1870.
Conclusions
The Westhoff catalogue is a valuable record of Chinese materia medica and its practice in a specific time and space. It reflects an individual physician's interpretation of Chinese medicine, shows the difficulties in the interpretation of cultural-bound health issues between the Dutch and the Chinese, and provides evidence that traditional Chinese medicine spread not only in East Asia but also to the distant Western world.}

abstract = {In 1988, the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) defined essential procedural skills in nephrology, and candidates for ABIM certification were required to present evidence of possessing the skills necessary for placement of temporary dialysis vascular access, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and percutaneous renal biopsy. In 1996, continuous renal replacement therapy was added to the list of nephrology requirements. These procedure requirements have not been modified since 1996 while the practice of nephrology has changed dramatically. In March 2021, the ABIM Nephrology Board embarked on a policy journey to revise the procedure requirements for nephrology certification. With the guidance of nephrology diplomates, training program directors, professional and patient organizations, and other stakeholders, the ABIM Nephrology Board revised the procedure requirements to reflect current practice and national priorities. The approved changes include the Opportunity to Train standard for placement of temporary dialysis catheters, percutaneous kidney biopsies, and home hemodialysis which better reflects the current state of training in most training programs, and the new requirements for home dialysis therapies training will align with the national priority to address the underuse of home dialysis therapies. This perspective details the ABIM process for considering changes to the certification procedure requirements and how ABIM collaborated with the larger nephrology community in considering revisions and additions to these requirements.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Generic medications are cost-effective without compromising therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate, using a cross-sectional study design, the factors influencing Saudi Arabian consumers' preferences between innovator and generic medications.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was carried out in Saudi Arabia using a Google survey form. For data collection, a simple random sampling strategy was used. The recruited participants were surveyed using a validated questionnaire that focused on six influencing domains: physician, pharmacist, perceived effectiveness, price, information availability, and confidence based on prior experience. The obtained data was used to analyze factors that have an association with any of the six domains using multinomial regression analysis. A correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between domains.
Results
The 317 participants included 64.4 % females, 52 % aged ≥ 26, and a large proportion of Saudi nationals (82.6 %) and university graduates (78.9 %). Being employed (OR:3.029; P = 0.006; CI: 6.715–1.366), a healthcare providers (OR:2.298; P = 0.043; CI: 5.151–1.025), and having insurance coverage (OR:1.908; P = 0.017; CI: 3.245–1.122) had a greater influence on medication selection. Participants with linguistic and business educational backgrounds (OR:3.443; P = 0.022; CI: 9.950–1.191), those living in the northern region of Saudi Arabia (OR:3.174; P = 0.009; CI: 7.585–1.328), having chronic ailments (OR:3.863; P = 0.013; CI: 11.274–1.324), and possess insurance (OR:1.748; P = 0.039; CI: 2.971–1.028) get readily influenced by pharmacist. People who were married and lived in Saudi Arabia's southern region were influenced by perceived effectiveness when choosing medicine. Participants from the northern region were found to be influenced by the price of the medicines, information about the medicines, and confidence based on previous experience. The price of medicines has a significant impact on those suffering from chronic diseases. At a significant level of P = 0.01, all six influencing domains were found to be positively correlated with each other.
Conclusion
The study shows that healthcare providers, drug prices, perceived efficacy, and information availability all have a big influence on the Saudi Arabian population's choice of medications.Educational background, location, and chronic disease status are associated with several influencing domains. Aside from public awareness campaigns, healthcare professionals should be involved in the implementation of the generic medication policy.}
