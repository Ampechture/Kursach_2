abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), traditionally recognized as a noxious gas with a pungent odor, has emerged as a fascinating metabolite originating from proteinaceous foods. This review provides a comprehensive examination of H2S regulatory metabolism in cell. Dysregulation of cellular processes plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. Recent development explores the chemistry of biosynthesis and degradation of H2S in cells. The consequences of dysregulation causing diseases and the emerging role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) modulation as a promising therapeutic platform has not been explored much. These disturbances can manifest as oxidative stress, inflammation, and aberrant cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the development and progression of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. Hydrogen sulfide has gained recognition as a key player in cellular regulation. H2S is involved in numerous physiological processes, including vasodilation, inflammation control, and cytoprotection. Recent advances in research have focused on modulating H2S levels to restore cellular balance and mitigate disease progression. This approach involves both exogenous H2S donors and inhibitors of H2S -producing enzymes. By harnessing the versatile properties of H2S, researchers and clinicians may develop innovative therapies that address the root causes of dysregulation-induced diseases. As our understanding of H2S biology deepens, the potential for precision medicine approaches tailored to specific diseases becomes increasingly exciting, holding the promise of improved patient outcomes and a new era in therapeutics.}

abstract = {Objective
Appraisal of treatment outcomes in integrative medicine is a challenge due to a gap between the concepts of Western medicine (WM) disease and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome. This study presents an approach for the appraisal of integrative medicine that is based on targeted metabolomics. We use non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with spleen deficiency syndrome as a test case.
Methods
A patient-reported outcome (PRO) scale was developed based on literature review, Delphi consensus survey, and reliability and validity test, to quantitatively evaluate spleen deficiency syndrome. Then, a metabonomic foundation for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with spleen deficiency syndrome was identified via a longitudinal interventional trial and targeted metabolomics. Finally, an integrated appraisal model was established by identifying metabolites that responded in the treatment of WM disease and TCM syndrome as positive outcomes and using other aspects of the metabonomic foundation as independent variables.
Results
Ten symptoms and signs were included in the spleen deficiency PRO scale. The internal reliability, content validity, discriminative validity and structural validity of the scale were all qualified. Based on treatment responses to treatments for WM disease (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) or TCM syndrome (spleen deficiency PRO scale score) from a previous randomized controlled trial, two cohorts comprised of 30 participants each were established for targeted metabolomics detection. Twenty-five metabolites were found to be involved in successful treatment outcomes to both WM and TCM, following quantitative comparison and multivariate analysis. Finally, the model of the integrated appraisal system was exploratively established using binary logistic regression; it included 9 core metabolites and had the prediction probability of 83.3%.
Conclusion
This study presented a new and comprehensive research route for integrative appraisal of treatment outcomes for WM disease and TCM syndrome. Critical research techniques used in this research included the development of a TCM syndrome assessment tool, a longitudinal interventional trial with verified TCM treatment, identification of homogeneous metabolites, and statistical modeling.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chronic relapsing ulcerative colitis (CRUC) is classified as an inflammatory bowel disease, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recognized for its therapeutic benefits in treating CRUC. According to TCM principles, the prevailing syndromes in CRUC are yang deficiency and dampness stagnation (YDDS). The objective of this study is to establish a novel animal model of CRUC exhibiting the YDDS syndrome.
Methods
Initially, the rats were administered hydrocortisone succinate sodium through subcutaneous injection, followed by the administration of senna folium granule solution. Subsequently, the rats underwent three cycles of dextran sulfate sodium solution ingestion.
Results
Upon completion of the modeling process, it was observed that the disease activity index, colonic mucosal damage index score, colon weight/length ratio, colonic histopathology score, and tissue damage index scores of the model rats were elevated, while the colon length and spleen index exhibited a decrease compared to the control group. The pathological alterations in the model rats included the presence of shallow or deep ulcers and acute or chronic inflammation throughout the process of CRUC modeling. Additionally, our findings indicate a correlation between the proximity of the ulcer to the anal verge, the severity of the lesion, and the presence of precancerous glands, glandular disappearance, crypt abscesses, and tissue destruction. Furthermore, the expression levels of IL6, IL10, IFNG, and TNFA in the colon tissues were significantly elevated in the model rats compared to the control group. Notably, the end-stage lesions observed in CRUC exhibited greater severity when compared to those observed in cases of acute ulcerative colitis.
Discussion
In conclusion, we have successfully developed a rat model of CRUC with YDDS syndrome, which can be utilized to investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of TCM in treating CRUC.}

Psychological and psychiatric care is a core domain of palliative care. Despite a high burden of mental health comorbidity among individuals with serious illness, the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education gives little guidance about training hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) fellows in this domain of care. Currently, there is a lack of empiric data on HPM physician fellowship training in mental health topics.
Objectives
To characterize HPM physician fellowship training practices in the psychological and psychiatric aspects of palliative care.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey study querying HPM fellowship training directors nationally.
Results
A total of 95 programs participated (51% response rate). A total of 98% programs offered didactics on mental health topics. Topics universally deemed as important by program directors were commonly taught, but there was variability in both the perceived importance and the didactic coverage of several topics. Only 15% of programs offered core rotations in psychiatry. Most programs offered psychiatry electives, but such electives were only rarely utilized by fellows. Interdisciplinary team (IDT) rounds infrequently included doctoral mental health clinicians.
Conclusions
Beyond a few commonly identified and taught key topics, there is variability in clinical and didactic exposure to mental health training among HPM fellowships. Standardizing key learning objectives and guiding educators in how to achieve these objectives could improve the preparedness of the physician workforce in HPM to meet the mental health needs of patients with serious illness.}

abstract = {Objectives
Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been shown to be effective in autoimmune rheumatic diseases, but harmful herb-drug interactions might be inherent. We aim to review the evidence regarding herb-drug interactions between immunosuppressive drugs used in autoimmune rheumatic diseases and CHM.
Methods
We searched PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL from inception till 30 April 2023 using keywords that encompassed ‘herb-drug interactions’, ‘herbs’ and ‘immunosuppressants’. Articles were included if they contained reports about interactions between immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases with CHM. Level of evidence for each pair of interaction was graded using the algorithm developed by Colalto.
Results
A total of 65 articles and 44 unique pairs of interactions were identified. HDIs were reported for cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolic acid, glucocorticoids, sulfasalazine, tofacitinib and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Among these, cyclosporine (n = 27, 41.5%) and tacrolimus (n = 19, 29.2%) had the highest number of documented interactions. Hypericum perforatum had the highest level of evidence of interaction with cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Consumption reduced the bioavailability and therapeutic effects of the drugs. Schisandra sphenanthera had the highest level of evidence of interaction with tacrolimus and increased the bioavailability of the drug. Majority of the articles were animal studies.
Conclusion
Overall level of evidence for the included studies were low, though interactions between cyclosporine, tacrolimus, Hypericum perforatum and Schisandra sphenanthera were the most and well-documented. Healthcare professionals should actively enquire about the concurrent use of CHM in patients, especially when drugs with a narrow therapeutic index are consumed.}

The global attention to the capacities of traditional medicine for alleviating the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 has been growing. The present trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a Persian herbal medicine formula among patients with COVID-19.
Methods
The present trial was conducted in Afzalipour hospital, Kerman, Iran, from June to September 2020. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomly divided into intervention (Persian herbal medicine formula + routine treatment) or control (only routine treatment) groups. The intervention group received both capsule number 1 and 2 every 8 hours for 7 days. Capsule number 1 contained extract of the Glycyrrhiza glabra, Punica granatum, and Rheum palmatum, and the second capsule was filled by Nigella sativa powder. Participants were followed up to 7 days. The primary outcome was the number of hospitalization days, while cough, fever, and respiratory rate, days on oxygen (O2) therapy, and mortality rate were considered as the secondary outcomes.
Results
Eighty-two patients were enrolled to the study, while 79 cases completed the trial and their data were analyzed (mean age: 59.1 ± 17.1 years). Based on the results, the Persian medicine formula decreased the mean hospitalization days, so that the mean difference of length of hospitalization as primary outcome was 2.95 ± 0.43 days. A significant clinical improvement was observed regarding dyspnea, need for O2) therapy, and respiratory rate in the intervention group. No adverse effects were reported.
Conclusion
The present study supported the use of the Persian medicine formula as an adjuvant therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Plants are a natural treasure trove; their secondary metabolites participate in several pharmacological processes, making them a crucial component in the synthesis of novel pharmaceuticals and serving as a reserve resource foundation in this process. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with the risk of progression to hepatitis and liver cancer. The “Treatise on Febrile Diseases,” “Compendium of Materia Medica,” and “Thousand Golden Prescriptions” have listed herbal remedies to treat liver diseases.
Aim of the review
Chinese herbal medicines have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD owing to their efficacy and low side effects. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during NAFLD, and the impact and potential mechanism of ROS on the pathogenesis of NAFLD are discussed in this review. Furthermore, common foods and herbs that can be used to prevent NAFLD, as well as the structure-activity relationships and potential mechanisms, are discussed.
Methods
Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI database, Google Scholar, and WanFang database were searched for natural products that have been used to treat or prevent NAFLD in the past five years. The primary search was performed using the following keywords in different combinations in full articles: NAFLD, herb, natural products, medicine, and ROS. More than 400 research papers and review articles were found and analyzed in this review.
Results
By classifying and discussing the literature, we obtained 86 herbaceous plants, 28 of which were derived from food and 58 from Chinese herbal medicines. The mechanism of NAFLD was proposed through experimental studies on thirteen natural compounds (quercetin, hesperidin, rutin, curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, salvianolic acid B, paeoniflorin, ginsenoside Rg1, ursolic acid, berberine, honokiol, emodin). The occurrence and progression of NAFLD could be prevented by natural antioxidants through several pathways to prevent ROS accumulation and reduce hepatic cell injuries caused by excessive ROS.
Conclusion
This review summarizes the natural products and routinely used herbs (prescription) in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Firstly, the mechanisms by which natural products improve NAFLD through antioxidant pathways are elucidated. Secondly, the potential of traditional Chinese medicine theory in improving NAFLD is discussed, highlighting the safety of food-medicine homology and the broader clinical potential of multi-component formulations in improving NAFLD.

Methods
A multicenter observational cohort study was conducted to evaluate the competency-based milestone evaluation designed by the Taiwan Society of Internal Medicine in 2019. The evaluation was based on the ACGME-accredited milestone ratings. Periodic evaluation of milestone achievements of R1 and PGY2, who entered the internal medicine residency training at six medical centers, was performed. Each resident was evaluated every 3 months.
Results
Among the 98 R1 enrolled in 2019, substantial improvement in sub-competencies, including skill in performing procedures (Patient Care 4), clinical knowledge (Medical Knowledge 1), knowledge of diagnostic testing and procedures (Medical Knowledge 2), and identify impact the cost of health care and practices cost-effective care (Systems Based Practice 3) during the two years of training. Among the 107 R1 and 46 PGY2 enrolled in 2020, no significant difference in baseline milestone ratings was observed. However, the milestone assessments of R1 in 2020 showed improvement in nearly all sub-competencies compared with the stationary status of PGY2 in 2020.

abstract = {Background
As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread throughout countries, researchers and scientific groups have published a large number of scientific papers examining effective treatments and prevention strategies for COVID-19, including herbal medicine. It has become difficult to navigate the increasing volume of scientific material on the pandemic, and critical appraisal of these outcomes is needed. This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) aims to synthesize evidence from SRs and summarize the effects of herbal medicine interventions in the treatment of COVID-19.
Methods
Four databases were searched from inception up to October 20, 2021. SRs analyzing primary studies of the efficacy of herbal medications for treating COVID-19 were included. Two reviewers selected the studies and retrieved the data independently. The AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included SRs.
Results
A total of 21 SRs on herbal medicine treatments for COVID-19 were included. All SRs were published between May 2020 and September 2021. Thirteen of the SRs included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), whereas the remaining eight included evidence from nonrandomized trials in addition to RCTs, with a significant overlap identified across the RCTs. Twelve SRs concluded that existing evidence was insufficient to form a definite judgment, nine found that herbal therapy was useful, and none indicated that herbal medicine had no benefit. The AMSTAR 2 tool revealed that the methodological quality of the included SRs was generally low.
Conclusion
In this overview of SRs, we reviewed herbal medicine-related evidence from 21 SRs that were published after the outbreak of COVID-19. This study shows that while there is considerable evidence demonstrating the advantages of herbal medicine interventions, the quality of the evidence is inadequate to provide solid and accurate judgments about the effectiveness of herbal medicine therapies for COVID-19. Despite the crisis caused by the pandemic, clinical studies and SRs should comply with established methodological standards.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed at culturally adapting pan-Canadian Oncology Symptom Triage and Remote Support (COSTaRS) Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) Practice Guide to enable its use in China. This article focuses on presenting the key cultural adaptation step: supplementing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) nursing recommendations for CRF symptom management according to evidence.
Methods
Guided by A Guideline Adaptation and Implementation Planning Resource (CAN-IMPLEMENT), the process for cultural adaptation of the CRF guide in the COSTaRS project included translation, expert committee review, acceptability and feasibility assessment, and targeted adaptation to include TCM nursing techniques for CRF management via the Delphi method.
Results
First, an expert committee of nurses, nurse leaders, and researchers was established. The practice guide was translated and verified by the members of the expert committee. Nurses then rated the practice guide for acceptability and feasibility. Concurrently, 83 stakeholders (nurses and patients) identified five relevant TCM nursing techniques: acupuncture, moxibustion, acupressure therapy, Taijiquan, and auricular acupoint embedding. A systematic review of literature identified three clinical practice guidelines and four systematic reviews. Through two rounds of Delphi expert consultation, five TCM care strategies were added into the culturally adapted COSTaRS practice guide.
Conclusions
Cultural adaptation of the Canadian CRF practice guide involved not only language translation but also the addition of relevant TCM evidence. Combining TCM evidence and the Delphi method was a novel aspect of the cultural adaptation process. Further research is needed to investigate the implementation of the guide in appropriate settings in China.}

abstract = {Background
Binafuxi granules are a traditional Uighur medicine (TUM) for treating the common cold with fever. However, high-quality clinical studies supporting its efficacy and safety are lacking.
Methods
In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial, patients with common cold and fever were randomly assigned to a high-dose group, low-dose group, and placebo group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Outcomes were time to fever relief, time to fever clearance, proportion of afebrile patients, time to symptom disappearance, rate of symptom disappearance, effective rate, emergency drug usage and safety assessment.
Results
A total of 235 patients were recruited. Of these, 234 were included in the full analysis set (FAS), and 217 were included in the per-protocol set (PPS). In the FAS analysis, the median time to fever relief was 6.00 h, 5.54 h and 10.65 h (P = 0.31) in the high-dose group, low-dose group and placebo group, respectively. The median time to fever clearance was 18.29 h, 20.08 h and 25.00 h (P = 0.0018), respectively, and the proportion of afebrile patients was 92.4%, 89.7% and 71.4% (P = 0.0002), respectively. There was a significant difference in the disappearance time and disappearance rate of all symptoms and of individual symptoms. No serious adverse events were found.
Conclusions
Binafuxi granules can dose-dependently shorten the fever course and improve clinical symptoms in patients suffering from the common cold with fever.
Trial Registration
This trial was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IIR-17013379).}

To clarify the underlying immune-related cellular and molecular mechanisms, current biomedical research is increasingly focusing on “transplantomics” which relies on a huge quantity of big data deriving from genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics platforms. The AlloMap (gene expression) and the AlloSure (donor-derived cell-free DNA) tests represent two successful examples of how omics and liquid biopsy can really improve the precision medicine of heart and kidney transplantation. One of the major challenges in translating big data in clinically useful biomarkers is the integration and interpretation of the different layers of omics datasets. Network Medicine offers advanced bioinformatic-molecular strategies which were widely used to integrate large omics datasets and clinical information in end-stage patients to prioritize potential biomarkers and drug targets. The application of network-oriented approaches to clarify the complex nature of graft rejection is still in its infancy. Here, we briefly discuss the real-life clinical applications derived from omics datasets as well as novel opportunities for establishing predictive tests in solid organ transplantation. Also, we provide an original “graft rejection interactome” and propose network-oriented strategies which can be useful to improve precision medicine of solid organ transplantation.}

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) consists of various medical practices and products not recognized as a part of conventional medicine. There are few studies on CAMs used for childhood epilepsy. We aimed to determine the prevalence and socio-demographic factors affecting CAM use in children with epilepsy.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional prospective descriptive study. The study included all parents who agreed to participate and had children with epilepsy. The data was collected using a questionnaire developed from a literature review of CAM use in pediatric epilepsy patients.
Results
A total of 219 parent–child pairs were included in the study. Seventy-five participants had one or more comorbid disorders. 55.3% of participating children with epilepsy were taking more than one antiseizure medication (ASM). 30.1% of parents reported using some form of CAM for their children in the previous year. Only 60.6% of parents discussed their CAM decision with their child's doctor before using it. Univariate analysis showed that the patient's age, presence of comorbid disorders, duration of ASM, and family history of epilepsy were statistically significant predictors for CAM use. However, the presence of comorbidities was the only significant predictor of CAM use in logistic regression.
Conclusion
Even though most parents believe CAMs have no effect on their children with epilepsy, they frequently use them. We propose that the predictors identified in this study can help to identify potential CAM users. Since most parents do not report the use of CAM, physicians should routinely inquire about CAM use.}

Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is commonly used to reveal an underling arrhythmia in stroke patients and can influence treatment and prognosis. While many patients with stroke are admitted to the internal medicine department, evidence for the role of Holter ECG in this setting is scarce.
Objective
determine the diagnostic value of Holter ECG monitoring for evaluation of stroke in internal medicine department.
Methods
We included consecutive patients admitted to one of nine internal medicine departments in a tertiary center between 2018 and 2021, who completed a 24-hour Holter ECG as part of the evaluation of stroke. The primary outcome was a diagnostic Holter monitoring with recording of a new atrial fibrillation or flutter, not evident in previous ECG.
Results
271 patients completed a Holter monitoring for the evaluation of stroke. Four patients (1.5%) met the primary outcome, and anticoagulation treatment was initiated for all of them. Accordingly, the number needed to change decision was 67. Two additional patients (0.7%) had a non-diagnostic Holter finding which effected treatment plan. Mean time from hospital admission to Holter was 3.01 ±3.44 days, and longer time to Holter initiation correlated with a longer hospital stay duration (r (270) =0.692, p<0.001).
Conclusion
Conducting a routine Holter ECG monitorig for hospitalized patients with stroke in the internal medicine department carry a negligible yield, and may result in an extended hospitalization with possible harm.}

Early prediction of cardiovascular events can reduce the incidence of acute myocardial infarction and decrease the mortality rates of patients with CVDs. The pathological mechanisms and multiple factors involved in CVDs are complex; thus, traditional data analysis is insufficient and inefficient to manage multidimensional data for the risk prediction of CVDs and heart attacks, medical image interpretations, therapeutic decision-making, and disease prognosis prediction. Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used for treating CVDs. TCM offers unique theoretical and practical applications in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. Big data have been generated to investigate the scientific basis of TCM diagnostic methods. TCM formulae contain multiple herbal items. Elucidating the complicated interactions between the active compounds and network modulations requires advanced data-analysis capability. Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) technology has allowed these challenges to be resolved, which significantly facilitates the development of integrative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CVDs and the understanding of the therapeutic principles of TCM formulae. Herein, we briefly introduce the basic concept and current progress of AI and machine learning (ML) technology, and summarize the applications of advanced AI and ML for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. Furthermore, we review the progress of AI and ML technology for investigating the scientific basis of TCM diagnosis and treatment for CVDs. We expect the application of AI and ML technology to promote synergy between western medicine and TCM, which can then boost the development of integrative medicine for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs.}

The bidirectional property of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) was recorded in the classic work Medicine Origin (Yi Xue Qi Yuan) as early as the Jin and Yuan dynasties of ancient China. Since then, this imperative theory has been applied to guide the clinical application of TCMs. Studies have been performed to investigate this phenomenon only over the last three decades. A limited number of reviews on the bidirectional role of TCMs have been published, and almost all current studies are published in the Chinese language. Aim of the review: The aim of this review is to provide the first comprehensive evidence regarding the bidirectional effects and the underlying mechanisms of TCMs and their active compounds.
Materials and methods
Information relevant to opposing pharmacological activities or opposing properties exerted by TCM prescriptions, herbal medicines, and their active compound, as well as their mechanisms was summarized by searching Chinese and English databases, including the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Data, Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Wiley Online Library.
Results
Although the bidirectional regulation of TCMs has been applied in the clinic since ancient times in China, only limited reviews have been published in Chinese. The existing data showed that bidirectional effects can be found in TCM prescriptions, herbal medicines, and pure active compounds. Additionally, the bidirectional role of TCMs was primarily reported in the modulation of immune function, blood circulation and hemostasis, gastrointestinal motility, the central nervous system and blood pressure. This may because the therapeutic outcomes of these disorders are more obvious than those of other complicated diseases. Intriguingly, some herbal medicines have multiple bidirectional activities; for instance, Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer showed bidirectional regulation of immune function and the central nervous system; Astragalus membranaceus can bidirectionally regulate blood pressure and immune function; and Rheum officinale Baill exerts bidirectional effects on blood circulation and hemostasis, gastrointestinal motility and immune function. The mechanisms underlying the bidirectional effects of TCMs are largely attributed to the complexity of herbal constituents, dosage differences, the processing of herbal medicine, and compatibility of medicines, the physiological conditions of patients and adaptogenic effects.
Conclusion
Uncovering the bidirectional effects and mechanisms of TCMs is of great importance for both scientific research and clinical applications. This review may help to facilitate the recognition of the bidirectional role of TCMs, to explain some seemingly-opposite phenomena in the pharmacological study of herbal medicines and to provide guidance for TCM practitioners.}

Stingray envenomation is a common presenting complaint for coastal emergency departments in the United States. Currently, radiograph is the gold standard to evaluate for a retained stingray barb, but ultrasound may be a useful tool to detect retained barbs.
Objective
To determine if emergency medicine residents could use ultrasound to identify stingray barbs embedded in animal tissue models. A secondary objective was to determine if resident experience affected their ability to detect stingray barbs.
Methods
Thirty-two emergency medicine residents participated in the study. After a short didactic session on foreign body identification with ultrasound, they rotated through six simulation stations and were asked to identify whether a stingray barb was present in pig and chicken tissue models. They were given 2 min per model to identify the presence, size, and depth of a stingray barb. Pre- and postexperiment surveys were collected to assess the residents’ level of experience and confidence regarding foreign body identification using ultrasound.
Results
Residents accurately identified barbs in chicken drumsticks with a sensitivity of 72.92% (95% confidence interval [CI] 63.89–81.48) and a specificity of 64.58% (95% CI 54.16–74.08), and in pig's feet with a sensitivity of 50.00% (95% CI 39.62–60.38) and specificity of 68.75% (95% CI 58.48–77.82). There was no statistically significant difference regarding accuracy for any outcome measured based on experience or level of training.
Conclusions
The use of point-of-care ultrasound by novice sonographers lacks sensitivity to identify retained stingray barbs in animal models and is not significantly impacted by resident experience with point-of-care ultrasound.}

However, most existing extractive summarization models often process academic articles with sentence classification models, which are hard to produce comprehensive summaries. To address this issue, we explore a new view to solve the extractive summarization of academic articles in natural sciences and medicine by taking it as a question-answering process. We propose a novel framework, MRC-Sum, where the extractive summarization for academic articles in natural sciences and medicine is cast as an MRC (Machine Reading Comprehension) task. To instantiate MRC-Sum, article-summary pairs in the summarization datasets are firstly reconstructed into (Question, Answer, Context) triples in the MRC task. Several questions are designed to cover the main aspects (e.g. Background, Method, Result, Conclusion) of the articles in natural sciences and medicine. A novel strategy is proposed to solve the problem of the non-existence of the ground truth answer spans. Then MRC-Sum is trained on the reconstructed datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. During the inference stage, four answer spans of the predefined questions are given by MRC-Sum and concatenated to form the final summary for each article. Experiments on three publicly available benchmarks, i.e., the Covid, PubMed, and arXiv datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of MRC-Sum. Specifically, MRC-Sum outperforms advanced extractive summarization baselines on the Covid dataset and achieves competitive results on the PubMed and arXiv datasets. We also propose a novel metric, COMPREHS, to automatically evaluate the comprehensiveness of the system summaries for academic articles in natural sciences and medicine. Abundant experiments are conducted and verified the reliability of the proposed metric. And the results of the COMPREHS metric show that MRC-Sum is able to generate more comprehensive summaries than the baseline models.}

Methods
Randomized controlled trials on the use of Kampo medicines for cancer supportive care and the descriptions of Kampo medicines in clinical practice guidelines were reviewed.
Results
Kampo medicines potentially ameliorate refractory symptoms in cancer patients. For example, hochuekkito, juzentaihoto, and ninjin'yoeito seem to be efficacious for fatigue/general malaise. Potential use of rikkunshito for anorexia/cancer cachexia and goshajinkigan for peripheral neuropathy is proposed from small numbers of randomized controlled trials in addition to basic research. The number of clinical practice guidelines which contain descriptions of Kampo medicines is increasing in general, but only a few in the area of cancer supportive care.
Conclusion
Kampo medicines potentially play some roles in preventing or ameliorating side effects of anticancer agents. Supportive care with Kampo medicines for patients with cancer might lead to physical, mental, and nutritional improvement.}

Many researchers have adopted resolving phlegm and unblocking fu-organs (RPUF) therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and yielded beneficial results in terms of clinical symptoms. However, there has been no systematically pooled analysis of RPUF therapy for AIS to date. Therefore, a well-designed systematic review and meta-analysis is necessary.
Aim
This systematic review aims to determine the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy for resolving phlegm and unblocking fu-organs (RPUF) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
Methods
Eight databases were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving RPUF therapy for AIS. The primary outcome included the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and the secondary outcomes were the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Neurological Deficit Score (NDS), Barthel Index (BI), Fugel-Meyer assessment (FMA), and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used to assess risk of bias. The quantitative synthesis was analyzed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0 software.

The systematic review and meta-analysis comprised 61 RCTs with a total of 6056 participants. RPUF prescriptions combined with usual care were superior to usual care alone in individuals with AIS, as evidenced by decreased mRS (MD＝−0.34; 95%CI [−0.65, −0.03]; P＝0.03), NIHSS (MD＝−3.38; 95%CI [−4.07, −2.68]; P＜0.00001), and NDS (MD＝−3.65; 95%CI [−4.07, −3.24]; P＜0.00001), as well as improved BI (MD＝10.4; 95%CI [8.21, 12.59]; P＜0.00001), FMA (MD＝20.41; 95%CI [17.40, 23.41]; P＜0.00001), and GCS (MD＝3.08; 95%CI [1.95, 4.20]; P＜0.00001). No significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse effects between the RPUF therapy group and the usual care group.
Conclusion
RPUF therapy appears to be an effective and safe approach for treating AIS; it could decrease mRS, NIHSS, and NDS while improving BI, FMA, and GCS. However, the methodological quality of the included RCTs was far from sufficient, and further high-quality, well-designed RCTs with long-term follow-up are still required.}

Medical scepticism is on the rise worldwide. It is very important to differentiate between uneducated scepticism (e.g. the anti-vaccination movement) where valuable areas of medicine are disputed and well-informed scepticism, where legitimate experts reveal flaws in mainstream medicine. It is assumed that medicine being a science will be self-correcting and inevitably move towards a stronger evidence-base, but a competing factor is the profit motive. Three excellent books are reviewed, all Australian and all covering primarily musculoskeletal medicine (Back Up by Mannix; Surgery: The Ultimate Placebo and Hippocrasy by Harris and Buchbinder). These texts reveal that musculoskeletal medicine has many treatments where the desire to offer hope and, also, make a profit is taking precedence over scientific evidence. Because many healthcare presentations of young people are musculoskeletal, doctors risk losing the younger generation to medical scepticism in general if they continue to offer and promote flawed treatment options over effective ones. The most effective long-term treatments in musculoskeletal medicine (exercise load management and psychological reassurance) are less profitable because they require so much time investment. Health care professionals need to be true to their science background and aim to do only what is effective, not be drawn to drugs and procedures that are more profitable but ultimately more harmful.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study investigated the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of healthcare workers related to hospital infection in Chinese medicine hospitals in Hunan Province. We analyzed the influencing factors and made rational suggestions to improve the healthcare workers’ ability for hospital infection prevention and control in Chinese medicine hospitals based on knowledge, beliefs, and action models.
Methods
The survey participants were selected using multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling. In the first stage, 14 tertiary-level hospitals and 42 tertiary-level hospitals in Hunan Province were selected, and 56 TCM hospitals at provincial, municipal, and county levels were finally covered. In the second stage, 2253 Medical personnel were selected as survey participants from January 2022 to January 2023. The network questionnaire was used to investigate the current knowledge, attitude, and behavior of hospital infection prevention and control by self-compiled questionnaire.
Results
According to the self-prepared questionnaire, the survey results show that 2253 Medical personnel scored 35.88 ± 8.96, 98.12 ± 24.61, and 112.27 ± 6.31 on knowledge, attitude, and behavior regarding hospital infection prevention and control, respectively. There was a linear relationship between knowledge and sex, age, working years, education level, job title, and position, with working experience having the greatest influence. There was a linear relationship between attitudes and working years, education level, job title, position, and hospital level, with working experience having the greatest influence. There was a linear relationship between attitudes and sex, age, working years, education level, job title, and hospital level, with education level having the greatest influence.
Conclusions
The knowledge reserve of medical staff in TCM hospitals should be improved. The level of awareness of nosocomial infection prevention when using traditional Chinese medicine techniques is low. Therefore, training is required to strengthen and enhance awareness regarding hospital infection prevention and control among healthcare workers in traditional Chinese medicine hospitals. Moreover, there is a need to adopt stratified management training for healthcare workers of different ages and educational levels, especially to regulate the behavior of junior healthcare workers.}

Such incidents may multiply and further develop the provocative response. Over the past 15 years, various classes of secondary metabolites that were isolated from plant and marine sources have been described as natural cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. The majority of natural COX inhibitors could be used as a selective therapeutic agent for complementary medicine and clinical applications. Currently, the inflammation is commonly treated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), several medications of which, however, have been linked to renal and gastrointestinal side effects. A variety of inhibitors of COX-2 that are selective (celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib and others) have been designed as NSAIDs mostly with enhanced stomach safety profiles. This helps to improve the compliance and functions in the geriatric patients as they have so many complications and problems associated with the diseases. The use of complementary medicine in combination with clinical therapy might give better results than medicine alone. Some disease condition like cancer which shows the COX-2 expressions could also have treatment related problems in such cases the selective inhibitors used as a complementary medicine. On the other hand, elevated cardiovascular risks have brought increasing worries about the safety of using specific inhibitors of COX-2. This current review focuses on how quinoline heterocycle was used for creation of inhibitors of COX-2 since 2009 along with its clinical significance in complementary medicine. These agents included the variety of substituents on the ring or ring attached to other heterocycles. As a result, the quinoline heterocycle will be used for creating and finding anti-inflammatory COX-2 medicines.}

abstract = {Objective
Transition to adult health care for adolescents and young adults (AYAs), especially those with chronic conditions, is a critical time. Medical trainees lack competency in providing transition care, but little is known about the factors contributing to the development of health care transition (HCT) knowledge, attitudes, and practice. This study examines how Internal Medicine-Pediatrics (Med-Peds) programs and institutional HCT champions influence trainee HCT knowledge, attitudes, and practices.
Study Design
A 78-item electronic survey regarding the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of caring for AYA patients was sent to trainees from 11 graduate medical institutions.
Results
A total of 149 responses were analyzed, including 83 from institutions with Med-Peds programs and 63 from institutions without Med-Peds programs. Trainees with an institutional Med-Peds Program were more likely to identify an institutional HCT champion (odds ratio, 10.67; 95% confidence interval, 2.40–47.44; p = .002). The mean HCT knowledge scores and use of a routine, standardized HCT tools were higher in trainees with an institutional HCT champion. Trainees without an institutional Med-Peds program experienced more barriers to HCT education. Trainees with institutional HCT champions or Med-Peds programs reported greater comfort in providing transition education and using validated, standardized transition tools.
Discussion
The presence of a Med-Peds residency program was associated with a greater likelihood of a visible institutional HCT champion. Both factors were associated with increased HCT knowledge, positive attitudes, and HCT practices. Both clinical champions and adoption of Med-Peds program curricula will enhance HCT training within graduate medical education.}

Ayurveda is the main traditional healthcare system in Indian medicine. Tibetan medicine (TM), Mongolian medicine (MM), Buddhist medicine (BM), Dai medicine (DM), and Uyghur medicine (UM) are main traditional medicines practiced in China. These are existing traditional medical systems that still play a role in disease prevention and treatment.
Aim of the study
To reveal the similarities and differences of traditional medicinal preparations between Ayurveda in India and five traditional medicines in China to deepen medical exchanges and cooperation between the two countries and beyond.
Methods
All preparations were extracted from statutory pharmacopoeias, ministry standards, and prescription textbooks from China and India. The information of each preparation, such as therapeutic uses, medicinal materials, and preparation forms, was recorded in Excel for statistical analysis and visual comparison.
Results
A total of 645 Ayurvedic preparations, 458 TM preparations, 164 MM preparations, 616 BM preparations, 227 DM preparations, and 94 UM preparations were identified. Preparations of the six traditional medicines were mostly used for treating digestive, respiratory, and urogenital system diseases. The preparation forms of these six traditional medicines are mainly pills and powders. There are 38 shared-use medicinal materials in Ayurveda and TM preparations, 25 in Ayurveda and MM preparations, 30 in Ayurveda and BM preparations, 39 in Ayurveda and DM preparations, and 31 in Ayurveda and UM preparations. Finally, we selected one important shared-use preparation (Triphala) and 51 medicinal materials to research traditional use and modern pharmacology.
Conclusions
These preparations are used by different prescribers and users of medicinal materials in different medical systems with the similarities and differences. The similarities may reflect the historical exchanges of traditional medicines between the two countries. The differences showed that traditional medicines in China have absorbed some theories, diagnoses, and treatments from Ayurveda but also retained their own ethnic and regional characteristics.}

Art. 50 of the proposal for a Regulation on the European Health Data Space (EHDS) states that “health data access bodies shall provide access to electronic health data only through a secure processing environment, with technical and organizational measures and security and interoperability requirements”.
Objective:
To identify specific security measures that nodes participating in health data spaces shall implement based on the results of the IMPaCT-Data project, whose goal is to facilitate the exchange of electronic health records (EHR) between public entities based in Spain and the secondary use of this information for precision medicine research in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Data and methods:
This article presents an analysis of 24 out of a list of 72 security measures identified in the Spanish National Security Scheme (ENS) and adopted by members of the federated data infrastructure developed during the IMPaCT-Data project.
Results:
The IMPaCT-Data case helps clarify roles and responsibilities of entities willing to participate in the EHDS by reconciling technical system notions with the legal terminology. Most relevant security measures for Data Space Gatekeepers, Enablers and Prosumers are identified and explained.
Conclusion:
The EHDS can only be viable as long as the fiduciary duty of care of public health authorities is preserved; this implies that the secondary use of personal data shall contribute to the public interest and/or to protect the vital interests of the data subjects. This condition can only be met if all nodes participating in a health data space adopt the appropriate organizational and technical security measures necessary to fulfill their role.}

1. Understand the value of consulting palliative medicine teams early when caring for patients with complex medical diseases. 2. Understand the utility of palliative medicine resources across different healthcare settings.
Key Message
Early initiation of Palliative Medicine consults from the emergency department leads to improved hospital quality metrics such as decreased hospital length of stay and higher hospice utilization.
Introduction
Many studies have demonstrated that early involvement of palliative medicine (PM) can lead to improved quality of life, optimized pain and symptom control and goal concordant care. During the pandemic, surge volumes and limited bed flow led to higher number of palliative medicine consults in the Emergency Department (ED).
Objective
Evaluate the impact of ED utilization of PM due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that early initiation of PM consults from the ED would lead to improved quality metrics.
Methods
We performed a retrospective review of monthly EMR-generated consult data. Average LOS was analyzed based on the unit where the order originated. Data was collected from January 2020 to May 2021.
Results
During winter 2020-2021 near one of the peaks of COVID, our hospital saw average admission levels of 2373 patients from the ED and an average bed wait time of 438 minutes. During that time, a total of 4,222 inpatient consults were placed for PM, 698 of which originated in the ED. This demonstrated favorable downstream metrics when PM was involved at the time of admission. Patients who received PM from the ED had an average LOS of 6.5 days compared to LOS of 12.12 days if the consult originated after being admitted to an acute care unit. Furthermore, patients who received PM consult in the ED had higher hospice utilization rates at discharge.
Conclusion
Early PM involvement in the ED led to improved quality metrics including reduced LOS as well increased hospice utilization. This supports the majority of patients’ preferences which is to experience end of life care outside the hospital. The supports the value palliative medicine provides by ensuring goal concordant care.

Guidelines for establishing MRLs are outlined by regulatory authorities that drug sponsors follow in each country. During the drug approval process, residue limits are targeted for specific animal species and matrices. Therefore, MRLs are commonly not established for other species. This study demonstrates unestablished MRLs can be reliably predicted for under-represented food commodity groups using machine learning (ML). Classification methods with imbalanced data were used to analyze MRL data from multiple countries by implementing resampling techniques in different ML classifiers. Afterward, we developed and evaluated a data-mining method for predicting unestablished MRLs. Seven different ML classifiers such as support vector classifier, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forest, decision tree, k-neighbors, Gaussian NB, and AdaBoost have been selected in this baseline study. Among these, the neural network MLP classifier reliably scored the highest average-weighted F1 score (accuracy >99% with markers and ≈88% without markets) in predicting unestablished MRLs. This provides the first study to apply ML algorithms in regulatory food animal medicine. By predicting and estimating MRLs, we can potentially decrease the use and cost of live animals and the overall research burden of determining new MRLs.}

Some anomalies of the cord have a higher prevalence than other fetal structural anomalies. The most common anomalies are the absence of an umbilical artery and velamentous insertion of the cord (with or without vasa previa). These anomalies, even when not associated with fetal structural defects, increase the risk of adverse perinatal outcome including, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth. In the absence of prenatal diagnosis, vasa previa is associated with the highest perinatal morbidity and mortality of all congenital anomalies of the umbilical cord. Most cases can be detected by ultrasound from the beginning of the second trimester and should be included in the routine mid-pregnancy ultrasound examination. Documentation should include cord insertion site, number of vessels in the cord, and if other pathologies have been detected. Pregnancies at increased risk of velamentous cord insertion should be screened for vasa previa using transvaginal ultrasound and colour Doppler imaging. If a velamentous cord insertion or isolated single umbilical artery is detected, individualised follow-up during pregnancy and tailored obstetric management are indicated.}

The selection of cancer medicines for national procurement requires deliberate evaluation of population benefit, budget impact, sustainability, and health system capacity. However, this process is complicated by numerous challenges, including the large volume and rapid pace of newly developed therapies offering marginal gains at prohibitively high prices. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) and Model List of Essential Medicines for Children (EMLc) have undergone a series of evidence-based updates to ensure recommended cancer medicines offer meaningful clinical benefit. This Health Policy paper describes how cancer medicines are listed on the EML and EMLc, including two updated WHO processes: (1) the formation of the Cancer Medicines Working Group, and (2) additional selection principles for recommending cancer medicines, including a minimum overall survival benefit of 4–6 months with improvement to quality of life compared with standard treatment. These updates, along with proposals to include formal price considerations, additional selection criteria, and multisectoral collaboration (eg, voluntary licensing) promote procurement of high-value essential cancer medicines on national formularies in the context of supporting sustainable health systems to achieve universal health coverage.}

This article aims to review the literature published mainly from 2010 to 2022, focusing on the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects. It has been found that unabsorbed TCMPs can exert local pharmacological effects in the gut, including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, regulation of intestinal flora, modulation of intestinal immunity, and maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity. Unabsorbed TCMPs can also produce systemic pharmacological effects, such as anti-tumor activity and immune system modulation, by regulating intestinal flora and immunity. Conversely, some TCMPs can be absorbed and distributed to various tissues, especially the liver, where they exhibit tissue-protecting effects against inflammation and oxidative stress-induced damage and improve glucose and lipid metabolism. In future studies, it is important to improve quality control and experimental design. Furthermore, research on enhancing the oral bioavailability of TCMPs, exploring the activity of TCMP metabolites, investigating pharmacokinetic interactions between TCMPs and oral drugs, and developing oral drug delivery systems using TCMPs holds great significance.}

Health-seeking behavior has a direct impact on individual's health. A proper understanding of patients' demographics and health factors is essential in constructing high-quality health care services toward Chinese or Western medicine. The objective of this study was to understand the tendency among Taiwanese to opt for either Chinese or Western medicine when both services are available.
Materials and methods
This study was based on the analysis of secondary data. A total of 13,151 individuals with an age of 30 years or more were selected from the Taiwan Biobank Research Database in Taiwan. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with health-seeking behaviors toward Chinese or Western medicine.
Results
Among all the participants, 50.8% showed a greater tendency to seek Western medicine treatment, while 10.4% showed a preference for Chinese medicine treatment. Main drivers for a Chinese medicine health-seeking behavior were women, hypotension, low income, normal HbA1c, normal total cholesterol, and yang deficiency. The preference for Western medicine treatment was associated mainly with men, an older age, a married status, lower income, a lower education, an abnormal cholesterol level, and the absence of stasis.
Conclusion
Healthcare providers should understand the factors associated with health-seeking behavior and refer patients to their desired treatment.}

Pilot studies to overcome such problems using regenerative medicine (RM) delivered promising data. Comprehensive investigations of RM in zebrafish or reptilians are necessary for better understanding. However, the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood despite the tremendous amount of data obtained using the zebrafish model investigating the exact mechanisms behind their regenerative capability. Indeed, understanding such mechanisms and their application to humans can save millions of lives from dying due to potentially life-threatening events. Recent studies have launched a revolution in replacing damaged human organs via different approaches in the last few decades. The newly established branch of medicine (known as Regenerative Medicine aims to enhance natural repair mechanisms. This can be done through the application of several advanced broad-spectrum technologies such as organ transplantation, tissue engineering, and application of Scaffolds technology (support vascularization using an extracellular matrix), stem cell therapy, miRNA treatment, development of 3D mini-organs (organoids), and the construction of artificial tissues using nanomedicine and 3D bio-printers. Moreover, in the next few decades, revolutionary approaches in regenerative medicine will be applied based on artificial intelligence and wireless data exchange, soft intelligence biomaterials, nanorobotics, and even living robotics capable of self-repair. The present work presents a comprehensive overview that summarizes the new and future advances in the field of RM.}

The objective of this study is to explore the clinical effect and safety of Zhuang medicine herbal-thread moxibustion therapy for the treatment of suboptimal health status-related insomnia through a randomized clinical trial.
Methods
A total number of 60 patients with insomnia of suboptimal health status (SHS) were enrolled from the Clinic of Zhuang Medicine, Renai Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine and the Clinic of Zhuang Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, as well as Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine. According to the random number table method, they were randomized into a Zhuang medicine herbal-thread moxibustion therapy group (30 patients) and a western medication group (30 partients).The outcome assessors were blinded for patients allocation. In the herbal-thread moxibustion group, Zhuang medicine herbal-thread moxibustion therapy was provided once daily. In the western medication group, alprazolam tablets were prescribed for oral administration once daily. One course consisted of 10 treatments. After three consecutive courses of treatment, the score of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) was compared between groups, and both clinical effect and safety were assessed.
Results
Sixty eligible patients were enrolled, and thirty were assigned to each group and included in the data analysis. After treatment, the score of each PSQI indicator (sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction) and total PSQI score were compared with those before treatment in both groups (all changes were statistically significant when P < 0.05). Scores in the herbal-thread moxibustion group were superior to those in the western medication group (all values were statistically significant at P < 0.05). The total effective rate was 93.3% in the herbal-thread moxibustion group and 80.0% in the western medication group (P < 0.05). During treatment, no adverse reactions were reported in the herbal-thread moxibustion group. In the western medication group, three patients reported dizziness and headache, and one patient reported dry mouth, the incidence of adverse reactions was 13.3%.
Conclusion
The Zhuang medicine herbal-thread moxibustion therapy is a safe and effective management strategy for the clinical symptoms of suboptimal health status-related insomnia.}

In Nepal, a police inquest is done for all the unnatural deaths who then subjects the body for medico-legal autopsy at the nearest government hospital. Except for a few hospitals where forensic medicine experts are available, the medico-legal work in Nepal is done by medical officers most of who have no forensic qualification. For a country with a population of nearly 30 million, there are less than 50 forensic medicine experts who are currently practicing. There are 21 medical colleges in Nepal each having a forensic medicine department engaged in teaching forensic medicine as a separate subject in the undergraduate medical curriculum. Currently, postgraduate courses are also offered in the country. However, there is a lack of uniformity in the curriculum set by different universities for both postgraduate and undergraduate education. Due to the lack of forensic medicine faculty members in some medical colleges, the undergraduate students of medicine have to undertake the exam being taught by some guest lectures and without witnessing a single medico-legal autopsy. To standardize the medico-legal services and forensic medicine education, the Medico-Legal Society of Nepal was established with an aim to conduct regular seminars, conferences, and CMEs and also various training programs for the non-forensic medicine experts who deal with medico-legal cases. This paper aims to provide a brief history of medico-legal practice in Nepal, the current situation, and future plans to improve the medico-legal service of the country.}

It’s known that respiratory diseases are the top of the list of systemic diseases, and accumulating evidence suggests that one of the important reasons for the high incidence of respiratory diseases is the difficulty in delivering drugs effectively to the respiratory system.
Purpose
In this review, we summarized the potential roles of targeting T2Rs in combination with bitter compounds for the treatment of respiratory diseases, and also discussed the potential of ABC transmembrane transporter proteins to deliver bitter compounds to cells to combat drug resistance, providing a reference for future studies on bitter receptor therapy related to respiratory diseases.
Results
The airway epithelium cells serve as a lung barrier against the invasion of various harmful substances in the respiratory system, and many receptors have been found to exist in the airway epithelium cells. Interestingly, it’s reported that lots of bitter compounds (quercetin, resveratrol, etc.) can reduce oxidative stress and other responses in respiratory diseases via bitter taste receptors (T2Rs).
Conclusion
Collectively T2Rs, seem as feasible drug targets and alternative treatment option for for natural bitter agents from traditional Chinese medicine to respiratory diseases in the future.}

Through 2 systematic literature reviews and interviews with dry mouth patients, we identified relevant outcome domains for dry mouth assessment. A Delphi survey was presented to health care providers attending the American Academy of Oral Medicine annual meeting in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, on May 2022 (n = 104) and 10 dry mouth patients at Cork University Dental School and Hospital, Republic of Ireland. The outcome domains for which no consensus was reached were subsequently discussed in a second consensus process led by a virtual Special Interest Group of 11 oral medicine experts from the World Workshop on Oral Medicine VIII dry mouth working group.
Results
After the 2-step consensus process, a consensus was reached for 12 dry mouth outcome domains (i.e., salivary gland flow, signs of hyposalivation, mucosal moisture/wetness, the severity of xerostomia, duration of xerostomia, the overall impact of xerostomia, impact on physical functioning, impact of hyposalivation on general health, impact on social activities, quality of life, the economic impact of dry mouth, patient satisfaction) to be included in the final COS.
Conclusions
We propose a consensus-based COS to assess dry mouth interventions in clinical trials. This COS includes the minimum but mandatory set of domains that all clinical trials evaluating dry mouth treatments should assess.}

Introduction
Choosing the right galenic form adapted to children is a challenge. It influences the acceptability of the drug and enhances the treatment adherence. In the same context, developing specific galenic forms has become a necessity. This survey was carried out to identify the problems encountered by parents when administering medicines and to consider ways to improve them.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted using questionnaires distributed to parents with children under 12 years old, via “Google Forms” software.
Results
Self-medication was a common practice in our sample (71.2%). Syrups were the most commonly used and were considered the most suitable for pediatric use. A significant portion of parents (78%) reported that their children had confronted them with a refusal of treatment. This refusal was mainly associated with the organoleptic characteristics of the medicines as well as difficulties related to administration. Besides, errors in the administration of medication, including dosing errors or forgetfulness, were mentioned by one-third of respondents. To overcome acceptability problems, 68.1% of the parents used tricks to administer the medication to their children like co-administering it with food or drinks. Suggestions for improving the acceptability of drugs were mainly related to the palatability improvement, the reduction in the number of taken doses as well as the volume of liquid oral forms, and the size of tablets or capsules.
Discussion
This survey showed that pediatric medicines did not necessarily meet the needs of parents. Improvements could be made to raise acceptability and therefore ensure better therapeutic adherence, which is a key to the treatment efficacy.
Conclusion
This study could help pharmaceutical companies prioritize pediatric formulation work.
Résumé
Introduction
Le choix de la forme galénique adaptée aux enfants est un défi. Il influence l’acceptabilité du médicament et améliore l’adhésion au traitement. Dans ce contexte, le développement de formes galéniques spécifiques est devenu une nécessité. Cette enquête a été réalisée afin d’identifier les problèmes rencontrés par les parents lors de l’administration des médicaments et d’envisager des pistes d’amélioration.
Matériels et méthodes
Cette étude a été réalisée à l’aide de questionnaires distribués aux parents d’enfants de moins de 12 ans, via le logiciel « Google Forms ».
Résultats
L’automédication est une pratique courante dans notre échantillon (71,2 %). Les sirops étaient les plus utilisés et étaient considérés comme les plus adaptés à un usage pédiatrique. Une part importante des parents (78 %) a rapporté que leurs enfants les avaient confrontés à un refus de traitement. Ce refus était principalement associé aux caractéristiques organoleptiques des médicaments ainsi qu’aux difficultés liées à l’administration. Par ailleurs, des erreurs dans l’administration des médicaments, y compris des erreurs de dosage ou des oublis, ont été mentionnées par un tiers des répondants. Pour surmonter les problèmes d’acceptabilité, 68,1 % des parents ont eu recours à des astuces pour administrer les médicaments à leurs enfants, par exemple en les associant à de la nourriture ou à des boissons. Les suggestions visant à améliorer l’acceptabilité des médicaments concernaient principalement l’amélioration de la palatabilité, la réduction du nombre de prises et du volume des formes orales liquides, ainsi que la taille des comprimés ou des gélules.
Discussion
Cette enquête a montré que les médicaments pédiatriques ne répondaient pas forcément aux besoins des parents. Des améliorations pourraient être apportées afin d’augmenter l’acceptabilité et ainsi assurer une meilleure adhésion thérapeutique, clé de l’efficacité du traitement.
Conclusion
Cette étude pourrait aider les entreprises pharmaceutiques à donner la priorité aux travaux de formulation pédiatrique.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Globally, plant materials are widely used as an additional and alternative therapy for the treating of diverse diseases. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, recurrent and nonspecific inflammation of the bowel, referred to as “modern intractable disease” according to the World Health Organization. With the continuous development of theoretical research in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the advantages of TCM in terms of low side effects, TCM has shown great progress in the research of treating UC.
Aim of this review
This review aimed to explore the correlation between intestinal microbiota and UC, summarize research advances in TCM for treating UC, and discuss the mechanism of action of TCM remedies in regulating intestinal microbiota and repairing damaged intestinal barrier, which will provide a theoretical basis for future studies to elucidate the mechanism of TCM remedies based on gut microbiota and provide novel ideas for the clinical treatment of UC.
Methods
We have collected and collated relevant articles from different scientific databases in recent years on the use of TCM in treating UC in relation to intestinal microecology. Based on the available studies, the therapeutic effects of TCM are analysed and the correlation between the pathogenesis of UC and intestinal microecology is explored.
Results
TCM is used to further protect the intestinal epithelium and tight junctions, regulate immunity and intestinal flora by regulating intestinal microecology, thereby achieving the effect of treating UC. Additionally, TCM remedies can effectively increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, decrease the abundance of pathogenic bacteria, restore the balance of intestinal microbiota, and indirectly alleviate intestinal mucosal immune barrier dysfunction and promote the repair of damaged colorectal mucosa.
Conclusion
Intestinal microbiota is closely related to UC pathogenesis. The alleviation of intestinal dysbiosis can be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for UC. TCM remedies can exert protective and therapeutic effects on UC through various mechanisms. Although intestinal microbiota can aid in the identification of different TCM syndromes types, further studies are needed using modern medical technology. This will improve the clinical therapeutic efficacy of TCM remedies in UC and promote the application of precision medicine.}

In this study, a MS-feature-based medicinal plant database-driven strategy was proposed for quick and automatic interpretation of CMP ingredients. The single herb database consisting of stable ions of sixty-one common TCM medicinal herbs was first constructed. And then, the data of CMP was imported into a self-built searching program to achieve quick and automatic identification with four steps including level 1 candidate herb screening based on stable ions (step 1), level 2 candidate herb screening based on unique ions (step 2), difficult-to-distinguish herb differentiation (step 3) and results integration (step 4). The identification model was optimized and validated with homemade Shaoyaogancao Decoction, Mahuang Decoction, Banxiaxiexin Decoction, and their related negative prescriptions and homemade fakes. Another nine batches of homemade and commercial CMPs were applied to this new approach and most of composed herbs in the corresponding CMPs were correctly identified. This work provided a promising and universal strategy for the clarification of CMP ingredients.}

abstract = {Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has attracted much interest, and its prevalence in both developed and developing countries has increased. During the Hajj season, millions of Muslims from many different countries travel to Makkah for the pilgrimage. In dealing with health issues during the holy season, many pilgrims prefer to self-medicate with traditional remedies instead of visiting medical practitioners, which could affect the efforts of state healthcare organizations to maintain overall public health during this mass gathering. This study aims to gauge the prevalence of CAM use during Hajj, and to assess pilgrims’ beliefs and knowledge of CAM therapies, with particular reference to products available in Makkah. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in several camps and hotels occupied by Hajj pilgrims in Makkah, during Hajj 2023. CAM modalities were used by 68.8 % of the study participants during the Hajj season. There were almost equal numbers of men (53.7 %) and women (46.3 %) participants, with 88 % of the CAM users being non-Saudi and only 12 % Saudi. The majority of the CAM users belonged to two age groups, the 31–40 year group (29.9 %) and the 41–50 year group (34.5 %). The most frequent self-practice therapies were religious prayer/rituals (30.2 %), and the most popular practitioner therapies was herbal treatments (12.3 %). The most common source of CAM-related information was family/friends (29.2 %), for improving well-being reason (25.8 %). More than half of the participants (56.8 %) strongly believed that CAM therapies have the potential to cure disease, although they were unaware of possible interactions between CAM and conventional drugs (76.7 %). More than half of the participants (57.8 %) did not disclose their CAM usage to healthcare practitioners. Half of the sample said they used CAMs during Hajj because of the common belief that therapeutic products from the holy city of Makkah, such as Zamzam water, are more effective. In conclusion, CAM therapies are commonly used by Hajj pilgrims as they are presumed to be natural and therefore safe, raising concerns about the potential risks of relying on CAM without adequate consultation with healthcare providers or awareness of potential interactions between prescription drugs and CAM treatments.}

abstract = {Objective
Here, we explored molecular changes that could potentially mediate healing effects of Gua Sha — a method employed by the Chinese traditional medicine with proven track records of safe and efficient applications dating back to ancient times as well as support from randomized controlled trials performed by modern medical studies — yet remaining almost entirely unexplored by the modern-day high-throughput methods of the -omics sciences.
Methods
We investigated transcriptome changes occurring shortly after Gua Sha treatment in the whole blood of healthy volunteers using bulk RNA-seq analysis. We applied various analytical tools to identify genes with consistent expression changes in multiple individuals in response to Gua Sha and their networks.
Results
We found that while the changes were very subtle and individual-specific, we could identify consistent upregulation of three histone genes. Further analysis of the potential regulatory networks of these histone genes revealed the enrichment of functions involved in the immune response and inflammation.
Conclusion
The significance of these results in the context of potential effects of Gua Sha and the next steps in exploring the molecular mechanisms of action of this technique are discussed.}

(ii) To what extent the critical literature on circular and sharing/collaborative economies can be taken as metaphors for the advancement of knowledge to better understand the complexities of medicines returns? After the selection of 125 papers, 10 hubs of collaboration were identified in this research field with early work on reuse stemming from the UK. From the thematic analysis, three outcomes emerged. The first relates to the problem of wastage versus costs and affordability, and the role of stockpiles and misplacement of leftover medicines. The second arises from a chronological description of the selected studies. Using a timeline, recurring debates were identified: prescription costs/sharing; reuse in evolutionary perspective of rational use; affordability and avoidance of wastes; and the role of pharmacists and care in the community/solidary pharmacies. The third outcome delivers metaphors linking critical aspects of circular and sharing/collaborative economies with concepts and situations of medicines reuse. It was found that the circular economy, which is still far from consumer reality, offers a limited contribution as a metaphor for medicines reuse, while sharing/collaborative economy reflects current practices that can be understood as access giving, thus interpreted as a form of affordability.}

keywords = {Traditional chinese medicine, Vascular cognitive impairment, Network pharmacology, Multi-omics analysis, Mechanism},
abstract = {Background
The term "vascular cognitive impairment" (VCI) describes various cognitive conditions that include vascular elements. It increases the risk of morbidity and mortality in the elderly population and is the most common cognitive impairment associated with cerebrovascular disease. Understanding the etiology of VCI may aid in identifying approaches to target its possible therapy for the condition. Treatment of VCI has focused on vascular risk factors. There are no authorized conventional therapies available right now. The medications used to treat VCI are solely approved for symptomatic relief and are not intended to prevent or slow the development of VCI.
Purpose
The function of Chinese medicine in treating VCI has not yet been thoroughly examined. This review evaluates the preclinical and limited clinical evidence to comprehend the "multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway" mechanism of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It investigates the various multi-omics approaches in the search for the pathological mechanisms of VCI, as well as the new research strategies, in the hopes of supplying supportive evidence for the clinical treatment of VCI.
Methods
This review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statements. Using integrated bioinformatics and network pharmacology approaches, a thorough evaluation and analysis of 25 preclinical studies published up to July 1, 2023, were conducted to shed light on the mechanisms of TCM for vascular cognitive impairment. The studies for the systematic review were located using the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, and ScienceDirect.
Results
We discovered that the multi-omics analysis approach would hasten the discovery of the role of TCM in the treatment of VCI. It will explore components, compounds, targets, and pathways, slowing the progression of VCI from the perspective of inhibiting oxidative stress, stifling neuroinflammation, increasing cerebral blood flow, and inhibiting iron deposition by a variety of molecular mechanisms, which have significant implications for the treatment of VCI.
Conclusion
TCM is a valuable tool for developing dementia therapies, and further research is needed to determine how TCM components may affect the operation of the neurovascular unit. There are still some limitations, although several research have offered invaluable resources for searching for possible anti-dementia medicines and treatments. To gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms that precisely modulate the key molecules at different levels during pharmacological interventions—a prerequisite for comprehending the mechanism of action and determining the potential therapeutic value of the drugs—further research should employ more standardized experimental methods as well as more sophisticated science and technology. Given the results of this review, we advocate integrating chemical and biological component analysis approaches in future research on VCI to provide a more full and objective assessment of the standard of TCM. With the help of bioinformatics, a multi-omics analysis approach will hasten the discovery of the role of TCM in the treatment of VCI, which has significant implications for the treatment of VCI.}

abstract = {Introduction
Chinese medicine (CM)/integrative medicine have been widely used to treat dampness syndrome, regarded as the main pathogenesis of many chronic diseases. Many clinical trials of CM/integrative medicine for dampness syndrome have been conducted. However, most of their conclusions should be viewed with caution because of their methodological quality defects. One of the defects is the inconsistency of outcomes, which results in obstacles to comparing and combining the results of related studies. This issue could be addressed by developing a core outcome set (COS).
Method
This study aims to develop a COS for clinical research of CM dampness syndrome (COS-CMDS). We will set up a study advisory group to organize and guide the development of the COS. The study consists of four stages: (1) a systematic review of CM dampness syndrome; (2) qualitative interviews with experts and patients to construct a preliminary outcome pool based on the systematic review; (3) a two-round Delphi survey; and (4) a consensus meeting to determine the final COS-CMDS. This study has been approved by the institute review board and has been registered at the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative (COMET) database (https://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/1950).
Discussion
The development of COS-CMDS will provide a reference for outcome selection in clinical research on CM dampness syndrome, and contribute to the combination and comparison of results reported during systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It may help generate more high-quality evidence.
Conclusion
COS-CMDS will standardize the selection and reporting of outcomes in clinical research of CM dampness syndrome. It will be published in appropriate ways to promote further widespread use after completion.}

Few individuals have fellowship training in both hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) and a surgical specialty including general surgery, general obstetrics and gynecology, or affiliated subspecialties. There is a paucity of data to explain why some surgeons choose to pursue HPM fellowship training.
Objective
Identify facilitators and barriers to palliative medicine fellowship training among physicians from a surgical specialty.
Methods
We conducted individual semistructured interviews with 17 surgeons who were also fellowship-trained in HPM. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes.
Results
Participants reported pivotal experiences—either positive exposure to palliative care or suboptimal surgical care experiences—as a key motivator for pursuing specialty palliative care training. Additionally, participants chose HPM training because they felt that practicing from a HPM perspective aligned with their personal care philosophy, and in some cases, offered professional opportunities to help achieve career goals. Participants reported encountering bias from both HPM and surgical faculty, and also found that some HPM fellowship programs did not accept surgical trainees. Surgeons also reported logistical concerns related to coordinating a one-year fellowship as a barrier to formal HPM training.
Conclusions
Understanding the motivations of surgeons who pursue HPM training and identifying challenges to completing fellowship may inform solutions to expand surgeon representation in palliative care. Both HPM and surgical faculty should be educated on the benefits of specialty HPM training for surgical trainees and practicing surgeons. Further research should explore HPM fellowship best practices for welcoming and training surgeons and other underrepresented specialties.}

abstract = {Introduction
Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.
Objective
This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning LGIB for the emergency clinician.
Discussion
LGIB is most commonly due to diverticulosis or anorectal disease, though there are a variety of etiologies. The majority of cases resolve spontaneously, but patients can have severe bleeding resulting in hemodynamic instability. Initial evaluation should focus on patient hemodynamics, the severity of bleeding, and differentiating upper gastrointestinal bleeding from LGIB. Factors associated with LGIB include prior history of LGIB, age over 50 years, and presence of blood clots per rectum. Computed tomography angiography is the imaging modality of choice in those with severe bleeding to diagnose the source of bleeding and guide management when embolization is indicated. Among stable patients without severe bleeding, colonoscopy is the recommended modality for diagnosis and management. A transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL hemoglobin is recommended based on recent data and guidelines (8 g/dL in those with myocardial ischemia), though patients with severe bleeding and hemodynamic instability should undergo emergent transfusion. Anticoagulation reversal may be necessary. If bleeding does not resolve, embolization or endoscopic therapies are necessary. There are several risk scores that can predict the risk of adverse outcomes; however, these scores should not replace clinical judgment in determining patient disposition.
Conclusions

abstract = {Introduction
The assessment of the medical doctoral dissertation is a preliminary step in the promoting of scientific writing. this study aimed to describe the research topics, study designs and quality writing of Preventive and Community Medicine academic dissertations in Tunisia.
Material and Methods
It’s a bibliometric study covering the Preventive and Community Medicine doctoral dissertations performed in the faculties of medicine of Tunisia over forty years (1980-2019). The research topics were determined from the descriptors, grouped into major descriptors and thematic groups. The types of studies were classified according to the Evidence-Based Medicine pyramid. The editorial quality assessment was based on a 20-item grid, deduced from the International Committee of Editors of Medical Journals repository, and applied to the abstracts of thesis. It was considered satisfactory if the score was ≥75/100 points.
Results
In total 595 PCM doctoral dissertations were performed in 40 years. Themes of dissertations were studied through 2580 index lines and 1030 descriptors. Healthcare-associated infections, maternal health, smoking, and high blood pressure accounted for 25.4% among major descriptors. The major research category evolved from "family medicine and primary care" (40.9%) before 2000 to management of health facilities” (26.7%) after 2000. The study designs were population studies or synthesis research, respectively in 259 (43.5%) and 22 (3.7%) doctoral dissertations. The quality of scientific writing was satisfactory in 34.6% of doctoral dissertations globally.
Conclusion
Preventive and Community Medicine doctoral dissertations suffered from methodological and editorial shortcomings, which required their reform based on bibliometric assessment, capacity building and structural reform.

abstract = {Background
Interest in the metaverse has been growing worldwide as the virtual environment provides opportunities for highly immersive and interactive experiences. Metaverse has gradually gained acceptance in the medical field with the advancement of technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and 5 G mobile networks. The demand for and development of metaverse are different in diverse subspecialties owing to patients with varying degrees of clinical disease. Hence, we aim to explore the application of metaverse in acute medicine by reviewing published studies and the clinical management of patients.
Method
Our review examined the published articles about the concept of metaverse roadmap, and four additional domains were extracted: education, prehospital and disaster medicine, diagnosis and treatment application, and administrative affairs.
Results
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) integration have broad applications in education and clinical training. VR-related studies surpassed AR-related studies in the emergency medicine field. The metaverse roadmap revealed that lifelogging and mirror world are still developing fields of the metaverse.
Conclusion
Our findings provide insight into the features, application, development, and potential of a metaverse in emergency medicine. This study will enable emergency care systems to be better equipped to face future challenges.}

abstract = {Background and aim
Due to the complexity of TCM ingredients and medication compatibility, TCM cannot be used like chemical medicines. The theory of “Four Natures and five Flavors” provides a theoretical basis for the use of TCM. “Four Natures and five Flavors” are originated from pharmacological rules based on clinical practices. Whereas, How to describe and characterize “Natures”(Warm, Hot, Cold and Cool) and “Flavors” (Pungent, Sour, Sweet, Bitter and Salty) scientifically remain the issue that needs to be solved. The aim of this study is to establish the TCM characterization models based on the integrated pharmacology network strategy and provide a deeper understanding of TCM theory.
Experimental procedure
Five “Pungent-Neutral”, nine “Sweet-Neutral and nine “Bitter-Neutral” TCMs were selected to characterize the “Flavors” (Pungent, Sweet and Bitter). Nine “Pungent-Warm” and nine “Bitter-Cold” TCMs were selected to characterize the “Natures” (Warm and Cold). The screened chemical ingredients were analyzed by classification and the screened characteristics targets were analyzed by GO and KEGG enrichment analysis.
Results and conclusion
In the “Pungent” group, flavonoids are the most. “Pungent” may have immune-regulatory effects and potential anticancer activity. In the “Sweet” group, isoflavones are the most. “Sweet” are related to effectively invigorate health. Fatty acids in the “Warm” group are the most. Flavonoids in the “Cold’ group are far more than other components. “Warm” and “Cold” are both related to fatty acid and energy metabolism.}

Recognize that one out of eleven geriatric ED patients in this sample received a Hospice and/or Palliative medicine consult during their hospitalization.
Key Message
At the crossroads of acute care and palliative medicine, Emergency Departments (ED) play a defining role in providing end-of-life geriatric care. This study specifically explores geriatric ED visits and subsequent Hospice and Palliative Medicine (HPM) needs, uncovering a rising annual trend of HPM consults and identifying the ED as the portal of hospital entry for 84.4% of all these patients.
Introduction
At the crossroads of acute care and palliative medicine, Emergency Departments (ED) play a defining role in providing end-of-life geriatric care.
Objective
This study aims to quantify the prevalence and trends of geriatric (Age > 65) ED visits and subsequent downstream hospice and palliative medicine (HPM) needs.
Methods
We conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study of electronic health records from five hospitals within a large metropolitan health system, from January 1st, 2018, to December 31st, 2022. Data included all ED visits and inpatient hospital admissions in adult patients with a HPM consult ordered during their encounter. A variety of patient specific demographic, clinical, and outcome variables were collected. The yearly number of HPM consults ordered in each hospital were also obtained and compared by year and site. Across years, we compared the incidence of geriatric ED visits, hospitalizations and HPM consults per every 1,000 geriatric ED visits. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-square testing, and regression analysis.
Results
A total of 27,100 HPM consults were ordered for 23,555 unique patients meeting inclusion criteria. In 2018, 4,229 unique patients received HPM consults, and this number grew by 24.1% to 5,247 consults in 2022 (p <.001). Among patients who received HPM consults, 84.4% (19,870) were admitted to the hospital through the ED. Of all HPM consults, 74.8% (17,622) involved geriatric patients. Geriatric patients accounted for 23.2% (503,249) of all ED encounters, of which 42.3% (231,036) resulted in an inpatient hospitalization or observation stay. Of these geriatric admissions, 7.8% (16,698) ultimately received a HPM consult. The calculated prevalence of HPM consults for geriatric patients was 33 downstream consults for every 1,000 geriatric ED visits.

This research aims to monitor the internal hazard of occupational workers who handle 131I. Two methods are used: in vivo or direct method and in vitro or indirect method. The in vivo or direct method was performed by assessing thyroid intake with a thyroid uptake monitoring machine. The in vitro or indirect method was performed by assessing urine samples with the help of a gamma-ray spectroscopy practice using a High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) Detector. In this study, fifty-nine thyroid counts and fifty-nine urine samples were collected from seven occupational workers who were in charge of 131I at the National Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (NINMAS), Dhaka. The result showed that the average annual effective dose of seven workforces from thyroid counts were 0.0208 mSv/y, 0.0180 mSv/y, 0.0135 mSv/y, 0.0169 m Sv/y, 0.0072 mSv/y, 0.0181 mSv/y, 0.0164 mSv/y and in urine samples 0.0832 mSv/y, 0.0770 mSv/y, 0.0732 mSv/y, 0.0693 mSv/y, 0.0715 mSv/y, 0.0662 mSv/y, 0.0708 mSv/y.The total annual effective dose (in vivo and in vitro method) was found among seven workers in average 0.1039 mSv/y, 0.0950 mSv/y, 0.0868 mSv/y, 0.0862 mSv/y, 0.0787 mSv/y, 0.0843 mSv/y, 0.0872 mSv/y. Following the rules of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the annual limit of effective dose for occupational exposure is 20 mSv per year and the finding values from this research work are lesser than this safety boundary.}

abstract = {Background
Rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is a rare infection caused by an invasive fungus and found predominantly in immunocompromised patients. The presentation of ROCM ranges from a mild headache, fever, and sinusitis to vision loss, altered mental status, and facial disfigurement secondary to local tissue invasion. ROCM can cause significant morbidity and mortality and requires prompt diagnosis with timely evaluation by surgical and infectious disease specialists. Cases of ROCM have been reported extensively in internal medicine, infectious disease, and otolaryngology literature. However, there are very few reports in emergency medicine literature in the United States.
Case Report
A 72-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with altered mental status, 4 days of left-sided facial numbness and weakness, and sudden facial pain, swelling, and erythema. Laboratory analysis was consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. Noncontrast computed tomography of the head and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated findings indicative of invasive fungal infection of the left sinus and orbit with extension to the cavernous sinus and surrounding cranial nerves. She was initiated on broad-spectrum antifungals, but based on the extent of the infection, was not a surgical candidate. She subsequently transitioned to a comfort-based plan of care and died 6 days after initial ED presentation.
Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?
Early recognition and initiation of treatment can potentially mitigate the devastating outcomes of ROCM, therefore it is critical to be aware of this condition and have a high level of suspicion in susceptible patients.}

Physicians and midwives meet patients with sexual health issues regularly; however, they may have limited sexual medicine education. The study’s aim was to evaluate the self-reported competence of medical and midwifery students to bring up sexual health issues with their patients and to assess the barriers that hinder these discussions. The need for additional education was also evaluated.
Study design
A web-based questionnaire was sent to the last-year medical and midwifery students graduating between December 2018 and May 2019 in Finland. In total, 233 medical students and 131 midwifery students participated in the study. Three fields were evaluated: the self-reported competence in discussing sexual health issues and treating patients with these issues, the barriers to bringing up sexual problems, and the need for education in sexual medicine.
Results
The students self-reported better competence in discussing sexual health issues than in treating patients’ sexual problems. For the medical students, the most important barriers hindering bringing up sexual health issues were lack of i) time (89.2 %), ii) experience with sexual medicine (88.1 %), and iii) knowledge (82.1 %). For the midwifery students, the most important barriers were i) lack of experience with sexual medicine (73.3 %), ii) fear of failing to respond to patients’ sexual health issues (64.9 %), and iii) lack of knowledge (62.5 %). A higher percentage of the midwifery students (96.2 %) reported an interest in sexual medicine education compared to the medical students (55.4 %) (OR 13.89, 95 % CI 5.32–35.71, P <.001). Majority (76.5 %) of the medical students and almost half (45.0 %) of the midwifery students reported receiving too little sexual medicine education (OR 7.30, 95 % CI 4.00–13.33, P <.001).
Conclusions
Both student groups reported several barriers hindering bringing up sexual health issues with their patients and expressed a need for more education, particularly the medical students.}

In response, a systematic integrative review was conducted to examine empirical literature reporting on one or more aspects of the relationship between psychology (incorporating clinical practice, professional associations and academia) and CM, and how that relationship may relate to or inform psychologists' engagement with CM in their clinical practice. Twenty-seven peer-reviewed articles met the specific inclusion criteria and quality appraisal was employed. Analysis shows a substantial number of psychologists are engaging with, or are interested in engaging with, CM in their clinical practice. Analysis identified a dissonance between psychologists’ engagement with CM in clinical practice and the limited engagement of the broader discipline of psychology with CM. Further research is required to understand these differing types of engagement with a view to helping inform relevant policy and practice guidelines, and ultimately assist psychologists in navigating CM in their clinical practice.}

Polygonati Rhizoma (PR), which contains rich national cultural connotations, is a traditional Chinese medicine with homology of medicine and food. It has been used for a long time as a tonic in China's multi-ethnic medical system, and is also used to treat diseases such as premature graying hair, deficiency of blood and essence, diabetes, hypertension, etc. Meanwhile, PR is often used as food in China, India, South Korea and other Asian countries, which can satisfy hunger and provide many health benefits.
Aim of the review
This paper systematically reviewed the ethnopharmacology, botany, phytochemistry, pharmacology and related applications research of PR, and provided a reference for the comprehensive applications of PR, including basic research, product development and clinical applications. This paper also refined the national application characteristics of PR, such as rich plant resources, special chemical components and anti-hidden hungry, which laid a foundation for its high value and high connotation development in the future.
Materials and methods
The literature information was collected systematically from the electronic scientific databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Geen Medical, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, as well as other literature sources, such as classic books of herbal medicine.
Results
A comprehensive analysis of the above literature confirmed that PR has been used in the ethnic medicine system of Asian countries such as China for thousands of years. In this paper, 12 species including official species that can be used as PR are summarized, which provide rich plant resources for PR. The chemical components in PR are divided into nutritional components and active components. The former not only contains non-starch polysaccharides and fructo-oligosaccharides, which account for about 50% in PR and are recognized as high-quality diet in the world, but also contains inorganic elements and mineral elements. And a total of 199 kinds active ingredients, including saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, etc., were sorted out by us. The above ingredients make PR have a special property of anti-hidden hunger. Studies have shown that PR has a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as immune regulation, blood glucose regulation, lipid-lowering, antioxidant, anti-tumor, antibacterial, etc. It has been widely used in medicine, food, cosmetics, gardens and other fields.
Conclusions
PR, as a classic medicinal material of the same origin, is widely used in the traditional ethnic medicine system. It contains abundant potential plant resources, chemical components and pharmacological activities. This paper also suggests that PR with high application value in food industry, has the potential to become a high-quality coarse grain. Exploring the way of grain and industrialization of PR is beneficial to fully develop the economic value of PR.}

abstract = {Introduction
Given the importance of understanding methodical reporting and statistical terminology in ensuring evidence-based decision-making, physicians should possess statistical literacy. The purpose of this study was to distinguish statistical terminology commonly used in emergency medicine methods and describe changes in statistical methods from 2011 to 2021.
Methods
The research team chose four journals in emergency medicine widely read and clinically relevant: Academic Emergency Medicine, American Journal of Emergency Medicine, Annals of Emergency Medicine, and Journal of Emergency Medicine. A total of 400 research articles were included. The team compared overall frequencies in statistical word counts as well as differences by year (2021 vs 2011).
Results
Included words from 2011 totaled 31,002 compared to 38,272 in 2021. Unique words for 2011 included 3801 compared to 4291 in 2021. The most common statistical words found in both years were model(s), difference(s), and regression(s). The largest increases in usage included the following words: noninferior(ity), NPV, Fixed, AUC, Mixed, Shapiro, and Wilk. Compared to 2011, results showed a 10% decrease in “p” for 2021. While the terms “Confidence” (2%) and “Intervals” (6%) decreased from 2011 to 2021, there was a 25% increase in “CI(s)”.
Conclusion
By understanding common statistical terms and trends over time, educational efforts can be targeted to consumers of EM literature. Additionally, this work provides evidence suggesting an overall improvement in processes in statistical methodology, enhancing the quality of research outputs and ultimately allowing better clinical decision-making.}
