abstract = {Introduction
Herbal medicines are an important part of healthcare worldwide. In Brazil, the national authorities issued the concept of “living pharmacies”, that produce and offer herbal medicines in the Brazilian unified public health system. Farmácia da Natureza (Nature’s Pharmacy) is a living pharmacy and a single, not-for-profit institution that integrates traditional and scientific knowledge on medicinal plants, along with the preservation of Brazilian biodiversity, with benefits to the health of the population that uses herbal drugs. A six-year experience of medical prescription of herbal medicines at Farmácia da Natureza is reported
Methods
A retrospective, descriptive analysis of data on medical prescriptions of herbal medicines was conducted (September 2013 to December 2019) retrieved from a computerized database.
Results
A total of 47,418 prescription items for 4739 patients were analyzed. The most frequent pharmaceutical forms were tinctures (39.6%); capsules containing powdered plant material (20.7%); creams, ointments, or gels (12.3%); and aqueous extracts (11.7%). The five most frequently prescribed single-constituent herbal medicines were: Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae); Valeriana officinalis L. (Caprifoliaceae); Aloysia polystachya (Griseb.) Moldenke (Verbenaceae); Eclipta prostrata (L.) L. (Asteraceae); and Baccharis trimera (Less.) DC. (Asteraceae). Nearly half of the plants were naturally occurring in Brazil, while more than 80% of the products were not present in Brazilian official documents.
Conclusion
At Farmácia da Natureza, herbal medicines are usually prescribed as tinctures and capsules containing powdered plant material, but other pharmaceutical forms are also prescribed. Half of the plants are of Brazilian origin and almost all preparations are galenic formulations.}

Tendinopathy and enthesitis share clinical, anatomical, and molecular parallels. However, their relationship is complex, presenting challenges in diagnosis and treatment. The biomechanics underlying these pathologies, together with relative immune and stromal contributions to pathology, are characterised by crucial comparative elements. However, methodologies used to study enthesitis and tendinopathy have been divergent, which could account for discrepancies in how these conditions are perceived and treated. In this Review, we summarise key clinical parallels between these two common presentations in musculoskeletal medicine and address factors that currently preclude development of more effective therapeutics. Furthermore, we describe molecular similarities and disparities that govern pathological mechanisms in tendinopathy and enthesitis, thus informing translational studies and treatment strategies.}

Jing Guan Fang (JGF) is an anti-COVID-19 Chinese Medicine decoction comprised of five medicinal herbs to possess anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties for treatment. This study aims to electrochemically decipher the anti-coronavirus activity of JGF and show that microbial fuel cells may serve as a platform for screening efficacious herbal medicines and providing scientific bases for the mechanism of action (MOA) of TCMs.
Methods
Electrochemical techniques (e.g., cyclic voltammetry) and MFCs were adopted as the bioenergy-based platforms to assess the bioenergy-stimulating characteristics of JGF. Phytochemical analysis correlated polyphenolic and flavonoid content with antioxidant activity and bioenergy-stimulating properties. Network pharmacology on the active compounds was employed to identify anti-inflammatory and anti-COVID-19 protein targets, and molecular docking validated in silico results.
Significant findings
This first-attempt results show that JGF possesses significant reversible bioenergy-stimulation (amplification 2.02 ± 0.04) properties suggesting that its antiviral efficacy is both bioenergy-steered and electron mediated. Major flavonoids and flavone glycosides identified by HPLC (e.g., baicalein and baicalin, respectively) possess electron-shuttling (ES) characteristics that allow herbal medicines to treat COVID-19 via (1) reversible scavenging of ROS to lessen inflammation; (2) inhibition of viral proteins; and (3) targeting of immunomodulatory pathways to stimulate the immune response according to network pharmacology.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Traditional plant-based medicines (TMs) have been widely used to prevent chronic oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (OIPN). However, the prevention and safety of TMs for chronic OIPN remain ambiguous. Furthermore, diverse TM prescriptions and complicated components limit in-depth research on the mechanisms of TMs.
Aim of this study
To determine core TMs and potential pharmacological pathways on the basis of a thorough investigation into the preventive benefits and safety of oral TMs for chronic OIPN in colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods
A search of the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang databases for RCTs reporting on TMs for chronic OIPN was conducted through December 1, 2022. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were applied to assess the impacts of influencing variables. The assessment of Risk of Bias was relied on Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The funnel plot, Egger's test, and the Trim and Fill method were applied to identify potential publication bias. Trial sequential analyses (TSA) were carried out by the TSA tool to increase the robustness. The assessment of the quality of evidence was according to the GRADE system. System pharmacology analysis was employed to screen core herbal combinations to elucidate possible mechanisms for preventing chronic OIPN in CRC.
Results
The pooled effect estimate with robustness increased by TSA analysis demonstrated that oral TMs appeared to significantly decrease the incidence of chronic OIPN (RR = 0.66, 95% CI (0.56, 0.78); P＜0.00001), leukocytopenia (RR = 0.65, 95% CI (0.54,0.79); P＜0.00001), and nausea and vomiting (RR = 0.72, 95% CI (0.61,0.84); P＜0.0001) as well as improve the Objective Response Rate (ORR) (RR = 1.31, 95% CI (1.09,1.56); P = 0.003). The incidence of severe chronic OIPN was revealed a significant reduction, particularly when chemotherapy was administered for periods of time shorter than six months (RR = 0.33, 95% CI (0.15,0.71); P = 0.005; actuation duration＜3 months; RR = 0.33, 95% CI (0.17,0.62); P = 0.0007; actuation duration≥3 months, ＜6 months). The considerable heterogeneity among studies may be attributable to the severity of dysfunction categorized by grade and accumulated dosage. Using core TMs consisting of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, Atractylodes Macrocephala Koidz., Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, and Codonopsis pilosula (Franch.) Nannf. To regulate nuclear factor-kappa B against inflammation caused by activation of microglia might be an approach to preventing chronic OIPN.
Conclusions
TMs appear to be effective and safe in the prevention of chronic OIPN, especially severe chronic OIPN. Additionally, core TMs consisting of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, Atractylodes Macrocephala Koidz., Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, and Codonopsis pilosula (Franch.) Nannf were presumably responsible for reducing the incidence of chronic OIPN, and the mechanism may be related to relieving inflammation. However, quality-assured trials with long-term follow-up for exploring inflammatory factors and preliminary research on core TMs and pharmacological pathways are needed.}

abstract = {Study objective
We implemented a virtual observation unit in which emergency department (ED) patients receive observation-level care at home. Our primary aim was to compare this new care model to in-person observation care in terms of brick-and-mortar ED length of stay (inclusive of ED observation unit time) as well as secondarily on inpatient admission and 72-hour return visits (overall and with admission).
Methods
In a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data on ED observation patients from January 1, 2022 to December 29, 2022 from an academic urban ED, we used propensity matching to compare virtual to in-person observation patients on outcomes of interest. Patients were matched 1:1 based on age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and reason for observation. We also conducted real-time review of all virtual observation cases for potential safety concerns.
Results
Of 8,218 observation stays, 361 virtual observation patients were matched with 361 in-person observation patients. Virtual observation patients experienced lower median brick-and-mortar ED + EDOU LOS [14.6 (IQR 10.2, 18.9) versus 33.3 (IQR 28.1, 38.1) hours] and lower inpatient admission rates (10.2% [SD 5.0] versus 24.7% [SD 11.3]). The 72-hour return rate was higher for virtual observation patients (3.6% [SD 3.0] versus 2.5% [SD 3.0]). Among those with return visits, the rate of inpatient admission was higher among virtual observation patients (53.8% [SD 3.2] versus 11.1% [13.0]). There were no significant patient safety events recorded.
Conclusion
Virtual observation unit patients used fewer hours in ED and ED observation relative to on-site observation patients. This new care delivery model warrants further study because it has the potential to positively impact ED capacity.}

abstract = {Transfusion therapy is an indispensable form of treatment, and an important element of the public health system. Due to its origin, blood’s clinical use is associated with various risks that may cause adverse reactions and events. Progress in quality and safety of blood components has eliminated numerous risks, especially those of infectious origin. However, some risks cannot be predicted, while others cannot always be prevented. Globalisation and climate change constantly favour the spread of infectious agents. Against this, epidemiology plays a central role in ensuring the safety of transfusion treatment, by continuous surveillance and timely identification of risks, and in the development of routine and additional tests as measures for risk mitigation. As a quantitative discipline based on research methods, epidemiology is a method of reasoning; it relies on the generation and testing of hypotheses; it utilises other scientific resources, particularly in the field of blood donation and blood transfusion, thus having many applications. The main focus falls on transfusion-transmissible infections, and on environmental or occupational diseases, injuries, disabilities and death causes at large. The practice of epidemiology relies on a systematic approach and measurement of disease frequencies. Surveillance is a key element, involving continuously gathering, analysing, and evaluating data regarding diseases, morbidity and mortality, and disseminating the conclusions of the analyses to relevant competent authorities; in this way, action is taken for disease prevention and control. Surveillance systems also provide an important tool for risk assessment, a method to assess and characterise the critical parameters in the functionality of equipment, systems or processes of using scientific data in order to estimate the magnitude of any health effect that derives from decisions of policy makers. Epidemiological surveillance, particularly for the incidence of adverse reactions and adverse events associated with blood transfusion at the national and international levels, has demonstrated the importance of multidisciplinary cooperation between blood and public health services.}

Utilizing a curriculum-based approach, participants will self-report the ability to develop and apply a communication skills workshop for residents for future education applications.
Key Message
The ACGME requires palliative care training opportunities for Internal Medicine (IM) residency, though does not specify type of exposure. This session will focus on development and evaluation of a palliative care curriculum for Yale Primary Care IM residents, with description of communication skills workshop, two-week structured clinical rotation, and program evaluation.
Introduction
All IM residents care for seriously ill and dying patients. Trainees currently feel unprepared to provide palliative care (1). Further training is desired (2).
Objectives
We developed a comprehensive curriculum for IM residents, evaluating if it improved interns’ comfort with, and knowledge of, core topics in palliative care.
Methods
We designed a communication skills simulation workshop powered by VitalTalk for all interns and residents. We also developed a palliative care rotation for interns with learning objectives, entrustable professional activities, and rotation evaluation. The rotation included goal setting, observed clinical encounters, symptom management, family conferences, and participation in interdisciplinary meetings. Interns completed a pre, post, and end-of-year survey with 8 comfort questions and 14 knowledge questions, compared with historical control. Data was evaluated through paired and unpaired T-tests.
Results
In 2022-2023, 52 interns and residents completed the VitalTalk workshop. 18 interns completed the Palliative Care rotation, which was made permanent for future classes. Individualized learning goals encompassed communication, prognostication, symptom management, hospice and local resource discussion, advance care planning, and mindful practice. Pre and post results (n=5) demonstrate significant increases in both comfort with skills (8 item mean: 2.4 to 3.5 out of 5, p=0.05) and knowledge (14 item mean: 51% to 82%, p=0.04). End of year learning outcomes (n=4) compared to historical control (n=11) suggest significant increases in both comfort with skills (mean 4 to 2.7 out of 5, p=0.05) and knowledge (mean 72% to 56%, p=0.01).
Conclusions
This curriculum represents a robust example of IM intern and resident exposure to palliative care core competencies. Interns’ comfort with skills and their knowledge of palliative care improved. Future directions will incorporate feedback to improve the curriculum and track longitudinal interest in subspecialty training.

Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets and drugs for treating AKI is urgent. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent and lipid-peroxidation-driven regulatory form of cell death and is closely associated with the occurrence and development of AKI. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has unique advantages in treating AKI due to its natural origin and efficacy. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis and its role in AKI, and TCM compounds that play essential roles in the prevention and treatment of AKI by inhibiting ferroptosis. This review suggests ferroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for AKI, and that TCM compounds show broad prospects in the treatment of AKI by targeting ferroptosis.}

abstract = {Background
Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the sole FDA approved thrombolytic drug for ischemic stroke. But delayed thrombolytic therapy with tPA may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Many Chinese herbal medicines have been used as tPA helpers to enhance the capacity of tPA and minimize the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. The efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines on tPA thrombolysis is not systematically analyzed.
Methods
We searched the following three databases up to January 2022: Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. Studies that reported the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines on tPA thrombolysis in experimental stroke were included. The efficacy outcomes were neurological score and infarct volume, the safety outcomes were cerebral hemorrhage and blood brain barrier (BBB) damage. We used the checklist of CAMARADES to assess the quality of included studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were used to assess all the outcomes. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Trim and fill method and Egger's test were used to assess the potential publication bias. Sensitivity analyses were used to identify the stability of the results.
Results
A total of nine studies including 11 Chinese herbal medicines fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were subsequently analyzed. The pooled data demonstrated that Chinese herbal medicines improved neurological score (2.23 SMD, 1.42–3.04), infarct volume (1.08 SMD, 0.62–1.54), attenuated cerebral hemorrhage (1.87 SMD, 1.34–2.4), and BBB dysfunction (1.9 SMD, 1.35–2.45) following tPA thrombolysis in experimental stroke. Subgroup analysis indicated that the route of drug delivery, dosage of tPA, and stroke model used may be factors inducing heterogeneity and influencing the efficacy.
Conclusion
Treatment with Chinese herbal medicines significantly improved neurological score and infarct volume, reduced cerebral hemorrhage and BBB damage after tPA thrombolysis. This study supports Chinese herbal medicine as an adjuvant therapy in reducing the side effects of tPA thrombolysis after acute ischemic stroke. The results should be interpreted with more caution since this article was based on animal studies.}

Even steroids are not uniformly effective in mucus production in severe asthma, and new therapeutic options are needed. Seihaito is a Japanese traditional medicine that is used clinically as an antitussive and expectorant. In the present study, we examined the effect of Seihaito on goblet cell differentiation and mucus production. In in vitro studies, using air–liquid interface culture of guinea-pig tracheal epithelial cells, Seihaito inhibited IL-13-induced proliferation of goblet cells and MUC5AC, a major component of mucus production. Seihaito suppressed goblet cell-specific gene expression, without changing ciliary cell-specific genes, suggesting that it inhibits goblet cell differentiation. In addition, Seihaito suppressed MUC5AC expression in cells transfected with SPDEF, a transcription factor activated by IL-13. Furthermore, Seihaito attenuated in vivo goblet cell proliferation and MUC5AC mRNA expression in IL-13-treated mouse lungs. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that Seihaito has an inhibitory effect on goblet cell differentiation and mucus production, which is at least partly due to the inhibition of SPDEF.}

abstract = {Clinicians are increasingly using regenerative medicines to repair, replace, regenerate or rejuvenate lost, damaged or diseased genes, cells, tissues or organs. In South Africa, access to these novel gene therapies and cell and tissue-based products is limited. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) diversity and a paucity of suitable HLA-identical unrelated donors, results in limited access to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell transplantation (HSPCT). Cell-based products could increase this access. Genetic diversity can also manifest in local or region-specific rare congenital disorders, and in vivo gene therapies hold the promise of developing treatments and cures for these debilitating disorders. South Africa has a disproportionate mortality rate due to non-natural causes, with many surviving with permanent injuries and disabilities. Tissue-engineered cell-based products have the potential to restore many of those affected and improve quality of life and productivity. These factors create an urgency for South Africa to develop regenerative medicines to address the country's unique needs and to provide access to these new and innovative treatment modalities. Achieving this objective requires a well-coordinated effort by multiple stakeholders and role players. A critical component of a regenerative medicine ecosystem is establishing an enabling regulatory framework for these new classes of medicines. Here we provide a brief profile of South Africa, including its genetic diversity, economy, the impact of the burden of disease, health policy and the healthcare system. We address the regulation of medicines, how the existing framework can accommodate regenerative medicines, and the steps needed to establish a future regulatory framework.}

abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, incurable non-Hodgkin's lymphoma characterized by naive B cells infiltrating the lymphoid follicle's mantle zone. A key feature of MCL is the cytogenetic abnormality t(11;14) (q13:q14), found in 95% of cases, leading to Cyclin D1 overexpression resulting in uncontrolled cell cycle progression and genetic instability. Occasionally, Cyclin D2 or D3 overexpression can substitute for Cyclin D1, causing similar effects. The transcription factor SOX11 is a hallmark of classical Cyclin D1-positive MCL and also in cases without the typical t(11;14) abnormality, making it an important diagnostic marker. MCL's development necessitates secondary genetic changes, including mutations in the ATM, TP53, and NOTCH1 genes, with the TP53 mutation being the only genetic biomarker with established clinical prognostic value. The Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) score, which considers age, performance status, serum LDH levels, and leukocyte count, stratifies patients into risk groups. Histologic variants of MCL, such as classic, blastoid, and pleomorphic, offer additional prognostic information. Recent research highlights new mutations potentially tied to specific populations among MCL patients, suggesting the benefit of personalized management for better predicting outcomes like progression-free survival. This approach could lead to more effective, risk-adapted treatment strategies. However, challenges remain in patient stratification and in developing new therapeutic targets for MCL. This review synthesizes current knowledge on genetic mutations in MCL and their impact on prognosis. It aims to explore the prognostic value of genetic markers related to population traits, emphasizing the importance of tailored molecular medicine in MCL.}

abstract = {Equitable and sustainable access to medicines is a global challenge, including for high-income countries. Over the last two decades, launch prices of new medicines have considerably increased, making some medicines unaffordable for many countries. This article is based on a presentation held by the author at the IQWiG Autumn Symposium in November 2021. The medicine price situation in European countries and beyond is presented informed by international evidence. Medicine prices vary across countries, and for some therapeutic groups (e.g., cancer drugs) medicines are largely unaffordable and/or unsustainable for most countries. Selected policy options to improve affordability, which are commonly applied and considered as potential solutions, are discussed. The article stresses the importance of price regulation, and of transparency of prices and further components across the pharmaceutical value chain. Many governments opted for concluding managed-entry agreements (e.g., pay-for-performance) with confidential discounts to make new medicines with high price tags affordable and/or to manage uncertainty about their performance. However, this policy is linked to limitations, particularly due to its secrecy of discounts. Patent expiry of biological medicines can contribute to affordable access; however, it is important to strategically exploit the biosimilar potential by implementing a mix of appropriate policies to foster competition and enhance the uptake of biosimilar medicines.
Zusammenfassung
Regierungen, einschließlich jene in wohlhabenden Ländern, stehen vor der Herausforderung, fairen und nachhaltigen Zugang zu Arzneimitteln zu schaffen. Im Laufe der letzten beiden Jahrzehnte kamen Medikamente mit immer höheren Preisen auf den Markt, die sich viele Staaten nicht leisten können. Der vorliegende Beitrag basiert auf einer Präsentation der Autorin bei der IQWiG-Herbsttagung im November 2021. Grundlegende Muster bei Arzneimittelpreisen in den europäischen Ländern und global werden auf Basis internationaler Evidenz skizziert: Die Medikamentenpreise sind je nach Land unterschiedlich, und in einigen Indikationen (z.B. Onkologika) sind sie für zahlreiche Länder nicht leistbar bzw. gefährden die Nachhaltigkeit der Solidarsysteme. Der Beitrag beleuchtet ausgewählte Politikmaßnahmen, die zu leistbaren Arzneimittelpreisen beitragen sollen – sowohl solche, die von zahlreichen Ländern angewendet werden, als auch Ideen im Diskussionsstadium. Die Bedeutung von Preisregulierung und Transparenz – von Preisen wie auch von weiteren arzneimittelsystemrelevanten Komponenten – wird dargelegt. Um hochpreisige Arzneimittel leistbar zu machen und/oder mit der Unsicherheit über ihre Wirkung besser umzugehen, haben viele Staaten sogenannte Managed Entry Agreements (z.B. Pay for Performance) mit den pharmazeutischen Unternehmern abgeschlossen, die jedoch wegen der dabei vereinbarten Vertraulichkeit der Rabatte problematisch sind. Patentabläufe von Biologika tragen zur Leistbarkeit von Medikamenten bei, allerdings ist dabei wichtig, mit einem guten Mix an adäquaten Maßnahmen Wettbewerb und Nachfrage nach den Biosimilar-Medikamenten zu fördern.}

Bivariate analysis of quantitative data was performed using Fisher’s test. Qualitative data were organized into themes and analyzed quantitatively. Of those invited to participate, a total of 153 (18.25%) PH/GPM residents and graduates responded to the survey. We found diversity in prior medical education/training among respondents. Overall, debt burden at the start of training was low compared to national trends. Compared to residents, a higher proportion of graduates were board-eligible in another specialty (p<0.001). Most respondents felt that their programs provided them with opportunities to acquire skills essential for a career in PM. Ninety-one percent of graduates were board-certified in PH/GPM. Respondents expressed a wide range of career interests, including government work and academia. Difficulty with marketing themselves as PM physicians was frequently cited as a reason for the difficulty in securing a PM job.The results inform the PM community with current trends in PH/GPM training and career obstacles faced by PM graduates.}

The surface functional groups (C–O, CO, and O–H) on the surface of the original biochar were dramatically improved by activation, enables CMRBKOH to adsorb Pb(II) with more effective surface complexation, electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, co-precipitation, and coordination. Compared with the work done in other literatures, the material properties of this study are excellent. In addition, after eight cycles of experiments, the adsorption capacity is still 87.22%, and the adsorbent shows excellent regeneration capacity. As a whole, CMRBKOH could be considered an emerging Pb(II) adsorbent material with significant promise for Chinese medicine residue resource utilization, environmental quality, and public health protection.}

We sought to survey ADEMs regarding the current number of endowed faculty positions and compare the results over time.
Methods
A survey was emailed to the chairs of all ADEMs belonging to the Association of Academic Chairs of Emergency Medicine or identified by the Association of American Medical Colleges. We requested the following information: number of endowed chairs and professorship positions; the amount required to fund; the amount allowed to be spent annually; the date established; and the names of the positions.
Results
One hundred chairs responded out of a total of 109 ADEMs, for a response rate of 92%. Thirty-eight ADEMs (38%) reported having a total of 55 endowed chair positions. Twenty-six ADEMs (26%) reported having a total of 37 endowed professorships. The most common amount required to fund an endowed chair was $2 million to $2.5 million, and $1 million for an endowed professorship. The majority of ADEMs were allowed to spend 4–5% of the value of the endowment annually.
Conclusions
Forty-six individual ADEMs (46%) reported having at least one endowed faculty position compared with only 30 in 2014 and only 19 in 2009. The total number of endowed faculty positions in ADEMs was 92 in the current study compared with 53 in 2014, 25 in 2009, and only 9 in 2004.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic non-atrophic gastritis (CNG) is the most common type of chronic gastritis. If not actively treated, it may induce gastric cancer (GC). Western medicine is effective in CNG, but there are more adverse reactions after long-term medication, and it is easy to relapse after treatment, which affects patients’ health and life. Tibetan medicine Liuwei Muxiang Pills (LWMX pills) is a traditional Tibetan medicine compound, which has a unique curative effect in the treatment of gastric inflammation, especially chronic non-atrophic gastritis. However, the mechanisms of LWMX pills for treatment CNG still remain poor known.
Purpose
The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic intervention potential of Tibetan medicine LWMX pills on CNG and explore its potential mechanisms in mice models.
Methods
The mice models was established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LWMX pills on CNG. The main components of LWMX pills were analyzed by GC-MS. HE staining, immunohistochemistry, proteomics and Western Blot were used to analyze the potential mechanism of LWMX pills for CNG treatment.
Results
In the present study, LWMX pills containing costunolide, dehydrocostuslactone and antioxidants were found. IF results showed that the expression of ALDH1B1 in the control group was significantly lower than that in the model group in the gastric mucosa tissue, and the expression of ALDH1B1 was significantly lower in the 25 mg/ml LWMX Pills group (one month) and 25 mg/ml LWMX Pills group (two months) than in the model group. IHC revealed that model group samples expressed higher levels of Furin than 25 mg/ml LWMX Pills group samples, as evidenced by very strong staining of Furin in gastric mucosal cells. However, AMY2 staining in gastric mucosal cells did not differ significantly between the treated and control groups. the protein expression levels of these proteins were decreased in 25 mg/mL LWMX pills. Meanwhile, we found that the CAM1 protein expression in the in 25 mg/ml LWMX pills group (two mouths) was increased compared to the in 25 mg/ml LWMX pills group (one mouths).Western blotting showed that the protein expression levels of Furin, AMY2A, CPA3, ALDH1B1, Cam1, COXII, IL-6, IL-1β were decreased in 25 mg/mL LWMX pills. Meanwhile, that the CAM1 protein expression in the in 25 mg/ml LWMX pills group (two mouths) was increased compared to the in 25 mg/ml LWMX pills group (one mouths).
Conclusion
25mg/ml LWMX pill treatment for one month had better therapeutic effect on mice CNG. Further proteomic results showed that LWMX pills maintain gastric function by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress, and we also found that LWMX pills regulate the expression of proteins associated with cancer development (Amy2, Furin).}

To describe the growth and characteristics of active orthopaedic sports medicine podcasts.
Methods
Three common podcasting platforms (Apple, Google, and Spotify) were queried July 24, 2021 using the search term “sports medicine.” For each unique active podcast hosted by an orthopaedic surgeon, data were collected on year of the first episode, number of episodes, frequency of episodes, types of guests, topics discussed, episode length, and social media presence. Descriptive characteristics were then calculated.
Results
15 podcasts met inclusion criteria. Seven (46.7%) of these podcasts were started within 12 months of July 24, 2021. The most common episode release schedule was weekly, and podcast lengths averaged 21 minutes, 47 seconds (SD 17:17, range: 11:02–1:49:13). All podcasts featured guests, most often from a variety of sports medicine backgrounds. Social media platforms were commonly used by podcast hosts, with social media account follower numbers as high as over 100,000, and consistent engagement across three major social media platforms for most podcasts.
Conclusions
This study found that episodes are typically released weekly and average 21 minutes, 47 seconds long, with most covering a wide array of topics in sports medicine. The Facebook accounts of these podcasts displayed higher numbers of followers compared to other social media platforms; however, Instagram was superior for engagement.
Clinical Relevance
Orthopaedic sports medicine podcasts have an increasing presence and can be used to increase trainee engagement and public exposure via tailoring of podcast episode lengths and selection of social media platforms with high audience interaction.}

abstract = {Objective
The incidence of headaches with blood stasis syndrome has increased. Herein, we used scientific, statistical methods to explore the medication rules of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) to treat headaches with blood stasis syndrome and provide a scientific and reliable theoretical basis for clinical treatment.
Methods
First, we retrieved studies related to CHMs used to treat headaches with blood stasis syndrome from the VIP, CNKI, Wanfang, and PubMed databases. We used Excel 2013 to establish a database and SPSS Modeler 18.0 and SPSS 25.0 to conduct frequency, association rule, and cluster analyses.
Results
Based on the screening criteria, we retrieved 126 CHM prescriptions for headaches with blood stasis syndrome involving 149 herbs. The top three high-frequency herbs were Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Chuanxiong), Angelica Sinensis Radix (Danggui), and Carthami Flos (Honghua). Blood-activating and stasis-eliminating herbs were the most frequently used herb efficacy categories. The liver meridian represented the most frequently used herb meridian tropism. The properties and taste of herbs were mainly warm and bitter, respectively. We obtained 21 association rules and five new clusters. The Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Chuanxiong) and Angelica Sinensis Radix (Danggui) herb pair had the strongest correlation.
Conclusion
We analyzed published CHM prescriptions for headaches with blood stasis syndrome and eliminated factors that did not reach an agreement, such as herb dosage. We used different data mining and analysis methods to ensure that the method and process were scientific and the conclusion was reliable, comprising a valuable reference for selecting herbs for the clinical treatment of headaches with blood stasis syndrome. The Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZYD) was the primary CHM prescription for headaches with blood stasis syndrome. Xiaoyao San (XYS) and Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) might also be clinical references for treatment selection. Meridian-inducing and insect herbs might be used according to syndromes.}

The oral medicine education for medical students is very important and a necessary part for the comprehensive medical education. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the oral medicine course for medical students by evaluating students' perspectives and the instructor's observation.
Materials and methods
The medical students who took the compulsory course entitled “Introduction to Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine” in MacKay Medical College from 2016 to 2021 were invited to fill out the questionnaire for course satisfaction survey regarding their satisfied level with the course and their feelings about the instructors or suggestions, and the participatory observation was performed throughout the course activities and instructor–student interactions.
Results
From 2016 to 2021, of a total of 268 medical students, 202 (75%) participated in the surveys. The results of the surveys and the instructor's observation showed that students satisfied with the course, and the course helped them to have a basic understanding of oral medicine. Moreover, all the mean scores and the rates of respondents who answered as agree for each item were 4.22–4.92 and 85%–100%, respectively.
Conclusion
In this study, the oral medicine education for medical students contributed to an increase in students' awareness and understanding of oral health and dentistry. Considering the reported effectiveness of the course, students' satisfaction with the course content and teaching materials, and the instructor's teaching, this model of providing dental and oral health knowledge for the medical students may be a good one for further use in other medical institutions.}

Despite these encouraging results, the market for stem cell products yields limited, which is largely due to the challenges faced to the safety and viability of stem cells in vivo. Besides, the fate of cells re-infusion into the body unknown is also a major obstacle to stem cell therapy. Actually, both the functional protection and the fate tracking of stem cells are essential in tissue homeostasis, repair, and regeneration. Recent studies have utilized cell engineering techniques to modify stem cells for enhancing their treatment efficiency or imparting them with novel biological capabilities, in which advances demonstrate the immense potential of engineered cell therapy. In this review, we proposed that the “engineered stem cells” are expected to represent the next generation of stem cell therapies and reviewed recent progress in this area. We also discussed potential applications of engineered stem cells and highlighted the most common challenges that must be addressed. Overall, this review has important guiding significance for the future design of new paradigms of stem cell products to improve their therapeutic efficacy.}

abstract = {Purpose
The cardiac phenotype of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hTTR) usually presents as a restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and, although rarely observed as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), TTR is routinely included in DCM genetic testing panels. However, the prevalence and phenotypes of TTR variants in patients with DCM have not been reported.
Methods
Exome sequences of 729 probands with idiopathic DCM were analyzed for TTR and 35 DCM genes.
Results
Rare TTR variants were identified in 2 (0.5%; 95% CI = 0.1%-1.8%) of 404 non-Hispanic White DCM probands; neither of them had features of hTTR. In 1 proband, a TTR His110Asn variant and a variant of uncertain significance in DSP were identified, and in the other proband, a TTR Val50Met variant known to cause hTTR and a likely pathogenic variant in FLNC were identified. The TTR Val142Ile variant was identified in 8 (3.0%) non-Hispanic Black probands, comparable with African/African American Genome Aggregation Database controls (OR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.46-1.99).
Conclusion
Among the 729 DCM probands, 2 had rare TTR variants identified without the features of hTTR, and both had other plausible genetic causes of DCM. Moreover, the frequency of TTR Val142Ile was comparable to a control sample. These findings suggest that hTTR variants may have a limited role in patients with DCM without TTR-specific findings.}

Objective
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions have been used to cure diseases in China for thousands of years, in which many TCM herbs have no definite common quantity. Some key TCM herbs are commonly used and thus deserve in-depth investigations based on a more acceptable classification method. This study analyzes whether TCM prescriptions follow Zipf's law and attempts to obtain the thresholds of key TCM herbs based on the application of Zipf's law.
Methods
A total of 84,418 TCM prescriptions were collected and standardized. We tested whether Zipf's law and Zipf's distribution fit the Chinese herb distributions. A linear fitting experiment was performed to verify the relationship between the frequency distribution and frequency of TCM herbs.
Results
The distribution of TCM herbs in TCM prescriptions conformed to Zipf's law. Accordingly, the thresholds were obtained for the key TCM herbs.
Conclusion
The distribution of TCM herbs in TCM prescriptions follows Zipf's law.}

Biobanks of linked clinical patient histories and biological samples are an efficient strategy to generate large cohorts for modern genetics research. Biobank recruitment varies by factors such as geographic catchment and sampling strategy, which affect biobank demographics and research utility. Here, we describe the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a single-health-system biobank currently consisting of >91,000 participants recruited primarily during surgical encounters at Michigan Medicine. The surgical enrollment results in a biobank enriched for many diseases and ideally suited for a disease genetics cohort. Compared with the much larger population-based UK Biobank, MGI has higher prevalence for nearly all diagnosis-code-based phenotypes and larger absolute case counts for many phenotypes. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) results replicate known findings, thereby validating the genetic and clinical data. Our results illustrate that opportunistic biobank sampling within single health systems provides a unique and complementary resource for exploring the genetics of complex diseases.}

Pimobendan (PBD), a veterinary drug only, is prescribed in specific cases of chronic heart disease in dogs and is available on the market in only a few different doses. Furthermore, the therapy itself is challenging due to the large size of the chewable tablets and the requirement for twice-daily administration. The development of customised and on-demand PBD medicines by three-dimensional (3D) printing has been proposed to circumvent these disadvantages. In this study, we designed controlled-release flavoured printlets containing PBD. We evaluated the use of two natural polymers, guar or xanthan gums, as the main component of the printing inks. Guar gum showed the better rheological behavior and printability by semisolid extrusion. The printlets were produced in three different shapes and sizes to allow dose customisation. Guar gum printlets showed a PBD controlled release profile, regardless of their shape or size. Therefore, we have demonstrated a novel approach for controlling PBD drug release and tailoring the dose by employing a natural polymer to produce 3D-printed tablets. This study represents a significant step towards the development of 3D-printed guar gum controlled-release formulations for veterinary applications.}

CHF is characterized by reduced cardiac output resulting from neurohumoral dysregulation and cardiac remodeling, which might be related to oxidative stress, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, autophagy, mitochondrial function, and angiogenesis. These molecular mechanisms interact with each other through crosstalk.

Study Objective
Adolescents use long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods less than adults. Practices that specialize in adolescent medicine, including Adolescent Medicine (AM) and Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (PAG), may be well positioned to help improve adolescent access to these methods. We describe administrative and system-level barriers encountered when implementing LARCs for adolescents and strategies that practices have successfully used to address these barriers.
Design/Setting/Participants
We conducted a qualitative study with physicians and staff at AM and PAG practices that provide LARCs to adolescents.
Interventions
Semi-structured telephone interviews
Main Outcome Measures
Interview guides were based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), an implementation science methodology designed to understand the following aspects of settings adopting new practices: innovation characteristics, external environment, institutional and practice settings, the stakeholders involved, and the implementation process.
Results
Seventeen interviews were performed. When examining administrative and system-level challenges encountered by interviewees, the four CFIR constructs identified most frequently were cost, readiness for implementation–available resources, planning, and engaging. Interviewees shared strategies used to overcome these common barriers, including for billing and working with insurance companies, space and equipment needed to introduce LARCs, scheduling and use of telemedicine, and staff training and engagement.
Conclusion
Sites used many strategies to address these common challenges to implementation. Examples could help with implementation of LARC provision in practices serving adolescent populations.}

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) impose a significant burden worldwide. Despite the elucidation of the etiology and underlying molecular mechanisms of CVDs by numerous studies and recent discovery of effective drugs, their morbidity, disability, and mortality are still high. Therefore, precise risk stratification and effective targeted therapies for CVDs are warranted. Recent improvements in single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have improved our understanding of the mechanisms and cells involved in cardiovascular phylogeny and CVDs. Single-cell RNA sequencing can facilitate the study of the human heart at remarkably high resolution and cellular and molecular heterogeneity. However, this technique does not provide spatial information, which is essential for understanding homeostasis and disease. Spatial transcriptomics can elucidate intracellular interactions, transcription factor distribution, cell spatial localization, and molecular profiles of mRNA and identify cell populations causing the disease and their underlying mechanisms, including cell crosstalk. Herein, we introduce the main methods of RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics analysis and highlight the latest advances in cardiovascular research. We conclude that single-cell RNA sequencing interprets disease progression in multiple dimensions, levels, perspectives, and dynamics by combining spatial and temporal characterization of the clinical phenome with multidisciplinary techniques such as spatial transcriptomics. This aligns with the dynamic evolution of CVDs (e.g., "angina–myocardial infarction–heart failure" in coronary artery disease). The study of pathways for disease onset and mechanisms (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) in different patient subgroups should improve disease diagnosis and risk stratification. This can facilitate precise individualized treatment of CVDs.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to revise the Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (Elderly Edition) (CCMQ-EE), as well as evaluate its reliability and validity. The objective was to provide a more accurate Chinese medicine constitution identification tool for geriatric health management and help further research on the relationship between geriatric diseases and constitution type, etc.
Methods
The Delphi method and a cross-sectional survey of the elderly population were used. From April to October 2021, experts in different fields were invited to participate in the questionnaire, and items were revised through the experts’ ratings and feedback. From December 2021 to February 2022, the revised CCMQ-EE was validated in the elderly population.
Results
The coefficients of variation of rationality and importance scores decreased to less than 0.25 in the third round of Delphi. The Kendall coordination coefficients of rationality and importance in the third round were 0.15 and 0.17 (P = .031 and P = .007, respectively). The revised CCMQ-EE was established with 34 items. The factor loadings of subscales were between 0.39 and 0.92, and the fitting effects of other subscales were acceptable, except for the inherited special constitution. The Cronbach alpha and test–retest reliability coefficients of each subscale ranged from 0.65 to 0.83, and 0.66 to 0.96, respectively. The composite reliability and average variance extraction were between 0.66 and 0.84, and between 0.32 and 0.57, respectively. The reliability and validity of the revised CCMQ-EE were acceptable or satisfactory.
Conclusion
The revised CCMQ-EE was developed through a three-round Delphi process and internal team discussion. After the verification in the elderly in Beijing area, its measurement performance was good. The updated questionnaire can probably replace the initial version to better promote health management and help healthy aging by identifying the constitution type of the elderly.}

The 2023 Match saw over 500 unfilled positions in emergency medicine (EM). Geographic location is the third most important factor for all United States (US) EM-bound senior medical students when selecting programs to rank and can be affected by political climate. Given the perceived importance of geography on program selection and recent changes to reproductive rights in the US, we sought to evaluate the impact of geography and reproductive rights on unmatched positions among EM programs.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study assessing Match rates in EM by program US state, region, and degree of reproductive rights. We included all EM programs participating in the 2023 Match year. Our primary outcome was to determine the unfilled programs and positions rate per US state. Secondary outcomes included Match rates by region and by degree of reproductive rights.
Results
We found notable differences in unfilled programs by US state, with the highest percentage of unfilled programs and positions in Arkansas (100%, 56.3%), Nevada (100%, 35.5%), Kansas (100%, 40.0%), Ohio (81.3%, 33.3%), and Michigan (80.0%, (36.8%). Among regions, the highest percentage of unfilled programs (62.5%) and residency positions (26.0%) was East North Central (IL, IN, MI, OH, WI). US states with limited reproductive rights had the highest percent (52.9%) of programs with unmatched positions and the highest percent (20.5%) of unfilled positions.
Conclusion
We identified notable differences in unmatched positions by US state and region, as well as the highest rate of unmatched positions in US states with more limited reproductive rights.}

abstract = {Objectives
There exists a deficiency in a distinct understanding of the intervention effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) exercise therapies (Tai Chi, Yi Jin Jing, Ba Duan Jin, Liu Zi Jue, Qigong, Wu Qin Xi etc.) on cognitive function and its moderating variables in the elderly. This study aims to systematically evaluate the effects of TCM exercise therapies on the cognitive function of the elderly and further propose the best exercise intervention programme to delay the cognitive decline of the elderly.
Methods
PubMed, EBSCO host, Web of Science, EMbase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang databases were searched for the effects of TCM exercise therapies on the cognitive function in older adults until July 2022. A meta-analysis of the included literature was performed using Stata 12.0 software, with a subgroup analysis of seven moderating variables: subject type, intervention content, intervention duration, intervention frequency, intervention period, study type and sample size. A random effects model was used to combine the overall effect sizes and to test for heterogeneity and publication bias across studies.
Results
A total of 20 publications with 1975 subjects were included. The TCM exercise therapies delayed cognitive decline in older adults (d = 0.83; 95 % CI [0.62–1.04]; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis found that intervention content, intervention duration, intervention frequency, and intervention period were significant moderating variables influencing the effectiveness of the intervention. Among them, the Ba Duan Jin intervention (d = 0.85; 95 % CI [0.65–1.06]; P < 0.001), the duration of each exercise session of 60 min or more (d = 0.86; 95 % CI [0.71–1.00]; P < 0.001), the frequency of exercise of more than 5 times per week (d = 0.80; 95 % CI [0.64–0.96]; P < 0.001) and exercise cycles of 6–9 months (d = 0.96; 95 % CI [0.80–1.12]; P < 0.001) produced the largest effect sizes.
Conclusion
TCM exercise therapies can effectively improve the cognitive function of the elderly. The best effect on the cognitive function of the elderly was achieved by choosing Ba Duan Jin and exercising at least five times a week for at least 60 min each time for a total of 6–9 months. The effect size of the TCM exercise therapy interventions on the cognitive function in older adults may be overestimated because of publication bias. In addition, large-sample, multicenter, high-quality randomised controlled trials should be conducted to validate this result.}

In current IVF practice, metaphase-2 (M2) oocytes are considered most efficient in producing good quality embryos. Maximizing their number at all ages is standard clinical practice, while immature germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes are mostly automatically discarded. We present preliminary evidence that oocyte maturity grades with advancing age significantly change in their abilities to produce good quality embryos, with M2 oocytes significantly declining, GV oocytes improving, and M1 oocytes staying the same. These data contradict the over-40-year-old dogma that oocyte grades functionally do not change with advancing age, supporting potential changes to current IVF practice: (1) Stimulation protocols and timing of oocyte retrieval can be adjusted to a patient’s age and ovarian function. (2) In older and younger women with prematurely aging ovaries, GV oocytes may no longer be automatically discarded. (3) In some infertile women, rescue in vitro maturation of immature oocytes may delay the need for third-party egg donation.}

The removal of dye obeyed First-order rate kinetics (k1 = 0.35 min−1) with an electrical energy consumption of 0.15 kWh/m3. Further, around 54 ± 3.8% of chemical oxygen demand and 38.5 ± 4.3% total organic carbon removal was also obtained corresponding to 25 mg/L of initial CBB concentration. The FTIR revealed no leaching of plastic into the solution from the wrappers. The phytotoxicity of W-EC effluent on green gram revealed 6.6 and 13 −folds more increment in shoot and root length, respectively, than untreated influent. Thus, the utilisation of waste medicine wrapper directly as electrodes in the EC not only provides a sustainable step for waste management, but it can also help to minimize the treatment cost of the EC process.}

abstract = {Over the past years, healthcare methodologies were commonly applied to all patients affected by the same pathology as an overall treatment. However, recent scientific works were mainly aimed at personalized care, according to the patient’s clinical conditions and morphological characteristics. Pediatric surgery was also involved in this process, although laparoscopy has been set aside so far. In this regard, the physical characteristic that correlates intra-abdominal pressure and intra-abdominal volume (i.e., abdominal com-pliance) was always studied as a unique curve. This work aims to propose an alternative approach to treat laparoscopy surgery and abdominal compli-ance for pediatric individuals, which is based on personalized medicine. We perform an exploratory data analysis considering a real dataset, in order to study the data model (i.e., descriptive univariate and multivariate analysis) and the predictors (i.e., variance thresholding, Shapiro-Wilk test, Pearson’s correlation coefficient) that will allow physicians to build clusters of pediatric individuals. Data analysis proves that there are strong correlations among features referring to thorax circumference and xifo-bisialic lenght with the sum of thorax and pelvis volumes. This leads to identify the optimal number of clusters through the Elbow method.}

abstract = {Introduction
The advancement and advocacy of the 3R principle and safety evaluation and risk assessment technology has given rise to an innovative method on a global scale, which known as the Next Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA). This progressive approach adopts a tiered assessment strategy based on prepositive hypothesis and exposure analysis. Unlike traditional risk assessment methods that rely on toxicological endpoint animal tests, NGRA lays emphasis on evaluating the exposure process by outlining the mechanisms and significant key events leading to adverse outcomes. The NGRA process entails prioritizing the robust high-throughput screening and prediction tools to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and relevance of the assessment.
Result
This review provides an overview of the principles, framework, and tools of NGRA as recommended by the International Cosmetics Regulatory Cooperation Organization (ICCR). Furthermore, the review encompasses published case studies of cosmetics ingredients and elucidates the potential applications and technical challenges associated with NGRA while considering the extant safety evaluation requirements for cosmetics ingredients in China. Moreover, the review synthesizes a selection of case studies of cosmetics ingredients and hope to proffer implications for the assessment of risk in traditional Chinese medicine.
Conclusion
It was hoped to help researchers to investigate novel techniques of safety risk assessment and propose research concepts for both cosmetics and traditional Chinese medicine.}

Technological advancements have enabled a holistic study of the individual “omic” levels, allowing collective characterization and quantification of intrinsic mechanisms related to clinical manifestations of pathophysiological processes. Although still in its infancy, “multiomics” possess the potential to establish patient-specific disease-related trends to guide decision-making on a large system-wide scale. In the current chapter, we present the available evidence for the application of the various “omic” levels in medicine, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and others, and evaluate their integration into clinical practice. Currently, a limited number of “multiomic” models outperform traditional clinical practice, mainly due to the associated challenges in “multiomic” research. Innovative and technological solutions to the inherent analytical and computational challenges are required to facilitate the incorporation of “multiomics” in contemporary medicine. In this chapter, we evaluate the associated barriers and discuss respective potential solutions for overcoming difficulties and achieving the implementation of precision medicine. Unraveling the highly complicated role of “multiomics” will unveil meaningful insights into human disease processes, ultimately informing decision-making and shaping clinical guidelines and practices.}

In this study, we fabricated two customized nuclear medicine phantoms using a three-dimensional (3D) printing technique with lead and copper materials, which were acquired with efficient gamma rays owing to their higher physical density. The customized phantom was designed with six spheres, each with different diameters, using the fusion 360 software. In addition, a customized phantom was printed using a 3D printer created by Ultimaker after slicing using the CURA software. The gamma images according to lead-based and copper-based customized phantoms were obtained with the technetium-99 m radioisotope of 1 mCi at 50 kcounts. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were applied to evaluate the image quality. The SNR and CNR values for the lead-based customized phantom image were higher (1.11 and 1.21 times higher than those of the copper-based customized phantom image, respectively). We confirmed the possibility of an alternative nuclear medicine phantom based on the 3D printing technique, as well as the reasonable price and reorganization of conventional structures. In addition, the image quality of the lead-based customized phantom was superior to that of the copper-based customized phantom images.}

Muscle atrophy represents a significant clinical challenge, involving the continued loss of muscle mass and strength, which frequently accompany the development of numerous types of cancer. Cancer cachexia is a highly prevalent multifactorial syndrome, and although cachexia is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths, there are still no approved management strategies for the disease. The etiology of this condition is based on the upregulation of systemic inflammation factors and catabolic stimuli, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis and enhancement of protein degradation. Numerous necessary cellular processes are disrupted by cachectic pathology, which mediate intracellular signalling pathways resulting in the net loss of muscle and organelles. However, the exact underpinning molecular mechanisms of how these changes are orchestrated are incompletely understood. Much work is still required, but structured exercise has the capacity to counteract numerous detrimental effects linked to cancer cachexia. Primarily through the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis, enhancement of mitochondrial function, and the release of myokines. As a result, muscle mass and strength increase, leading to improved mobility, and quality-of-life. This review summarises existing knowledge of the complex molecular networks that regulate cancer cachexia and exercise, highlighting the molecular interplay between the two for potential therapeutic intervention. Finally, the utility of mass spectrometry-based proteomics is considered as a way of establishing early diagnostic biomarkers of cachectic patients.}

In Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, medicines with spleen- and kidney-nourishing effects are commonly used in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) treatment. Aikeqing (AKQ) is a compound Chinese medicinal granule with spleen- and kidney-nourishing effects. Herein, we investigate the in vitro and in vivo anti-osteoporotic effects of AKQ, its underlying mechanisms and pharmacodynamic basis. In vitro antiosteoporotic effects of AKQ were assessed by its ability to promote osteoblastogenesis in MC3T3-E1 and/or inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in murine bone marrow monocytes (BMMs). The protective effect of AKQ on bone loss induced by oestrogen deficiency was evaluated in ovariectomized rats. The underlying mechanisms were studied in BMMs by detecting the effects of AKQ on the RANKL-induced expression of genes and proteins involved in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. The main chemical constituents of AKQ in the granule were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS. Our findings show that AKQ did not affect osteoblastogenesis, but it inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. In the ovariectomized rats, oral administration of AKQ (4 g/kg/d) for 90 d effectively prevented oestrogen deficiency-induced bone loss. Mechanistic studies in BMMs revealed that AKQ inhibited RNAKL-induced activation of NF-κB (p65) and MAPKs (p38 and JNK) via blocking the RANK-TRAF6 interaction, subsequently suppressing the translocation and expression of NFATc1 and c-Fos. UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis quantified the 123 main components of AKQ. Taken together, AKQ was demonstrated for the first time as a novel alternative therapy for osteoclast-associated bone diseases.}

abstract = {Summary
Screening for sarcopenia is a growing public health issue since associated with functional alterations and an increase in morbidity and mortality.
Objective
To analyze the prevalence of decreased muscle strength (dynapenia) in patients aged 18 to 74 in community medicine, as measured in the general practitioner's office, and to assess the prevalence of undernutrition in this population.
Method
Muscle strength was measured with a Hand Grip (HG) dynamometer according to European recommended thresholds and French guidelines. Malnutrition was defined according to the GLIM criteria.
Results
Of 341 patients, 303 were evaluated (89%): mean age was 47.8 ± 17.4 years, including 51.2% women, 103 with an acute disease (AD) and 200 with a chronic disease (CD). 23.5% were below the 10th percentile threshold in the CD group and 19.4% in the AD group. For these patients, muscle age, evaluated on the median values for age, was higher by 39.3 ± 15.2 years for men and by 41.5 ± 13.6 years for women. Maximum HG values were significantly correlated with changes in International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) score (F = 10.22; p = 0.0017) and weight changes (%) (F = 5.30; p = 0.0227) in women only, regardless of age, BMI, disease, professional status or type of work (manual or not); 19.1% suffered from malnutrition (10.9% Stage 1 and 8.3% Stage 2), with 20.0% in the CD group and 17.4% in the AD group.
Conclusion
This study highlights the feasibility of screening for sarcopenia in primary care community medicine. The prevalence of dynapenia in the studied population (nearly one in 5 patients) and the observed higher-than-expected undernutrition (17.5%) justify their screening for appropriate management care.

abstract = {Study objective
Over the past 2 decades, podcasting has become an easy and inexpensive way to disseminate information. Given the increasing importance of podcasts in medicine and medical education, it is important to understand the current status of diverse voices on podcasts. The primary objective of this study was to describe the distribution of women and men as hosts and guest speakers among 3 popular emergency medicine podcasts across a 10-year period. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association between host gender and speaker gender.
Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study of the gender distribution of hosts and guest speakers among 3 popular emergency medicine podcasts from July 2011 to June 2021. Data were extracted and their gender determined using pronouns listed in their faculty profiles or using Genderize. The data were presented descriptively using subanalyses by year and the type of speaker. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the likelihood of a single host predicting a speaker’s gender.
Results
We identified 2,834 podcasts (n=5,962 speakers), with 964 (16.2%) women and 4,996 (83.8%) men speakers. Among hosts, 10.2% were women and 89.8% were men, whereas among guest speakers, 23.4% were women and 76.5% were men. The distribution of women speakers increased from 9.1% in 2011 to 23.1% in 2021. Having a woman host had an OR of 2.40 (95% CI 1.72 to 3.34) for having a woman guest speaker, whereas having a man host had an OR of 0.42 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.58) for having a woman guest speaker.
Conclusion
Among the 3 popular emergency medicine podcasts, there are few women speakers, hosts, and guest speakers; however, the proportion has risen over the past 10 years.}

Red mini-waffle shapes containing drug loads of 2, 5 and 8 mg were successfully printed. This new 3D design allow to release more than 80 % of the drug in 45 min indicating a conventional release like the one obtained with capsules. Mass and content uniformity, hardness and friability tests complied with European Pharmacopeia specifications, despite the considerable challenge of the small dimensions of the forms. This study demonstrates that FDM can be used to produce innovative pediatric-friendly printed shapes of an advanced pharmaceutical quality to practice personalize medicine.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a well-established medical system with a long history. However, the overall concept and systematic thinking in TCM are not comprehensively understood and applied in its inheritance and development.
Objective
This study aims to provide a basic theory for TCM diagnosis using systematics as the guiding principle. Using modern scientific and technological achievements, we aim to explore a new TCM diagnosis method.
Methods
We analyzed previous studies on TCM diagnosis and treatment, and reviewed clinical research on TCM diagnosis and treatment from the viewpoint of systematics. We propose a new process model based on systematics for TCM diagnosis and treatment. This is a generalized model that summarizes the process of “establishing an image to express meaning”.
Results
The proposed model was implemented in the clinical practice of TCM. We monitored the detailed treatment process of patients in the Department of Liver Diseases at Beijing Hospital. One patient underwent a treatment program that lasted 1 year and 45 days, consisting of 12 iterative cycles, each guided by the proposed diagnostic model and tailored to the patient's evolving condition. This case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed model in the diagnosis and treatment of liver disease in TCM. The therapeutic efficacy has been validated through the examination of both TCM indicators and Western medical auxiliary parameters. Among these, the TCM indicators consist of 2 components: tongue diagnosis and pulse diagnosis. Meanwhile, the Western medical auxiliary indicators encompass a range of assessments, including whole blood cell analysis, professional liver function examination, a series of liver function assessments, a high-sensitivity hepatitis B pentathlete test, as well as color Doppler ultrasound evaluations of the liver, bile duct, pancreas, spleen, and assessments of liver elasticity, among other related examination parameters. In conclusion, it is evident that the syndrome of liver depression and spleen deficiency has significantly diminished, and the viral load has decreased to levels below the detectable threshold, thereby confirming the restoration of normal liver function. These findings indicate that the disease is now under control.
Conclusions
In this study, we applied the guiding principle of systematics to the study of TCM diagnosis and treatment, and combined it with modern medical technology. We proposed a TCM diagnosis and treatment process model, and a TCM model to establish an image, which can effectively support the diagnosis and treatment of TCM diseases. We illustrated the effectiveness of these models by applying them to TCM liver disease.}

Special approval medicines (SAMs) are medicines used with approval from the Director General of Health Malaysia when the therapeutic options within regulatory and formulary boundaries appear unsuitable or ineffective to treat the patients.
Objectives
To examine and characterize the use of SAMs among children in a Malaysian tertiary care hospital.
Methods
The named-patient basis SAM application forms, cover letter, pharmacist review summary and patient monitoring forms available at the Pharmacy Department between 1st January 2019 and 31st December 2020 were reviewed. Unprocessed, unapproved and stock-basis applications were excluded. The outcome measures were categories, scope, off-label use and cost of SAM. Per-patient data were analyzed descriptively.
Results
Overall, 1010 patients (mean age of 8.7 ± 5.6 years) were involved in 328 SAMs applications. The most common SAMs pharmacological groups were nervous system (n = 371, 36.7%) and antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (n = 332, 32.9%). Top three SAMs were melatonin (11.5%), scopolamine (7.6%) and cholecalciferol (7.1%). A total of 837 (82.9%) and 513 (50.8%) patients were involved in the SAMs applications for non-formulary and unregistered medicines, respectively. Unregistered, non-formulary medicines were applied for 47.3% (n = 478) of the patients. The majority of the scope for SAMs (64.7%) were to substitute the available alternatives in the national formulary which were ineffective or sub-optimal for the patients. Among the 262 patients with repeat applications, 93.8% reported disease or symptom improvement while 1.9% experienced side effects. Up to 17% of SAMs analyzed in this study were used for off-label indications. The total cost of the SAMs was RM8,748,358.38 (USD 2,090,418.86).
Conclusion
The use of SAMs among children in this hospital involved unregistered, non-formulary medicines used to substitute the available alternatives in the formulary. A concerted effort is warranted in exploring supplementary mechanisms to enhance the medicine registration process and formulary system towards facilitating enhanced provision of treatment for children.}

With the emergency medicine speciality in its nascency in Africa, EM doctoral programmes will need to be developed to facilitate the establishment of an evidence base that is responsive to the African populace. This study aimed to understand the thoughts, experiences, and opinions of current and past candidates of a South African EM PhD programme.
Methods
Descriptive, qualitative, semi-structured interviews were used to gather data on PhD EM candidates and graduates.
Findings
Four candidates, and four graduates were interviewed. Four categories emerged from the data 1) interviewees had various motivations for starting a PhD in EM, 2) candidate expectations and learning needs were not always aligned with reality, and the challenges and opportunities for success in the PhD programme are related both 3) intrinsically (candidate) and 4) extrinsically (system).
Discussion
Many of the barriers noted by the participants can be related to the nascency of the EM in Africa. Participants felt underprepared for their doctorate in terms of their baseline research literacy and skill. Candidates did not receive the level of student-supervisor engagement they desired. Candidates who are also clinicians faced both academic challenges and a resource-limited healthcare system. Pre-doctoral training may upskill prospective candidates in research literacy before they officially register. Distance-learning can be sub-optimal in terms of social interaction and collaboration. A well-curriculated, competency-based programme with clear outcomes, structured teaching-learning opportunities, intentional academic support throughout the programme, can mitigate the above. Protected academic time, promotion criteria which acknowledges academic contributions, financial incentives and more joint positions between universities and clinical services are potential solutions for clinician researcher challenges. An African PhD EM programme should produce graduates who are independent researchers, skilled in academic supervision and who are impactful to African needs when contributing to the African EM knowledge economy.}

Effect of HTC temperature, HTC duration, and feedwater pH on the mass yield and properties of HAs was examined. The associated formation mechanism of HAs during HTC was proposed. The combustion performance of remained hydrochar after HAs extraction was evaluated. Results show that the positive correlation between hydrochar yield and HAs yield is observed. According to three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (3D EEM) fluorescence intensity, the best quality of HAs is achieved with a yield of 8.17 % at feedwater pH of 13 and HTC temperature of 200 °C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses show abundant aromatic and aliphatic structure as well as oxygenated functional groups in HAs, which is like commercial HAs (HA-C). Besides, in terms of comprehensive combustion index (CCI), HTC can improve the combustion performance of CMR, while it becomes a bit worse after HAs extraction. Higher weighted mean apparent activation energy (Em) of hydrochar indicating its highly thermal stability. HAs extraction reduces Em and CCI of remained hydrochar. However, it can be regarded a potential renewable energy. This work confirms a more sustainable alternative way for CMR comprehensive utilization in near future.}

The major underlying factors that contribute to such malignancies include tumor microenvironment, genetic alterations, changes at the cellular level and most of all the heterogeneity of tumors. Recent advances in the field of oncology have prompted a mechanistic understanding of the human genome which is responsible for such alterations, upon which the therapy would be designed. Such an approach that administers drugs by targeting the molecular changes is attributed to precision medicine. Precision medicine helps design therapy as per the requirement of patients based on the sharing of similar complex tumor environments. This revolutionized approach would help in early detection, better targeting, improved patient compliance and survival along with much reduced toxicity otherwise evidenced in conventional cancer therapy. This review discusses the cause of MDR, highlighting the role of precision medicine in overcoming such critical events. Major limitations and future prospects are also highlighted.}

IS-MEs co-loaded with ICT and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were prepared by water titration method. The particle size of IS-MEs was 27.97 ± 0.25 nm, encapsulation efficiency was 97.18%, and presented a regular sphere under TEM. BSP/PNIPAM was prepared by free radical polymerization, which has good biocompatibility, excellent procoagulant function and dense microstructure. The low critical solution temperature (LCST) of ISBP was 30 °C, which had excellent in vitro injection performance. The microscopic morphology of ISBP was loose and porous, the long-acting sustained-release time could reach 144 h, and the maximum ICT release was (48.6 ± 8.5) %. IPSBs with SPIONs exhibit desirable imaging properties and macrophage M1 polarization function. During the rabbit renal artery embolization, ISBP showed excellent distal vascular embolization performance and there was no obstruction or adhesion of the catheter. These results suggest that a novel in situ multifunctional traditional Chinese medicine thermosensitive microemulsion gel embolic agent has been developed with a potential application as a liquid embolic solution for TACE.}

abstract = {Background
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental illness that can place a significant burden on individuals, their families, and society. East Asian Herbal Medicine (EAHM) has long been used in East Asian nations to treat mental illness in children. Nevertheless, the evidence for the effectiveness of EAHM for the treatment of ADHD is insufficient. A systematic review was performed to examine the effectiveness and safety. In addition, research on core herbal combinations was also conducted to help clinicians in their prescription selection.
Materials and methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis were prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The following databases were searched: 4 English databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), EMBASE), 4 Korean databases (Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), Research Information Service System (RISS), Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), Korea Citation Index (KCI)), 2 Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Wanfang Data), and 1 Japanese database (CiNii) database. The publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. GRADE pro was used to evaluate the evidence of the study. The core herb combination of EAHM used in this study was revealed using apriori algorithm-based association rule mining.
Results
This review assessed 42 studies that evaluated 3484 children and adolescents. In meta-analysis, EAHM monotherapy had a similar clinical efficacy rate to conventional medicine (CM) (n = 2166; random effects RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.13; heterogeneity χ2= 25.08, df = 23, p = 0.35, I2=8%). EAHM-combined therapy showed a better clinical efficacy rate than when conventional therapy was used alone (n = 746; fixed effects RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.26; heterogeneity χ2= 11.80, df = 9, p = 0.22, I2=24%). For adverse events, EAHM had a lower incidence than conventional therapy. In GRADE pro, each outcome varied from moderate to very low quality. The constituents of the herb combinations with consistent association rules were Fossilia Ossis Mastodi, Polygalae Radix, and Acori Graminei Rhizoma.
Conclusion
EAHM monotherapy has similar effects to CM but with fewer side effects. Hence, it will be helpful for children with ADHD suffering from the side effects of CM. EAHM-combined therapy has a better effect than conventional therapy. Accordingly, it will be useful for children with ADHD who do not respond to treatment with conventional therapy. Nevertheless, more well-designed studies will be needed to confirm this in the future.}

In this work, an improved “Safoof-e-Nesyān” formulation described in the “Qarābādin-e-Azam” pharmacopoeia was developed, and its chemical composition and antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase properties were assessed. The formulation contains a mixture (FM) of Cinnamomum cassia (CC), C. verum (CV), Pistacia lentiscus (PL), Rheum palmatum (RP), Syzygium aromaticum (SA), and Zingiber officinalis (ZO) powdered plants. Its total phenolic content is 110.45 mg GAE/g, while the total flavonoid content is 6.28 mg RE/g. 66 secondary metabolites (mainly tannins, flavonoids, anthraquinones, and gingerols) were identified by UPLC-QToF-MS analysis. FM exerts antioxidant effects by scavenging radicals, and by reducing and chelating metals such as Mb, Cu and Fe. The anticholinesterase activity of one gram of the FM equals that of 3.60 mg of the reference drug galantamine, on both acetyl- and butyryl-cholinesterase. Correlations between specific compounds and bioactivities were highlighted by multivariate analysis of data: lyoniresinol 9′-glucoside strongly correlates with antiradical activities on DPPH and ABTS and reducing activity on Cu, and with anti-AChE effects. Most of the identified flavonoids and the ellagic acid derivatives positively correlate with the reducing activity on Fe and Mb, and with anti-BChE effects. Finally, a tablet formulation of the FM was developed, and its physical properties were preliminarily assessed. Overall, our results indicate that the FM may be a useful natural remedy for dementia, although further safety and efficacy assessments in vivo are required.}

Subsequently, the dual-wavelength fusion fingerprint was obtained to avoid the limitations of a single wavelength. In addition, an electrochemical fingerprint (ECFP) was obtained to assess the similarity of electroactive components in the sample, and the Differential Scanning Calorimetry quantized fingerprint (DSC QFP) was introduced for thermal analysis. Fingerprint-efficacy correlations between PL-EC* and dual-wavelength fusion fingerprint (DWFFP) provided valuable insights that there are 76.6 % of the fingerprint compounds exhibited electroactivity. Finally, samples were classified into grades 1∼3 by combining DWFFP, ECFP and DSC QFP through the mean method, meeting the evaluation standard (SL−M > 0.9, PL−M between 80 % and 120 %). This study provides valuable information for ensuring the quality of TCM products, which represents a significant step forward in enhancing the reliability and authenticity of TCM products.}

This was a case control study of ED visits for patients <22 years of age, with an assigned Emergency Severity Index (ESI) score of 4 or 5, and associated hospital admission, nebulized treatment, supplemental oxygen, and/or intravenous (IV) line placement, between January 1, 2018, to June 30, 2022. Controls were sampled from a pool of patient visits with an ESI score of 3, matched by intervention, disposition, and date and hour of arrival. Primary outcome measures were time to order of intervention (nebulized treatment, oxygen administration, or IV placement) and time to disposition decision. A secondary outcome measure was return visits requiring admission or emergency intervention within 14 days of the index visit. Continuous variables (time to orders) were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test and dichotomous outcomes (return visits) were compared using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Analysis was performed with Python v3.10.
Results
The final analysis included 7245 undertriaged patients. Undertriaged patients had longer times to orders for nebulized treatments, (p < 0.001) IV placement, (p < 0.001) and admission (p < 0.001) when compared to controls. There were no significant differences in time to supplemental oxygen delivery and time to discharge compared to controls. Undertriaged patients were more likely to experience a return visit requiring admission or emergency intervention (OR 3.74, 95% CI 3.32,4.22).
Conclusions
Undertriage in the pediatric ED is associated with delays in care and disposition decisions and increases likelihood of return visits.}
