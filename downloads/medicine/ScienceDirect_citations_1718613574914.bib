Several biomaterials including scaffolds and hydrogels have been reported in cardiovascular and orthopedic-related medical conditions. However, their applications in gynecology are very limited. With this aim, the proposed review article exhibits the importance of biomaterials, such as alginate, chitosan, collagen, and fibrin-based hydrogels and 3D scaffolds for tissue engineering in female reproductive organs. These biomaterials have previously been reported in the functionalization of the nano-drug delivery system for targeted delivery. However, their role directly as therapeutic molecules is a new area under study and has not been studied in detail in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Therefore, here we summarized the importance and applications of biomaterials in regenerative medicine for PCOS therapy. The initial section of the review focused on the pathophysiology of PCOS and the limitations of conventionally prescribed treatment therapy. In respect of ovarian environmental conditions, the role and regenerative properties of mentioned biomaterials are explained in the next section of the review followed by futuristic prospects for effective PCOS treatment.}

abstract = {Context
Given the high prevalence of burdensome symptoms in palliative care (PC) and increasing use of complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) therapies, research is needed to determine how often and what types of CIM therapies providers recommend to manage symptoms in PC.
Objectives
To document recommendation rates of CIM for target symptoms and assess if, CIM use varies by provider characteristics.
Methods
Nationwide survey's of physicians (MD and DO), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners in PC.
Results
Participants (N = 404) were mostly female (71.3%), physicians (74.9%), and cared for adults (90.4%). Providers recommended CIM an average of 6.82 times per-month (95% CI: 6.04–7.60) and used an average of 5.13 (95% CI: 4.90–5.36) out of 10 CIM modalities. Respondents recommended mind-body medicines (e.g., meditation, biofeedback) most, followed by massage, and acupuncture and/or acupressure. The most targeted symptoms included pain; followed by anxiety, mood disturbance, and distress. Recommendation frequencies for specific modality-for-symptom combinations ranged from little use (e.g., aromatherapy for constipation) to occasional use (e.g., mind-body interventions for psychiatric symptoms). Finally, recommendation rates increased as a function of pediatric practice, noninpatient practice setting, provider age, and proportion of effort spent delivering palliative care.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first national survey to characterize PC providers’ CIM recommendation behaviors and assess specific therapies and common target symptoms. Providers recommended a broad range of CIM but do so less frequently than patients report using CIM. These findings should be of interest to any provider caring for patients with serious illness.}

Since many plants have been shown to contain powerful antimicrobial compounds that can act synergistically or alternatively to antibiotics, the demand for herbal medicines has recently increased to co-treat microbes that are resistant to antibiotics. Maximum benefit can be achieved when the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of natural products match the antibiotic. This review article refers to nine highly effective and key herbs to use alongside antibiotics to overcome crises of antibiotic resistance. Their unique molecular mechanisms of action have been highlighted.}

abstract = {Purpose
(1) To compare the total number and dollar amount of industry funding and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding to academic orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons and (2) to examine the impact of academic influence on industry funding and NIH funding to academic orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons.
Methods
Academic orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons were identified using faculty web pages. Academic influence was approximated by a physician’s Hirsch index (h index) and number of publications and obtained from the Scopus database. Total industry payments were acquired through the Open Payments Database, and NIH funding was determined from the NIH website. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlations with significance set at P < .05.
Results
Physicians who received industry research payments and NIH funding had a significantly higher mean h index and more mean total publications than physicians who did not receive industry research payments and NIH funding. There were no significant differences in h index (P = .374) or number of publications (P = .126) between surgeons receiving industry nonresearch funding and those who did not. h Index and number of publications were both weakly correlated with the amount of industry research and nonresearch funding.
Conclusion
Although academic influence is associated with industry research funding and NIH funding, there is no association between measures of academic influence and total industry and industry nonresearch payments. Combined with the weak associations between academic influence and the amount of industry payments, academic influence does not appear to be a major determinant of industry funding to academic orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons.
Clinical Relevance
Surgeons should be cognizant of potential conflicts with industry, but the relationship between academic sports medicine surgeons and industry may be less subject to bias than previously believed.}

abstract = {Ferroptosis, which has attracted much attention, is a new form of regulated cell death that is closely associated with the progression of various diseases. Ferroptosis is dependent upon intracellular iron and reactive oxygen species and is morphologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct from other nonapoptotic forms of cell death. Cumulative evidence shows that ferroptosis plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of tumorigenesis. Ferroptosis induction has become a potential effective strategy in cancer prevention and treatment in the clinic. Thus, it is worth identifying the active chemical compounds that induce ferroptosis for cancer suppression. Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs), which contain a host of bioactive phytochemicals that could target many signaling pathways, have been increasingly used worldwide due to their effects against various diseases. Compelling evidence has demonstrated that many phytochemicals from CHMs exert potent anticarcinogenic effects and have been widely used for the clinical prevention and treatment of a variety of cancers. Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that phytochemicals could exhibit potent inhibitory effects against different cancers by inducing ferroptosis through the regulation of a large number of ferroptosis-related signaling pathways and targets. Herein, we summarized the current understanding of phytochemicals from CHMs in ferroptosis-mediated cancer prevention and treatment and the molecular mechanisms. We also concluded with potential applications of emerging ferroptosis-related strategies against cancer. This study may expand our current knowledge about the mechanisms of phytochemicals from CHMs as anticancer agents, which could be used clinically to enhance the effect of future ferroptosis-inducing CHM therapies against cancers.}

Due to its persistent growth and ever-expanding outreach, Twitter (X) is facilitating dissemination of scientific information including complex medical knowledge leading the way in collaborations, and in organizing and networking of various health care professionals, patients, and caregivers with shared medical interests. While there are several advantages of Twitter (X) as an important tool in our contemporary medical armamentarium, there are also some drawbacks. False information can be distributed effortlessly and can entrench unscientific beliefs as there is no peer-review process. Occasionally, discourteous discussions between health care professionals can be misinterpreted by users with limited medical knowledge. Other disadvantages include Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act violations and hacking of accounts. Therefore, it is imperative for health care professionals interested to use this valuable tool to be familiar with and cautious about its potential risks and limitations.}

abstract = {Background
Idiopathic short stature (ISS) is a common problem in children and causes many economic and social burdens. In Asian countries, East Asian traditional medicine (EATM) therapies are widely used for children with ISS. In this study, we compared and ranked various EATM therapies for the treatment of pediatric ISS using network meta-analysis.
Methods
Randomized controlled trials that evaluated various EATMs for pediatric ISS were found through searching 14 electronic databases. The primary outcome was growth velocity (GV). The comparative effectiveness of the treatments was ranked based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and the risk of bias was assessed. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach.
Results
Fourteen studies comprising 1,066 participants were included. HM plus GH showed statistically significant superiority over other EATM therapies including acupuncture (weighted mean difference (WMD) 3.20 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 5.99) and HM (WMD 3.70 cm, 95% CI 1.41 to 5.99) for improving GV per year, although there was no difference compared with GH alone (WMD 1.18 cm, 95% CI -0.27 to 2.63). SUCRA indicated that HM plus GH was the most effective therapy for increasing GV, followed by GH, HM plus acupressure, and HM. No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusion
For the treatment of ISS, HM plus GH might have a large beneficial effect and might be a better option than EATM therapies and GH alone. However, more long-term, high-quality trials are warranted to confirm the findings.

abstract = {Summary
Patients who decline blood transfusions, including members of the Jehovah's Witness faith, often face challenges when they require or desire prolonged operations such as free tissue transfer (FTT). This study aims to outline our institution's experience with treating bloodless medicine patients and offers the first anatomically comprehensive evaluation of FTT in this population. All patients undergoing FTT from 2017 to 2020 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who declined blood products were selected. Outcomes of interest include flap success, operative complications, and changes to hemoglobin measurements. Ten patients undergoing 11 FTT procedures were identified. Average age was 62.4 years (SD 7.6). Most patients were female (n = 9) and Black (n = 8). Average body mass index was 31.3 (SD 5.6), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status was 2.9 (SD 0.5), and Charlson Comorbidity Index was 3.8 (SD 1.1). Sites of FTT reconstruction were breast (6), lower extremity (3), and scalp (2). Average operative time was 390 min (SD 85.1), with an average estimated blood loss of 170 mL (SD 100.4). The difference between preoperative hemoglobin to first postoperative hemoglobin measurement averaged 2.2 g/dL (SD 1.4). Average patient follow-up was 12 months (SD 7.8). Flap success occurred in 10 cases. One patient with flap failure was successfully reconstructed with a second procedure. Despite a small, heterogeneous cohort, our success rate in this highly comorbid population indicates that FTT can be performed effectively for patients who cannot use blood products. Bloodless medicine protocols are beneficial to providers serving patients with transfusion restrictions and systems that strive to limit transfusion volume and risk.}

However, indigenous perceptions of health are largely absent from Western-derived measurements, contributing to disparities in health outcomes between indigenous and non-indigenous populations. China is the country with the world’s largest population and only officially introduced the term “health literacy” in 2008. Current measures of health literacy in China are primarily based on Western-derived constructs, which have been shown to have poor comparability to the unique dual medical system in China. Given its significant importance to health management globally, understanding health perceptions from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective is essential. This review explores the concept and core elements of indigenous health literacy, evaluates the existing definitions and measurement tools as applied to the concept, and proposes a new model of traditional Chinese medicine health literacy.

Readmission soon after hospital discharge can result from suboptimal care during the index hospitalization or from inadequate systems for postdischarge care. For many conditions, readmission is associated with a high rate of serious morbidity and potentially avoidable costs. In obstetrics, for postpartum care specifically, hospitals and payers can easily track the rate of maternal readmission after childbirth and may seek to incentivize obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, or provider groups to reduce the rate of readmission. However, this practice has not been shown to improve outcomes or reduce harm. There are major concerns with incentivizing providers to reduce postpartum readmissions, including the lack of a standardized metric, a baseline rate of 1% to 2% that is too low to accurately discriminate between random variation and controllable factors, the need for risk adjustment that greatly complicates rate calculations, the potential for bias depending on the duration of the follow-up interval, the potential for the “gaming” of the metric, the lack of evidence that obstetrical providers can influence the rate, and the potential for unintended harm in the vulnerable postpartum population. Until these problems are adequately addressed, maternal readmission rate after a childbirth hospitalization currently has limited utility as a metric for quality or performance improvement or as a factor to adjust provider reimbursement.}

abstract = {Purpose
Sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden of epilepsy worldwide. A presumed proportion is genetic, but this etiology is buried under the burden of infections and perinatal insults in a setting of limited awareness and few options for testing. Children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are most severely affected by this diagnostic gap in Africa, because the rate of actionable findings is highest in DEE-associated genes.
Methods
We tested 234 genetically naive South African children diagnosed with/possible DEE using gene panels, exome sequencing, and chromosomal microarray. Statistical comparison of electroclinical features in children with and children without candidate variants was performed to identify characteristics most likely predictive of a positive genetic finding.
Results
Of the 41 (of 234) children with likely/pathogenic variants, 26 had variants supporting precision therapy. Multivariate regression modeling highlighted neonatal or infantile-onset seizures and movement abnormalities as predictive of a positive genetic finding. We used this, coupled with an emphasis on precision medicine outcomes, to propose the pragmatic “Think-Genetics” strategy for early recognition of a possible genetic etiology.
Conclusion
Our findings emphasize the importance of an early genetic diagnosis in DEE. We designed the Think-Genetics strategy for early recognition, appropriate interim management, and genetic testing for DEE in resource-constrained settings.}

This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is intended to provide clinicians an overview of bariatric surgery (i.e., bariatric procedures that improve metabolic disease are often termed “metabolic and bariatric surgery”), gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome as they relate to patients with obesity.
Methods
The scientific information for this CPS is based upon published scientific citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by the Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
This CPS includes the pros and cons of the most common types of bariatric procedures; the roles of gastrointestinal (GI) hormones in regulating hunger, digestion, and postabsorptive nutrient metabolism; and the microbiome's function and relationship with body weight. This CPS also describes patient screening for bariatric surgery, patient care after bariatric surgery, and treatment of potential nutrient deficiencies before and after bariatric surgery. Finally, this CPS explores the interactions between bariatric surgery, GI hormones, and the microbiome.
Conclusions
This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) regarding bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome is one of a series of OMA CPSs designed to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of obesity. Implementation of appropriate care before and after bariatric surgery, as well as an awareness of GI hormones and the microbiome, may improve the health of patients with obesity, especially patients with adverse fat mass and adiposopathic metabolic consequences.}

Diabetic foot (DF) is a prevalent metabolic infection. DF wounds are the basis for all cases of nontraumatic lower limb amputations in diabetes. DF care approaches include debridement of wound, pressure relief in the wounded area, proper wound, infection, and ischemia management. However, there is a need for research to develop more effective therapeutic approaches. This study investigated the effectivity and safety of autologous platelet-rich gel combined with conventional treatment and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in DF ulcer therapy.
Methods
Sixty DF ulcer patients were divided into treatment and control groups of 30 patients each. The treatment group involved a combination of autologous platelet-rich gel, conventional treatment, and TCM. The control group was only treated with a combination of conventional therapy and TCM. Laboratory variables, including platelets, hemoglobin (Hb), albumin, and HbA1c, were analyzed and compared between the treatment and the control groups at baseline and endpoint. Healing area, volume, and rates were compared in both groups.
Results
Basic patients’ data and the wound conditions had no significant difference between the treatment and the control group. The treatment and control groups cure rates were 93.3% vs. 50%, respectively. The healing rate per 2 weeks was significantly higher in the treatment than in the control group (0.78 ± 0.05 vs. 0.43 ± 0.04). There was no statistically significant difference in the platelets, Hb, albumin, and HbA1c levels in the treatment and control groups.
Conclusions
Autologous platelet-rich gel combined with conventional treatment and TCM is effective and safe for DF ulcer treatment.}

The disparities in the fingerprint spectra of Zuotai from different manufacturers are likely due to differing quantities of electroactive compounds and choices of raw materials in the production process. A cluster analysis of the electrochemical fingerprint spectra further corroborates these findings, showing a significant similarity to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results.

Alternative antimicrobial options or functional enhancement of currently available antimicrobials remains only options. One of the potential options seems stem cells especially the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that show antimicrobial properties. These cells additionally have pro-healing effects that may plausibly improve healing outcomes. MSCs antimicrobial actions are mediated either through direct cell-cell contact or their secretome that enhances innate immune mediated antimicrobial activities. These cells synergistically enhance efficacy of currently available antimicrobials especially against the biofilms. Reciprocal action from antimicrobials on the MSCs functionality remains poorly understood. Currently, the main limitation with MSCs based therapy is their limited efficacy. This demands further understanding and can be enhanced through biotechnological interventions. One of the interventional options is the ‘priming’ to enhance MSCs resistance and specific expression potential. The available literature shows potential antimicrobial actions of MSCs both ex vivo as well as in vivo. The studies on veterinary species are very promising although limited by number and extensiveness in details for their utility as standard therapeutic agents. The current review aims to discuss the role of animals in AMR and the potential antimicrobial actions of MSCs in veterinary medicine. The review also discusses the limitations in their utilization as standard therapeutics.}

Due to the complex nature of the brain structures and heterogeneous morphological and physiological properties of neuronal cells, interventions for cerebral-related disorders using surgical approaches, and classical and ongoing treatments remain hard for physicians. Furthermore, the development of newly designed medications attempts to target AD are not successful in improving AD, because abnormalities of tau protein, aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, inflammatory responses, etc lead to advanced neurodegeneration processes that conventional treatments cannot stop them. In recent years, novel diagnostic strategies and therapeutic approaches have been developed to identify and cure early pathological events of AD. Accordingly, many gene-based therapies have been developed and introduce the therapeutic potential to prevent and cure AD. On the other hand, genetic investigations and postmortem assessments have detected a large number of factors associated with AD pathology. Also, genetically diverse animal models of AD help us to detect and prioritize novel resilience mechanisms. Hence, gene therapy can be considered an effective and powerful tool to identify and treat human diseases. Ultimately, gene study and gene-based therapy with a critical role in the detection and cure of various human disorders will have a fundamental role in our lives forever. This scientific review paper discusses the present status of different therapeutic strategies, particularly gene-based therapy in treating AD, along with its challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Artemisia annua, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is the main source for production of artemisinin, an anti-malaria drug. A. annua is distributed globally, with great diversity of morphological characteristics and artemisinin contents. Diverse traits among A. annua populations impeded the stable production of artemisinin, which needs an efficient tool to identify strains and assess population genetic homogeneity.
Purpose
In this study, ribosomal DNA (rDNA), were characterized for A. annua for strains identification and population genetic homogeneity assessment.
Methods
The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were identified using cmscan and assembled using rDNA unit of LQ-9 as a reference. rDNA among Asteraceae species were compared performing with 45S rDNA. The rDNA copy number was calculated based on sequencing depth. The polymorphisms of rDNA sequences were identified with bam-readcount, and confirmed by Sanger sequencing and restriction enzyme experiment. The ITS2 amplicon sequencing was used to verify the stability of ITS2 haplotype analysis.
Results
Different from other Asteraceae species, 45S and 5S linked-type rDNA was only found in Artemisia genus. Rich polymorphisms of copy number and sequence of rDNA were identified in A. annua population. The haplotype composition of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region which had moderate sequence polymorphism and relative short size was significantly different among A. annua strains. A population discrimination method was developed based on ITS2 haplotype analysis with high-throughput sequencing.
Conclusion
This study provides comprehensive characteristics of rDNA and suggests that ITS2 haplotype analysis is ideal tool for A. annua strain identification and population genetic homogeneity assessment.}

Appropriate staging and treatment selection may alleviate the extent of fatal recurrence. However, effective methods to preoperatively evaluate pathophysiologic and molecular characteristics of HCC are lacking. Imaging plays a central role in HCC diagnosis and stratification due to the non-invasive diagnostic criteria. Vast and crucial information is hidden within image data. Other than providing a morphological sketch for lesion diagnosis, imaging could provide new insights to describe the pathophysiological and genetic landscape of HCC. Radiomics aims to facilitate diagnosis and prognosis of HCC using artificial intelligence techniques to harness the immense information contained in medical images. Radiomics produces a set of archetypal and robust imaging features that are correlated to key pathological or molecular biomarkers to preoperatively risk-stratify HCC patients. Inferred with outcome data, comprehensive combination of radiomic, clinical and/or multi-omics data could also improve direct prediction of response to treatment and prognosis. The evolution of radiomics is changing our understanding of personalized precision medicine in HCC management. Herein, we review the key techniques and clinical applications in HCC radiomics and discuss current limitations and future opportunities to improve clinical decision making.}

Clinical decisions bear wellbeing and economic risks and consequences for patients, families, employers, and national economies. Thus, clinicians should employ sound scientific knowledge to promote optimum decision outcomes. Evidence-based medicine organizes clinical decision-making activities with philosophical, ethical, and methodological foundations to ensure accessibility to the best scientific knowledge to inform clinical decision-making. But high-quality evidence could be lacking or methodically, ethically, or economically unfeasible, compelling clinicians to make risk-bearing decisions without an ideal evidence base. In uncertain clinical conditions, decisions' outcomes are probabilistic and the clinicians’ knowledge about outcomes is limited, which makes the clinical decision in significant need for aid. The modern analytical approaches that abstract knowledge from data such as machine learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to address some of the evidence-based medicine challenges. However, despite the plethora of literature that proposes the machine learning as a remedy to evidence-based medicine challenges, there is no serious literature-based framework that helps guide the reconciliation between evidence-based medicine and machine learning paradigms. This study proposes a pragmatic reconciliation framework that guides the paradigms reconciliation agenda. This paper is among the first to present a literature-based framework to guide the reconciliation agenda and is thought to pave the way towards the future research quest.}

However, given its infrequent occurrence, only a limited number of preclinical models have been established. Here, we established three LCNEC tumoroids for long-term culture. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that these tumoroids inherited genetic mutations from their parental tumors; two were classified as small-cell carcinoma (S-LCNEC) and one as non-small cell carcinoma (N-LCNEC). Xenografts from these tumoroids in immunodeficient mice mimicked the pathology of the parent LCNEC, and one reproduced the mixed-tissue types of combined LCNEC with a component of adenocarcinoma. Drug sensitivity tests using these LCNEC tumoroids enabled the evaluation of therapeutic agent efficacy. Based on translational research, we found that a CDK4/6 inhibitor might be effective for N-LCNEC and that Aurora A kinase inhibitors might be suitable for S-LCNEC or LCNEC with MYC amplification. These results highlight the value of preclinical tumoroid models in understanding the pathogenesis of rare cancers and developing treatments. LCNEC showed a high success rate in tumoroid establishment, indicating its potential application in personalized medicine.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known as “Fawang” in Zhuang medical theory. Longzuantongbi granules (LZTBG) is an in-hospital preparation used at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine. This medicine is based on traditional Zhuang medicine theory for the treatment of “Fawang”, and has an effectiveness of over 86.67%. It comprises eight medicinal materials, including the main drug Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. and Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A.C. Smith, the assisting drugs Alangium chinense (Lour.) Harms, Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC., Sinomenium acutum (Thunb.) Rehd.et Wils., Bauhinia championii (Benth.) Benth., Spatholobus suberectus Dunn, and Ficus hirta Vahl. All of these herbs are commonly used in Zhuang medicine.
Aim of the study
This study aims to reveal the effect of LZTBG on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, to discover the potential efficacy-related biomarkers and explore the intervention mechanism of LZTBG from a molecular level, based on metabolomics.
Materials and methods
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into a normal group, a CIA model group, a positive control (MTX) group and two different LZTBG treatment groups (5.4 g/kg/d and 2.7 g/kg/d). Body weight, arthritis index (AI), paw swelling, and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining experiments were used to evaluate the efficacy of the established model. A metabolomics method based on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique was established to analyze plasma taken from the rats, and to explore the interventional mechanism of LZTBG.
Results
LZTBG showed a positive effect on the CIA model rats. Thirty-one differential metabolites were screened out, and combined with pathway analysis, 11 potential efficacy-related biomarkers were then mapped in the pathway. These included linoleic acid (LA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), arachidonic acid (AA), 12-HETE, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), 13(S)-HOT, 2-oxobutanoate, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, L-Valine, and acetylcholine. Furthermore, it was found that these metabolites may exhibit an intervention effect by means of modulating pathways related to both lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism to associated with inflammation.
Conclusion
LZTBG can effectively alleviate symptoms of RA, an effect that can primarily be attributed to the regulation of multiple pathways and multiple targets These results demonstrate that LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics is an advantageous technique for the investigation of the intervention effect and molecular mechanism of traditional compound medicine.}

To evaluate the safety, potential benefits and possible mechanisms of the extract of Si Ben Cao (SBC), a traditional Chinese medicine formula composed of four herbs, for skin whitening.
Methods
The reflux method was performed to prepare the extract of SBC. MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic of SBC extract in vitro. Skin irritation test and skin allergy test on rats were performed to evaluate the safety of SBC extract in vivo. Intercellular melanin production was analyzed to assess the function of SBC extract for whitening. Afterwards, we analyzed the activity of intracellular tyrosinase, Ultraviolet (UV) absorption, and anti-oxidant activity, which were related to melanin production.
Results
The aqueous extract and ethanol extract of SBC were prepared separately. MTT assay results showed aqueous extract of SBC at a concentration of 100 μg/mL had no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of B16F10 cells even after treatment for 96 h, indicating that aqueous extract of SBC was not cytotoxic. Thus, we conducted subsequent experiments using aqueous extract of SBC. The results on rats showed SBC extract was safe to apply on the skin without causing irritation and allergies. Analysis of melanin content showed SBC extract had inhibitory effect on cellular melanin generation and secretion. Moreover, we found that SBC extract was able to reduce cellular tyrosinase activity, as well as absorb UV light and scavenge DPPH radicals for anti-oxidants.
Conclusion
Our data clearly demonstrated that SBC extract is safe and effective for skincare, and it is suitable for use with the purpose of skin whitening and health benefits.}

abstract = {Background and objective
In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) has a low survival rate, so it is essential to recognize the cases with the highest probability of developing it. The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with the occurrence of IHCA.
Material and methods
A single-center case-control study was conducted including 65 patients admitted to internal medicine wards for non-cardiovascular causes who experienced IHCA, matched with 210 admitted controls who did not present with IHCA.
Results
The main reason for admission was pneumonia. The most prevalent comorbidity was arterial hypertension. Four characteristics were strongly and independently associated with IHCA presentation, these are electrical left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (OR = 13.8 95% IC: 4.7–40.7), atrial fibrillation (OR = 9.4 95% CI: 4.3–20.6), the use of drugs with known risk of Torsades de pointes (OR = 2.7 95% CI: 1.3–5.5) and the combination of the categories known risk plus conditional risk (OR = 17.1 95% CI: 6.7–50.1). The first two detected in the electrocardiogram taken at the time of admission.
Conclusion
In admitted patients for non-cardiovascular causes, the use of drugs with a known risk of Torsades de Pointes, as well as the detection of electrical LVH and atrial fibrillation in the initial electrocardiogram, is independently associated with a higher probability of suffering a IHCA.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivos
El paro cardiaco intrahospitalario (PCIH) presenta una baja tasa de supervivencia por lo que es imprescindible reconocer los casos con más alta probabilidad de desarrollarlo. El objetivo de este estudio es identificar factores asociados a la ocurrencia de PCIH.
Materiales y métodos
Se realizó un estudio de casos y controles unicéntrico que incluyó 65 pacientes ingresados en salas de medicina interna por causas no cardiovasculares que sufrieron un PCIH, emparejados con 210 controles ingresados que no presentaron PCIH.
Resultados
El principal motivo de ingreso fue la neumonía. La comorbilidad más prevalente fue la hipertensión arterial. Cuatro características se asociaron de forma independiente con la manifestación de un PCIH, estas son, hipertrofia ventricular izquierda eléctrica (OR = 13,8 95% IC: 4,7–40,7), fibrilación auricular (OR = 9,4 95% IC: 4,3–20,6), el uso de fármacos con riesgo conocido Torsades de Pointes (OR = 2,7 95% IC: 1,3–5,5) y la combinación riesgo conocido más riesgo condicional (OR = 17,1 95% IC: 6,7–50,1). Las dos primeras detectadas en el electrocardiograma tomado al momento del ingreso.
Conclusiones
En pacientes ingresados por causas no cardiovasculares el uso de fármacos con potencial para producir Torsades de Pointes así como la detección de hipertrofia ventricular izquierda y de fibrilación auricular en el electrocardiograma inicial se asocia de forma independiente a una mayor probabilidad de sufrir un PCIH.}

abstract = {Background
The authors sought to identify the prevalence of burnout in oral medicine (OM) and orofacial pain (OFP) residents and investigate potential contributing factors.
Methods
A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted. An anonymous 22-item online survey was emailed to the residents of all Commission on Dental Accreditation–accredited OM and OFP residency programs in the United States. Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory was included to gauge the following details of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment. Questions also addressed the impact of residency program characteristics, work-life balance, and possible discrimination or abuse on burnout.
Results
Six OM and 12 OFP programs (72 residents) were contacted, and 46 residents responded (response rate, 64%). Overall prevalence of burnout was 35% (29% in OM residents, 40% in OFP residents). High EE burnout was noted in 57% of residents, high DP burnout in 11% of residents, and high personal accomplishment burnout in 59% of residents. Working for fewer than 40 hours per week was significantly associated with low DP burnout (P < .05). Moderate to high DP burnout was more prevalent in men and unmarried residents (whether in a relationship or not) were more likely to experience moderate to high EE burnout (P < .05).
Conclusions
Burnout among OM and OFP residents is an emerging concern due to its detrimental effect on the physical and mental well-being of the residents. To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to report burnout prevalence in the 2 most recent dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association in 2020.
Practical Implications
Early detection of signs of burnout among residents would allow program faculty and administrators to provide required support and resources.}

abstract = {Introduction
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is receiving more and more attention across the globe and its use in the health protection and treatment of different diseases is increasing. This study aimed to determine healthcare workers’ attitudes towards CAM in Turkey.
Methods
This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out between November and December 2020 on healthcare workers working in two public hospitals (Ankara and Bingol province/Turkey). Data collection included the Holistic Complementary and Alternative Medicines Questionnaire (HCAMQ) .
Results
The survey was completed by 794 healthcare workers, a response rate of 83%.The mean age of healthcare workers was (39.73±8.9), and the age range was 19–70 years old. Of the participants, 63.4% were male, 42.2% were nurses and 72.9% were married. Mean and standard deviation values for HCAMQ was (28.72±5.62). Cupping (45.5%), leeches (30.9%), and ozone (27.5%) practices were found to be the most widely known methods and chiropractic (3%) and larvae (5.3%) were the least known methods. It was also found that 57.9% of the participants used at least one CAM method, and 84.4% recommended it to others. Among the sociodemographic characteristics, only the high-income group had a more negative attitude than the low group (P<0.05).
Conclusions
Healthcare workers’ knowledge levels on CAM were adequate and the great majority of participants in the study had recommended it to other individuals.}

abstract = {Purpose
Patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are required to strictly adhere to immunosuppressive medications to avoid rejection and infective complications. Since medication adherence is among the most important modifiable behaviors to achieve better outcomes, the aims of this study were to measure the baseline and longitudinal trends of medication adherence and investigate the psychological factors associated with medication adherence in allo-HSCT patients.
Methods
This was a single-center, longitudinal study of patients who underwent allo-HSCT to treat hematological malignancies at the University hospital of Florence (Italy). Adherence was measured with the Immunosuppressive Medication Self-Management Scale; psychological factors (i.e., beliefs about medicines and health locus of control) were measured with the Beliefs About Medicines Questionnaire and Multidimensional Health locus of Control Scale. Data were collected 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge. A mixed effects model was performed after adjusting for demographic characteristics.
Results
50 adult patients were included in this study. Adherence to immunosuppressant was optimal and increased significantly 3 months after bone marrow transplantation (B = 0.23, p = 0.041). Patients with lower concerns about immunosuppressive medications were more likely to be adherent (B = 0.02, p = 0.040), while those having beliefs that their disease was due to external factors were less likely to be adherent (B = −0.02, p = 0.026) than their counterparts.
Conclusions
These results underline the importance of psychological factors in affecting adherence to immunosuppressants of allo-HSCT patients. Healthcare providers and researchers should target medication beliefs and reorient locus of control with appropriate interventions, in order to improve adherence.}

The immune system plays an important role in tissue repair and must be considered in the design of therapies in regenerative medicine. In particular, macrophage cell therapy has emerged as a promising strategy that leverages the reparative roles of these cells. Macrophages are critical for successful tissue repair and accomplish diverse functions throughout all phases of the process by dramatically shifting in phenotypes in response to microenvironmental cues. Depending on their response to various stimuli, they may release growth factors, support angiogenesis, and facilitate extracellular matrix remodeling. However, this ability to rapidly shift phenotype is also problematic for macrophage cell therapy strategies, because adoptively transferred macrophages fail to maintain therapeutic phenotypes following their administration to sites of injury or inflammation. Biomaterials are a potential way to control macrophage phenotype in situ while also enhancing their retention at sites of injury. Cell delivery systems incorporated with appropriately designed immunomodulatory signals have potential to achieve tissue regeneration in intractable injuries where traditional therapies have failed. Here we explorecurrent challenges in macrophage cell therapy, especially retention and phenotype control, how biomaterials may overcome them, and opportunities for next generation strategies. Biomaterials will be an essential tool to advance macrophage cell therapy for widespread clinical applications.}

Background
Suicide still represents an unsolved issue worldwide and suicidal behaviours are often difficult to detect and prevent. The aim of the study is to investigate the phenomenon of suicide in cases analysed by the Unit of Legal Medicine of Pavia, North-Western Italy, from 1999 to 2019, providing qualitative-statistical data, representing a starting point to investigate further the risk factors related to suicide.
Methodology
For each autoptic case, the following variables were taken into consideration: personal data (age and sex), social status (employment, marital status), medical history (organic and/or psychiatric conditions) and forensic evaluations (time, circumstances and method of death, the presence or not of a ‘suicide note’ and previous anticonservative behaviours).
Results
Were found 724 confirmed suicide cases, with an average annual rate of 34±12. Mean age at suicide 50.2±20.2-year-old, male/female ratio 3. Some characteristics linked with suicide were discussed: male sex (71.8%), age range 31–60 years (50.7%), asphyxia method of death (46.1%) of which 68% by hanging, cardiovascular disease (3%), previous anti-conservative attempts (7.7%), retirement (22.4%), unemployment (7.2%), separation/divorce (8%). We detected a lower percentage of mental illness: depression (26%), alcohol (4%) and drugs abuse (3%).
Conclusion
It is essential to monitor suicidal risk factors to efficiently intervene through targeted prevention campaigns, according to cross-national and temporal variation. Forensic medicine approach, as shown, could give a wide perspective over the suicide phenomenon, mainly in its social and ethical connotations.}

abstract = {Background
In 2019, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) Foundation launched a project to leverage registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) leading “food as medicine” (FAM) initiatives within food retail settings. Subsequently, a conceptual definition of FAM was created.
Objective
This survey aimed to gauge RDNs’ familiarity with FAM, assess RDNs’ perceptions of the Academy’s FAM definition, and prioritize program models for food retail implementation.
Design
Development and testing of this cross-sectional survey involved expert content validation, cognitive interviews, and field testing.
Participants
One thousand five hundred fifty-two RDN Academy members completed the online survey.
Main outcome measures
Familiarity and perception of FAM was evaluated by asking participants about FAM focus areas, Academy definition, concept integration, and FAM program models within food retail settings.
Statistical analyses performed
Quantitative results were analyzed descriptively, using frequencies and proportions; content analysis was used on qualitative results to analyze open-ended responses.
Results
Most respondents had heard the term FAM (94%) and were familiar with the concept (95%). Before learning the Academy’s FAM definition, RDN views of the concept aligned with the definition’s strategic focus areas (health and well-being, disease management and treatment, nutrition security, food safety). Overall, 77% of RDNs surveyed had a positive perception of the Academy’s FAM definition. Sixty-nine percent also found food retail settings favorable for integrating FAM programming. Because of the limited number of RDNs identifying food retail as their primary practice setting (n = 12), data on prioritizing program models in these settings were not analyzed.
Conclusions
RDNs in all practice settings can incorporate strategic focus areas outlined in the Academy’s FAM definition. Further research is needed, particularly around use of the term by the RDN profession. A follow-up survey targeting a larger sample size of RDNs who practice in food retail settings is also necessary to further prioritize FAM program models in these settings.}

Therefore, the demand to elevate pyroptosis level is highly desirable and highlighted. Herein, a RGD-modified and pyroptosis-engineered theranostic agent (PETA) consisting of Fe3O4-embedded magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MMSN) vehicles and chlorin e6 (Ce6) photosensitizers (i.e., MMSN-cRGD@Ce6) is established to heighten ROS level for inducing pyroptosis by Ce6-mediated photodynamic process. Inspiringly, Fe3O4-mediated nanocatalytic medicine contributes to O2 release and hypoxia mitigation, which liberates hypoxia-induced resistances to ROS production and further favors ROS production. Consequently, ROS-activated pyroptosis is accessible to circumvent the hypoxia-induced resistance to ROS-activated apoptosis especially when uniting with cRGD-enhanced active targeting, which significantly represses malignant breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. The design principles of targeted PETAs can serve as a general method to develop new pyroptosis-highlighted theranostic agents, and coincidently indicate that pyroptosis contribution should be surveyed to veritably and comprehensively reflect death pathway when investigating ROS-based anti-tumor pathways.}

At present, there are many hypotheses regarding the mechanism of leptin resistance, but there is no definite conclusion. TCM has a long history of treating obesity, and single and compound TCM is an effective obesity treatment method. However, TCM's mechanism of action is complex and resists further weight loss drug development. In the last decade, network pharmacology has become an important tool for exploring the mechanism of compound TCMs. In this study, we reviewed the interrelation between TCM obesity treatment and leptin resistance, and network pharmacology studies of TCM intervention in simple obesity revealed that their targets overlap with the leptin pathway. We also summarized TCM pairs that effectively interfere with leptin resistance and their related intervention mechanisms, providing targets for anti-obesity drug development.}

In this stud TCMs with myocardial protection were applied as a case study, and validated for the feasibility and utility of the platform. Seven frequently used herbal drugs (Ginseng, etc.) were screened from 100,000 TCMs formulas for myocardial protection and subsequently prepared as a library of 700 extracts. By using TCMs-CFA platform, 81 lead compounds, including 10 novel bioactive ones, were quickly identified by correlating 8089 mass signals with 170,100 cytological parameters from an extract library. The TCMs-CFA platform described a new evidence-led tool for the rapid discovery process by data mining strategies, which is valuable for novel lead compounds from TCMs. All computations are done through Python and are publicly available on GitHub.}

Neurodegenerative diseases have been one of the major concerns for human health. Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases.
Aim
The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish.
Materials and methods
In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7 μg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group.
Results
The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure. Finally, prevention of dopamine alteration in SB-treated fish brains confirmed the protective action of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish.
Conclusions
This study finds that Suvarna Bhasma has neuroprotective effects against Parkinson's-like disease model.}

Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) knowledge and skills have been recommended as a core competency of healthcare professionals worldwide. However, EBM teaching and learning approaches is quite heterogeneous. Hence, we aimed to conduct a meta-synthesis to identify various teaching and learning aspects of EBM from the learners and instructors perspective.
Methodology
This study followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was used to retrieve articles from PubMed/Medline and Embase from inception till June 2022. To find additional studies, bibliographic search of included studies, review articles, a random search in Google Scholar, Research Gate and Google were carried out. This review evaluated studies published in English language that explained the teaching and learning aspects of EBM among healthcare professionals and students.
Result
A total of 41 out of 8139 studies were included in this study. Both learners and instructors preferred tutorials, lectures, short courses, and workshops on EBM as a teaching method. To continue learning and practicing EBM, instructors suggested curricular changes as well as continuing education programmes. Learners preferred to learn EBM by direct clinical practice along with peers. Blended learning, group activities, assignments, workshops, journal clubs, task based learning, didactic teaching, team based learning, problem based learning, case based learning, blended learning, flipped learning and E-learning were the identified pedagogical approaches for teaching EBM.
Conclusion
Different pedagogical approaches are used for teaching EBM among healthcare professionals. Continuous education programs for skill development must be held on a regular basis to improve the instructors and learners competency in EBM. Learners and instructors preferred learning approach should be considered while designing EBM educational studies as it is a life-long self-directed learning process.}

Present case series is a same novel experience of early diagnosing and treating mid aged, morbid individuals who took only Ayurvedic treatment and could get out of the disease without any complications. This case series had 10 mid aged, morbid patients with maximum symptoms of COVID-19 disease and their hemogram and CRP was suggestive of moderate to severe type COVID-19/FLI/SARI. They were diagnosed by contemporary methods of pathology and treated with Ayurvedic classical medicines Tamra Sinduradi Yoga and Bhunimbadi Kwath for 20 days along with continuing the medicines for their ongoing morbidities. All 10 patients showed recoveries without any complications, they reduced their all symptoms, drastic reduction in their CRP and corrections in their hemograms were observed and also they showed any complications neither physically nor in their pathological tests. Hence it can be concluded that early diagnosis and treating it with Ayurvedic medicine can manage viral pandemic issue in a very successful way.}

Cellular collectives in all tissues form bioelectrical networks via ion channels and gap junctions that process morphogenetic information, controlling gene expression and allowing cell networks to adaptively and dynamically control growth and pattern formation. Recent progress in understanding this physiological control system, including predictive computational models, suggests that targeting bioelectrical interfaces can control embryogenesis and maintain shape against injury, senescence and tumorigenesis. We propose a roadmap for drug discovery focused on manipulating endogenous bioelectric signaling for regenerative medicine, cancer suppression and antiaging therapeutics.}

To assess: 1) the percentage of female and underrepresented in medicine (URiM) medical students interested in interventional radiology (IR), and 2) the motivations for and deterrents from IR for female and URiM students.
Methods
The study was IRB exempt. Data from a 19-item survey sent to 5 US medical schools were collected from 10/2018–01/2019 using REDCap and analyzed with SAS GLIMMIX.
Results
16% (56/346) of women and 27% (69/258) of men strongly considered IR. 21% (19/89) of URiM versus 21% (105/508) of non-URiM students, p = .88, seriously considered IR. On a 0-to-4 scale (0 = not a motivator, 4 = strong motivator), women rated “Female mentorship” “2.5” versus males' “0.4”, p < .0001, independent of IR interest URiM students uninterested in IR rated “Lack of ethnic diversity in training”“2.3” versus “1.2” for IR-interested URiM, p < .01. 18% (9/50) of IR-interested women reported adequate gender-specific mentorship in IR in medical school. Of IR-interested URiM students 5% (1/19) reported adequate ethnicity/race-specific mentorship.
Conclusion
Fewer female medical students considered IR compared to males. Female mentorship was a significant motivator for women. Similar numbers of URiM and non-URiM students consider IR. Few women and URiM students report adequate gender/ethnicity/race-specific mentorship. For students not interested in IR, lack of ethnic diversity in training was a significant deterrent. Increasing numbers and visibility of female and URiM interventional radiologists in mentoring and clinical practice may improve recruitment of medical students from these underrepresented groups.}

Ebolavirus, the causative agent of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks mainly in sub-Saharan Africa since 1976. EVD is associated with high risk of transmission, especially to healthcare workers during patient care.
Objective
The purpose of this review is to provide a concise review of EVD presentation, diagnosis, and management for emergency clinicians.
Discussion
EVD is spread through direct contact, including blood, bodily fluids or contact with a contaminated object. Patients may present with non-specific symptoms such as fevers, myalgias, vomiting, or diarrhea that overlap with other viral illnesses, but rash, bruising, and bleeding may also occur. Laboratory analysis may reveal transaminitis, coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The average clinical course is approximately 8–10 days with an average case fatality rate of 50%. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, with two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibody treatments (Ebanga and Inmazeb). Survivors of the disease may have a complicated recovery, marked by long-term symptoms.
Conclusion
EVD is a potentially deadly condition that can present with a wide range of signs and symptoms. Emergency clinicians must be aware of the presentation, evaluation, and management to optimize the care of these patients.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Introduction
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), are continuing to heighten global mortality, and those causing diarrhoea and respiratory diseases are more common. In Uganda, plants like C. pyrrhopappa, E. abyssinica, C. limon, M. foetida, C. flexuosus, and C. citrinus are often used to treat diarrhoea and cough. Some of these plants are reported to demonstrate antibacterial properties in some countries, but the evidence is limited due to fragmented studies. We evaluated global antibacterial research on these plants, to derive practical insights, able to stimulate new thinking and inform drug development.
Methods
Eligible articles from 14 electronic databases were examined using Standard Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). Sensitive ARB to the plant extracts, and Cochran’s Q test were evaluated using MedCalcs-software, publication bias using Begg’s test and funnel plot asymmetry, and heterogeneity using sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression (P < 0.05).
Results
Twenty studies assessed the plants against 237 ARB in vitro. C. flexuosus exhibited the highest efficacy (89.8%), which was not significantly different from the rest of the plants species except M. foetida and C. pyrrhopappa (0.0%) (χ2, P < 0.05). Multidrug-resistant strains with 100% sensitivity to plant extracts were A. baumannii, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa.
Discussion/Conclusions
Efficacy of these plants against globally circulating bacteria which are resistant to highly-powered, last-resort drugs like carbapenems, indicates potential global treatment success if they are used in drug development. In vivo efficacy studies, especially on the world’s leading multidrug-resistant strains like K. pneumoniae and E. coli are warranted to bridge knowledge-gaps.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the push for complementary medicine (CM) practitioners to engage in evidence implementation, and arguments in support of evidence-based practice (EBP), uptake of EBP amongst most CM professions remains low. This review aimed to synthesise the evidence examining the barriers and enablers to evidence implementation in CM.
Methods
Any primary study examining enablers and barriers to evidence implementation in CM were eligible for inclusion. Eight databases and search engines were searched for eligible studies. Reference lists of included studies were screened, and authors of included studies were contacted to identify current or unpublished studies that met the inclusion criteria.
Results
Thirty-nine published and unpublished studies were included in this review. The seven published qualitative studies and 25 published quantitative studies were rated as moderate to high quality. Fifty-two distinct barriers and 62 discrete enablers were identified. Reported barriers were predominantly structural (e.g. limited availability of time and clinical evidence) and cognitive (e.g. skills deficits), with relatively fewer studies reporting cultural (e.g. lack of industry support) or attitudinal barriers (e.g. lack of interest in, or relevance to CM). Enablers of evidence implementation largely focussed on improving access to bibliographic databases and evidence reviews, supporting skills acquisition, and cultivating leadership and interprofessional/interagency collaboration.
Conclusions
The findings of this review highlight the diverse barriers and enablers to evidence implementation in CM that span multiple dimensions. The interplay between these various factors highlights the complexity of evidence implementation, and the need for a targeted multistakeholder, multidimensional solution to optimise evidence-based practice in CM.
Study registration
The protocol of this review was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022308527).}

abstract = {Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased interest in herbal supplements and nutraceuticals as alternative treatments. This review looks at the evidence on their use to prevent and treat COVID-19 variants. It talks about their possible pros and cons and stresses the need for more research in this area to fully understand how well they work against the virus.
Methods
In order to conduct this review, a comprehensive search of relevant literature was performed. Studies examining the efficacy of herbal supplements and nutraceuticals in preventing and treating COVID-19 variants were included. The data from these studies was analyzed to determine the potential benefits and limitations of these alternative treatments. Additionally, the review also considered any potential side effects or interactions with other medications.
Results
The review found that while some herbal supplements and nutraceuticals have potential for preventing and treating COVID-19 variants, their effectiveness is uncertain. Vitamin C and zinc may boost the immune system, but their effectiveness in combating the virus is uncertain. The research explores the potential benefits of TCM in treating and preventing COVIR-19 variants. Some supplements may interact with certain medications, highlighting the need for consultation with healthcare professionals. Further research is needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of these alternative treatments. The study also explores the potential benefits of traditional Chinese medicine.
Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a debate on alternative treatments, with some suggesting supplements can boost the immune system and combat the virus, while others call for more research. Safety concerns and potential interactions between supplements and medications also arise. A comprehensive understanding of these treatments is crucial for optimal care during the pandemic. Healthcare professionals should stay updated on research and evidence, allowing informed discussions with patients about benefits and risks. A balanced approach considering individual patient needs is essential.
Conclusions
Healthcare professionals play a crucial role in guiding patients in making informed decisions about alternative treatments and supplements, ensuring they are not used as substitutes. They should help patients understand the benefits and risks of these treatments, adopting a balanced approach that considers both traditional and alternative treatments. This holistic approach is essential in the current pandemic situation and promotes overall patient well-being.}

Twitter may be used in disseminating scientific information that can be measured via citations by traditional systems. We aimed to investigate the relationship between Twitter mentions, traditional citations including Google Scholar and Scopus, and the metric value of Altmetric for articles published in emergency medicine journals.
Methods
Articles published in emergency medicine journals between January 2018 and June 2018 were retrospectively analyzed in February 2021. Journals included with an impact factor of >1 and indexed in Q1. Metric data about citations in Google Scholar and Scopus, the metric value of the Altmetric system, and Twitter mentions were obtained.
Results
There were 502 articles published in different seven emergency medicine journals. Fifty-four articles (10.8%) were never cited in Google Scholar or Scopus. There were 79 articles (15.7%) without Twitter mention. Twitter mentions as a tweet or no tweet impacted the number of articles with citation (p > 0.05). The number of citations per article was significantly higher in articles with Twitter mentions (p = 0.002 for Google Scholar citations, p = 0.005 for Scopus citations). Altmetric cited articles were significantly higher for articles with Twitter mentions (p < 0.001). There were significant positive correlations between the number of Twitter mentions and citations in Scopus (r = 0.30, p < 0.001), in both Google Scholar and Scopus (r = 0.19, p < 0.001), and in Altmetrics (r = 0.852, p < 0.001).

Historically, the protocols underlying cell therapy have been pioneered by academic medical scientists who are leaders in their respective area. Increasingly, autologous cell therapy programs anchor clinical centers of excellence at top academic medical centers that invest in clinical-grade cell handing facilities to enable investigator-initiated studies and reimbursement of clinical care for select cell therapy use cases. Academic cell therapy programs are inherently personalized early during innovation cycles, until challenges with generalizability and scalability are deemed commercially tractable and opportunities for academic partnership with industry become feasible. The depth of knowledge and know-how of these academic programs is attractive to industry partners when a given cell therapy protocol presents an investment opportunity with a positive return on investment (ROI). Such industry partners are often biopharmaceutical companies with cell therapy business lines.

A bi-institutional partnership between physicians at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia and the University of Toronto, Canada led the development and implementation of a novel emergency medicine (EM) postgraduate training program at Addis Ababa University (AAU). Subsequently, the first three cohorts of trainees were invited to participate in the evaluation of the curricular components devised and delivered by Toronto EM physicians as part of the Toronto Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration in EM (TAAAC-EM). We sought to characterise the strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum to improve it for future trainee cohorts.
Methods
This curriculum assessment used semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews to evaluate components of the TAAAC-EM program curriculum. Interviews were conducted with a purposive sampling of graduates from the first three cohorts of the TAAAC-EM program.
Results
Twelve participants were interviewed. The following themes were identified; The TAAAC-EM program built a novel EM culture at AAU and shifted teaching from didactic to learner-centered strategies where teachers serve as role models; The curriculum content of the EM resident program, including didactic and practical sessions, was well received by the graduates interviewed; Challenges identified included lack of continuity in training, and difficulties transitioning to practice in a locally nascent field; Participants evaluated the TAAAC-EM program model as very positive overall, and supported replicating the model by expanding within Ethiopia and beyond.
Conclusions
The challenges identified in the program, including lack of continuity of clinical teaching and meeting the local educational resource needs of new graduates, helped inform program adaptations and improvements. TAAAC-EM, currently in its eleventh year, is now focused on transitioning full teaching responsibilities to local faculty and continuing to support a positive EM teaching culture. We believe that this thriving partnership can serve as a model for future north-south and south-south collaborations in postgraduate medical education.}

There are many drugs to improve myocardial metabolism for the treatment of HF, including angiotensin receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Although Western medicine has made considerable progress in HF therapy, the morbidity and mortality of the disease remain high. Therefore, HF has attracted attention from researchers worldwide. In recent years, the application of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in HF treatment has been gradually accepted, and many studies have investigated the mechanism whereby TCM improves myocardial metabolism; the TCMs studied include Danshen yin, Fufang Danshen dripping pill, and Shenmai injection. This enables the clinical application of TCM in the treatment of HF by improving myocardial metabolism. We systematically reviewed the efficacy of TCM for improving myocardial metabolism during HF as well as the pharmacological effects of active TCM ingredients on the cardiovascular system and the potential mechanisms underlying their ability to improve myocardial metabolism. The results indicate that TCM may serve as a complementary and alternative approach for the prevention of HF. However, further rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the effect of TCM on long-term hard endpoints in patients with cardiovascular disease.}

Polyacetylenes have attracted considerable attention owing to their diverse biofunctions like tumor suppression, immunity regulation, depression resistance and neural protection. The present review intends to reconstruct data concerning the occurrence, pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetics of polyacetylenes from herbal medicine in a systematic and integrated way, with a view to backing up their curative potential and healthcare properties (2014–2021). The natural polyacetylene-related data were all acquired from the scientific search engines and databases that are globally recognized, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, SciFindern and CNKI. A total of 183 polyacetylenes were summarized in this paper. Modern pharmacological studies indicated that polyacetylenes possess multiple biological activities including antitumor, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, anti-depression, anti-obesity, hypoglycemic, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, hepatoprotective and renoprotective activities. As important bioactive components of herbal medicine, the pharmacological curative potential of polyacetylenes has been described against carcinomas, inflammatory responses, central nervous system, endocrine disorders and microbial infection in this review. While, further in-depth studies on the aspects of polyacetylenes for toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and molecular mechanisms are still limited, thereby intensive research and assessments should be performed.}

abstract = {Aims
This work aims to analyze the structure, activity, and outcomes of internal medicine units and departments (IMU) of the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) and to analyze the challenges for the specialty and propose policies for improvement. It also aims to compare the results from the 2021 RECALMIN survey with IMU surveys from previous years (2008, 2015, 2017, 2019).
Methods
This work is a cross-sectional, descriptive study of IMUs in acute care general hospitals of the SNHS that compares data from 2020 with previous studies. The study variables were collected through an ad hoc questionnaire.
Results
Between 2014 and 2020, hospital occupancy and discharges by IMU increased (annual mean of 4% and 3.8%, respectively), as did hospital cross-consultation and initial consultation rates (2.1% in both cases). E-consultations increased notably in 2020. Risk-adjusted mortality and length of hospital stay did not show significant changes from 2013−2020. Progress in the implementation of good practices and systematic care for complex chronic patients was limited. A consistent finding in RECALMIN surveys was the variability among IMUs in terms of resources and activity, though no statistically significant differences were found in regard to outcomes.
Conclusions
There is considerable room for improvement in the operation of IMUs. The reduction in unjustified variability in clinical practice and inequities in health outcomes are a challenge for IMU managers and the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine.
Resumen
Objetivos
Analizar la estructura, la actividad y los resultados de los Servicios y Unidades de Medicina Interna (UMI) del Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS). Analizar los retos para la especialidad y realizar propuestas de políticas de mejora. Comparar los resultados de la encuesta RECALMIN 2021 con las anteriores oleadas de encuestas a las UMI (2008, 2015, 2017, 2019).
Material y métodos
Estudio descriptivo transversal entre las UMI en hospitales generales de agudos del SNS con datos referidos a 2020, comparándolos con los anteriores estudios. Las variables de estudio fueron recogidas mediante un cuestionario ad hoc.
Resultados
Entre 2014 y 2020 aumentó la frecuentación hospitalaria y las altas dadas por las UMI (promedio anual del 4% y del 3,8%, respectivamente), así como las tasas interconsultas hospitalarias y primeras consultas (promedio anual: 2,1% en ambos casos). En 2020 aumentaron notablemente las consultas no presenciales. La mortalidad ajustada por riesgo y la estancia hospitalaria no mostraron cambios significativos en 2013−2020. Los progresos en la implantación de buenas prácticas y de una atención sistemática al paciente crónico complejo fueron escasos. Una constante en las encuestas RECALMIN es la variabilidad entre UMI en recursos y actividad, sin encontrarse diferencias estadísticamente significativas en relación con los resultados.
Conclusiones
Existe un notable margen de mejora en el funcionamiento de las UMI. La reducción de la variabilidad no justificada en la práctica clínica y las desigualdades en los resultados en salud deben ser un reto para los responsables de las UMI y para la Sociedad Española de Medicina Interna.}

abstract = {Background
Building on the success of targeted therapy in certain well-defined cancer genotypes, three platform studies—NCI-MATCH, LUNG-MAP and The National Lung Matrix Trial (NLMT)—have attempted to discover new genotype-matched therapies for people with cancer.
Patients and methods
We review the outputs from these platform studies. This review led us to propose a series of recommendations and considerations that we hope will inform future precision medicine programmes in cancer.
Results
The three studies collectively screened over 13 000 patients. Across 37 genotype-matched cohorts, there have been 66/875 responders, with an overall response rate of 7.5%. Targeting copy number gain yielded 5/199 responses across nine biomarker–drug matched cohorts, with a response rate of 2.5%.
Conclusions
The majority of these studies used single-agent targeted therapies. Whilst preclinical data can suggest rational combination treatment to reverse adaptive resistance or block parallel activated pathways, there is an essential need for accurate modelling of the toxicity–activity trade-off of combinations. Agent selection is often suboptimal; dose expansion should only be carried out with agents with clear clinical proof of mechanism and high target selectivity. Targeting copy number change has been disappointing; it is crucial to define the drivers on shared amplicons that include the targeted aberration. Maximising outcomes with currently available targeted therapies requires moving towards a more contextualised stratified medicine acknowledging the criticality of the genomic, transcriptional and immunological context on which the targeted aberration is inscribed. Genomic complexity and instability is likely to be a leading cause of targeted therapy failure in genomically complex cancers. Preclinical models must be developed that more accurately capture the genomic complexity of human disease. The degree of attrition of studies carried out after standard-of-care therapy suggests that serious efforts be made to develop a suite of precision medicine studies in the minimal residual disease setting.}

abstract = {Platelets produce platelet growth factors such as PDGF, IGF-1, EGF-, HGF, TGFβ, bFGF, and VEGF, which are crucial in regulating all stages of the wound healing process. The source of these substances is platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Over the past five decades, the interest and use of the regenerative properties of platelets have increased significantly in many different fields of medicine around the world. PRP and PRF plate preparations are used in: 1. Dentistry (they reduce bleeding, facilitate and accelerate soft tissue healing and bone regeneration - FGF 2, IGF-1, IGF-2, TGF-β1, and PDGF); 2. Sports medicine - IGF-1, IGF-2, TGF-β, VEGF, PDGF and bFGF, EGF); 3. dermatology and cosmetology (treatment of alopecia, hair reconstruction - FGF-7, HGF, acne scars, skin rejuvenation and regeneration, treatment of chronic and poorly healing wounds, burns, and acquired vitiligo); 4. Gynecology and reproductive medicine (treatment of infertility, erectile dysfunction - PDGF-β, TGF-β, IGF-1, in sexual dysfunction - PDGF, in vaginal atrophy); 5 Ophthalmology (in the healing of corneal epithelial wounds, in the treatment of dormant corneal ulcers, dry eye syndrome and the reconstruction of the corneal surface; 6. Neurology (regeneration of neurons, pain alleviation, and clinical symptoms - TGF-β 1, IGF-1, PDGF, VEGF) and FGF). Platelet-rich plasma therapy is a very interesting alternative and complement to traditional methods of treatment. However, the potential for using platelets is still not fully understood. The composition of platelet-rich plasma depends on many factors that may affect its use's efficacy and clinical benefits. Further research is necessary to standardize PRP delivery's preparation procedures and methods for a specific disease entity or clinical case.}

Although PM promises targeted benefits (and reduced risks) of therapeutic and preventive interventions, it has the potential to exacerbate health disparities, particularly if environmental contributions to ill health are neglected. Its implementation presents challenges with regard to informed consent, intrafamilial disclosure of genetic risks, and discrimination and stigmatization, particularly if a polygenic risk assessment is implemented without attention to macrolevel environmental factors. Individualizing health risks increases the risk that individuals will be blamed for their ill health. Moreover, because the knowledge base for PM is currently based on genetic/genomic studies in which people of European ancestry are vastly overrepresented, those of other ancestries will not currently benefit equally from PM. Further, the high cost of PM interventions, such as rare diseases or in precision oncology, also raises concern about access and fair distribution of PM’s potential benefits.}
