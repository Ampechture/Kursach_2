The present study aims to evaluate anti-tyrosinase activity of 10 commonly used TCM on mushroom (ab), human (hs) and mouse melanoma B16F0 (mm) tyrosinase (TYR) respectively. The results showed that at 1.0 mg/mL, extracts from Rosa rugosa Thumb, Morus alba L. and Paeonia lactiflora Pall were active against both abTYR and hsTYR (>50% inhibition), extracts from Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Rchb. F., Centella asiatica (L.) Urb, Cynanchum atratum L., Rosa canina L., Rhus chinensis Mill. and Glycyrrhiza urolensis Fisch. Ex DC. inhibited either abTYR or hsTYR (>50%), while extract from Tribulus terrestris L. had no/minimal activity (<10% inhibition). When treated with melanoma B16F0 cells, M. alba also significantly reduced mmTYR activity (70% at 250 μg/mL) and melanin content (50% at 250 μg/mL). These findings demonstrated inhibitory effects of 9 TCM against TYR and hence support their application as skin lightning agents. Our results also showed discrepancies in TYR activity from different sources, suggesting a testing regime of combining abTYR, hsTYR and mmTYR when developing depigmentation agents for human application.}

abstract = {Introduction
Evidenced based medicine (EBM) is necessary to standardize or treatment for infection since EBM is established based on the results of clinical trials. Entry criteria for clinical trials are very strict, and many patients have difficulties in being enrolled in any clinical trials regarding candidemia. It is questionable if the results of clinical trials reflect the real world of general medicine in this case.
Patients and methods
For the purpose of examining how many patients could join any randomized clinical trials for the treatment of candidemia, we reviewed all the candidemia patients in our institute during 2014–2018. The patients were divided into two groups: patients who were eligible for clinical trials (participation possible group), and those who were not (participation impossible group). Exclusion criteria for clinical trials were set based on previous clinical trials.
Results
A total of 70 patients was enrolled in this study. The median age was 73 years (range 36–93 years). Of these, 41 patients (59%) were male. As for site of infections, catheter related blood stream infection was most frequently seen in 37 (53%). Seventeen patients (24%) were classified as participation possible group and 53 patients (76%) were participation impossible group. Comparing the two groups, participation possible group patients have much better performance status, have less comorbidities and have longer overall survival times than participation impossible group patients.
Conclusion
Only 24% of candidemia patients were eligible for the clinical trials. Thus, we can see that clinical trials might not correctly reflect the real world among candidemia patients.}

As a new drug delivery method, microneedles (MNs) can effectively break through the stratum corneum barrier, deliver drugs more efficiently, and achieve better therapeutic effects. In this study, we develop a composite double-layer MN through multi-step casting fabrication using a polydimethylsiloxane mold. The needle tip was fabricated by mixed solution of chitosan and polyvinylpyrrolidone which was loaded with Polygonum multiflorum extract, and the base layer was prepared by mixed solution of polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone. In vitro mechanical tests showed that the maximum load of a single tip of the drug-loaded MN was about 3.5 ​N, which met the mechanical requirements of skin puncture (>1 ​N). The drug release experiment showed that the MN could achieve gradual drug release. In the animal experiment, pigmentation and hair regrowth occurred earlier in the Polygonum multiflorum-MN (Pm-MN) group than in the other groups, and hair growth finally appeared in almost the entire area. Compared with the AGA model mice, mice in the Pm-MN group achieved an increase in the number and diameter of hair follicles. In conclusion, the Pm-MN is scientific and feasible for treating AGA.}

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that belongs to the family of synucleiopathies, varying according to age, symptoms and progression. The hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) protein in neuronal and non-neuronal brain cells. Over the past decades, the diagnosis and treatment of PD had a view centred on motoric endpoint and deficits in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and consequently animal models of PD with predominantly motor behavior deficits have been used to study the disease. However, clinical trials have failed to translate results from animal models into successful treatments. PD as a multisystem disorder therefore requires additional assessment of early non-motor symptoms. Braak’s staging revealed early α-Syn pathology in the pontine brainstem and olfactory circuits controlling rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and olfaction, respectively. Recent converging evidence from multicenter clinical trials points to RBD as the most important functional risk marker for prodromal PD and conducting neuroprotective therapeutic trials in RBD-enriched cohorts has been recommended. Animal models of RBD and olfactory dysfunction may help bridge the translational research gap in precision drug discovery for PD.}

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the single most prevalent drug target family.

It explores large multidimensional biological information datasets that can elucidate individual variations in genes, functions, and the environment. In PM, there is an initial selection of customized therapies based on diagnostic tests including “omics” genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic, etc., background of the patient, and other physiological, biochemical, and cellular attributes. Thus, PM relies on molecular and cellular diagnostics and on imaging analysis, also known as molecular pathology, using artificial intelligence and other analytics tailored to an individual's genetic and molecular background, to determine the cause of the disease and monitor the tailored treatment using computing tools, such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, neural networks, and other algorithms for data analytics. With gradual ramping up of electronic health record datasets and new imaging and tests, AI can significantly contribute to the health-care sector. Herein, we focus on the evolving technologies and programs producing enabling technologies that enhance the aims of both personalized and precision medicine, including ethical questions and limits of what artificial intelligence can and cannot do.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) is sought by more than 50% of patients with osteoporosis. Despite this, many healthcare providers lack the knowledge to adequately counsel patients on safe and effective TCIM use. The purpose of this study was to determine the quantity and quality of TCIM recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the treatment and/or management of osteoporosis.
Methods
MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases, in addition to the Guidelines International Network, and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website were searched from 2009–2020. CPGs making TCIM recommendations for the treatment/management of osteoporosis were assessed with the AGREE II instrument.
Results
Of 536 unique search results, 27 osteoporosis CPGs made mention of TCIM therapies. From highest to lowest, scaled domain percentages of all eligible CPGs averaged to 92.59% for scope and purpose, 88.79% for clarity in presentation, 55.04% for stakeholder involvement, 47.84% for editorial independence, 46.53% for rigor of development, and 36.96% for applicability. Of the 27 CPGs assessed, 4 CPGs were recommended as is by both appraisers, while 23 CPGs were recommended with modifications.
Conclusions
Recommendations pertaining to calcium and vitamin D supplementation and exercise were favorably recommended across nearly all CPGs. In the case of other TCIM interventions, recommendations varied greatly, which may present challenges for CPGs target users due to a lack of consistency. Given the varying quality of osteoporosis CPGs found, those requiring improvement may benefit from their guideline development panel utilizing the AGREE II instrument to inform future updates.}

This review highlights the main approaches using biomaterials, growth factors, and cell therapies towards the healing of complex TM perforations. In addition, we discuss the challenges and advances for the development of reliable animal models, which will allow the optimisation and development of novel techniques. Finally, we indicate technologies that are currently used clinically and others that are closer to the market. The advances here discussed on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies applied to the field of TM perforations will allow otologists, surgeons, and researchers to better bring novel technologies to the bedside as well as to develop new ones.}

abstract = {For nearly three decades, tissue engineering strategies have been leveraged to devise effective therapeutics for dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) regenerative medicine and treat permanent deformities caused by many debilitating health conditions. In this regard, additive manufacturing (AM) allows the fabrication of personalized scaffolds that have the potential to recapitulate native tissue morphology and biomechanics through the utilization of several 3D printing techniques. Among these, melt electrowriting (MEW) is a versatile direct electrowriting process that permits the development of well-organized fibrous constructs with fiber resolutions ranging from micron to nanoscale. Indeed, MEW offers great prospects for the fabrication of scaffolds mimicking tissue specificity, healthy and pathophysiological microenvironments, personalized multi-scale transitions, and functional interfaces for tissue regeneration in medicine and dentistry. Excitingly, recent work has demonstrated the potential of converging MEW with other AM technologies and/or cell-laden scaffold fabrication (bioprinting) as a favorable route to overcome some of the limitations of MEW for DOC tissue regeneration. In particular, such convergency fabrication strategy has opened great promise in terms of supporting multi-tissue compartmentalization and predetermined cell commitment. In this review, we offer a critical appraisal on the latest advances in MEW and its convergence with other biofabrication technologies for DOC tissue regeneration. We first present the engineering principles of MEW and the most relevant design aspects for transition from flat to more anatomically relevant 3D structures while printing highly-ordered constructs. Secondly, we provide a thorough assessment of contemporary achievements using MEW scaffolds to study and guide soft and hard tissue regeneration, and draw a parallel on how to extrapolate proven concepts for applications in DOC tissue regeneration. Finally, we offer a combined engineering/clinical perspective on the fabrication of hierarchically organized MEW scaffold architectures and the future translational potential of site-specific, single-step scaffold fabrication to address tissue and tissue interfaces in dental, oral, and craniofacial regenerative medicine.
Statement of significance
Melt electrowriting (MEW) techniques can further replicate the complexity of native tissues and could be the foundation for novel personalized (defect-specific) and tissue-specific clinical approaches in regenerative dental medicine. This work presents a unique perspective on how MEW has been translated towards the application of highly-ordered personalized multi-scale and functional interfaces for tissue regeneration, targeting the transition from flat to anatomically-relevant three-dimensional structures. Furthermore, we address the value of convergence of biofabrication technologies to overcome the traditional manufacturing limitations provided by multi-tissue complexity. Taken together, this work offers abundant engineering and clinical perspectives on the fabrication of hierarchically MEW architectures aiming towards site-specific implants to address complex tissue damage in regenerative dental medicine.}

abstract = {The field of energy medicine (EM) is perhaps the most controversial branch of integrative medicine. Its core concept - the existence of an invisible healing energy – has not yet been validated by Western medicine, and the mechanism(s) of action of its techniques have not been fully elucidated. This paper addresses these problems by marshalling several types of evidence: basic science research into electromagnetic fields (EMF), subjective sensations experienced when receiving EM treatments, and clairvoyant perceptions of EM in action. The latter two sources of information, while not solid enough to meet current standards of scientific rigor, can nonetheless generate important new information. A hypothesis is then developed to explain these findings. First, the main components of the human subtle energy system are presented: the “subtle anatomy” of the meridians, of the energy centers and of the biofield. Several representative EM techniques are then analyzed to determine which specific components of that energy structure they impact. Next, EM's mechanisms of action are explored by describing how these altered energy dynamics can affect biologic processes. This subject is termed “energy physiology”, in parallel with conventional medicine's foundation in anatomy and physiology. Finally, potential research into energy physiology is outlined that focuses on several common but distinctive experiences which are not fully explained by the current mechanistic biomedical model. Plausible and testable energy-based explanations are proposed for phantom limb pain, emotional entrainment in groups, unusually rapid symptom response to EM, and the invisible templates that guide cell growth and differentiation. This analysis is intended to serve as a guide to future clinical and research explorations into the multidimensional nature of human beings. As Western medicine develops technologies that can generate objective empiric evidence in these subtle domains, we will be able to more fully understand the energetic components of health and illness.}

The philosophical, traditions and wisdom-based view of PM (also known as Iranian medicine and humoral medicine) comprises some of its most notable and indeed, defining features. The principles of health maintenance and disease prevention are highly regarded and come first in PM, with the principles of treatment (lifestyle modifications, nutrition, herbal medicines, etc.) possessing secondary importance. These principles are overlaid by the foundational concepts of balancing temperament (Mizaj) and body humors in PM. The natural temperament of an individual is a state of moderation that leads to good health, though any imbalances can give rise to disease and illness. With the recent revival of PM as a specialized academic discipline in Iran, research and discourse may help to the introduction of this ancient knowledge to the global community, ultimately with the goal of providing effective treatment strategies or options on a transnational scale. This has critical importance in providing and understanding culturally attentive care for patients who identify strongly with the traditions of PM. This article will introduce concepts relating to the origin of illness, and provide an overview of education, training and regulation, and research directions in PM as a means of knowledge dissemination within medical literature.}

abstract = {Introduction
The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Accreditation Council requires all nursing and midwifery programs to undergo reaccreditation every five years to ensure currency. For programs leading to endorsement to prescribe scheduled medicines, the program must be “equitable”, “flexible”, “effectual” and “accessible.” As the landscape of midwifery and health care continues to change, it is essential that existing programs that lead to endorsement as a midwife are critically evaluated both from educational and clinical application perspectives.
Objective
To examine midwives’ views of the educational, clinical and practical value of undertaking/completing a program of study that leads to endorsement to prescribe scheduled medicines.
Methods
Using a purpose developed survey, we sought feedback from midwives who had or were planning on completing a program leading to endorsement. The survey collected participant demographics, their experiences of undertaking a program leading to endorsement and the barriers and challenges faced in utilising endorsement in their context of practice. Ethical approval was gained.
Results
Of the 39 midwives who responded, 95% (n=37) had completed a program leading to endorsement - 46% (n=17) received a non-award/completion certificate, 38% (n=14) a graduate certificate/diploma and another 16% (n=6), masters. Of the total participants, 75% (n=27/36) had worked as an endorsed midwife; the majority in private practice (n=21/27, 78%). With respect to programs leading to endorsement, midwives found the content on pharmacology and script writing the most useful but indicated that more emphasis on antenatal care would have been beneficial. Midwives also highlighted that mentorship during their program of study would have assisted them to navigate the challenges of using their endorsement. From a clinical application perspective, participants described the challenges of navigating jurisdictional formularies – some had access to all medicines (including schedule 4 and 8), while others were limited to a select few. Almost all participants described that they had or were able to, order pathology, radiology and common screening tests. The largest barrier to utilising endorsement was the requirement to have a collaborative agreement. Midwives described resistance and reluctance from both doctors and entities to enter into these agreements and as such, stated they were “pointless”, “confusing” and “demeaning.” However, this was offset by the autonomy, flexibility, relationships and satisfaction afforded by their work.
Conclusion
Midwives surveyed in this study found benefit in completing a program leading to endorsement however, they expressed significant challenges and barriers when it came to utilising this extended practice. While some of these challenges stemmed from the program of study, a large proportion surfaced when midwives sought out collaborative agreements, access to formularies, and attempted to navigate jurisdictional inconsistencies. Midwives who hold endorsement are calling for change. Our findings add to the limited literature base and will inform changes to the provision of educational programs while providing more evidence for practice change.}

Tissue engineering has been introduced as an alternative approach for common available therapeutic strategies in the terms of restoring deformed tissue structure and its functionality via the developing of new bio-scaffold. Designed three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds, alone or in combination with bioactive agents, should be able to stimulate and accelerate the development of engineered tissues and provide proper mechanical support during in-vivo implantation and later regeneration process. To cover it up, a series of new bio-structures with higher mechanical strength were designed through the combination of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) into 3D bio-polymeric networks. HNTs clay mineral with its unique rod-like structure and distinctive chemical surface features, exhibits excellent biocompatibility and biosafety for doping into regenerative scaffolds to enhance their mechanical stiffness and biological performance. In this paper, the ongoing procedures of bone/cartilage tissue engineering and wound healing strategies focusing on the designing of 3D-HNTs bio-composites and their multi-cellular interactions in-vitro and in-vivo preclinical studies are reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects of 3D-HNTs and HNTs-based functional bio-devices for regenerative medicine are also discussed.}

Explore how often, when and how care decisions are discussed during consultations at an internal medicine outpatient clinic, and what we can learn from these observations.
Methods
Qualitative analysis of 150 video-taped consultations. Consultations involving a discussion of care decisions were analyzed using conversation analysis.
Results
1) Only 21 of the 150 consultations involved a discussion of care decisions; 2) As there is no destined phase for the introduction of the topic of care decisions, the topic is most often introduced at the end of the phase ‘treatment and course of the disease’; 3) A lot of interactional effort is needed to create common ground and make relevance clear with extensive justification. Hesitation markers, repairs and hypothetical talk show the precariousness of the topic.
Conclusions
Three dilemma’s need to be addressed: 1) a slot has to be created to introduce the topic of care decisions; 2) common ground has to be created, possibly over time; 3) the paradox of framing the topic as relevant ‘in the future’ but ‘needs to be discussed now’ needs to be attended to.
Practice implications
We recommend that physician training should address the three dilemmas. Future research should focus on how to do so.}

abstract = {The prevalence of unhealthy living behaviors is largely driven by environments that support them and has become a key concern at global, national, and individual (patient) levels. Healthy Living Medicine offers a compelling path forward to move people towards healthy living behaviors and better health outcomes when complemented by socially just and equitable public campaigns and initiatives. Some of the concepts that are critical for these campaigns and initiatives that will be discussed in this manuscript include the social determinants of health, the communication loop, health literacy, and implicit bias and discrimination. Considering what is practical and achievable, examples of actionable, socially-just strategies will be described to inform and encourage health professionals and other stakeholders to prioritize healthy living and reverse the poor health trajectory among our most vulnerable populations.}

abstract = {Purpose
It has been reported that adversarial growth during traumatic events potentially enhances coping with sequelae. The purpose of this work was to assess posttraumatic growth (PTG) among radiation medicine staff members at the individual level as well as changes in perceptions of departmental culture after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods and Materials
An anonymous PTG inventory (PTGI) survey comprising 21 indicators was disseminated to all 213 members of our multicenter radiation department to measure perceptions of change in personal, interpersonal-relationship, and philosophy of life factors using principal-factor analysis. Additionally, 8 department safety-culture indicators from the National Hospital Patient Safety Culture Survey developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality were included to assess changes in department safety-culture perceptions verses a prepandemic survey. The survey was repeated 15 months later to assess longitudinal trends.
Results
With a 56.3% survey-response rate, PTGI factor analysis yielded Cronbach's alpha values exceeding 0.90 for the 3 aforementioned PTG factors. The average growth per indicator was 2.3 (out of 5.0), which fell between small and moderate. The values were 2.4 (personal), 2.1 (interpersonal), and 1.6 (philosophy) for the 3 factors. The total PTGI score (47.7 ± 28.3 out of 105 points) was lower for masked, patient-facing, frontline workers members (41.8 ± 28.4) compared with others (53.1 ± 27.3, P value .001). For the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality survey there was an improvement of 15% in perceptions of department safety culture, and 7 of the 8 indicators showed improvements compared with baseline. The follow-up survey demonstrated overall sustained findings, albeit with a trend toward declining PTG scores for nonfrontline workers, notably in interpersonal relationships (47.4 ± 27.0, P value .05).
Conclusions
A fair-to-moderate degree of PTG was observed in personal and interpersonal relationship factors whereas least growth was noted in spiritual and religious beliefs. Perceptions of department patient-safety culture improved substantially. Sustained improvements were thus perceived at the individual and department levels.}

In this scenario, a new paradigm of modulation has emerged, following the development of small molecules capable of interfering with sarcomere contractile proteins. Potential applications include heart muscle disease and various forms of heart failure, although promising targets also include conditions affecting the skeletal muscle, such as degenerative neuromuscular diseases. In cardiac patients, a cardiac myosin stimulator, omecamtiv mecarbil, has shown efficacy in heart failure with reduced systolic function, lowering heart failure related events or cardiovascular death, while two inhibitors, mavacamten and aficamten, in randomized trials targeting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, have been shown to reduce hypercontractility and left ventricular outflow obstruction improving functional capacity. Based on years of intensive basic and translational research, these agents are the prototypes of active pipelines promising to deliver an array of molecules in the near future. We here review the available evidence and future perspectives of myosin modulation in cardiovascular medicine.}

NEN lesions with positive positron emission tomography with 18FDG (glucose analogue radiolabelled with fluoride-18) stablished a relationship with tumour aggressiveness and poorly differentiated cell morphology. Otherwise, NEN lesions evidencing somatostatin receptors (SSTR) overexpression or abnormal surface NE transporter system hyperactivity status of cancer cell profiles correlated with well differentiated cell morphology. Theoretically, the apparent correspondence between the triple-positive imaging of glycolytic hypermetabolism, SSTR overexpression and abnormal NE transporter system hyperactivity of overlapping cancer cell states in metastatic site of a NEN patient could be revealing a single tumorigenic subpopulation with a dynamic divergent differentiation potential. The complex events of metastasis progression included transdifferentiation from epithelial-to-mesenchymal to leave the primary neoplastic niche, probable as a collective migration of cancer cells, including cancer stem cells (CSCs), to circulating and reversibly transdifferentiating from mesenchymal-to-epithelial to settle in distant niches. Considering future research perspectives, we argued whether the apparent triple-positive matched correlative imaging with the radiolabelled molecular probes (glucose, SST and NE analogues) in patients’ metastatic niches could indicate potential biopsy sites to further investigation for the potential CSCs properties. We suggested that early treatment planning with lutetium-177-based peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, could provide for the blocking of poorly differentiated cell states at the point of differentiation to well differentiated cell states, and vice versa. In addition, specific individual cases should be considered for targeted-based therapy with radiolabelled-NE analogue, blocking dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation from abnormal NE transporter system hyperactivity status to SSTR overexpression cancer cell profile.}

Physicians who discussed their expertise and compassion for patients were also rated more favorably. A within-subjects experiment in Study 2 (N = 500) also demonstrated that linguistic self-presentation patterns can affect patient perceptions. Participants who read physician profiles with high rates of self-references and verbal confidence rated doctors as warmer and more competent than those who read physician profiles with low rates of self-references and certainty. Together, words are indicators of physicians’ self-presentation strategies and can change patient evaluations. Theoretical contributions for self-presentation and psychology of language research are discussed.}

In addition to chemotherapy, treatment options for AML include recently approved therapies that target proteins with roles in AML pathobiology, such as FLT3, BLC2, and IDH1/2. However, due to disease complexity, these therapies produce very diverse responses, and survival rates are still low. Thus, despite considerable advances, there remains a need for therapies that target different aspects of leukemic biology and for associated biomarkers that define patient populations likely to respond to each available therapy. To meet this need, drugs that target different AML vulnerabilities are currently in advanced stages of clinical development. Here, we review proteomics and phosphoproteomics studies that aimed to provide insights into AML biology and clinical disease heterogeneity not attainable with genomic approaches. To place the discussion in context, we first provide an overview of genetic and clinical aspects of the disease, followed by a summary of proteins targeted by compounds that have been approved or are under clinical trials for AML treatment and, if available, the biomarkers that predict responses. We then discuss proteomics and phosphoproteomics studies that provided insights into AML pathogenesis, from which potential biomarkers and drug targets were identified, and studies that aimed to rationalize the use of synergistic drug combinations. When considered as a whole, the evidence summarized here suggests that proteomics and phosphoproteomics approaches can play a crucial role in the development and implementation of precision medicine for AML patients.}

To explore contraceptive implant experiences, knowledge and attitudes among family medicine residents and preceptors. To identify barriers and facilitators to contraceptive implant training in family medicine.
Methods
This mixed-methods study began with a survey distributed to family medicine residents and preceptors across New Jersey, assessing knowledge, attitudes, and experiences about contraceptive implant training. We then interviewed residents and preceptors from programs with the highest and lowest resident implant training numbers. Participants discussed factors that supported or inhibited implant training and provision. We transcribed, coded, and analyzed interviews on a rolling basis until identifying saturation. We used deductive and inductive techniques to identify themes.
Results
Fifty-three preceptors and 146 residents from 15 family medicine residency programs completed the survey. Knowledge, attitudes, and experiences varied between programs, with a resident mean of 4.7 contraceptive implant insertions and 3.5 removals. Programs with the most implant provision had higher rates of resident comfort with insertions and higher rates of preceptor comfort with insertions and removals. We interviewed 14 residents and 11 preceptors from four family medicine residency programs, two with the highest and two with the lowest implant training numbers. Barriers included lack of trained preceptors, patient financial barriers, and office logistics. Facilitators included formal training, preceptor comfort, dedicated office sessions and staff, and patient demand.
Conclusions
Family medicine residency training provides a unique opportunity for impacting access to long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). We identified potential interventions including formal implant training sessions, dedicated procedure office sessions, stocking devices in office, and staff focused on reproductive health.}

There is currently no system that aligns pharmaceutically equivalent medicinal products across nations, creating obstacles to transnational medication prescribing and medical research. EDQM has been internationally recognized as the leading system in systematic pharmaceutical product descriptions. RxNorm is a critical terminology based in the US and used widely in applications internationally that would benefit from alignment with EDQM-based dosage form descriptions.
Goal
Demonstrate a method for alignment of RxNorm dosage forms with EDQM terminologies and with EDQM dosage forms. Describe obstacles and advantages of such an alignment for ultimate application in calculating universal Pharmaceutical Product Identifiers.
Methods
A pharmaceutical sciences student and a clinical pharmacology expert in dosage forms used definitions supplied by RxNorm and EDQM technical documentation to align the 120 RxNorm dose forms to EDQM-based dosage form description terms. The alignment of RxNorm to EDQM was then used to fit the RxNorm dose forms into an ontology based on EDQM.
Results and Conclusions
The alignment of RxNorm and EDQM requires further validation but provides a potential method of establishing interoperability between the two terminologies without cumbersome manual reclassification. There remain ambiguities within each dosage form nomenclature that create obstacles to integrating medication databases rooted in EDQM and RxNorm into a single worldwide database.}

A growing amount of evidence suggests that ion channels in the endolysosomal system play a crucial role in the pathology of both groups of diseases. The development of advanced patch-clamp technologies has allowed us to directly characterize ion fluxes through endolysosomal ion channels in their native environments. Endolysosomes are essential organelles for intracellular transport, digestion and metabolism, and maintenance of homeostasis. The endolysosomal ion channels regulate the function of the endolysosomal system through four basic mechanisms: calcium release, control of membrane potential, pH change, and osmolarity regulation. In this review, we put particular emphasis on the endolysosomal cation channels, including TPC2 and TRPML2, which are particularly important in monocyte function. We discuss existing endogenous and synthetic ligands of these channels and summarize current knowledge of their impact on channel activity and function in different cell types. Moreover, we summarize recent findings on the importance of TPC2 and TRPML2 channels as potential drug targets for the prevention and treatment of the emerging infectious diseases and cancer.}

In this study, we reported a novel green extract-system, one of hybrid deep eutectic solvents (HDESs), which could simultaneously efficiently extract active ingredients with different polarities from herbal medicines. Initially, quantitative analyses of 14 coumarins in Suhuang antitussive capsule (SH) were performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) under the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. After systematically optimizing the composition of HDESs, the composition of DL-menthol, decanoic acid, and 1-tetradecanol at a molar ratio of 6:0.5:1.5 exhibited the highest extract yields for target coumarins in SH. Then, response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the ultrasonic extraction conditions of this HDESs. The results showed that under the conditions of liquid to solid ratio of 496 mL/g, extract time of 30 min and water content of 35 %, the highest yield of total coumarins was obtained, and the extract efficiency was increased by 53.9 % compared with conventional organic solvents. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image showed the formation of HDESs-water micellar system during the ultrasonic-assisted extraction, which may promote the mass transfer process and improve the yield of target coumarins. This new ternary HDESs system could provide a green and effective extract technology for natural compounds with different polarities from complex plant materials.}

abstract = {Background
Senescence leads to permanent cell-cycle arrest and is a potential target for cancer therapy. Andrographolide (AD) is a diterpene lactone isolated from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Andrographis paniculate, which has been used as an anti-inflammatory drug in clinical practice with the potential to target senescence in recalcitrant lung cancer.
Purpose
To determine whether AD can induce senescence in human lung adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
Methods
SA-β-Gal staining was used to detect the expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) in human lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 and NCI-H1795. DNA damage was examined by the detection of γH2AX foci. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cancer cell proliferation was determined by ATPlite assay and clonogenic survival assay in vitro. Tumor growth was determined in a mouse model of A549. The expression level of proteins and mRNA was estimated by Western blotting and Quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knock down p21, p27 and p53 to explore the potential mechanism of AD-induced senescence in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.
Results
AD-induced A549 and NCI-H1795 cell senescence determined by increased cell size, flattened morphology, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest as well as the increased expression of β-galactosidase. AD inhibited cell proliferation in lung cells in vitro and lung cells xenograft growth in nude mice. p21 and p27, the major cell cycle regulators and mediators of senescence, were upregulated at the protein level in AD-treated A549 lung adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Further studies demonstrated that AD induced cell senescence via p53/p21 and Skp2/p27.
Conclusion
In the present study, we found that the primary anti-inflammatory drug AD could have a potential antitumor effect in lung cancer. We demonstrated that AD induced lung adenocarcinoma senescence in vitro and in vivo via p53/p21 and Skp2/p27 for the first time. AD is therefore a promising senescence-inducing therapeutic for recalcitrant human lung adenocarcinoma.}

This study conducts an umbrella review to identify the main barriers for the evaluation of ATMPs and their translation into clinical practice across the development lifecycle. 71 systematic reviews were included, of which 50 dealt primarily with effectiveness and safety, 13 with translation from pre-clinical to human subjects. Others dealt with economic issues and translation from health technology assessment to market access. The literature highlights the importance of synergistic research groups or networks that collaborate across the in-vitro science, preclinical and clinical investigation phases, and the role of private investor capital and public-private collaborations. Most ATMPs reviewed seem to have a favourable safety profile although considerable uncertainties remain. Randomised controlled trials are not always feasible in these patient groups. Greater sharing of data is recommended, both at preclinical and post-marketing real world evidence. There are considerable variations between EU countries in how they regulate hospital exemption for ATMPs, and this can lead to inequitable access for patients.}

abstract = {The failure of transplanted tissues and organs is a major challenge in contemporary regenerative medicine. Biocompatible scaffolds, fabricated from poly ε-caprolactone (PCL), are widely used in tissue engineering strategies to promote tissue and organ growth; however, scaffold biological activity and safety refinement are urgently needed to support their use in clinical practice. PCL scaffolds created in 2-D or 3-D forms have emerged with great potential for the development of tissue regeneration grafts. However, limited bioactivity and surface wettability render PCL scaffolds direct interactions with surrounding tissues. Manipulations of PCL scaffolds may have the potential to overcome these limitations. This review focuses on how scaffold manipulations enhance protein adsorption and can achieve optimized scaffold biocompatibility. From a practical perspective, techniques such as etching or deposition of bioactive compounds can easily modify the surface of the PCL scaffolds. Incorporating bioactive inorganic fillers can be an alternative way to enhance the bioactivity of PCL scaffolds. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of bioactive PCL scaffolds and their applications in regenerative medicine.}

abstract = {Background
Different Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the format of granules, such as Kanggan Granules (KangGs), Kouyanqing Granules (KouGs), Lianhua Qingwen Granules (LQGs), Qingkailing Granules (QGs) and Xiao'er Qingjie Granules (XQJGs), collectively named Yinhua-based herbal granules (YH-HGs) have been widely used in the management of pediatric outpatients with herpangina. Few head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of these agents. This network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to indirectly compare the efficacy of YH-HGs.
Methods
This systematic review and fixed-effect NMA was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) extension statement for NMA. RCTs assessing the efficacy and safety of YH-HGs in children that were also receiving ribavirin as the conventional therapy were searched from eight databases and two trial registers up to Jan 13, 2022. The primary outcome was total effectiveness rate (TER). The secondary outcomes were total adverse events (TAEs) and the time to symptom improvement of fever, vesicles, pain and salivation. Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by direct pairwise meta-analysis (MA) and NMA.
Results
A total of 10 RCTs, enrolling 1 017 pediatric patients, were included. YH-HGs were better than no medication (NM) in TER (RR = 1.22, 95%CIs, 1.16 – 1.28) by direct pairwise MA, in which KangGs (RR = 1.24, 95%CIs, 1.05 – 1.47), KouGs (RR = 1.17, 95%CIs, 1.08 – 1.27), LQGs (RR = 1.24, 95%CIs, 1.14 – 1.35), QGs (RR = 1.33, 95%CIs, 1.11 – 1.58) and XQJGs (RR = 1.18, 95%CIs, 1.00 – 1.40) were also more efficient than NM. As for secondary outcomes, YH-HGs was associated with a 103% increased risk of TAEs compared to NM, but no significant differences were found. YH-HGs has a more positive symptom improvement effect than NM in fever, vesicles, pain and salivation. The ranking results showed that QGs (79.2%) had the highest probability ranking first in TER and KangGs (63.6%) ranked as the second, followed by LQGs (52.4%), XQJGs (50.3%), KouGs (49.7%), and NM (4.9%) at last.
Conclusions
Our findings support the better efficacy of YH-HGs than NM as regards TER. QGs, KangGs, LQGs, XQJGs, KouGs remain superior to NM and their clinical choice should depend on the patient's conditions to improve symptoms better for the different effects. Given the limitations of NMA, head-to-head RCTs with high-quality are needed.}

While needle pain is especially problematic for children needle pain and associated fear also has significant impact on adults and can lead to avoidance of appropriate medical care. Currently there is not a standard definition of needle pain. A taxonomy, or classification system, for acute needle pain would aid research efforts and enhance clinical care. To meet this need, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks public−private partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the American Pain Society, and the American Academy of Pain Medicine formed the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks−American Pain Society−American Academy of Pain Medicine Pain Taxonomy initiative. One of the goals of this initiative was to develop taxonomies for acute pain disorders, including needle pain. To accomplish this, a working group of experts in needle pain was convened. Based on available literature and expert opinion, the working group used a 5-dimenional structure (diagnostic criteria, common features, modulating factors, impact and/or functional consequences, and putative mechanisms) to develop an acute pain taxonomy that is specific needle pain. As part of this, a set of 4 diagnostic criteria, with 2 modifiers to account for the influence of needle associated fear, are proposed to define the types of acute needle pain.
Perspective
This article presents a taxonomy for acute needle pain. This taxonomy could help to standardize definitions of acute pain in clinical studies of patients undergoing needle procedures.}

Numerous cell-related studies have been conducted to treat a variety of diseases and injuries, including cardiovascular disease, neurological abnormalities, musculoskeletal deformities, and osteoarthritis. As a result, cell encapsulation in homogenous micro-sized hydrogels and transplantation in vivo have recently attracted a lot of interest for minimally invasive administration and improving the therapeutic actions of transplanted cells. This chapter discusses the current state of the art and future directions in the field of cell encapsulation in the context of regenerative medicine. We also discuss current advancements in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, as well as recent advances in hydrogel design for cell encapsulation.

abstract = {Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women, and the curative effects of its current management are not satisfactory. A formula of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), called Bu-Shen-Tian-Jing Formula (BSTJF), has clinically shown beneficial effects in treating PCOS.
Purpose
This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying BSTJF for treatment of PCOS.
Methods
Whole blood samples were collected from women with PCOS treated and not treated with BSTJF (n = 5 per group). Whole transcriptome sequencing of leukocytes and untargeted metabonomic analysis of the plasma were performed. Three groups of 18 female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly selected: control, PCOS, and BSTJF. A PCOS rat model was established using testosterone propionate. The estrous cycle; glucose tolerance; ovarian morphology; serum markers of oxidative stress; and expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospho-protein kinase B in the ovary were measured. Palmitate was initially applied to KGN cells, followed by freeze-dried BSTJF powder. The glucose uptake, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and protein levels of SIRT3, PI3K, and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) were detected in KGN cells.
Results
The transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles showed alterations in 572 genes and 73 metabolites in women with PCOS treated with BSTJF. The enriched pathways in women with PCOS treated with BSTJF were mainly involved in inflammation, insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism, and neuro and associated signaling pathways. In PCOS rat models, BSTJF improved the estrous cycle, glucose tolerance, and ovarian morphology; relieved oxidative stress; increased ovarian SIRT3 expression; inhibited p38 MAPK activation; and promoted the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in the ovary. In the in-vitro study with KGN cells, BSTJF rescued the palmitate-induced impaired glucose uptake and SIRT3 expression, reduced mitochondrial ROS production mediated by SIRT3, and restored the impaired insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
Conclusion
BSTJF effectively alleviated the pathogenesis of PCOS by improving oxidative stress and glucose metabolism via mitochondrial SIRT3 and the following insulin signaling pathway. This study innovatively revealed the action mechanism of CHM in treating PCOS.}

The main parameters affecting the extraction in the MSPE process were studied and optimized. Fe3O4@MIL-68(Al) coated with 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene and terephthaldehyde (Fe3O4@MIL-68(Al)@TAPB-PDA-COF) was analyzed and verified.

The adsorption results were in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities of Fe3O4@MIL-68(Al)@TAPB-PDA-COF over CBZ and TBZ were 54.24 and 67.87 mg g−1, respectively, and the equilibrium adsorption time was 200 min.

abstract = {Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has been a significant concern worldwide since its outbreak in December 2019. Various treatments are being researched and developed, and there are reports that dexamethasone has reduced the mortality rate and improved the clinical course of critically ill patients with COVID-19. In this study, we examined the clinical efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for patients with COVID-19 in our hospital during the first wave of infections.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with or without corticosteroid therapy at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Japan between February and April 2020. The primary outcome was improvement in the patients’ clinical course using a seven-category ordinal scale. We collected data on patient characteristics, treatment, and clinical course, and compared them between two groups: the steroid-using group and the non-steroid-using group.
Results
Between February and April 2020, 110 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Despite poor conditions during admission into the steroid group, there were no statistical differences in clinical course between both groups, as measured using the scale. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in the number of days to fever resolution or negative polymerase chain reaction results.
Conclusions
There was no difference in the clinical course between both groups. Because of the difference in background, corticosteroids may potentially make the clinical course of severely ill patients similar to that of mildly ill patients.}

abstract = {Background
A preoperative evaluation is an opportunity to engage in advance care planning (ACP) with older adults. The objective of this study was to identify the frequency and characteristics associated with ACP documentation in older adults evaluated at a preoperative medicine clinic (PMC) prior to elective surgery.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of preoperative medicine clinic (PMC) visits with patients aged 65 and older from April to July 2020 at our tertiary academic medical center. A patient-level analysis was done to identify patient characteristics associated with ACP documentation. Odds ratios were estimated from logistic regression.
Results
1409 patients presented over 1456 visits. 28% of visits documented a surrogate decision maker (SDM), 11% an advance directive (AD), and 17% a POLST (of which 36% ordered Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) and 44% Limited Treatment or Comfort Measures Only). Increasing age, ASA 3–4, and cognitive impairment increased the odds of any ACP documentation (OR 1.08, 2.76, 3.28; all P<0.001) and preoperative POLST completion (OR 1.09, 1.81, 3.96; all P<0.001). Visits for high-risk (HR) procedures were more likely to have any ACP documentation (OR 1.80, P<0.001), though patients with treatment-limiting POLST orders were less likely to be seen at PMC in preparation for a HR procedure compared to those ordering Full Treatment (OR 0.49, P = 0.045).
Conclusions
ACP documentation is more frequently completed for higher risk patients undergoing PMC evaluation, however overall rates are low. Systematizing ACP documentation may be facilitated using a centralized ACP repository with the medical record.}

abstract = {Introduction
In the United States, medical education on sexual medicine varies throughout the country and between institutions. With limited standardization, medical students and subsequent trainees have little to no training in how to approach a patient with concerns surrounding their sexual health. In 2018, half of the medical institutions in the United States required formal instruction in sexual medicine. Of those institutions that do include didactic material on sexual medicine, most of the material is dedicated to anatomy, physiology, and sexually transmitted infections, with limited or no information on sexual dysfunction and sexual history taking. Therefore, we identified a need to determine which components of sexual medicine, particularly female sexual medicine, are currently being covered in undergraduate medical education with the goal of proposing and developing standardized curriculum materials to be utilized by medical students during their preclinical education.
Objective
The aim of this study is to examine current preclinical curricula at all seven medical schools, including six allopathic and one osteopathic institution, in the Chicago, Illinois area to investigate which aspects of female sexual anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology are being taught to medical students.
Methods
Curriculum materials on female sexual anatomy, physiology and pathology were collected from all seven medical schools in Chicago, Illinois. Courses covering topics on female sexual medicine varied between institutions due to differences in preclinical curriculum and coursework. To standardize our needs assessment, we utilized previous literature to identify specific components of anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, social sciences, and history and physical exam skills. Upon reviewing each institution's preclinical educational materials, we assessed curriculum content for saturation of specific concepts within each of the above areas.
Results
Curriculum materials were collected from seven (n=7) total medical schools in the surrounding Chicago, Illinois area. Out of the 7 institutions, 4/7 discussed clitoral anatomy, with 6/7 mentioning the glans, 1/7 mentioning the corona, 2/7 mentioning the clitoral hood, 6/7 mentioning the corpora cavernosa, 4/7 mentioning the corpus spongiosum, 6/7 mentioning the crus, 6/7 mentioning the bulb and 5/7 detailing the clitoral neurovasculature. In addition to the anatomy, 4/7 discussed the physiology of the female orgasm, 3/7 highlighted the rate and epidemiology of female sexual dysfunction (FSD), 3/7 included information on treatment for FSD, 1/7 taught a genitourinary physical exam specific to assessing FSD (external exam, internal exam, pelvic floor assessment), and 6/7 institutions included information on how to take a sexual history asking about sexual function, pleasure, and satisfaction.
Conclusion
Overall, our focused needs assessment of both allopathic and osteopathic medical schools in the Chicago, Illinois area highlights the need for restructuring of curriculum as it pertains to female sexual medicine and FSD in undergraduate medical education. Next steps include proposing individual curricular recommendations to institutions, due to the variation in current curriculum design, as to how they can better teach on areas surrounding FSD, while also aiming to standardize what medical students are learning during their preclinical years.

Many interesting strategies are being researched in the attempt to improve plants' environmental stress tolerance. These include the application of nanoparticles, which have been found to improve plant function under stress situations. Nanotechnology will be a key driver in the upcoming agri-tech and pharmaceutical revolution, which promises a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient agricultural and medical system Nano-fertilizers can help plants utilise nutrients more efficiently by releasing nutrients slowly and sustainably. Plant physiology and nanomaterial features (such as size, shape, and charge) are important aspects influencing the impact on plant growth. Here, we discussed the most promising new opportunities and methodologies for using nanotechnology to increase the efficiency of critical inputs for crop agriculture, as well as to better manage biotic and abiotic stress. Potential development and implementation challenges are highlighted, emphasising the importance of designing suggested nanotechnologies using a systems approach. Finally, the strengths, flaws, possibilities, and risks of nanotechnology are assessed and analysed in order to present a comprehensive and clear picture of the nanotechnology potentials, as well as future paths for nano-based agri-food applications towards sustainability. Future research directions have been established in order to support research towards the long-term development of nano-enabled agriculture and evolution of pharmaceutical industry.}

With the recent advances in biomedical research, the role of big data and precision medicine has drastically increased. As a result, there is a massive requirement for endowing machine learning (ML) and systems genomics algorithms, in sync with multiomics data, to weigh potential phenotype–genotype association. The variant genetic and expression profiles of a population are the reason for the different degrees of responses to a particular medication or treatment strategy. The advancement in computational biology has made it possible to analyze and functionally annotate the available biological big datasets. Artificial intelligence in biology can help to draw patterns between functional annotations and construct a functional hologram from diverse data types. ML approaches have devised various algorithms to deduce and develop high-throughput sequencing, phenotyping, and metabolomics approaches. These advancements are economical, more precise, and time-efficient. As a result, SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) has emerged as a clinical genomic signature for novel drug discovery and target prediction in health omics. In this chapter, we tend to concentrate on applying ML and deep learning methods to apply high-throughput sequencing strategies in the development of precision medicine by using SNP as a tool of reference.}

To identify concerns related to the use of medicines for adults with complex needs and explore whether these differed between healthcare professionals and patients/carers, in order to inform development of interventions to increase medication adherence.
Methods
A quantitative secondary analysis of a database of healthcare professionals’ and patients’/carers’ healthcare concerns, related to adults with complex needs. Categories of concerns related to medicines use were identified and concerns related to medication use coded against these. Data were analysed descriptively, and a Chi-square test conducted to test for differences in responses from healthcare professionals versus patients/carers.
Results
There was a significant difference in the types of medication concern raised by healthcare professionals versus those raised by patients/carers. Patients/carers expressed more concerns about side effects and interactions; healthcare professionals identified more concerns related to patient support and carers’ knowledge/training.
Conclusion
Healthcare professionals had significantly different concerns about medicines to patients; this may be a potential barrier to medication adherence.
Practice implications
Healthcare professionals may need to adopt an approach to non-adherence that goes beyond education and counselling and adopts a wider patient perspective. Findings suggest that a greater focus on addressing side effects and interactions may be beneficial in increasing medication adherence.}

Previous studies demonstrated the low evidence-based practice competence of nurses in traditional Chinese medicine hospitals. University education may enhance nursing students' evidence-based practice competence. Few studies have investigated traditional Chinese Nursing Bachelor students' evidence-based practice competence.
Objectives
To investigate the evidence-based practice competence of traditional Chinese Nursing Bachelor students across all grades and their influencing factors.
Design
A cross-sectional online study.
Settings
A traditional Chinese medicine university offering an evidence-based nursing curriculum in Beijing, China.
Participants
A total of 601 traditional Chinese Nursing Bachelor students were recruited, with a response rate of 70.05%. The junior and senior groups consisted of first- and second-year students, and third- and fourth-year students, respectively.
Methods
An online survey was conducted in 2019 using a self-administered questionnaire encompassing attitude, knowledge, and skill. A t-test, non-parametric test, and correlation analysis were used for data analysis.
Results
Evidence-based practice attitude mean scores were the highest in both groups (3.87 ± 0.48 junior; 3.97 ± 0.45 senior), followed by skill (3.33 ± 0.46 junior; 3.48 ± 0.46 senior) and knowledge (3.21 ± 0.55 junior; 3.52 ± 0.47 senior). In the senior group, attitude decreased (from 4.02 to 3.86). The two groups reported the same items with the lowest scores in all three dimensions. The influencing factors were 1) scientific research experience (Z = −2.87) and a medical literature retrieval course (t = −3.40) for the junior group, 2) completion of the evidence-based nursing course (Z = −2.59) for the senior group, and 3) student admission level (Zjunior = −2.55, Zsenior = −3.85) and English language proficiency (chi-squarejunior = 2.80, chi-squaresenior = 16.37) for both groups.
Conclusions
Deficiencies in evidence implementation and decreasing evidence-based practice attitudes among fourth-year students warrant attention. Evidence-based nursing courses could be optimised, and research and English activities enriched to improve evidence-based practice competence.}

In this study, catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of licorice residue (LR) over ZSM-5 was conducted using pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The effects of temperature, Si/Al atomic ratio (SAR) and catalyst to feedstock (C/F) ratio on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) were investigated. The results indicated that ZSM-5 effectively converts oxygenates into AHs. Specifically, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene and naphthalene (BTEXN) were the dominant components. The pyrolysis temperature and acidity of zeolite exert a greater influence on the formation of BTEXN. The maximum content of BTEXN was 73.45 % at 500 °C and 72.21 % at lower SARs (27 and 36). Coke can be formed and deposited on the zeolite during CFP of LR, which cause the deactivation of catalyst. A higher pyrolysis temperature and C/F ratios inhibits the coke formation, while a higher SAR is beneficial to coke formation. The large oxygenated molecules and aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHCs) was the precursors of coke during catalytic pyrolysis. The coke was tended to disperse on the surface of catalyst at low temperature. However, it was largely deposited in the channels of zeolite catalyst at high temperatures. This study reveals that ZSM-5 is an effective catalyst for the utilization of herbal medicine wastes. The pyrolytic bio-oil has high potential for use in fuels or renewable chemical production.}
