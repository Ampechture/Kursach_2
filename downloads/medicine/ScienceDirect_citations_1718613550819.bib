abstract = {Stroke is a serious threat to human survival and health due to its high morbidity and mortality. The pathological mechanism of stroke is complex and involves various regulated cell death (RCD) modalities such as autophagy, apoptosis and necroptosis. ferroptosis, a novel form of RCD characterised by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen radicals, has been found to be closely associated with the prognosis and outcome of stroke. At the same time, ferroptosis is also associated with other forms of RCD with varying degrees of crosstalk. Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), with its multi-component, multi-pathway and multi-target action characteristics, has unique advantages and good prospects for application in stroke prevention and treatment. Using ferroptosis and its crosstalk with other forms of RCD as an entry point, we review the research on TCM with anti-stroke effects discovered in the past 10 years, with a view to providing reference for further scientific development and application of anti-stroke therapeutic drugs.}

abstract = {In the field of regenerative medicine, the use of biomaterials as scaffolds that provide structural integrity is key for tissue regeneration. In this context, hydrogels are considered a great option, due to their elastic properties and capacity to absorb large amounts of water while preserving their structure. Notably, both collagen and gelatin are considered good candidates for use due to their high biocompatibility. In particular, gelatin is a collagen derivative that has better biological properties at the expense of poorer mechanical properties. Therefore, the main objective of this work was the development and characterization of polymeric hydrogels based on collagen and gelatin. In this sense, hydrogels with different collagen/gelatin ratios were elaborated using cooling as the gelation method. Subsequently, different studies were carried out in order to evaluate their mechanical, thermal and microstructural properties, as well as their biocompatibility. The results showed that hydrogels formed from the mixture of collagen and gelatin retain, to a large extent, the good viscoelastic properties of collagen, while showing low levels of cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility similar to those obtained for gelatin. However, owing to the nature of the materials used, the thermal characteristics are not ideal for use in biomedicine, thus further studies are required to overcome these drawbacks.}

Judicious use of surgery combined with careful prescribing will optimize comfort, allowing the patient to live as well as possible for as long as possible. Anticipatory prescribing includes opioid, anti-emetic, anti-secretory and sedative medication. Attention should also be given to care of the bereaved.

The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of scribe use on physicians, nurses, and patients in an orthopaedic sports medicine clinic.
Methods
Surveys containing validated outcome measures relating to physician well-being and workplace satisfaction, among other variables, were used to assess the influence of medical scribes on clinic function. These surveys were collected for 8 months from all patients, nurses, and orthopaedic surgeons working in one orthopaedic sports medicine clinic. Time during a half-day clinic (i.e., 20 or more patients) was documented by surgeons after the last patient was seen.
Results
The average time spent per half day of clinic was 104 minutes on nonscribe days and 25 minutes on scribe days. Additionally, the time spent documenting encounters per half day of clinic was 87 minutes on average without scribes and 26 minutes on average with scribes. The average surgeon single assessment numeric evaluation (SANE) score was 48.1 without scribes, and 89.3 with scribes. The overall assessment of the clinic by nurses was 73.4 out of 100 on average without scribes and 87.7 out of 100 on average with scribes. Patients did not report a significant change in rating of overall experience (4.7/5.0 with scribes and 4.8/5.0 without scribes, (P = .27) or wait time between scheduled appointment time and surgeon arrival (15.1 minutes with scribes and 18.1 minutes without scribes; P = .12).
Conclusions
We found the use of scribes in a high-volume orthopaedic sports medicine clinic to have a favorable impact on physicians, nurses, and trainees. The use of a scribe also significantly reduced the time required by surgeons for documentation during clinic and at the end of each clinic day. Patients also reported no significant difference in patient clinic experience scores.
Clinical Relevance
Orthopaedic surgeons spend a substantial amount of time on paperwork. The results of this study could provide information on whether the use of a scribe helps to reduce administrative burden on orthopedic surgeons.}

abstract = {Objective
From the beginning of 2020, our study team formulated a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription named Sanhanhuashi formula (SHHS) to treat COVID-19 patients. Then we conducted several studies to explore the effectiveness of SHHS formula and other influencing factors on prognosis of disease. The purpose of this study was to describe the trends of patients’ characters from 2020 to 2021 based on two separate cohorts, and to explore the influencing factors on incidence of severe COVID-19 conditions, especially the contributions of timely treatment and higher compliance to SHHS formula.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Wuhan, Hubei province and Tonghua, Jilin province. Participants were hospitalized mild to moderate COVID-19 consecutive enrolled patients in Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese and western medicine (from Feb 13, 2020 to March 8, 2020) and Tonghua central hospital (from Jan 17, 2021 to Feb 5, 2021). Age, sex, time waiting to be hospitalized, medical history, initial symptoms, concomitant medication, and severity of disease were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to explore the associations between various exposures and the outcome, ie. the proportion of patients who were converted to severe status. E-values and its lower control limit (LCL) were calculated for sensitivity analysis.
Results
Totally, 176 COVID-19 patients in two hospitals were enrolled. 81 patients were from Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese and western medicine and 95 from Tonghua central hospital. 42 patients used SHHS formula arrival or exceed 7 days, and 2 (4.8%) progressed to severe condition. Among 134 patients who were exposed SHHS less than 7 days, 18 (13.4%) were converted to severe situation. Compared with those diagnosed in 2020, cases in 2021 were characterized as lower rates of initial symptoms (88.9% vs 35.8%, P < 0.001) and concomitant medications ever widely used, eg. antiviral medicine (71.6% vs 43.2%, P < 0.001), antibiotics (61.7% vs 13.7%, P < 0.001) and Chinese patent medicine (76.5% vs 44.2%, P < 0.001). They also waited less time for hospitalization (median: 12 vs 2 days, P < 0.001). The final multivariate logistic regression model showed that age (> 60 yrs) (OR: 3.943; 95% CI: 1.402–11.086; P = 0.009; E-value = 7.35, LCL:2.15), diagnosis year (OR: 0.165; 95% CI: 0.050–0.551; P = 0.003; E-value=11.6, LCL: 3.03) and SHHS exposure (OR: 0.118; 95% CI: 0.014–0.992; P = 0.049; E-value = 16.43, LCL:1.1) were independent risk factors for predicting severe status.
Conclusions
The profile of COVID-19 patients has changed after one year. In addition to age, diagnosis year and SHHS exposure are two new factors to predict the prognosis of disease. The patients diagnosed in 2021 were mainly benefited from timely treatment. Subsequently, adhere to use SHHS formula a quite longer time reduced the number of severe cases. Therefore, both the current epidemic prevention and control measures and increasing compliance to traditional Chinese medicine are effective ways to reducing severe cases and improving public health.}

To review the historical perspective and current status of oral medicine in Brazil and to describe the next steps for the future of this specialty in our country.
Study Design
We performed a search based on the records of the Brazilian Society of Stomatology and Oral Pathology (SOBEP) and the Brazilian Federal Dental Council, as well as based on expert evidence input from academic leaders from different generations of Brazilian oral medicine specialists.
Results
Oral medicine has grown over the last 50 years in Brazil. Despite being a young specialty, professionals have worked hard to leverage postgraduate education through clinical practice and research. The onset of oral medicine in Brazil dates back to 1969, followed by SOBEP in 1974. However, official recognition as an independent specialty was achieved only in 1992 by the Brazilian Federal Dental Council. To date, most oral medicine specialists are concentrated in the Southeast region, and these specialists are active members of several international associations.
Conclusion
The future of oral medicine in Brazil will depend on the establishment of advanced training programs and better uniformity of clinical practice following the trends of the specialty internationally and establishing a standard curriculum at a post-graduate level.}

Starting from a multidimensional model of regulating immunity, improving inflammation, and protecting multiple organs, this paper constructs a multidimensional model of targeted drug discovery, integrating molecular, cellular, and animal efficacy evaluation. Through functional activity testing, biophysical detection of compound binding to target proteins, multidimensional pharmacodynamic evaluation systems of cells (Vero E6, Vero, Vero81, Huh7, and caca2) and animals (mice infected with the new coronavirus, rhesus macaques, and hamsters), the effectiveness of effective preparations was evaluated, and various efficacy effects including lung moisturizing, dehumidification and detoxification were obtained. Using modern technology, it is now possible to understand how the immune system is controlled, how inflammation is reduced, and how various organs are protected. Complete early drug characterization and finally obtain effective targeted TCM. This article provides a demonstration resource for the development of new drugs specifically for TCM.}

Conventional treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) like 5alpha-reductase inhibitors and invasive surgery are associated with some obvious side effects. Conversely, evidence, though limited, has shown that alternative medicines are safer and have potential to improve the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and quality of life in addition to improving sexual dysfunction in patients with BPH. The current article aimed to include an overview of BPH, different ways of its management, and particularly its appreciation in Greco-Arab (Unani) system of medicine, one of the alternative medicinal systems.
Methods
PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar databases and classical texts of Greco-Arab medicine were searched for data collection.
Results
In Unani system of medicine, BPH, traced under the headings of Waram unuq al-mathana (bladder neck swelling) and Insidad majra-i-mathana (bladder outlet obstruction), has been managed for centuries with herbal medicines yet demanding a comprehensive scientific validation. Among the herbs, Cucurbita pepo, Tribulus terrestris, Urtica dioica, and Linum usitatissimum are worth mentioning.
Conclusion
For achieving the goal of LUTS-free ageing men, and safer and cost-effective future management of BPH, Unani herbal medicine could hopefully prove beneficial.}

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is “the process of systematically seeking, examining, evaluating, and utilizing current research findings as the basis for clinical decision-making by combining both individual clinical competence and client choice”.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude toward EBM and its associated factors among health science students in Mettu University.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a random sample of health science students in Mettu University from November to December 2022. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with the knowledge and attitude toward EBM. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval and P ≤ 0.05 was used to quantify strength of association between variables.
Results
Out of 423 health science students 415 completed the questionnaire (with a 98.1% response rate). Overall, 49.4% (205/415) of respondents had a favorable attitude toward EBM and 50.6% (208/415) had good knowledge of EBM. The majority 61.1% (253/415) of participants had internet access. Only 12.0% (50/415) of respondents had received EBM-related training. Respondent's EBM training was associated with knowledge of EBM were 2.7 times (AOR 2.70, 95% CI 1.38, 5.31), those who understood sensitivity were 3.0 times (AOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.76, 3 0.60), those who understood odds ratio were 2.0 times (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.35, 2.38), Aware of PubMed were 1.9 times (AOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.03, 3.73), and Owned smart-phone or PC were 3.6 times (AOR 3.67, 95% CI 3.20, 4.31). Good EBM knowledge was 3.0 times (AOR 3.01, 95% CI 2.05, 3.12), Aware of PubMed resources to make clinical decisions was 2.9 times (AOR 2.99, 95% CI 3.20, 3.61), and Participants owned a smartphone or personal computer were 3.2 times (AOR 3.23, 95% CI 3.05, 3.57) were predictors of positive attitude.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates a lack of formal EBM training and awareness of basic concepts of EBM among health science students. Health science students' attitude toward EBM were 49.4% to enhance EBM knowledge and skills, formal teaching of EBM courses should be integrated into medical education.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is becoming a popular complementary approach in pediatric oncology. However, few or no meta-analyses have focused on clinical studies of the use of TCM in pediatric oncology.
Objective
We explored the patterns of TCM use and its efficacy in children with cancer, using a systematic review, meta-analysis and data mining study.
Search strategy
We conducted a search of five English (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov) and four Chinese databases (Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Database) for clinical studies published before October 2021, using keywords related to “pediatric,” “cancer,” and “TCM.”
Inclusion criteria
We included studies which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational clinical studies, focused on patients aged < 19 years old who had been diagnosed with cancer, and included at least one group of subjects receiving TCM treatment.
Data extraction and analysis
The methodological quality of RCTs and observational studies was assessed using the six-item Jadad scale and the Effective Public Healthcare Panacea Project Quality Assessment Tool, respectively. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate the efficacy of combining TCM with chemotherapy. Study outcomes included the treatment response rate and occurrence of cancer-related symptoms. Association rule mining (ARM) was used to investigate the associations among medicinal herbs and patient symptoms.
Results
The 54 studies included in this analysis were comprised of RCTs (63.0%) and observational studies (37.0%). Most RCTs focused on hematological malignancies (41.2%). The study outcomes included chemotherapy-induced toxicities (76.5%), infection rate (35.3%), and response, survival or relapse rate (23.5%). The methodological quality of most of the RCTs (82.4%) and observational studies (80.0%) was rated as “moderate.” In studies of leukemia patients, adding TCM to conventional treatment significantly improved the clinical response rate (odds ratio [OR] = 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49–4.36), lowered infection rate (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.13–0.40), and reduced nausea and vomiting (OR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.08–0.23). ARM showed that Radix Astragali, the most commonly used medicinal herb (58.0%), was associated with treating myelosuppression, gastrointestinal complications, and infection.
Conclusion
There is growing evidence that TCM is an effective adjuvant therapy for children with cancer. We proposed a checklist to improve the quality of TCM trials in pediatric oncology. Future work will examine the use of ARM techniques on real-world data to evaluate the efficacy of medicinal herbs and drug-herb interactions in children receiving TCM as a part of integrated cancer therapy.}

abstract = {Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is an area of interdisciplinary research exploring the complex interactions within the immuno-neuro-endocrine system in response to psychosocial influences. Such influences can trigger neurological changes, leading to immunological effects related to the emergence and course of various diseases. This concise clinical review explores the role of PNI in oral medicine in three exemplary models of oral disease: periodontitis, herpes labialis, and oral lichen planus. Previous literature has shown that psychosocial stress is related to exacerbations in these three oral diseases and to poorer overall oral health. The presumed biological mechanisms affect the activity of stress axes, i.e. the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and subsequent immune system dysregulation. Although these PNI mechanisms remain poorly understood, several stress reduction interventions in clinical oral medicine have already yielded promising results. In future work, the elucidation of pathways within PNI networks will require carefully designed studies with sensitive methodology, e.g. the integrative single-case design. A biopsychosocial approach has the potential to move disease models in oral medicine from simple connections rooted in empirical dualism and reductionism to the establishment of network-based models. Further research on these complex connections should lead to novel clinical approaches and preventive strategies in oral medicine.}

abstract = {In the field of regenerative medicine, the importance of 3D bioprinting is self-evident and nonnegligible. However, 3D bioprinting technology also requires bioink with excellent performance as support material to fabricate a multi-functional bioinspired scaffold. Collagen-based bioink is regarded as an ideal 3D bioprinting ink for its excellent biocompatibility, controllable printability and cell loading property. It is an important breakthrough in regenerative medicine with the progress of collagen-based bioink, which fabricates bioinspired scaffolds with different functions and is applied in different repair scenarios. This review summarizes the different applications of collagen-based bioink and classifies them as soft tissue and hard tissue according to the target region. The applications of target region in soft tissues include skin, cartilage, heart and blood vessels, while in hard tissues include femur, skull, teeth and spine. When the collagen-based bioink is applied in repairing soft tissue, the requirements of function are higher, while the mechanical properties must be further improved in repairing hard tissue. We further summarize the characteristics of collagen-based bioink and point out the most important properties that should be considered in different repair scenarios, which can provide reference for the preparation of bioinks with different functions. Finally, we point out the main challenges faced by collagen-based bioink and prospect the future research directions.}

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, called COVID-19, in Colombia as well as in a great part of the world, has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern, affecting different aspects of the daily life, being one of the most important the access and distribution of necessary medicine, not only for the known deceases but also for the mitigation of COVID 19.
Objective
the distribution of medicines should maintain stability in the supply chain of essential medicines, thus ensuring high quality medicines that could help in the treatment to fight the virus.
Methodology
through this work a detailed analysis of the variable and critical points in the supply chain of essential medicines to mitigate COVID-19 is developed.
Results
A new architecture based on the Blockchain Hyperledger is presented. It will help to solve those critical points found, through the secure trace of the medicine supply chain. In Colombia, by using this architecture all actors take responsibilities in the distribution chain, ensuring a high level of transparency in the distribution process.
Discussion
by verifying the proper functioning of the model, the main difficulty when using Hyperledger is the lack of suppliers with experience; besides, there are not enough standardization or regulations of Blockchain.
Conclusion
It is proved that Blockchain is an optimal technology to ensure essential medicine supply chain for the COVID 19 treatment in Colombia.}

To assess the current racial demographics of the pain medicine pipeline, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of medical school matriculants and graduates, residents, and pain fellows in 2018. Our results show that the 2018 anesthesiology residency ERAS applicant pool consisted of 46.2% non-Hispanic White, 7.0% non-Hispanic Black and 5.8% Hispanic students. The population of 2018 anesthesiology residents included 63% non-Hispanic White, 6.8% non-Hispanic Black and 5.4% Hispanic persons. Of the total eligible resident pool for pain fellowships (n = 30,415) drawn from core specialties, 44% were non-Hispanic White, 4.9% non-Hispanic Black and 5.1% Hispanic. Similar proportions were observed for pain medicine and regional anesthesia fellows. We briefly discuss the implications of the shortage of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic representation in pain medicine as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest approaches to improving these disparities.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Purpose
Tripterygium glycosides (TG) are widely used for the treatment of kidney disease in China. However, the application of TG in clinical practice is limited, as the therapeutic window is narrow, and the therapeutic dose is close to the toxic dose. In addition, the therapeutic effect of TG combined with Western medicine has not been fully elucidated. This study sought to explore standardized treatment, efficacy, and safety of TG combined with Western medicine for patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease (T2DKD).
Methods
The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature, Chinese Scientific Journal, and Wan Fang databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of TG combined with Western medicine on T2DKD from their inception until May 4, 2021. A random effects model was used to explore heterogeneity of studies.
Findings
A total of 33 studies with 2034 patients were included in the current meta-analysis. The findings showed that TG combined with Western medicine effectively reduced urinary albumin excretion rates (standardized mean difference, –2.55; 95% CI, –4.70 to –0.40; P = 0.02), 24-hour urinary protein level (mean difference, –0.79; 95% CI, –1.22 to –0.36; P = 0.0003), and serum creatinine level (mean difference, –8.23; 95% CI, –14.48 to –1.99; P = 0.01) and increased albumin level (mean difference, 4.70; 95% CI, 3.27 to 6.13; P < 0.00001) in patients with T2DKD. No serious adverse reactions occurred, and the incidence of adverse events in the TG combined with Western medicine treatment group was slightly higher than in the control group (8.14% vs 2.65%). The results were stable, and a significant publication bias was not detected (P > 0.05).
Implications
Based on our results, TG combined with Western medicine may be an effective and safe therapy for T2DKD; the best treatment duration may be 3 to 6 months. Nevertheless, larger, longer multicenter studies should be conducted for clinical application of the regimen to patients in more countries and regions. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021259466.}

Health care inequity is corrected more readily when safe, high-quality care is provided by physicians who reflect the gender, race, and ethnicity of patient communities. It is important to train and evaluate racially diverse physicians involved in residency training.
Objective
This study sought to determine any test-taking differences for black Emergency Medicine (EM) residents and whether any such differences would narrow as residency progressed.
Methods
This was an observational, cross-sectional study that reviewed performance (scaled scores) on the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) In-Training Examination (ITE) for 2018, 2019, and 2020. The study included EM residents in 3-year programs who took the ITE. A linear regression model was used for the variables of race, which included black physicians and white physicians (reference group), and level of training (EM resident year 1 [EM1] as the reference group).
Results
There were 9591 residents included; 539 were black and 9052 were white. Mean scaled scores were higher as a function of training level. Regression showed a scaled score intercept of 73.51. The ITE score increased for all groups as a function of training level (EM2 β = +5.45, p < 0.0001; EM3 β = +8.09, p < 0.0001). The regression coefficient for black residents was −5.87 (p < 0.0001). There was relative improvement by training level compared with improvement in the reference group, but this difference was not materially or statistically significant.
Conclusion
In this study of the ABEM ITE, a test-taking performance gap identified early in residency for black physicians persisted into late residency.}

abstract = {Background and aim
Novel nature of the viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2 and the absence of standard drugs for treatment, have been a major challenge to combat this deadly infection. Natural products offer safe and effective remedy, for which traditional ethnic medicine can provide leads. An indigenous poly-herbal formulation, Kabasura Kudineer from Siddha system of medicine was evaluated here using a combination of computational approaches, to identify potential inhibitors against two anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets – post-fusion Spike protein (structural protein) and main protease (Mpro, non-structural protein).
Experimental procedure
We docked 32 phytochemicals from the poly-herbal formulation against viral post-fusion Spike glycoprotein and Mpro followed by molecular dynamics using Schrodinger software. Drug-likeness analysis was performed using machine learning (ML) approach and pkCSM.
Results
The binding affinity of the phytochemicals in Kabasura Kudineer revealed the following top-five bioactives: Quercetin > Luteolin > Chrysoeriol > 5-Hydroxy-7,8-Dimethoxyflavone > Scutellarein against Mpro target, and Gallic acid > Piperlonguminine > Chrysoeriol > Elemol > Piperine against post-fusion Spike protein target. Quercetin and Gallic acid exhibited binding stability in complexation with their respective viral-targets and favourable free energy change as revealed by the molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA analysis. In silico predicted pharmacokinetic profiling of these ligands revealed appropriate drug-likeness properties.
Conclusion
These outcomes provide: (a) potential mechanism for the anti-viral efficacy of the indigenous Siddha formulation, targeting Mpro and post-fusion Spike protein (b) top bioactive lead-molecules that may be developed as natural product-based anti-viral pharmacotherapy and their pleiotropic protective effects may be leveraged to manage co-morbidities associated with COVID-19.}

This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) provides an overview of cancer and increased body fat.
Methods
The scientific information for this CPS is based upon published scientific citations, clinical perspectives of OMA authors, and peer review by the Obesity Medicine Association leadership.
Results
Topics include the increased risk of cancers among patients with obesity, cancer risk factor population-attributable fractions, genetic and epigenetic links between obesity and cancer, adiposopathic and mechanistic processes accounting for increased cancer risk among patients with obesity, the role of oxidative stress, and obesity-related cancers based upon Mendelian randomization and observational studies. Other topics include nutritional and physical activity principles for patients with obesity who either have cancer or are at risk for cancer, and preventive care as it relates to cancer and obesity.
Conclusions
Obesity is the second most common preventable cause of cancer and may be the most common preventable cause of cancer among nonsmokers. This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) on cancer is one of a series of OMA CPSs designed to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of obesity. Patients with obesity are at greater risk of developing certain types of cancers, and treatment of obesity may influence the risk, onset, progression, and recurrence of cancer in patients with obesity.}

The development and clinical use of PARP inhibitors has transformed lives for many patients with BRCA germline deficient breast and ovarian cancer as well as platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancers. However, lessons learnt from the clinical use of PARP inhibitors also confirm that not all patients respond either due to intrinsic or acquired resistance. Therefore, the search for additional synthetic lethality approaches is an active area of translational and clinical research. Here, we review the current clinical state of PARP inhibitors and other evolving DNA repair targets including ATM, ATR, WEE1 inhibitors and others in cancer.}

It is found that the hypoglycemic compounds in mulberry are mainly flavonoids, polysaccharides, alkaloids, stilbenes, and Diels-Alder compounds.Their mechanisms of action are mainly related to the regulation of lipid profiles and glucose metabolism, protection of pancreatic β-cells, promotion of insulin secretion, antioxidation, inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and α-glycosidase activities. In addition, mulberry treatment could change intestinal microbiota of mice, which are associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. This review provides reference for further research and development of different medicinal parts of mulberry for the treatment of DM.}

The assessment information is categorized into two groups: precise and interval numbers that can be obtained from the official sites, and precise information obtained through expert surveys and questionnaires. A three-step group decision-making mechanism is proposed for the CHM problem. First, an analytical method based on interval evidence reasoning is formed to unify different forms of information into the same interval belief structure. Next, a model based on the geometric area method is formed to obtain the weights of the attributes. Third, the extended interval regret theory is used to rank the alternative solutions. Applying perceived utility value and the ranking of the alternatives, an optimal solution for planting CHM is found. Comparative and sensitivity analyses highlight the flexibility and reliability of the suggested solution. By evaluating the various parameters, decision-makers in CHM can prioritize their decisions for maximal benefit.}

Conservative kidney management is a nondialytic treatment option for advanced chronic kidney disease that involves interventions to delay kidney function loss, medications to treat symptoms, and psychosocial support for patients and their loved ones. Several geriatric medicine principles are applicable to patients who are considering or receiving conservative kidney management, including the integration of physical, psychological, and social factors into medical care and medical decisions; careful review of medication lists with selective deprescribing; and screening for geriatric syndromes such as frailty and functional impairment. In this review, we discuss how functional and frailty assessments as well as selective deprescribing can be useful for patients considering or receiving conservative kidney management.}

Radioisotopes are used extensively in nuclear medicine. Analysis of occupational doses received by medical radiation workers, especially nuclear medicine staff dealing with radioisotopes, contributes significantlyto enhancing safe practice and promoting radiation protection measures in the radiology department. The current study aimed to determine the time trend and the differences in occupational radiation dose among nuclear medicine workers.
Methods
Readings of 394 OSL dosimeters were obtained from 31 medical workers and grouped into five worker groups (technologist, physician, nurse, radio-pharmacist, and radio-physicist).
Results
The average number of workers dropped to 4.5 in 2020 and 2021 compared to 14.4 in 2014 to 2019. The average annual effective dose and skin dose for all workers based on measurements for a typical yearly workload of 5000 patients were 1.21 (±1.15) mSv and 2.86 (±1.32) mSv, respectively. The highest average annual effective and skin dose was 5.41 and 5.82 mSv, respectively. The NM technologist working in PET/CT received higher mean and maximum effective and skin doses than the other worker groups.
Conclusion
The annual effective and skin doses were below the national legislation and international standards. However, improvements in radiation protection practices could be implemented to reduce occupational radiation dose to NM technologists, the most exposed worker group in this study.}

Besides the curated data collected from multiple resources, a series of bioinformatics tools for network pharmacology analysis were also embedded in INPUT, which makes it become the first automatic platform able to explore the disease treatment mechanisms of TCM. With the built-in tools, researchers can also analyze their own in-house data and obtain the results of pivotal ingredients, GO and KEGG pathway, protein-protein interactions, etc. In addition, as a proof-of-principle, INPUT was applied to decipher the antidepressant mechanism of a commonly used prescription. In summary, INPUT is a powerful platform for network pharmacology analysis and will facilitate the researches on drug discovery.}

KRAS mutation is the most common molecular alteration in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and around 10% of patients harbor KRAS wild-type tumors (KRASWT).
Methods
A retrospective chart review of clinical/molecular data was performed including all PDAC patients with a determined KRAS status (tumor molecular profiling on tissue or liquid biopsy).
Results
342 patients were included with 54 KRASWT PDAC (16%) compared to 288 patients with KRASm PDAC. Median age was 61 years [IQR:54.0;67.0] and 164 pts (48%) were female. At diagnosis, KRASWT patients (63%) were more frequently diagnosed at a non-metastatic stage compared to KRASm patients (41%) (p = 0.003). Regarding metastatic sites, liver was less frequent in KRASWT (39%, p < 0.0001). Median overall survival (mOS) from initial diagnosis was significantly higher in the KRASWT group compared to KRASm (50.8 months, CI95% [32.0-NR] vs 21.1 months, CI95% [18.9–23.4] (p < 0.004 after adjustment on age, ECOG and stage at diagnosis). In first-line systemic treatment, (mostly FOLFIRINOX) progression-free survival (PFS) was also higher in KRASWT. Based on ESCAT classification, a putative actionable alteration (ESCAT I-III) was identified in 19 (36%) KRASWT pts and 46 (16%) KRASm patients (p < 0.0001) with more alterations in FGFR2, BRAF(V600E), NRTK and more MSI tumors. KRASWT harbored also fewer alterations in TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. 12 KRASWT patients received a molecularly-matched treatment with clinical benefit and improved outcomes compared to KRASm patients.
Conclusions
KRASWT patients display distinct disease characteristics and outcomes with prolonged overall survival. KRASWT patients also harbor more actionable molecular alterations, leading to higher survival rates after receiving molecularly matched treatments.}

Objective. To assess the impact of a pilot advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) on fourth-year (P4) Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students’ knowledge and confidence related to substance use disorder, harm reduction, and co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Methods. Beginning in 2020, a 62-item assessment was developed and administered to P4 students at the beginning and end of the six-week APPE. The assessment tested knowledge in 10 content areas related to substance use disorder, harm reduction, and co-occurring disorders. Students also ranked their confidence in providing care related to each content area. The post-assessment included a free-text (open-ended) item to provide feedback on the APPE experience. Descriptive statistics and paired t tests were used to analyze the data. Results. Complete pre- and post-assessments were obtained from all participating students (N=7). The mean cumulative knowledge score increased from 55.2% to 81.5%, and the mean cumulative confidence score improved from 34.2% to 81.8%. Free-text responses garnered positive feedback from students, who indicated that the APPE allowed them to immerse themselves in all stages of the recovery process, gain confidence in presentation skills with patients, and solidify their passion for addiction medicine. Conclusion. A novel APPE in addiction medicine addressed a current gap in pharmacy education, earned positive evaluations from student pharmacists, increased student knowledge and confidence related to substance use disorder, harm reduction, and co-occurring disorders, and supported the development of new interprofessional collaborations. United States colleges of pharmacy that do not yet offer APPEs in this clinical domain should consider this model.}

The bioelectric circuits produce an endogenous electric field and a resting voltage when the cells are functioning and communicating. Oncology research has gained considerable interest focused on the development of emerging bioelectric cancer medicines. Reprogrammable circuits that underlie cancer, regeneration, and embryogenesis are known as bioelectric signalling. It is possible to create new therapeutic options to slow the spread of cancer by taking advantage of the bioelectric properties of cancer cells. The treatment of cancer may benefit from bioelectronic medicine. We looked into the value of bioelectrical energy in the fight against disease. This communication also covered the methods for therapeutically controlling this fatal illness. It is crucial to identify or measure the electrical activity of body cells in order to control or modify bioelectricity and bring about changes in cell structure. Knowledge of the cell-to-cell ionic interaction, faradaic processes, and their function in developing cancer phenotypes may improve cancer treatment approaches. With new evidence supporting an electrical mechanism that promotes this phenomenon, the data may also help us understand cancer metastasis better.}

abstract = {Objective
Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to become increasingly integrated with clinical medicine. Generative AI, and particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, have shown promise in generating human-like text, providing a potential tool for augmenting clinical care. These online AI chatbots have already demonstrated remarkable clinical potential, having passed the US Medical Licensing Exam, for example. The evaluation of these LLMs in the surgical literature, especially as it applies to judgement and decision-making, is sparse. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the efficacy of ChatGPT-4 in providing clinician-level vascular surgery recommendations and (2) compare its performance with its predecessor, ChatGPT-3.5, to gauge the progression of clinical competencies of LLMs.
Methods
A set of 40 clinician-level questions spanning 4 domains of vascular surgery (carotid artery disease, visceral artery aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms, chronic limb-threatening ischemia) were generated by clinical experts. These domains were chosen based on the availability of updated guidelines published before September 2021, which served as the cutoff date for the training dataset of the LLMs. The questions, devoid of additional context or prompts, were input into ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 between March 20 and March 25, 2023. Responses were independently evaluated by two blinded reviewers using a 5-point Likert scale assessing comprehensiveness, accuracy, and consistency with guidelines. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level of each response was also determined. Independent samples t test and Fisher's exact test were used for comparative analysis.
Results
ChatGPT-4 significantly outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 by providing appropriate recommendations in 38 of 40 questions (95%) as compared with 13 of 40 (32.5%) by ChatGPT-3.5 (Fisher's exact test P < .001). Despite longer response lengths (chatGPT-4 mean 317 ± 58 words vs chatGPT-3.5 mean 265 ± 74 words; P < .001), the reading ease of both models remained similar, corresponding with college-level graduate texts.
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 can consistently respond accurately to complex clinician-level vascular surgery questions. This also represents a substantial advancement in performance compared with its predecessor, which was released only a few months prior, highlighting the progress of performance of LLMs in clinical medicine. Several limitations persist with the use of LLMs, including hallucinations, data privacy issues, and the black box problem, However, these findings suggest that, with further refinements, LLMs like ChatGPT-4 have the potential to become indispensable tools in clinical decision-making, thereby marking an exciting frontier in the fusion of AI with clinical medicine and vascular surgery.}

The physician should choose between providing the optimal treatment or an inferior one, which can amount to practicing defensive medicine. The patient should choose whether to litigate or not, if an adverse event occurs. When both agents have no dominant strategy, we obtain four scenarios representing the positive and negative forms of defensive medicine, with or without physician's moral hazard. We find that certain legal parameters can have opposite effects on the probabilities that physicians practice defensive medicine and that patients litigate, depending respectively on the form of defensive medicine and on the presence of moral hazard. This result can explain the ambiguous results, reported in empirical literature, of legal reforms aimed at discouraging defensive medicine and medical malpractice litigation.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aims to examine the structure of communication about complementary medicine (CM) between patients with cancer and clinicians during oncology consultations.
Methods
Previously, consultations between 29 clinicians and 80 patients with advanced cancer were recorded in six hospitals in the Netherlands. The present study considers a secondary analysis. References to CM during the consultation were coded using a self-developed observational coding scheme.
Results
At least one reference to CM was observed in 35 out of 80 consultations (44 %), with a total of 73 references. In most cases, CM was initially referred to by patients. Clinicians often did not elaborate on the subject of CM. Relevant aspects related to CM (e.g., safety, effectiveness) were infrequently discussed. Both patients and clinicians showed predominantly neutral to positive attitudes towards CM.
Conclusions
This study shows that patients are still the main initiators of discussions about CM and the topic is not consistently discussed in daily oncology practice.
Practice implications
If exploration of patients’ interest in CM or its use became routine in oncology practice, it may relieve patients of the burden of introducing the topic, decrease potential risks of CM use and increase access to evidence-based CM for all patients with cancer.}

Urologists have been remarkably active in this field of medicine called Regenerative Medicine. The searching of the different requirements like suitable and compatible biomaterials, versatile cells, adequate techniques to construct tissues, available biomolecules, and the knowledge of all these minimizing risks, are some of the aims and the approximations until now. Despite many obstacles, in vitro and in vivo studies are already showing encouraging options. We will review the advances related to the bladder, urethra, ureter, and kidneys. Difficulties such as ethical issues, time investment and high costs, have been some of the drawbacks encountered. Further studies are still required for its clinical application in daily life.

Este proceso conlleva la colaboración por parte de otras ciencias como la ingeniería de materiales, la medicina molecular, la biotecnología y la impresión tridimensional. En la denominada medicina-regenerativa, los urólogos han desempeñado un papel especialmente activo. La búsqueda de los diferentes factores requeridos, como biomateriales adecuados y compatibles, células versátiles, técnicas adecuadas para construir tejidos, biomoléculas disponibles, y el conocimiento de todo ello minimizando los riesgos, son algunos de los objetivos y aproximaciones actuales.

Mutation accumulation in stem cells has been associated with cancer risk. However, the presence of numerous mutant clones in healthy tissues has raised the question of what limits cancer initiation. Here, we review recent developments in characterizing mutation accumulation in healthy tissues and compare mutation rates in stem cells during development and adult life with corresponding cancer risk. A certain level of mutagenesis within the stem cell pool might be beneficial to limit the size of malignant clones through competition. This knowledge impacts our understanding of carcinogenesis with potential consequences for the use of stem cells in regenerative medicine.}

Respectively in Africa and Latin America, the volume of nuclear medicine procedures decreased by 69% and 79% in June 2020 and 44% and 67% in October 2020. Among the nuclear medicine procedures, oncological PET studies showed less of a decline in utilization compared to conventional nuclear medicine studies. A gradual trend towards a return to the pre-COVID-19 status of the supply chains of radioisotopes, generators, and other essential materials was evident. Overall, in 2020, the pandemic-related challenges resulted in significant decrease in nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in Africa and Latin America. The impact was more pronounced in Latin America than in Africa. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses many challenges for the practice of nuclear medicine. If adequately prepared, departments can continue to deliver their essential services, while mitigating the risk for patients and staff. This requires adapting the SOPs, as quickly as possible, to meet the new requirements.}

Patients commonly undergo evaluation by internists prior to surgery. However, the impact of preoperative internal medicine evaluations on the postoperative outcomes of patients with cancer is uncertain.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who had been included in the National Surgery Quality Improvement Program from 2011 to 2014 from a single hospital specializing in cancer care to determine the effect of an Internal Medicine Perioperative Assessment Center (IMPAC) evaluation (IMPAC group) on the risk of 30-day mortality compared to that of patients who proceeded directly to surgery (control group).
Results
Of the 11,577 participants, 3,589 underwent an IMPAC evaluation. The absolute 30-day mortality was 0.47% for the IMPAC group and 0.50% for the control group. After propensity matching, the odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality was 0.39 (95% CI=0.18–0.84) for the IMPAC group in comparison to the control group.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that a preoperative internal medicine evaluation was associated with lower 30-day mortality. Additional studies are needed to identify which patient populations are most likely to benefit and which attributes of the internal medicine evaluation are most beneficial.}

Daily physiological rhythms of eating and fasting, sleeping and waking, moving and resting, are common to almost all life forms which evolved under the solar light–dark cycle. Despite their ubiquity, historians of health and medicine have yet to grapple with the lived experiences of these daily rhythms in the past. This paper presents a potential new research agenda in ‘rhythmic history’ that understands rhythmicity as something which lies between biology and culture. Thinking with rhythms offers exciting opportunities to unite previously disparate historical studies of daily rhythms like eating and sleeping and opens up a new way to view the enmeshed connections between body and environment. In this paper, I take inspiration from the scientific concept of the ‘zeitgeber’ (‘time giver’), coined by the German chronobiologist Jürgen Aschoff, to frame a review of current literature relating to rhythms and explore Henry Lefebvre’s notion of ‘rhythmanalysis’ as a methodological tool for historians undertaking ‘rhythmic histories’.}

abstract = {Objective
The study aimed to reveal the approaches to coping with stress of women with breast cancer and the factors predicting these approaches, to determine the prevalence and characteristics of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), and to examine the relationship between use of CAM and approaches to coping with stress.
Methods
A descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted among 328 women with breast cancer at a training and research hospital in Türkiye. Data were collected with the “Descriptive Information Form” and the “Stress Coping Styles Scale (SCSS)”.
Results
Women's SCSS score was 47.26±6.39 (effective) and 37.76±6.33 (ineffective). The SCSS score were not significantly different between CAM users and non-CAM users (p>0.05). The prevalence of CAM use was 36%, the most common types of CAM were herbal products (55.1%) and prayer (33.8%) and the reasons for using CAM were for relaxation (symptomatic) (43.2%). As a result of multivariate logistic regression analysis, level of income, working, number of living children, receiving chemotherapy, receiving surgery, having a family history of cancer, and the interest of their partner after the disease were associated with effective coping with stress (p<0.05, adjusted R2=0.08, 0.05, and 0.33 respectively). Working, receiving chemotherapy, receiving surgery, stage of cancer, and having a history of cancer in a social environment were associated with ineffective coping with stress (p<0.05, adjusted R2=0.14 and 0.11 respectively).
Conclusions
One-third of women were using CAM and had a good level of approaches to coping with stress. Healthcare providers, especially gynecology-oncology nurses, should provide counseling on CAMs and develop strategies for coping with stress for women with breast cancer.
Resumen
Objetivo
El estudio tenía como objetivo revelar los enfoques de afrontamiento del estrés de las mujeres con cáncer de mama y los factores que predicen estos enfoques, determinar la prevalencia y las características de la Medicina Complementaria y Alternativa (MCA), y examinar la relación entre el uso de la MCA y los enfoques de afrontamiento del estrés.
Método
Se realizó un estudio descriptivo y transversal entre 328 mujeres con cáncer de mama en un hospital de formación e investigación de Türkiye. Los datos fueron recolectados con el “Formulario de Información Descriptiva” y la “Escala de Estilos de Afrontamiento del Estrés (SCSS)”.
Resultados
La puntuación SCSS de las mujeres fue 47,26±6,39 (eficaz) y 37,76±6,33 (ineficaz). La puntuación SCSS no fue significativamente diferente entre usuarios de CAM y no usuarios de CAM (p > 0,05). La prevalencia de uso de la CAM fue del 36%, los tipos más comunes de CAM fueron los productos a base de hierbas (55,1%) y la oración (33,8%). y las razones para el uso de CAM fueron para la relajación (sintomática) (43,2%). Como resultado del análisis de regresión logística multivariante, el nivel de ingresos, el trabajo, el número de hijos vivos, recibir quimioterapia, recibir cirugía, tener antecedentes familiares de cáncer y el interés de su pareja tras la enfermedad se asociaron con un afrontamiento eficaz del estrés (p<0,05, R2 ajustado=0,08, 0,05 y 0,33 respectivamente). Trabajar, recibir quimioterapia, recibir cirugía, el estadio del cáncer y tener antecedentes de cáncer en el entorno social se asociaron con un afrontamiento ineficaz del estrés (p<0,05, R2 ajustado=0,14 y 0,11 respectivamente).
Conclusiónes
Un tercio de las mujeres utilizaban MCA y tenían un buen nivel de enfoque para afrontar el estrés. Los proveedores de atención médica, especialmente las enfermeras de ginecología y oncología, deben brindar asesoramiento sobre las MCA y desarrollar estrategias para afrontar el estrés en mujeres con cáncer de mama.}

abstract = {Introduction
This paper examines pain, illness and medicine metaphors as used in consultations between chronic pain patients and anaesthesiologists, physiotherapists and psychologists in a Belgian pain clinic. As metaphors frame and highlight aspects of understanding and experiences of life events, including illness, they can provide insight in how health professionals and patients construct illness, pain and medicine in interaction.
Materials and method
16 intake consultations (collected in Belgium in April–May 2019) between 6 patients and 4 health professionals were qualitatively coded twice ATLAS. TI by a team of 3 coders, using an adjusted form of the Metaphor Identification Procedure. Each metaphor was labelled for source domain, target domain and speaker.
Results
A number of metaphors that have been previously documented in past research were frequent in our data too, such as journey and machine metaphors, although sometimes also used differently, like war metaphors. Our data set also contained many few-used and sometimes more novel metaphors, such as ILLNESS IS A YO-YO. Many metaphors highlight particular aspects of living with and talking about chronic pain, such as its duration and persistent presence, a lack of agency and feelings of powerlessness, and a dualistic perspective on body and mind.
Discussion and conclusion
The metaphors used by health professionals and patients give insight in the lived experience of having and treating chronic pain. In this way, they can contribute to our understanding of patients’ experiences and challenges, how they recur in clinical communication, and how they are related to wider discourses on health, illness and pain.}

abstract = {Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate the use and effectiveness of non-pharmacological therapies as part of the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications, either combined or not with the usual treatment.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted between August and October 2021 using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science databases. From a total of 204 articles identified, 33 were included in the final sample (15 clinical trials and 18 quasi-experimental studies). The methodological evaluation was carried out using STROBE and CONSORT guidelines.
Results
There is a growing literature on the use of CAM for COVID-19. Most studies have shown positive findings, particularly for the use of TCM, other herbal therapies and acupuncture. Nevertheless, most studies were carried out in Asia and relied on quasi-experimental designs. The current evidence is available for physical outcomes (mortality rate, pneumonia resolution and other symptoms, negative PCR test, and hospitalization and ICU admissions) and for mental health outcomes.
Conclusion
Despite a positive role of CAM on COVID-19 outcomes, the evidence is still mostly based on quasi-experimental studies. More robust clinical trials are needed in order to generate better evidence in this area.}

abstract = {Background
Throughout the latest decades there has been a change in the paradigm of medical education, shifting from objective and knowledge- based curricula to competence-based curricula. In 2005, the concept of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA) was introduced to represent units of work that define a profession and are entrusted to a resident to complete unsupervised once she or he has obtained adequate competence. EPA have been described and implemented successfully in a number of countries and have been shown to contribute to greater trainee and trainer satisfaction. Doctor -patient communication is paramount in Family Medicine consultations and specific communication tasks can be defined as recognizable professional activities that can be performed and assessed in daily clinical activity. The purpose of this work is to define EPAs in doctor – patient communication in Family Medicine residency training, including underlying competences and assessment, by expert consensus and implement EPAs in a sample of residents also undergoing traditional evaluation methods.
Methods
two studies will be conducted: 1) a Delphi study including experts in Family Medicine and Communication Skills training to reach consensus about EPAs for Family Medicine focusing on clinical communication including three stages: identification of communication related tasks in Family Medicine from literature that could be treated as EPAs, content validation by experts and consecutive rounds of modified Delphi using predefined consensus levels; 2) an intervention study, to evaluate the impact of competence based assessment on acquisition of competences, and resident satisfaction in a sample of Family Medicine residents also undergoing traditional assessment.
Findings
the hypothesis is that, similarly to published literature, assessment using a EPA model leads to less time for competence acquisition and higher trainee satisfaction.}

abstract = {Aim
This study aimed to explore and evaluate various components of the medical education process (lectures, labs, small-group discussions, clinical rotations, and undergraduate research) in three colleges of medicine in Jordan.
Methods
This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study included 849 undergraduate students from three main medical colleges in Jordan. Statically valid responses were considered for 684 students. The participants were from Jordan University of Science and Technology, Yarmouk University, and the University of Jordan.
Results
The distribution of students according to their admission status was 276 (40%) regular, 266 (38.9%) parallel, and 142 (20.8%) international programs. Personal interest and self-initiation were the major motives for studying medicine in 66.1%. Regarding the frequency of attending classes, University of Jordan students reported the highest rate of regular classes' attendance (93%). The study also reported that lecture notes and textbooks were the main sources of learning for medical students. The study also reported superior academic performance of students in the regular program compared to students in the parallel and international programs. Participants of the study criticized the medical curricula in the three colleges mentioned above because of the lack of active research programs. Most of the students (40%–56%) also complained that the lectures within the modules were not well-integrated, and they felt that the academic environment was moderate (48–59%). In addition, most students in the clinical phase complained of overcrowding in hospital wards during clinical rotation.
Conclusions
Based on students' feedback, multiple aspects of the medical education process require substantial reform to meet the expectations of medical students in Jordan.}

These estimates suggest that higher drug list prices increase the number of launches of new medicines; the estimates are larger in the short term than in the longer term.

Banhasasim-tang (BHSST), a traditional herbal medicines mixture, mainly used to treat GI-related diseases, may have a potential in IBS treatment. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain as the main clinical symptom, which seriously affects the quality of life. Aim of the study: We conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of BHSST and its mechanisms of action in treating IBS. Materials and methods: We evaluated the efficacy of BHSST in a zymosan-induced diarrhea-predominant animal model of IBS. Electrophysiological methods were used to confirm modulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) and voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) ion channels, which are associated mechanisms of action. Results: Oral administration of BHSST decreased colon length, increased stool scores, and increased colon weight. Weight loss was also minimized without affecting food intake. In mice administered with BHSST, the mucosal thickness was suppressed, making it similar to that of normal mice, and the degree of tumor necrosis factor-α was severely reduced. These effects were similar to those of the anti-inflammatory drug—sulfasalazine—and antidepressant—amitriptyline. Moreover, pain-related behaviors were substantially reduced. Additionally, BHSST inhibited TRPA1, NaV1.5, and NaV1.7 ion channels associated with IBS-mediated visceral hypersensitivity. Conclusions: In summary, the findings suggest that BHSST has potential beneficial effects on IBS and diarrhea through the modulation of ion channels.}

abstract = {Objective
Some pediatric residents report experiencing less autonomy when working clinically with pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) fellows than with attendings alone. We sought to explore pediatric senior resident (SR) experiences working clinically with PHM fellows, with a focus on characterizing fellow behaviors that could impact perceived resident autonomy.
Methods
In this qualitative study, we conducted virtual semistructured interviews with pediatric SRs. We recorded, deidentified, and transcribed interviews for codebook thematic analysis, making iterative adjustments to our codebook and themes until reaching thematic sufficiency.
Results
We conducted 17 interviews. A subanalysis identified key components of the resident mental model of autonomy, including independent clinical decision-making with 3 core qualifiers: 1) plan follow-through, 2) availability of a safety net, and 3) ownership. Our primary analysis identified 4 key themes (with a total of 7 contributory subthemes) describing resident experiences of autonomy, scaffolded based on an organizing framework adapted from Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model including 1) microsystem factors (based on direct resident-fellow or resident-leadership team interactions), 2) mesosystem factors (based on fellow-attending interactions), 3) exosystem factors (based on fellow-intrinsic characteristics), and 4) macrosystem factors (cultural values, norms, and policies governing academic pediatrics).
Conclusions
Many factors impact perceived resident autonomy on PHM fellow-inclusive teams. Although some are related to direct resident-fellow interactions, many others are more complex and may reflect resident interactions with the leadership team, attending-fellow dynamics, and the influence of cultural context. Based on our analysis, we propose several best-practice recommendations directed at fellows, attendings, the fellow-attending dyad, and Graduate Medical Education programs overall.}

Background
Compounded by the needs of an aging society, interactions between oral condition and systemic diseases may require that dentists pursue additional training in oral medicine beyond that received in dental school. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pursuing oral medicine professional education is recognised by dental practitioners as an important factor regarding job satisfaction.
Methods
A questionnaire was mailed to 1,379 dental practitioners in Japan, along with a follow-up survey to assess repeatability, in 2017. The questionnaire consisted of 19 items/questions related to the respondents’ attributes and job satisfaction (5 items), willingness to learn oral medicine (4 items), willingness to learn more about dentistry (4 items), and willingness to contribute to society (6 items). Representative questions were extracted via binomial logistic regression analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationships between job satisfaction and the explanatory variables.
Results
Amongst 337 respondents, multivariable logistic regression analysis showed an association between strong job satisfaction (n = 126, 37%) and willingness to learn more about oral medicine and dentistry and contribute to society, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 4.22 (1.84-9.68), 3.16 (1.16-8.62), and 7.32 (3.14-17.06) and κ values of 0.38, 0.58, and 0.51, respectively.
Conclusions
Our results from dental practitioners suggest additional benefits of oral medicine professional education for future job satisfaction.}

abstract = {Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading disease that has caused an extensive burden to the world. Consequently, a large number of clinical trials have examined the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating and preventing COVID-19, with coinciding proliferation of reviews summarizing these studies.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the methodological quality and evidence quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy of TCM.
Search strategy
Seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP, Wanfang Data and SinoMed, were searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in October 2021. Search terms such as “Chinese medicine,” “Lianhua Qingwen” and “COVID-19” were used.
Inclusion criteria
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of TCM treatment of COVID-19 were included.
Data extraction and analysis
A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews Version 2.0 (AMSTAR 2) was used to evaluate the methodological quality. The quality of evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Data extraction and analysis were performed by two reviewers independently.
Results
There were 17 meta-analyses included in our overview. The intervention group was defined as TCM combined with Western medicine, while the control group was Western medicine alone. The methodological quality of all the included studies was moderate to poor. A total of 89 outcome indicators were evaluated, of which, 8 were rated as moderate quality, 39 as low quality, and 41 as very low quality. Only one outcome measure was graded as being of high quality. The moderate quality of evidence indicated that, for the treatment of COVID-19, the clinical efficacy of TCM in combination with Western medicine was better, in terms of lung recovery, rate of conversion to severe/critical cases, symptom scores, duration of symptoms, mortality, and length of hospital stay.
Conclusion
Evidence from the included studies shows that, compared with conventional Western medical therapy alone, the addition of TCM to COVID-19 treatment may improve clinical outcomes. Overall, the quality of evidence of TCM for COVID-19 was moderate to poor. Meta-analyses of the use of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 can be used for clinical decision making by accounting for the experiences of clinical experts, medical policies, and other factors.}

The influx of blood into the brain tissue after cerebrovascular rupture causes severe brain damage, including primary injury caused by persistent hemorrhage and secondary brain injury (SBI) induced by hematoma. The mechanism of brain injury is complicated and is a significant cause of disability after ICH. Therefore, it is essential to understand the mechanism of brain injury after ICH to develop drugs to prevent and treat ICH. Studies have confirmed that many traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) can reduce brain injury by improving neurotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress (OS), blood-brain barrier (BBB), apoptosis, and neurological dysfunction after ICH. Starting from the pathophysiological process of brain injury after ICH, this paper summarizes the mechanisms by which TCM improves cerebral injury after ICH and its comparison with conventional western medicine, so as to provide clues and a reference for the clinical application of TCM in the prevention and treatment of hemorrhagic stroke and further research and development of new drugs.}

abstract = {Purpose
To compare the surgical case volume for orthopaedic sports medicine fellows in the most recent classes with one another and in years preceding the pandemic.
Methods
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case log reports of key procedures for orthopaedic sports medicine fellows during academic years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 were extracted. Comparisons between these years in adult, pediatric, and total case volumes were performed using a 2-sample t-test to detect significant changes in the average number of key procedures completed between consecutive years.
Results
There was a significant decrease in the total number of cases completed by fellows during the 2020 academic year (P = .043) compared with 2019, immediately followed by a significant increase in case volume in 2021 (P < .001) (2019, 339 ± 123; 2020, 316.2 ± 108; 2021, 356.5 ± 117). There was a significant increase in adult case volume from 2020 to 2021 (2020, 295.7 ± 106; 2021, 332.9 ± 117; P < .001), whereas no trends were noted in pediatric case volume. Between the prepandemic year of 2019 and the first year of the pandemic, significant decreases were noted in case volume for several procedures, including multiligamentous knee injuries, knee instability and pediatric hip arthroscopy. From the first to the second years of the pandemic (2019-2020 to 2020-2021), significant increases were observed in case volume for rotator cuff, acromioclavicular instability, elbow instability, knee cartilage, and meniscal surgeries.
Conclusions
Orthopaedic sports medicine fellows experienced significant decreases in volume for several key case categories between the year preceding the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the first academic year during the pandemic. There were subsequent increases in cases between the first year of the pandemic and the second year, which may be associated with resuming elective surgical cases.

Critical Race Theory is a specific pedagogical and theoretical approach to understand how racialized historical contexts influence contemporary society. Clarifying and positioning CRT in a manner within which to understand health inequities experienced by racialized groups in the United States is paramount for the field of academic medicine and medical practice. A critical examination of the historical and contemporary issues of race and racism in America provides the necessary context within which to understand the long-standing and persistent existence of health disparities experienced among racial/ethnic populations in the United States. Ignoring historical and contemporary political and social influences of race and racism on health will only hinder the country's ability to narrow expanding gaps in racial/ethnic health disparities. Academic medicine has a professional and ethical responsibility to educate its trainees and health professionals on the history of medicine – including its ugly side – and to critically examine how historical and contemporary political and social factors have created racial/ethnic health disparities. Until such reckoning occurs the field of medicine's ability to achieve health equity for all will continue to be futile.}

The results indicated the wide variations of detected metals in the medicinal herbs. Mn and Sr had the highest concentrations in the herbal medicine and their infusions. Also, Cd levels of five dried plants exceeded the recommended values. Base on the findings of discriminant analysis, the dried Cheeseweed, Hollyhocks, Thymus, Pennyroyal, and Bugloss had the lowest metal levels. Furthermore, Cd in Senna and Marjoram infusions was displayed a carcinogenic risk for children. Considering that some of the studied plants were imported, a high level of Cd in medicinal plants and their products could pose a serious risk to human health worldwide. On the other hand, due to the poor extractability of analyzed metals (transfer rate < 30%), their levels in herbal infusions and their hazard indices were lower than international guidelines for adults. Hence, although preparing water-based extract may be an effective way to reduce the intake of toxic metals from herbal medicines, the presence of toxic metals in infusions may pose a risk to vulnerable groups, such as children.}

The population of Burkina Faso, a West-African country, relies heavily on traditional medicines for health care. However, data on the prevalence of use and occurrence of adverse events, as well as the factors associated with them, are lacking. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of use and occurrence of adverse events associated with traditional medicines in Burkina Faso.
Methods
This was a population-based cross-sectional study conducted from October 1 to November 30, 2020, in four randomly selected health districts: Nongr-Massom (Centre region), Tenkodogo (Centre-East region), Diapaga (East region) and Dafra (Hauts-Bassins region). An anonymous questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, data on the use of traditional medicines and on the occurrence of adverse events. The Chi-square (χ2) test was used to assess associated factors.
Results
The prevalence of use of traditional medicines in the 12 months preceding the survey was 85%. It was associated with health region (p < 0.001), occupation (p < 0.001) and area of residence (p = 0.046). The frequency of adverse events was 14.7%. Events mainly included gastrointestinal disorders (57.7%), nervous system disorders (15.2%) and skin disorders (7%). The report of adverse events was associated with duration of treatment (p < 0.001), gender (p = 0.033) and monthly income (p = 0.043).
Conclusion
Burkina Faso's population is highly exposed to traditional medicines. It is therefore imperative to develop a system for monitoring the risks associated with this exposure.}

Reporting research is as important a part of a study as its design or analysis. Reporting guidelines (RGs) provide structured advice on how to report research studies clearly and adequately. This study aimed to review the development of RGs of Chinese medicine (CM) and to provide recommendations for improvement.
Methods
Through a systematic search of the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network and electronic databases up to January 1, 2022, we identified a total of 15 RGs of CM, and further summarized their characteristics and applications. In addition, we reviewed the development of international RGs and analyzed its impact for CM.
Results
Compared with the generic RGs, the reporting standards of CM have been rapidly developed over the last 10 years, of which 57% were issued in recent 3 years (2019–2021). Currently, the system of RGs of CM has been established, especially for clinical trials, including various CM interventions and covering the guidelines from trial registration, protocol, results publication to the evidence synthesis and clinical practice guideline. However, the application of RGs of CM is suboptimal.
Conclusion
It is necessary to take further measures to promote practical application, improve journals’ endorsement, and establish quality monitoring procedures for RGs of CM in the future.}

abstract = {Background
Triphala (TLP), as a Chinese Tibetan medicine composing of Emblica officinalis, Terminalia chebula and Terminalia bellirica (1.2:1.5:1), exhibited hepatoprotective, hypolipidemic and gut microbiota modulatory effects. Nonetheless, its roles in prevention of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the related mechanistic insights involving the interplay of gut microbiota and hepatic inflammation are not known.
Purpose
The present study seeks to determine if TLP would prevent HFD-induced NAFLD in vivo and its underlying mechanisms from the perspectives of gut microbiota, metabolites, and hepatic inflammation.
Methods
TLP was subjected to extraction and chemo-profiling, and in vivo evaluation in HFD-fed rats on hepatic lipid and inflammation, intestinal microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and permeability, and body weight and fat content profiles.
Results
The TLP was primarily constituted of gallic acid, corilagin and chebulagic acid. Orally administered HFD-fed rats with TLP were characterized by the growth of Ligilactobacillus and Akkermansia, and SCFAs (acetic/propionic/butyric acid) secretion which led to increased claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1 expression that reduced the mucosal permeability to migration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into blood and liver. Coupling with hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride lowering actions, the TLP mitigated both inflammatory (ALT, AST, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and pro-inflammatory (TLR4, MYD88 and NF-κB P65) activities of liver, and sequel to histopathological development of NAFLD in a dose-dependent fashion.
Conclusion
TLP is promisingly an effective therapy to prevent NAFLD through modulating gut microbiota, mucosal permeability and SCFAs secretion with liver fat and inflammatory responses.}

abstract = {Objectives
We aimed to examine the bias for statistical significance using published confidence intervals in sport and exercise medicine research.
Design
Observational study.
Methods
The abstracts of 48,390 articles, published in 18 sports and exercise medicine journals between 2002 and 2022, were searched using a validated text-mining algorithm that identified and extracted ratio confidence intervals (odds, hazard, and risk ratios). The algorithm identified 1744 abstracts that included ratio confidence intervals, from which 4484 intervals were extracted. After excluding ineligible intervals, the analysis used 3819 intervals, reported as 95 % confidence intervals, from 1599 articles. The cumulative distributions of lower and upper confidence limits were plotted to identify any abnormal patterns, particularly around a ratio of 1 (the null hypothesis). The distributions were compared to those from unbiased reference data, which was not subjected to p-hacking or publication bias. A bias for statistical significance was further investigated using a histogram plot of z-values calculated from the extracted 95 % confidence intervals.
Results
There was a marked change in the cumulative distribution of lower and upper bound intervals just over and just under a ratio of 1. The bias for statistical significance was also clear in a stark under-representation of z-values between −1.96 and +1.96, corresponding to p-values above 0.05.
Conclusions
There was an excess of published research with statistically significant results just below the standard significance threshold of 0.05, which is indicative of publication bias. Transparent research practices, including the use of registered reports, are needed to reduce the bias in published research.}
