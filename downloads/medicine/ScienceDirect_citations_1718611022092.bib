abstract = {Background
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global pandemic since it broke out, and integrated Chinese and Western medicine (ICWM) has played an important role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to analyze the published literature on ICWM for COVID-19 at home and abroad, and compare their differences on hotspots and research fronts.
Methods
Publications before Oct 31, 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science core database (WOS), PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform (Wanfang), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), CiteSpace and VOSviewer to summarize the basic characteristics of publications, countries, institutions, keywords, and citations.
Results
We included 580 English papers and 1727 Chinese papers in this study. The development trends in China and other countries are relatively asynchronous and show a smooth growth trend for the future. The most productive countries were China, India, and the United States, while the most productive domestic research institution was the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. The clustering analysis of high-frequency keywords showed that Chinese literature focused on clinical studies of ICWM for COVID-19, such as retrospective studies, clinical features, and traditional Chinese medicine syndrome analysis, while English literature focused on therapeutic mechanism studies and evidence-based medicine studies, such as systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and both of them paid attention to network pharmacological research and Qingfei Paidu Decoction. Sorting out the top 10 highly cited articles, Huang CL's article published in Lancet in 2020 was regarded as a cornerstone in the field.
Conclusion
The treatment of COVID-19 by ICWM has become a worldwide research hotspot. Although there are differences in the specific contents among countries, the development trend of research types to the mechanism of action, and the development trend of research contents to the recovery period treatment and the prevention of COVID-19 by ICWM are consistent.}

abstract = {Objective
We aimed to explore medicines regimens charted for older people living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs).
Design
Repeated cross-sectional study using routinely collected data sampled in a cross-sectional manner at 11 time points (day of admission, then at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days, and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post admission).
Setting and Participants
The cohort is set in 34 RACFs managed by a single Australasian provider. People aged ≥65 years admitted to permanent care between January 1, 2017, and October 1, 2021, with medicines charted on the date of admission.
Methods
Medicines charted were evaluated for potentially suboptimal prescribing including number of medicines, high-risk prescribing (eg, potentially inappropriate medicines, anticholinergic burden), and potential underprescribing.
Results
The 3802 residents in the final cohort had a mean age of 84.9 ± 7.2 years at admission. At least 1 example of suboptimal prescribing was identified in 3479 (92%) residents at admission increasing to 1410 (97%) at 24 months. The number of medicines charted for each resident increased over time from 6.0 ± 3.8 regular and 2.8 ± 2.7 as required medicines at admission to 8.9 ± 4.1 regular and 8.1 ± 3.7 as required medicines at 24 months. Anticholinergic drug burden increased from 1.6 ± 2.4 at admission to 3.0 ± 2.8 at 24 months. Half the residents (2173; 57%) used at least 1 potentially inappropriate medicine at admission, which rose to nearly three-quarters (1060; 73%) at 24 months admission.
Conclusion and Implications
The total number of medicines charted for older adults living in RACFs increases with length of stay, with charted as required medicines nearly tripling. Effective interventions to optimize medicines use in this vulnerable population are required.}

Data were extracted from the WHO Global Essential Medicines database and the WHO Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health 2018. Data were extracted for 194 countries. Only 132 of 194 countries (68.0%) had EML, and among the 132 countries only 27.3% had included AUD medicines in their EML. Only 36 countries had included any of the AUD medicines in their EML. Disulfiram was included by 23 countries, while Acamprosate and Naltrexone was included by only four and 19 countries, respectively. Among the countries, 36.1% were from upper-middle income countries and 16.65 from low-income countries. The inclusion of AUD medicines in national EML was neither associated with alcohol consumption parameters nor the alcohol consumption related policy parameters. Considering the high prevalence of AUD and its complications, there is an urgent need to focus on including AUD medicines in national EML for making AUD treatment available and accessible across the world.}

To investigate the preferences among university students in Gothenburg, Sweden for medicines that have a different environmental impact with respect to effect and explore to what extent having received information about pharmaceuticals’ potential harm to the environment is associated with the stated preferences.
Methods
A survey was conducted among students in different study programs at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. In all, 704 students received oral and written information about the study at the end of a lecture and were invited to take part (response rate: 83.5%). The questionnaire contained items about medicinal environmental information and 2 scenarios with fictious medicines as options for the treatment or symptom relief of minor ailments in humans.
Results
Overall, 53.3% of the students (pharmacy students: 57.8%) had received information about the environmental impact of medicines, and 79.6% (pharmacy students: 80.6%) reported that they had concerns about the consequences. Twenty percent (pharmacy students: 9.0%) named the university as an information source. The students were most satisfied overall with the least effective and most environmentally friendly medicines. Consistently, pharmacy students gave higher scores to the most environmentally harmful medicines, especially compared with medical and health care students. Pharmacy students, who, to the same extent as medical and health care students had received information about medicines’ environmental impact, were less likely to state environmentally friendly options with an inferior effect as their preferred choice.
Conclusion
Pharmacy students generally rated the medicines higher than other student groups, despite being aware of the harmful effects on the environment.}

abstract = {Background
Insomnia is highly prevalent in stroke patients; however, there is no ideal intervention. This systematic review examined the effect and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and acupuncture on sleep in adults with stroke.
Methods
Six databases were searched from inception to June 2023 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores. Risk of bias and evidence quality was assessed. A pairwise random-effect meta-analysis was performed.
Results
A total of 54 RCTs published in 55 articles were finally included in the systematic review, including 35 of CHM and 19 of acupuncture therapies. Compared with placebo/sham procedure, CHM and acupuncture were more effective in improving PSQI scores. The evidence of moderate quality suggested that CHM outperformed benzodiazepine drugs (BZDs) while it presented an effect similar to that of non-BZDs in improving sleep quality. CHM and acupuncture also provided additional benefits to the patients treated with pharmacological agents alone. However, the evidence specific to individual CHM prescriptions lay in various factors and methodological quality, and the evidence on the comparative effectiveness between acupuncture and other therapies was conflicting or limited.
Conclusions
Overall, CHM and acupuncture used alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy can safely improve sleep in stroke patients with insomnia. In the future, RCTs on outstanding CHM prescriptions and the comparative effective research between acupuncture and other therapies are needed.

Objective
Compare clinical outcomes between advanced practice clinician-based comanagement and usual orthopedic care.
Background
Comanagement of orthopedic surgery patients by internal medicine hospitalists is associated with improvements in clinical outcomes including complications, length of stay, and cost. Clinical outcomes of orthopedic comanagement performed solely by internal medicine advanced practice clinicians have not been reported.
Methods
Retrospective cohort study in patients 18 years or older, hospitalized for orthopedic joint or spine surgery between May 1, 2014, and January 1, 2022. Outcomes assessed were length of stay, ICU transfer, return to operating room, inhospital and 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, and total direct cost excluding surgical implants. Generalized boosted regression and propensity score weighting was used to compare clinical outcomes and healthcare cost between usual care and advanced practice clinician comanagement.
Results
Advanced practice clinician comanagement was associated with a 5% reduction in mean length of stay (RR=0.95, p=0.009), decreased odds of returning to the operating room (OR= 0.51, p=0.002), and a significant reduction in 30-day mortality (OR= 0.32, p=0.037) compared to usual orthopedic care in a weighted analysis. Need for ICU transfer was higher with advanced practice clinician comanagement (OR= 1.54, p=0.009), without significant differences in 30-day readmission or inhospital mortality.
Conclusions
We observed reductions in length of stay, healthcare costs, return to the operating room, and 30-day mortality with advanced practice clinician comanagement compared to usual orthopedic care. Our findings suggest advanced practice clinician-based comanagement may represent a safe and cost-effective model for orthopedic comanagement.}

As a political, economic, and cultural exchange channel between ancient China and countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa, the Silk Road has promoted political, trade, and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries in Chinese history and also promoted the development of traditional Chinese medicine.
Methods
This article summarizes the introduction of medicinal materials from the Han to Qing Dynasties, spanning approximately 2000 years.
Results
A total of 235 types of medicinal plant materials were imported. An analysis of 178 medicinal herbs of known origin, belonging to 72 families revealed their effectiveness in treating 20 diseases. The maximum number of medicinal herbs used to treat gastrointestinal and digestive disorders (GAS) was 122. The applications and origin of exotic medicinal materials, including draconis sanguis and olibanum have changed during the development of the Silk Road. Imported medicinal materials are affected by five factors, including local demand, adaptability, cultural exchange, scarcity, and medical theory. Five modes for introducing medicinal materials include the onshore Silk Road, the maritime Silk Road, diplomatic envoys and gifts, overseas Chinese, cultural exchange, and medical integration. The application of exotic medicinal materials expands the resources and application fields of traditional Chinese medicine, enriching the theory of traditional Chinese medicine.
Conclusion
Traditional Chinese medicinal compounds introduced to China through the ancient Silk Road not only promoted their integration into foreign medicine but also had long-lasting impacts to date and over a wide range, thereby considerably affecting the pharmaceutical and general healthcare industries.}

While advancements in energy metabolism, chemical composition analysis, machine learning, ion current modeling, and supercritical fluid technology have provided valuable insight into how aspects of TCM property theory may be measured, these studies only capture specific aspects of TCM property theory in isolation, overlooking the holistic perspective inherent in TCM. To systematically investigate the modern interpretation of the TCM property theory from multidimensional perspectives, we consulted the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition) to compile a list of Chinese materia medica (CMM). Then, using the Latin names of each CMM and gut microbiota as keywords, we searched the PubMed database for relevant research on gut microbiota and CMM. The regulatory patterns of different herbs on gut microbiota were then summarized from the perspectives of the four natures, the five flavors and the meridian tropism. In terms of the four natures, we found that warm-natured medicines promoted the colonization of specific beneficial bacteria, while cold-natured medicines boosted populations of some beneficial bacteria while suppressing pathogenic bacteria. Analysis of the five flavors revealed that sweet-flavored and bitter-flavored CMMs positively influenced beneficial bacteria while inhibiting harmful bacteria. CMMs with different meridian tropism exhibited complex modulative patterns on gut microbiota, with Jueyin (Liver) and Taiyin (Lung) meridian CMMs generally exerting a stronger effect. The gut microbiota may be a biological indicator for characterizing the TCM property theory, which not only enhances our understanding of classic TCM theory but also contributes to its scientific advancement and application in healthcare.

A total of 23 articles were deemed eligible for the review and meta-analysis, which included 1,194 men from seven countries (China, Korea, Iran, Peru, Japan, Malaysia, and India). Of these, 19 articles were analyzed for semen parameters. The use of herbal medicine increased seminal parameters, including semen volume during each ejaculation (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.52, 1.26), sperm concentration (SMD = 1.97; 95 % CI: 1.30, 2.64), total sperm count (SMD = 2.28; 95 % CI: 1.44, 3.11), sperm motility (SMD = 1.07; 95 % CI: 0.68, 1.46), and normal morphology (SMD = 1.47; 95 % CI: 0.62, 2.32). Additionally, 18 articles that analyzed sex hormone levels showed that treatment with herbal medicines favorably reduced serum prolactin (SMD = -0.70; 95 % CI: -1.13, -0.28) and FSH levels (SMD = -1.07; 95 % CI: -1.56, -0.56). Meanwhile, herbal medicines did not affect testosterone levels (SMD = 0.41; 95 % CI: -0.24, 1.06) and LH levels (SMD = 0.45; 95 % CI: -0.33, 1.23). Finally, six articles were analyzed for seminal biochemical and antioxidant profiles, and the results showed that herbal medicine increased the levels of ascorbic acid (SMD = 1.19; 95 % CI: 0.51, 1.86), corrected seminal fructose (SMD = 1.32; 95 % CI: 0.89, 1.76), superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) (SMD = 1.06; 95 % CI: 0.45, 1.68), and catalase activity (SMD = 0.91; 95 % CI: 0.69, 1.44) in seminal plasma.
Conclusion
Herbal remedies have been found to promote spermatogenesis by optimizing semen parameters, sex hormone levels, and antioxidant profiles. As a result, these treatments should be regarded as complementary approaches to male infertility.}

abstract = {Background
Substandard and falsified (SF) medicines are a global health problem. Their high prevalence is a threat to public health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there are few street-level investigations of how this market works. This case study examines the supply and demand for SF medicines in Southern Ethiopia.
Methods
A cross sectional qualitative design, using semi-structured interviews supplemented by participant observation, was adopted. Study participants were selected using purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling techniques. They included pharmacists, physicians, wholesalers, pharmacy owners, regulatory staff, law enforcement agents and the local community. A total of 43 interviews were conducted. The study used Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as an analytic framework.
Results
The findings show that efforts to address the problem of SF medicines in Ethiopia struggle because of the lack of a clear framing of the issue and consensus on how it should be understood. The pharmaceutical market in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia is supplied with a wide variety of SF medicines from diverse sources. This complex supply chain emerges due to barriers to accessing essential medicines that are in demand. Control of SF medicines will require a range of interventions thoughtfully tailored to the local contexts and determinants of both supply and demand.
Conclusion
The evidence of confusion, ambiguity, and uncertainty in defining the problem of SF medicines suggest that more research and policy work is required to refine understanding of the issue, and of the local market conditions that join demand and supply for different medicines in Southern Ethiopia. These are likely to apply more widely in comparable contexts throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The current global policy emphasis on stricter regulation and enforcement alone does not adequately address the social and economic factors that collectively create and shape user demand that is met by SF medicines.}

abstract = {Introduction
Scarcity of age appropriate formulations for orally administered medicines for paediatric malignancies is a critical and ongoing issue which necessitates urgent solutions. According to JARC Survey 27 % of oral medicines were never available in child-friendly formulations (Vassal et al., 2021 [2]). Pharmacists from the European Society of Oncology Pharmacy Global (ESOP) and the European Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOPE) have collaborated to provide a document summarising literature data on this topic and a set of practical instructions on the preparation of extemporaneous oral liquid medicines.
Material and methods
Literature review was conducted for the preparation of oral medicines for paediatric cancer, through Pubmed 2.0. A table was drawn up with necessary information for medicine preparation. We adapted the classification model of the molecule stability ranking of the International database of stability for injectable drugs, Stabilis® (Class A–C).
Results
A total of 126 articles were selected and analysed. All commercially available marketed liquid oral medications used in paediatric cancer were overviewed using globally accessible drug databases and compiled in a table with appropriate indications. Based on the literature review, 28 formulations for 13 different active ingredients for chemotherapy and 35 formulations for 16 different active ingredients for supportive therapy were compiled.
Conclusions
Development of child-appropriate formulations of anticancer medicines by the pharmaceutical industry should be incentivised towards marketing authorisation to enhance accessibility. The results of this study could help facilitate creation of European standards for extemporaneous preparation and persuade researchers in the field of paediatric oncology on the way forward.}

keywords = {Chinese herbal medicine, Randomized controlled trial, Risk of bias, Meta-epidemiological study, Effect estimates},
abstract = {Background
Previously published meta-epidemiological studies focused on Western medicine have identified some trial characteristics that impact the treatment effect of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Nevertheless, it remains unclear if similar associations exist in RCTs on Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Further, Chinese medicine-related characteristics have not been explored yet.
Objective
To investigate trial characteristics related to treatment effect estimates on CHM RCTs.
Search strategy
This meta-epidemiological study searched 5 databases for systematic reviews on CHM treatment published between January 2011 and July 2021.
Inclusion criteria
An eligible systematic review should only include RCTs of CHM and conduct at least one meta-analysis.
Data extraction and analysis
Two reviewers independently conducted data extraction on general characteristics of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and included RCTs. They also assessed the risk of bias of RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A two-step approach was used for data analyses. The ratio of odds ratios (ROR) and difference in standardized mean differences (dSMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to present the difference in effect estimates for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively.
Results
Ninety-one systematic reviews, comprising 1338 RCTs were identified. For binary outcomes, RCTs incorporated with syndrome differentiation (ROR: 1.23; 95 % CI: [1.07, 1.39]), adopting Chinese medicine formula (ROR: 1.19; 95% CI: [1.03, 1.34]), with low risk of bias on incomplete outcome data (ROR: 1.29; 95% CI: [1.06, 1.52]) and selective outcome reporting (ROR: 1.12; 95% CI: [1.01, 1.24]), as well as a trial size ≥ 100 (ROR: 1.23; 95% CI: [1.04, 1.42]) preferred to show larger effect estimates. As for continuous outcomes, RCTs with Chinese medicine diagnostic criteria (dSMD: 0.23; 95% CI: [0.06, 0.41]), judged as high/unclear risk of bias on allocation concealment (dSMD: −0.70; 95% CI: [−0.99, −0.42]), with low risk of bias on incomplete outcome data (dSMD: 0.30; 95% CI: [0.18, 0.43]), conducted at a single center (dSMD: −0.33; 95% CI: [−0.61, −0.05]), not using intention-to-treat analysis (dSMD: −0.75; 95% CI: [−1.43, −0.07]), and without funding support (dSMD: −0.22; 95% CI: [−0.41, −0.02]) tended to show larger effect estimates.
Conclusion
This study provides empirical evidence for the development of a specific critical appraisal tool for risk of bias assessments on CHM RCTs.

abstract = {Context
Pain is a prevalent symptom in patients with serious illness and often requires interventional approaches for adequate treatment. Little is known about referral patterns and collaborative attitudes of palliative physicians regarding pain management specialists.
Objectives
To evaluate referral rates, co-management strategies, and beliefs of palliative physicians about the value of Pain Medicine specialists in patients with serious illness.
Methods
A 30-question survey with demographic, referral/practice, and attitudes/belief questions was mailed to 1000 AAHPM physician members. Responses were characterized with descriptive statistics and further analyzed for associations between training experiences, practice environment, and educational activities with collaborative practice patterns and beliefs.
Results
The response rate was 52.6%. Most survey respondents had initial board certification primarily in internal medicine (n = 286, 56%) or family medicine (n = 144, 28%). A minority of respondents had completed a formal ABMS Hospice and Palliative Medicine fellowship (n = 178, 34%). Respondents had been in practice for a median of nine years, (range 1-38 years) primarily in community hospitals (n = 249, 47%) or academic hospitals (n = 202, 38%). The variables best associated with collaborative practices and attitudes was practice in an academic hospital setting and participation in regular joint academic conferences with pain medicine clinicians.
Conclusion
This study shows that Palliative Care physicians have highly positive attitudes toward Pain Medicine specialists, but referrals remain low. Facilitating professional collaboration via joint educational/clinical sessions is one possible solution to drive ongoing interprofessional care in patients with complex pain.}

abstract = {Introduction
The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was first coined in the 1960s and has made significant progress up to the present day. During this period, numerous AI applications have been developed. GPT-4 and Gemini are two of the best-known of these AI models. As a triage system The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is currently one of the most commonly used for effective patient triage in the emergency department. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of GPT-4, Gemini, and emergency medicine specialists in ESI triage against each other; furthermore, it aims to contribute to the literature on the usability of these AI programs in emergency department triage.
Methods
Our study was conducted between February 1, 2024, and February 29, 2024, among emergency medicine specialists in Turkey, as well as with GPT-4 and Gemini. Ten emergency medicine specialists were included in our study but as a limitation the emergency medicine specialists participating in the study do not frequently use the ESI triage model in daily practice. In the first phase of our study, 100 case examples related to adult or trauma patients were extracted from the sample and training cases found in the ESI Implementation Handbook. In the second phase of our study, the provided responses were categorized into three groups: correct triage, over-triage, and under-triage. In the third phase of our study, the questions were categorized according to the correct triage responses.
Results
In the results of our study, a statistically significant difference was found between the three groups in terms of correct triage, over-triage, and under-triage (p < 0.001). GPT-4 was found to have the highest correct triage rate with an average of 70.60 (±3.74), while Gemini had the highest over-triage rate with an average of 35.2 (±2.93) (p < 0.001). The highest under-triage rate was observed in emergency medicine specialists (32.90 (±11.83)). In the ESI 1–2 class, Gemini had a correct triage rate of 87.77%, GPT-4 had 85.11%, and emergency medicine specialists had 49.33%.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study shows that both GPT-4 and Gemini can accurately triage critical and urgent patients in ESI 1&2 groups at a high rate. Furthermore, GPT-4 has been more successful in ESI triage for all patients. These results suggest that GPT-4 and Gemini could assist in accurate ESI triage of patients in emergency departments.}

We define open science practices and discuss those that are applicable to TCIM, including: study registration; reporting guidelines; data, code and material sharing; preprinting; publishing open access; and reproducibility/replication studies. We explore the benefits of open science in TCIM, spanning improved research quality, increased public trust, accelerated innovation, and enhanced evidence-based decision-making. We also acknowledge challenges such as data privacy concerns, limited resources, and resistance to cultural change. We propose strategies to overcome these challenges, including ethical guidelines, education programs, funding advocacy, interdisciplinary dialogue, and patient engagement. Looking to the future, we envision the maturation of open science in TCIM, the development of TCIM-specific guidelines for open science practices, advancements in data sharing platforms, the integration of open data and artificial intelligence in TCIM research, and changes in the context of policy and regulation. We foresee a future where open science in TCIM leads to a better evidence base, informed decision-making, interdisciplinary collaboration, and transformative impacts on healthcare and research methodologies, highlighting the promising synergy between open science and TCIM for holistic, evidence-based healthcare solutions.}

abstract = {Objective
In Pakistan, traditional medicines are an important component of the medical system, with numerous varieties and great demands. However, due to the scattered resources and the lack of systematic collection and collation, adulteration of traditional Pakistani medicine (TPM) is common, which severely affects the safety of their medicinal use and the import and export trades. Therefore, it is urgent to systematically organize and unify the management of TPM and establish a set of standards and operable methods for the identification of TPM.
Methods
We collected and organized the information on 128 TPMs with regard to their medicinal parts, efficacy, usage, and genetic material, based on Pakistan Hamdard Pharmacopoeia of Eastern Medicine: Pharmaceutical Codex. The genetic information of TPM is summarized from national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) and global pharmacopoeia genome database (GPGD). Furthermore, we utilized bioinformatics technology to supplement the chloroplast genome (cp-genome) data of 12 TPMs. To build the web server, we used the Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP (LAMP) system and constructed the webpage on a PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) model view controller (MVC) framework.
Results
We constructed a new genomic database, the traditional Pakistani medicine genomic database (TPMGD). This database comprises five entries, namely homepage, medicinal species, species identification, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), and download. Currently, TPMGD contains basic profiles of 128 TPMs and genetic information of 102 TPMs, including 140 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences and 119 mitochondrial genome sequences from Bombyx mori, 1 396 internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences and 1 074 intergenic region (psbA-trnH) sequences specific to 92 and 83 plant species, respectively. Additionally, TPMGD includes 199 cp-genome sequences of 82 TPMs.
Conclusion
TPMGD is a multifunctional database that integrates species description, functional information inquiry, genetic information storage, molecular identification of TPM, etc. The database not only provides convenience for TPM information queries but also establishes the scientific basis for the medication safety, species identification, and resource protection of TPM.}

Forensic doctors can deal with both the living and the dead and deal with cases of physical and sexual assault, gender-based violence, and domestic violence. In different courts, such as civil, military, and shariah, Palestinian judicial decisions depend primarily on forensic medical reports and the testimonies that forensic doctors provide for the court to explain their reports. Forensic medicine has a significant role and crucial impact on achieving justice for victims of all types of abuse, either dead or alive. However, the role of forensic medicine in achieving justice for victims, and hence fighting and eradicating violence, is underestimated and not fully understood by the general population. This paper introduces to the reader the status of forensic medicine in Palestine, focusing on the challenges and obstacles faced by both the victims and forensic doctors. Meeting these challenges and overcoming obstacles is essential for fighting all types of violence, including violence against women in Palestinian society. The current provision of forensic medical services in Palestine is less than satisfactory, being considerably hampered by the lack of legislation and regulations. Palestine is in great need of continued international support for forensic medicine and forensic services. Two projects supported by the United Nations put the country on the road, but there are still many miles to go toward the aim.}

abstract = {Importance
The lack of underrepresented in medicine physicians in academic plastic surgery has been a topic of interest for many years, and accordingly outreach has been undertaken to address the pipeline from medical school to residency and beyond.
Objective
This study aims to assess and identify the characteristics associated with plastic surgery match success for underrepresented in medicine applicants.
Design
Residency application data for first time, US allopathic medical school seniors from the 2017-2018 to 2021-2022 applicant cycles were abstracted from Electronic Residency Application Service applications, and match results were determined using the National Residency Matching Program database and online public sources. Data included self-reported race, and multiple application characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression of application characteristics were used to assess the relationship between underrepresented in medicine status and successfully matching. Binary logistic regression was used in subgroup analyses of each application characteristic, and interactions regression was used to evaluate the relative weight of each characteristic on successfully matching.
Results
Underrepresented in medicine applicants were 57% less likely to match than non-underrepresented in medicine applicants (OR 0.43, p = 0.001), though they were 60% less likely to match (ORadj 0.4, p = 0.216) when adjusted. Subgroup analysis revealed that odds of matching as an underrepresented in medicine applicant were significantly increased if the applicant had a home program, took a research year, and had an increased number of published research and presentations (ORs 0.43-0.48, all p < 0.05). Odds of matching as an underrepresented in medicine applicant were significantly decreased if the applicant went to a medical school ranked in the highest or lowest third (ORs 0.41-0.42, all p < 0.01); however, on interaction regression the odds of matching from a highly ranked medical school was increased (OR 3.5, 95% CI 0.98-12.55, p = 0.05).
Conclusions
The likelihood of matching as an underrepresented in medicine applicant is lower than the rest of the applicant population, and there are no individual applicant characteristics that can increase these odds to equal that of the general applicant population.}

To refine the methods of developing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for integrative Chinese-Western medicine (ICWM), promoting the formation of trustworthy, implementable recommendations that integrate the strengths of Chinese and Western medicine.
Methods
Using a nominal group technique (NGT) approach, a multidisciplinary expert panel was established. The panel identified key methodological issues in ICWM-CPG development through literature review and iterative discussions, and formulated methodological proposals to address these issues. The final set of proposals was achieved through consensus among the panel members.
Results
The collaborative effort resulted in the identification of five pivotal methodological issues and the subsequent establishment of 22 specific recommendations. These encompass strict adherence to renowned standards, such as those proposed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), the employment of methodologies like the GRADE approach and RIGHT statement, the strategic constitution of a balanced development group, the adept identification of ICWM-focused clinical inquiries, the nuanced integration of diverse evidence sources, and the detailed crafting of transparent, implementable recommendations.
Conclusions
This study concentrates on the most crucial and prevalent methodological issues in ICWM-CPG development, proposing a series of recommendations. These suggestions result from a multidisciplinary expert consensus, aiming to provide methodological guidance for ICWM-CPG developers, building upon the current foundational methodologies.}

abstract = {Objective
Few studies have assessed the ability of internal medicine residents to perform a cardiovascular physical examination using real patients.
Methods
First year internal medicine interns from two large academic medical centers in Maryland examined the same patient with aortic insufficiency as part of the Assessment of Physical Examination and Communication Skills (APECS). Interns were assessed on five clinical domains: physical exam technique, identifying physical signs, generating a differential diagnosis, clinical judgement, and maintaining patient welfare. Spearman's correlation test was used to describe associations between clinical domains. Preceptor comments were examined to identify common errors in physical exam technique and identifying physical signs.
Results
One-hundred and nine interns examined the same patient with aortic insufficiency across 14 APECS sessions. Only 58 interns (53.2%) correctly identified the presence of a diastolic murmur, and only 52 interns (47.7%) included aortic insufficiency on their differential diagnosis. There was a significant and positive correlation between physical exam technique and identification of the correct physical findings (r=0.42, p<0.001). Both technique (r=0.34, p=0.003) and identifying findings (r=0.42, p<0.001) were significantly associated with generating an appropriate differential diagnosis. Common errors in technique included auscultating over the gown, timing the cardiac cycle with the radial pulse, and failing to palpate for the apical impulse.
Conclusions
Internal medicine interns had variable skills in performing and interpreting the cardiovascular physical exam. Improving cardiovascular exam skills would likely lead to increased identification of relevant cardiovascular findings, inform clinical decision making and improve overall patient care.}

The appropriate use of medicines has long been recognized as a fundamental component of medicine policies. We aimed to extract lessons from published research on how policy contexts and mechanisms can affect the outcomes of national- or health-system level interventions to promote appropriate medicine use (defined as an increase in underutilized medications or decrease in inappropriate medication use).
Methods
We conducted a rapid realist review of published evidence concerning system-level policies to promote the appropriate use of medicines in high-income countries with universal prescription drug coverage. We searched MEDLINE and Embase to identify relevant publications. We used a realist evaluation framework to identify contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes for each intervention and to hypothesize which policy contexts and mechanisms supported successful outcomes in terms of relative changes in the prevalence of use of the specific medication classes targeted.
Results
From 1,318 identified studies, 18 met our inclusion criteria. 13 distinct policies were identified. Three main policy-related factors underpinned successful interventions: involving providers and patients through program interventions; central coordination through national agencies dedicated to medicine policies; and the establishment of an explicit and integrated national medicine policy strategy.
Conclusion
Policymakers can improve coordination of national pharmaceutical policies to reduce harms from inappropriate medicines use, thus improving health outcomes through cost-effective programs.}

Subsequent to two previous papers published by this group on general education in transfusion medicine, this paper specifically refers to the field of education in haemovigilance. This topic is of particular importance when one considers the role of haemovigilance in improving the safety of transfusion practice, and the fact that this role can only be realised through the cooperation of all participants in the transfusion chain.

abstract = {BACKGROUND
The United States Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization. Many states in the Southeastern United States responded with restrictive policies that limit and criminalize abortion care.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to characterize the effect of abortion restrictions on maternal-fetal medicine physicians in the Southeastern United States after the Dobbs decision.
STUDY DESIGN
Qualitative, semistructured interviews with 35 maternal-fetal medicine physicians in 10 Southeastern states between February 2023 and June 2023 were conducted. Our recruitment strategy relied on convenience and snowball sampling. Audio-recorded interviews were analyzed using Dedoose software and a descriptive qualitative approach that incorporated deductive and inductive approaches.
RESULTS
Emergent themes were identified, and a conceptual framework was developed on the basis of overarching themes. This study found that abortion laws and external constraints after the Dobbs decision resulted in ethical, professional, and legal challenges for maternal-fetal medicine physicians that led to changes in clinical practice and deviations from patient-centered care. These forced changes resulted in negative effects on maternal-fetal medicine physicians, such as increased fear, hypervigilance, and increased workload. In addition, these changes prompted concerns about health risks and negative emotional effects for patients. Supportive colleagues, hospital systems, and policies were associated with decreased stress, emotional distress, and disruption of healthcare delivery.
CONCLUSION
Abortion restrictions in the Southeastern United States limit the ability of maternal-fetal medicine physicians to provide or facilitate abortions in the setting of fetal anomalies and maternal health risks. Maternal-fetal medicine physicians perceived these restrictions to have negative professional and emotional repercussions for themselves and negative effects on patients. Supportive colleagues and clear guidance from hospital systems and departments on how to interpret the laws were protective. Our findings have implications for the maternal-fetal medicine workforce and patient care in the region.}

abstract = {Summary
Although the promise of radionuclides for the diagnosis and treatment of disease was recognised soon after the discovery of radioactivity in the late 19th century, the systematic use of radionuclides in medicine only gradually increased over the subsequent hundred years. The past two decades, however, has seen a remarkable surge in the clinical application of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, particularly in oncology. This development is an exciting time for the use of theranostics in oncology, but the rapid growth of this area of nuclear medicine has created challenges as well. In particular, the infrastructure for the manufacturing and distribution of radiopharmaceuticals remains in development, and regulatory bodies are still optimising guidelines for this new class of drug. One issue of paramount importance for achieving equitable access to theranostics is building a sufficiently trained workforce in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Here, we discuss the key challenges and opportunities that face the field as it seeks to build its workforce for the 21st century.}

Strategies targeted at the five pillars of sustainability (social, human, economic, ecological and environmental) can be used to improve sustainability of clinical or research practices in nuclear medicine.
Key findings
While the core principle of sustainability is ensuring depletion does not exceed regeneration, this manuscript considers the balance of benefits and detriments of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across the five pillars of sustainability. Specifically, innovations such as AI, generative AI and digital twins could enhance sustainability. While AI has the potential to address social asymmetry and inequity to drive the social and human pillars of sustainability, there is potential for widening the equity gap. AI augmentation and generative AI present economic and environmental sustainability opportunities. Deep digital twins offers clinical and research benefits in economic, ecological and environmental sustainability pillars.
Conclusion
AI, digital twins and generative AI offer potential benefits to sustainability in nuclear medicine. Despite the benefits, caution is advised because these technologies confront a number of challenges that could potentially threaten sustainability.
Implications for practice
AI presents opportunities for improving sustainability of nuclear medicine practice although caution is recommended to avoid unintentional undermining of sustainability across the five pillars.}

South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare has developed clinical pathways for Korean Medicine (KM-CPs). As part of this initiative, a panel comprising Korean Medicine doctors (KMD) was assembled. This implementation study aimed to preliminarily explore how KM-CP implementation affects the appropriateness and efficiency of the clinical process and its relation to attitude.
Methods
Through random sampling, 311 KMDs were recruited as panelists to participate in two surveys. The surveys included information regarding the KM clinical environment and KM-CP implementation. A panel management program and educational materials were provided to KMDs between the two survey periods. Only 262 KMDs who responded to both surveys were included in the analysis. Three analyses were conducted: 1) descriptive analysis of the study variables, 2) panel analysis using the ordered logit regression model to elucidate the impact of KM-CP on the appropriateness and efficiency of the clinical process, and 3) ordered logit regression analysis of the association between KM-CP implementation and attitude.
Results
More than two-thirds of the KMDs attempted to adopt KM-CP, with mostly positive perception expressed by these doctors. However, expectations and concerns coexist with the standardization of KM-CP. Cases in which KM-CPs were partially and mostly implemented respectively had negative and positive effects on the appropriateness and efficiency of the clinical process compared to those in which KM-CPs were not implemented. Compared to neutral attitude, positive and very positive attitudes tended to be associated with increased implementation of KM-CP. However, statistical significances were not observed.
Conclusions
The impact of KM-CP on the clinical process and its association with attitude were found to be statistically unclear or inconsistent. Considering the study limitations and implications, we suggest a policy and academic strategies aimed at fostering improvement to enhance its utility.}

Herbal medicine has seen remarkable growth in consumption over the past few years. Community pharmacists are health care professionals who have an important role in the dispensing and counselling of these products. The aim of this study was to evaluate perceptions, professional practices and knowledge about herbal medicine among community pharmacists in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain).
Method
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in community pharmacies in Tenerife using a questionnaire that included demographic data, perceptions, professional practices and knowledge of herbal medicine. Data from 610 community pharmacists was analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software program.
Results
Most of the responders had a positive attitude towards herbal medicine, considering its products useful (80.9%), safe (64.2%) and those sold in pharmacies of high quality and standardized (84.6%). They thought that these products should only be sold in pharmacies (78.0%) and that it was their responsibility to provide information about them (95.5%). However, only 32.1% believed they are well prepared to provide herbal pharmaceutical care services and 36.1% that there are reliable and easily accessible sources of information. Moreover, 60.7% considered lack of training a barrier to recommending herbal medicinal products, being interested in updating their knowledge on it (96.9%).
Conclusion
This study showed that community pharmacists have a positive perception of herbal medicines, considering them beneficial and safe. However, participants requested reliable sources of information, easy access, and more training to dispense, counsel, and safely label these products. Education and training programs in herbal medicine are needed to enhance their ability to provide herbal pharmaceutical care.}

abstract = {Bone metastases are a painful and complex condition that overwhelmingly impacts the prognosis and quality of life of cancer patients. Over the years, nuclear medicine has made remarkable progress in the diagnosis and management of bone metastases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in nuclear medicine for the diagnosis and management of bone metastases. Furthermore, the review explores the role of targeted radiopharmaceuticals in nuclear medicine for bone metastases, focusing on radiolabeled molecules that are designed to selectively target biomarkers associated with bone metastases, including osteocytes, osteoblasts, and metastatic cells. The applications of radionuclide-based therapies, such as strontium-89 (Sr-89) and radium-223 (Ra-223), are also discussed. This review also highlights the potential of theranostic approaches for bone metastases, enabling personalized treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics. Importantly, the clinical applications and outcomes of nuclear medicine in osseous metastatic disease are discussed. This includes the assessment of treatment response, predictive and prognostic value of imaging biomarkers, and the impact of nuclear medicine on patient management and outcomes. The review identifies current challenges and future perspectives on the role of nuclear medicine in treating bone metastases. It addresses limitations in imaging resolution, radiotracer availability, radiation safety, and the need for standardized protocols. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for further research and advancements in imaging technology, radiopharmaceutical development, and integration of nuclear medicine with other treatment modalities. In summary, advancements in nuclear medicine have significantly improved the diagnosis and management of osseous metastatic disease and future developements in the integration of innovative imaging modalities, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, radionuclide production, theranostic approaches, and advanced image analysis techniques hold great promise in improving patient outcomes and enhancing personalized care for individuals with bone metastases.}

abstract = {Objective
Visual narratives have been used in medicine to share information in the form of stories with the potential to improve understanding of conditions and change behaviours. One genre of visual narratives is “graphic medicine”, which integrates comics into medical education and the delivery of healthcare. Graphic medicine can maximise the impact of research findings by presenting them in a more accessible format, which may be particularly useful in certain populations, such as those with low levels of health literacy. Those with lower health literacy levels and osteoarthritis (OA) are less likely to manage their condition with guideline recommended management strategies, experience a higher burden of disease, and have lower access to care. Our objectives were to review the current visual narratives in the field of and create a graphic medicine visual narrative based on existing research.
Design
This paper summarises the current visual narratives in OA and presents a graphic medicine visual narrative to illustrate the experience of living with OA. Considerations for the dissemination of visual narratives to target audiences are also discussed.
Results
The most common visual narratives in are infographics, videos, and graphic medicine. A graphic medicine visual narrative, based on previous qualitative work and informed by a framework, was created to illustrate two distinct narratives – impairment and participatory.
Conclusion
Visual narratives remain an emerging field in OA but may serve as a useful resource for patients or clinicians to discuss various aspects of OA management. Future research should evaluate and validate the use of visual narratives in OA.}

Introduction
This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions for airway remodelling in patients with asthma.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted of 8 international and Chinese databases and 2 clinical trial registries from the inception of the database to March 2022. The data were analysed for the outcomes of lung function, matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), and adverse events. The Cochrane “Risk of bias” tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods were used to assess the methodological quality and the certainty of the evidence. Descriptive analysis was employed to summarize the outcomes of TCM. The PROSPERO ID is CRD42022318617. This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82,004,167).
Results
Twenty RCTs involving 1790 patients with asthma were included. The trials were at unclear or high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low certainty to low certainty. The TCM used in each trial was different. Compared to those of conventional medicine, 9 trials showed greater effects of TCM alone or combined with conventional medicine on lung function, as indicated by the FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC. Nine trials showed that TCM significantly reduced the expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1. Five trials reported adverse events.
Conclusion
TCM alone or in combination with conventional medicine alleviated airway remodelling symptoms in patients with asthma. However, additional high-quality randomized trials are still needed to confirm the beneficial effectiveness of TCM.}

abstract = {Introduction
ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, represents the cutting-edge in its field with its latest model, GPT-4. Extensive research is currently being conducted in various domains, including cardiovascular diseases, using ChatGPT. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies addressing the proficiency of GPT-4 in diagnosing conditions based on Electrocardiography (ECG) data. The goal of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of GPT-4 when provided with ECG data, and to compare its performance with that of emergency medicine specialists and cardiologists.
Methods
This study has received approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hitit University Medical Faculty on August 21, 2023 (decision no: 2023–91). Drawing on cases from the “150 ECG Cases” book, a total of 40 ECG cases were crafted into multiple-choice questions (comprising 20 everyday and 20 more challenging ECG questions). The participant pool included 12 emergency medicine specialists and 12 cardiology specialists. GPT-4 was administered the questions in a total of 12 separate sessions. The responses from the cardiology physicians, emergency medicine physicians, and GPT-4 were evaluated separately for each of the three groups.
Results
In the everyday ECG questions, GPT-4 demonstrated superior performance compared to both the emergency medicine specialists and the cardiology specialists (p < 0.001, p = 0.001). In the more challenging ECG questions, while Chat-GPT outperformed the emergency medicine specialists (p < 0.001), no significant statistical difference was found between Chat-GPT and the cardiology specialists (p = 0.190). Upon examining the accuracy of the total ECG questions, Chat-GPT was found to be more successful compared to both the Emergency Medicine Specialists and the cardiologists (p < 0.001, p = 0.001).
Conclusion
Our study has shown that GPT-4 is more successful than emergency medicine specialists in evaluating both everyday and more challenging ECG questions. It performed better compared to cardiologists on everyday questions, but its performance aligned closely with that of the cardiologists as the difficulty of the questions increased.}

abstract = {Objective
The surge in vehicles has escalated traffic volume, leading to an upswing in traffic accidents and subsequent disorders. Complex symptoms often characterize post-traumatic syndrome from these accidents. Traditional Korean medicine (TKM), increasingly used in car insurance, forms a substantial part of treatment costs. However, the current system lacks explicit fee guidelines and approval criteria for non-reimbursable TKM procedures, relying heavily on practitioners’ judgment without robust evidence-based decision-making. This scenario raises concerns about treatment appropriateness and transparency. We aim to explore physicians’ perspectives on utilizing TKM in emergency medicine, their participation sentiments, and their session selection process post-traffic accident.
Methods
We collected TKM practitioners’ opinions regarding their role in clinical environment and involvement in treating patients after traffic accidents. The need for comprehensive and standardized protocols for the diagnosis, treatment, management, and prognosis of patients with post-traumatic syndrome is evident. Additionally, improvements that facilitate rational decision-making by medical consumers and protect the treatment rights of healthcare providers are necessary. Results has emphasized the importance of evidence-based decision-making, establishing appropriate fee structures and detailed criteria for non-reimbursable TKM-based procedures, and enhancing regulations for the reliability and transparency of TKM-based treatments in the context of car insurance.
Results and conclusions
The perspective of healthcare providers directly involved in TKM-based treatments must be considered to maintain a sustainable vehicular insurance system, transcending administrative policy discourse. We highlighted the challenges and potential solutions for improving the effectiveness and appropriateness of TKM-based treatments in the context of car insurance.}

In 2019, a pilot lifestyle medicine program was launched at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue to improve cardiometabolic health in high-risk patients through intensive support for evidence-based lifestyle changes. Analyses of program data collected from January 29, 2019 to February 26, 2020 demonstrated feasibility, high demand for services, high patient satisfaction, and clinically and statistically significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors. This pilot is being expanded to 6 new NYC Health + Hospitals sites spanning all 5 NYC boroughs. As part of the expansion, many changes have been implemented to enhance the original pilot model, scale services effectively, and generate more interest and incentives in lifestyle medicine for staff and patients across the health care system, including a plant-based default meal program for inpatients. This narrative review describes the pilot model and outcomes, the expansion process, and lessons learned to serve as a guide for other health systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
The concerns of inaccessibility to essential medicines in India are well-studied and documented. Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Priyojana (PMBJP) is one of the policy initiatives to address the inaccessibility of essential medicine. Janaushadhi Kendra (People's Medicine Centre), which is part of PMBJP is being enquired in a limited way to understand its effectiveness. The province of Odisha has been chosen as the study area for the evaluation of People's Medicine Centres.
Objective
The present study intends to inquire into the nature of People's Medicine Centre ownership, pharmacists' motivations and incentives to engage in business, perceived customers' trust and satisfaction, scheme beneficiaries, and challenges.
Methods
A qualitative research approach has been adopted to evaluate the broader subjective accounts of the pharmacists and People's Medicine Centre. An open-ended interview guide was used. The topics of ownership, motivation, incentives, trust, satisfaction, perceived benefits, and challenges has been recorded from the participants. A total of seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted in the province of Odisha, India.
Results
The study found that the ownership of People's Medicine Centre was of two types in the province of Odisha: public-NGO-owned People's Medicine Centres and public-private-owned People's Medicine Centres. The financial incentive provisions in the scheme attracted the private pharmacists. Pharmacists highlighted about the lower price of generic medicines compared to branded medicines, which is very popular among patients. They also pointed out that there is no difference in the efficacy of both medicines. The attitude of physicians, especially private physicians, were considered problematic for popularity and acceptance.
Conclusion
The People's Medicine Centres in Odisha established themselves as trusted outlets despite physicians' unfavourable attitudes. Although the centres have not reached the required geographical coverage, economically developed regions have large number of centres, while backward regions have minimal presence. The scheme needs to be more conducive to the welfare of the masses living in remote and rural areas.}

The use of herbal medicine during pregnancy is common in developing countries. Studies evaluating such use are sparse in southern Nigeria. This study sought to assess the attributes and determinants of herbal medicine use among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at three hospitals in Uyo, Nigeria.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional survey of 650 eligible pregnant women between December 2022 and February 2023. At their antenatal appointments, participants were given a 14-item questionnaire to complete while they waited to see a doctor. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 25.0, with P<0.05 indicating statistical significance.
Results
The prevalence of herbal medicine use in the current and previous pregnancies was 19.4% and 35.3%, respectively. The most commonly used herbal medicines were fluted pumpkin leaves (21.8%), ginger (20.5%), and mixture herbal product (16.7%). The use of such medicines was highest in the first trimester (59.4%), mostly to relieve nausea and vomiting (58.0%) and to reduce swelling of the legs (53.3%). Herbal medicine use was significantly (P<0.05) associated with age, education, employment, number of children, whether the current pregnancy was the first, and having used herbal medicine during a previous pregnancy. Most users (63.7%) never disclosed such use to their doctor.
Conclusions
The pregnant women surveyed frequently used herbal remedies during their pregnancies; such use was associated with most of the participants’ characteristics. Healthcare professionals should routinely inquire about herbal medicines pregnant patients may be taking in addition to conventional medications and pay closer attention to conditions that cause inconvenience to them.}

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) dietotherapy, based on the principle of “medicine and food homology”, is widely used across diverse healthcare domains. However, the dual attributes of “medicine” and “food” possessed by medicinal and edible herbs make it challenging to assess the efficacy and harms of TCM dietotherapy using currently available methodological systems. This limits the advancement of health services and regulations in this field. This study introduces the Dietotherapy Intention, Evaluation, and Harm Tracking (DIET) pathway, a staged approach for assessing the efficacy and harms of TCM dietotherapy.
Results
The DIET pathway was developed through comprehensive analysis and two rounds of Delphi expert consensus. Based on the distinct characteristics and management requirements of TCM dietotherapy, the DIET pathway divides the assessment process into three stages: Stage 1 (Intention) aims to establish intended efficacy goals, Stage 2 (Evaluation) aims to validate efficacy and harms, and Stage 3 (Harm Tracking) aims to assess harms in special scenarios. Elaborate methodological guidelines are provided for each stage.
Conclusion
The DIET pathway has created a methodological environment that enables systematic and efficient assessment of the efficacy and harms of TCM dietotherapy regimens, which will facilitate the application and management of TCM dietotherapy.}

The panel made 14 recommendations on albumin use in adult critical care (three recommendations), pediatric critical care (one recommendation), neonatal critical care (two recommendations), cardiovascular surgery (two recommendations), kidney replacement therapy (one recommendation), and complications of cirrhosis (five recommendations). Of the 14 recommendations, two recommendations had moderate certainty of evidence, five recommendations had low certainty of evidence, and seven recommendations had very low certainty of evidence. Two of the 14 recommendations suggested conditional use of albumin for patients with cirrhosis undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Twelve of 14 recommendations did not suggest albumin use in a wide variety of clinical situations where albumin commonly is transfused.
Conclusions
Currently, few evidence-based indications support the routine use of albumin in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. These guidelines provide clinicians with actionable recommendations on the use of albumin.}

abstract = {Mexicans in the United States have been reported to maintain practices of Mexican traditional medicine at comparably higher rates than most other populations, including other Latino sub-groups. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the pre- and post-migration traditional medicine practices of first-generation immigrants from Mexico living in southern Arizona. Our objective was to assess how migration affected Mexican immigrants' ethnomedical practices and to better understand the mechanisms and motivating factors for the post-migration maintenance of practice. We designed a survey instrument based off prior qualitative data on traditional medicine practices and translated it into Spanish. The survey measured the rates and frequency of six domains of lay healing practices: herbal medicine, healing foods, self-medication with over-the-counter medicine, and three types of specialty healers (curandero/a, and sobador/a, or partero/a), and asked questions about knowledge sources, reasons for maintaining practice post-migration, and to what extent participants believed the remedies were effective. The research team fielded the telephone-based survey from April 2022 to February 2023 to 300 first-generation adult Mexican immigrants residing in southern Arizona. A series of proportions tests were conducted to examine differences in reliance on lay healing pre- and post-migration as well as to assess differences between women's and men's lay practices. The data indicate a general, but moderated decline in lay medical practices post-migration, with the usage of expert healers declining at much higher rates than the three self-care domains. Women tend to use herbal medicine and healing foods at higher rates than men post-migration. This cross-sectional quantitative study confirms prior research indicating that traditional medicine practices are heavily relied upon by Mexican origin people both pre- and post-migration. These findings suggest that public health messaging and medical providers should better address and harness Mexican immigrants' lay medical practices in order to optimize health in this population.}

abstract = {Background
Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a prevalent and challenging gastrointestinal disorder. Conventional medicine often faces limitations in providing effective treatment for FD, thus indicating the need to explore alternative approaches. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is rooted in ancient Chinese traditions and has evolved over thousands of years, offers a holistic approach to well-being. TCM incorporates herbal remedies, acupuncture, and other therapies while shaping the future of complementary and alternative medicine.
Purpose
To review the existing literature on the current status and future prospects of using TCM to treat FD.
Methods
We extensively searched the PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, an China National Knowledge Internet databases from inception to May 31, 2023 to identify relevant literature. We also searched the reference lists of the included articles.
Results
Clinical evidence-based research has explored the efficacy of TCM in treating FD. Recent research has illuminated the multifaceted mechanisms through which TCM interventions affect FD. TCM is a promising alternative, as it emphasizes a holistic approach and holds potential advantages in addressing the complex nature of FD.
Conclusions
The integration of TCM and Western medicine offers a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing FD by bridging traditional wisdom with modern scientific understanding. This paper highlights the practical implications of this integration, the challenges to be addressed, and the potential for international collaboration to further elucidate the efficacy of TCM. However, continued research and dialog are needed to advance the modern development of TCM and to improve the quality of life of FD patients.}

Despite the introduction of new regulations, the availability of medicines for children is suboptimal because of the frequent lack of relevant clinical trials due to the difficulty of conducting such trials. Thus, the Transparency Committee (TC) of the French National Authority for Health, who oversees the assessment of medicinal products in France, set up a pediatric working group with two aims: (1) The first aim was to review all opinions on medicines for pediatric use. Out of 536 opinions delivered between 2020 and 2022, 181 (34 %) concerned medicines for pediatric use. Whereas oncology largely dominated the medicines for adults, medicines for infectious diseases, endocrinology/metabolism, neurology, and hematology mostly prevailed for children. (2) The second aim was to clarify the evaluation criteria assessed by the TC, namely, the clinical benefit (CB), the clinical added value (CAV), and the public health impact (PHI) for pediatric medicinal products. An important CB was given to 113 out of 161 (71 %) opinions on medicines for pediatric use when it concerned pathologies with a severe prognosis. The quality of the demonstration (e.g., double-blind randomized trial vs. placebo or another active medicine) played a major role in the CB level. Clinical pediatric studies were also consistently associated with higher CAV levels: levels I (major) to III (moderate) in 26 out of 42 (62 %) opinions, level IV (minor) and level V (no therapeutic progress) in 43 out of 84 (51 %) and 30 out of 43 (70 %) opinions granting a sufficient CB, respectively. Conversely, 22 out of 30 (73 %) dossiers based only on literature reviews were given a level V. The main criteria leading to the qualification of a medicine for pediatric use as providing a PHI included a significant change in the morbidity and mortality of the disease and an improvement in the care pathway. Assessments were mostly aligned on the adults in the case of subsequent extensions of indications to children. Lastly, new measures were taken aimed at shortening median delays in the assessment process in order to reduce off-label use of medicines in France.}

abstract = {Objectives
Although diversity has been demonstrated to benefit research groups, women remain underrepresented in most scientific disciplines, including Laboratory Medicine and Clinical Chemistry. In order to promote diversity and equality in scientific communities, understanding the gender distribution of authorship is crucial.
Methods
This study included a total of 30,268 Web of Science-listed Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine publications from the United States of America, Canada, and the member countries of the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine from 2005 to 2022. In addition to the publication productivity of female and male authors over time, gender-specific publication characteristics and country-specific gender distributions of authorships were examined.
Results
Overall, publications with female first authors increased by 49 % between 2005 and 2022, averaging 42 % female first authors. Eastern Europe (60 %) and Southern Europe (51 %) had particularly high proportions of female first authors. While female last authorship was the most predictive of female first authorship, with an odds ratio of 2.01 (95 % CI: 1.91–2.12, p < 0.001), only 27 % of last authors were female. Moreover, citation rate was not predictive of female first or last authorship.
Conclusion
Authorship in Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine is moving towards gender parity. This trend is more pronounced for first authors than for last authors. Further research into the citations of female authors in this discipline could be a starting point for increasing the visibility of women researchers in science. Moreover, geographical differences may provide opportunities for future research on gender parity across disciplines.}

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which is a public health problem with a significant economic burden. Serious adverse effects, such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, and genitourinary infections, as well as increasing adverse cardiovascular events, limit the clinical application of available drugs. Plenty of randomized controlled trials(RCTs), meta-analysis(MAs) and systematic reviews(SRs) have demonstrated that many therapies that have been used for a long time in medical practice including Chinese patent medicines(CPMs), Chinese medicine prescriptions, and extracts are effective in alleviating DKD, but the mechanisms by which they work are still unknown. Currently, targeting inflammation is a central strategy in DKD drug development. In addition, many experimental studies have identified many Chinese medicine prescriptions, medicinal herbs and extracts that have the potential to alleviate DKD. And part of the mechanisms by which they work have been uncovered.
Aim of this review
This review aims to summarize therapies that have been proven effective by RCTs, MAs and SRs, including CPMs, Chinese medicine prescriptions, and extracts. This review also focuses on the efficiency and potential targets of Chinese medicine prescriptions, medicinal herbs and extracts discovered in experimental studies in improving immune inflammation in DKD.
Methods
We searched for relevant scientific articles in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. We summarized effective CPMs, Chinese medicine prescriptions, and extracts from RCTs, MAs and SRs. We elaborated the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms by which Chinese medicine prescriptions, medicinal herbs and extracts alleviate inflammation in DKD according to different experimental studies.
Results
After overviewing plenty of RCTs with the low hierarchy of evidence and MAs and SRs with strong heterogeneity, we still found that CPMs, Chinese medicine prescriptions, and extracts exerted promising protective effects against DKD. However, there is insufficient evidence to prove the safety of Chinese medicines. As for experimental studies, Experiments in vitro and in vivo jointly demonstrated the efficacy of Chinese medicines(Chinese medicine prescriptions, medicinal herbs and extracts) in DKD treatment. Chinese medicines were able to regulate signaling pathways to improve inflammation in DKD, such as toll-like receptors, NLRP3 inflammasome, Nrf2 signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, JAK-STAT, and AGE/RAGE.
Conclusion
Chinese medicines (Chinese medicine prescriptions, medicinal herbs and extracts) can improve inflammation in DKD. For drugs that are effective in RCTs, the underlying bioactive components or extracts should be identified and isolated. Attention should be given to their safety and pharmacokinetics. Acute, subacute, and subchronic toxicity studies should be designed to determine the magnitude and tolerability of side effects in humans or animals. For drugs that have been proven effective in experimental studies, RCTs should be designed to provide reliable evidence for clinical translation. In a word, Chinese medicines targeting immune inflammation in DKD are a promising direction.}

Although telemedicine-based care has the potential to facilitate timely access to maternal-fetal medicine services, which can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, telemedicine is a relatively novel healthcare modality that needs to be implemented strategically. As with any medical service, telemedicine care requires rigorous evaluation to assess outcomes and ensure quality. Important health policy considerations, including access to services and insurance coverage, have substantial implications for equity in the implementation of telemedicine, particularly for reproductive healthcare following the 2022 United States Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. Investing resources and advocating for a rigorous, widely accessible telemedicine infrastructure at this crucial moment will establish an important foundation for more equitable pregnancy care. Key advocacy priorities for maternal-fetal medicine telemedicine include (1) expanding insurance coverage of telemedicine across payers, regardless of geographic location; (2) advocating for interstate licensure parity; (3) increasing access to affordable Internet and digital literacy training; and (4) ensuring access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion care, delivered via telemedicine.}

Most existing methods for modeling longitudinal patient information overlook the impact of individual diagnoses and procedures on the patient’s health, resulting in insufficient patient representation and limited accuracy of medicine recommendations. Therefore, we propose a medicine recommendation model called KEAN, which is based on an attention aggregation network and enhanced graph convolution. Specifically, KEAN can aggregate individual diagnoses and procedures in patient visits to capture significant features that affect patients’ diseases. We further incorporate medicine knowledge from complex medicine combinations, reduce drug–drug interactions (DDIs), and recommend medicines that are beneficial to patients’ health.

abstract = {Background
Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes nephrotic syndromes in adults. Conventional immunosuppressive therapies often exhibit limited efficacy in achieving remission and may result in notable adverse reactions, warranting the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches for IMN treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is extensively used for kidney disease management, is a promising alternative.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of TCM alone or in combination with Western medicine for the management of patients diagnosed with IMN.
Methods
This study employed a systematic search of English and Chinese electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the application of TCM in the treatment of IMN. RCTs that met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria and assessed the safety and efficacy of TCM alone or in combination with Western medicine in patients with IMN were included in the analysis. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated by using a risk-of-bias tool. All statistical analyses were performed using the RevMan software (version 5.4.2). The evidence was evaluated on the https://www.gradepro.org/website.
Results
This study included 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1982 patients with moderate methodological quality that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that, compared to Western medicine alone therapy, the use of TCM alone or in combination with Western medicine significantly improved total remission (TR) rate (risk ratios [RR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–1.46, I2 = 0%, P < 0.00001), complete remission (CR) rate (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.48–2.15, I2 = 0, P < 0.00001), partial remission (PR) rate (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.161.40, I2 = 0%, P < 0.00001), and serum albumin (ALB) levels (MD: 4.05, 95% CI: 3.02–5.09, I2 = 91%, P < 0.00001). TCM alone or in combination with Western medicine also reduced proteinuria levels (mean difference [MD]: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.30 to −0.79, I2 = 95%, P < 0.00001), serum creatinine (SCr) levels (MD: 7.47, 95% CI: 13.70 to −1.24, I2 = 97%, P = 0.02), and serum antibodies against M-type phospholipase A2 receptor levels (aPLA2Rab) (MD: 19.24, 95% CI: 33.56 to −4.93, I2 = 87%, P = 0.008). Moreover, the efficacy of combined TCM and Western medicine is superior to that of Western medicine alone in reducing the incidence of infection, hepatotoxicity, and thrombosis. Although the primary and secondary outcomes were consistent, the evidence was generally moderate.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that TCM alone or in combination with Western medicine may be a feasible alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of IMN. Nevertheless, additional, rigorously designed, high-quality, and extensive clinical trials are imperative to provide substantial evidence regarding the effectiveness of TCM in managing IMN.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic fatigue is a predominant symptom of post COVID-19 condition, or long COVID. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) for fatigue post COVID-19 infection.
Methods
Ten English and Chinese language databases and grey literature were searched up to 12 April 2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Cochrane “Risk of bias” (RoB) tool was applied. Evidence certainty was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Effect estimates were presented as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Thirteen RCTs with 1632 participants were included. One RCT showed that Bufei Huoxue herbal capsules reduced fatigue (n=129, MD -14.90, 95%CI -24.53 to -5.27), one RCT reported that Ludangshen herbal liquid lowered fatigue (n=184, MD -1.90, 95%CI -2.38 to -1.42), and the other one RCT shown that fatigue disappearance rate was higher with Ludangshen herbal liquid (n=184, RR 4.19, 95%CI 2.06 to 8.53). Compared to traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation (TCM-rahab) alone, one RCT showed that fatigue symptoms were lower following Qingjin Yiqi granules plus TCM-rehab (n=388, MD -0.48, 95%CI -0.50 to -0.46). Due to concerns with RoB and/or imprecision, the certainty in this evidence was low to very low. No serious adverse events was reported.
Conclusions
Limited evidence suggests that various TCIM interventions might reduce post COVID-19 fatigue. Larger, high quality RCTs of longer duration are required to confirm these preliminary findings.

Accurately identifying Chinese herbal medicine is crucial for quality control and prescription compounding verification. However, with many Chinese herbal medicines and some with similar appearances but different therapeutic effects, achieving precise identification is a challenging task. Traditional manual identification methods have certain limitations, including labor-intensive, inefficient. Deep learning techniques for Chinese herbal medicine identification can enhance accuracy, improve efficiency and lower coats. However, few high-quality Chinese herbal medicine datasets are currently available for deep learning applications. To alleviate this problem, this study constructed a dataset (Dataset 1) containing 3,384 images of 20 common Chinese herbal medicine fruits through web crawling. All images are annotated by TCM experts, making them suitable for training and testing Chinese herbal medicine identification methods. Furthermore, this study establishes another dataset (Dataset 2) of 400 images by taking pictures using smartphones to provide materials for the practical efficacy evaluation of Chinese herbal medicine identification methods. The two datasets form a Ningbo Traditional Chinese Medicine Chinese Herb Medicine (NB-TCM-CHM) Dataset. In Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, each type of Chinese medicine herb is stored in a separate folder, with the folder named after its name. The dataset can be used to develop Chinese herbal medicine identification algorithms based on deep learning and evaluate the performance of Chinese herbal medicine identification methods.}

The nature of Chinese medicine is a unique index to measure its efficacy. Generally, treating the hot syndrome with cold nature medicine and vice versa. Ginseng medicines, a renowned Chinese medicine known for its qi tonifying action, encompasses various herbal materials such as ginseng, red ginseng, and black ginseng (GS, RG, and BG, respectively), ginseng leaves (GL), and American ginseng (AG), which exhibited different natures, thought contained similar ginsenosides. This traditional effect of GS and RG “reinvigorate the pulse for relieving qi depletion”. It is closely linked to anti-heart failure (HF), HF is a clinical manifestation of deficiency of “heart-qi”. However, the elucidation of the mechanism underlying the anti-HF effects of ginseng medicines with different natures remains a significant challenge.
Aim of the study
To elucidate pharmacological mechanisms underlying the effect of ginseng medicines on HF, and to identify biomarkers associated with their various natures. Furthermore, it provides the basis for the different applications of ginseng medicines with various natures.
Materials and methods
This study established a rat model of HF induced by isoproterenol (ISO) combined with a specific diet. Four representative hot/cold herbs were selected as compared references for the medicine natures. The divergent effects of these herbs on the HF model were investigated by analyzing RNA-seq data to identify genes expressed differentially. Additionally, pathways associated with medicine natures were obtained using KEGG. Furthermore, UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS, as well as ELISA, were used to measure indexes associated with the nervous system, energy metabolisms, and endocrinology systems, such as BNP, CK, IL-1, T3, T4, cAMP, cGMP, AD, adrenal hormones (DOC, CORT, and COR), progestogens (pregnenolone, P, 17-OH-PR, and 17-OH-P), androgens (DHEA, A4, and T), and estrogens hormones (E2).
Results
All ginseng medicines demonstrated varying levels of efficacy in alleviating HF and GS exhibited a significant protective effect on HF. The ginseng medicines with qi tonifying primarily achieve their effect by enhancing the levels of adrenal hormones (DOC, CORT, and COR), T4, elevation of cAMP/cGMP, and activation of AchE. Warm nature qi tonifying ginseng medicines increased the levels of 17-OH-PR and P while decreasing 17-OH-P and the ratio of E2/T. On the other hand, cold nature qi tonifying ginseng medicines decreased the levels of A4 and T while increasing the ratio of E2/T.
Conclusion
Overall, the effects of warm nature ginseng medicines are stronger on HF compared to cold nature ginseng medicines. Our research firstly reported that the E2/T ratio, progestogens (17-OH-PR, 17-OH-P, and P), and androgens (A4 and T) have been identified as significant biomarkers for discerning the mechanism differences of ginseng medicines with differences natures in treatment of HF.}

Background
Indonesia is making significant strides toward achieving universal health coverage, which involves providing free access to essential medicines. This study examines the availability of essential medicine in primary health centres (PHCs) across Indonesia, the reasons why medicines are unavailable, and the extent to which communities have access to alternative dispensing points.
Methods
Enumerators visited each of the 9831 PHCs in all 514 districts to assess the availability of 60 essential medicines and identify reasons for any absent medicines. We correlated the results with the national village census to assess the relationship between availability, poverty, and access to alternative dispensing points.
Findings
Medicine availability varied greatly. The median availability for 17 priority medicines was 82%, while 58% of the broader selection of 60 essential medicines was present. The availability of maternal and childcare medicines was highest (73%) and lowest for mental health (42%). The main reasons for absence were that medicines were deemed unnecessary (46%) or not supplied (38%). The Java/Bali region had the highest medicines availability, and rural areas in Eastern Indonesia had the lowest. In these districts, the population is financially struggling, most dependent on free medicines from public providers, and had the least access to alternative dispensing points.
Interpretation
The availability of priority medicines in PHCs is relatively high, while public-paid prices are low by international standards. To improve availability of all essential medicines, the government should prioritize areas with the highest need, increase funding for PHCs in remote areas, and implement transparent monitoring of medicines availability.
Funding

Persian medicine is a holistic medical school with deep roots. It has a high educational, research, and therapeutic capacity and has been the focus of Iran's general health policies in recent years. Futures studies aid policymakers and health managers in creating normative scenarios and developing action plans using various techniques. This study aimed to identify important drivers and factors that affect the future of the Persian medicine system.
Method
This qualitative research was conducted with a futures studies approach, using the Cross-Impact Analysis (CIA) in three main steps. The first and second steps were conducted using interviews and focus group discussions. In the first step, 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with Persian medicine experts to identify all factors affecting the future of Persian medicine. In the second step, we held three focus group discussions with 9 interviewees from step one with national-level influence to determine the influence and dependence of each factor. The third step was performed using the matrix CIA and MICMAC to identify the key factors affecting the future of Persian medicine.
Results
Sixty five variables affecting the future of Persian medicine were identified, 36 related to the health system, and 29 to external factors. Factors such as globalization, knowledge-based economy, the spread of non-communicable and chronic diseases, as well as people's views and attitudes towards Persian medicine, are considered key drivers and variables that will affect the future of the Persian medicine system. The Iranian development plans as a two-dimensional and risk factor are crucial in establishing Persian medicine.
Conclusion
The future of the Persian medicine system is relatively stable. The pattern of the Iranian development plans is considered the most important two-faceted factor as a risk factor in the establishment of the Persian medicine system. It is suggested that the position of the Persian medicine system in the Iranian development plans be made more prominent.}

Furthermore, we innovatively establish the logit regression system to identify the key factors contributing to these bubbles, representing a significant contribution to the field. The quantitative analyses reveal the following key insights: First, seven bubbles existed in the Chinese herbal medicine market from January 2007 to September 2023, consistent with the bubble theory that assumes the existence of expectation and intangible components in the price formation of Chinese herbal medicines. Second, it could be found that speculation and climate factors would cause irrational prosperity in the Chinese herbal medicine market, whereas the former's effect is larger and more significant than that of the latter. Third, the periodical boom and bust episodes in this market are undriven by the pandemic factor. Against the backdrop of frequent occurrences of Chinese herbal medicine bubbles, these conclusions would put forward valuable recommendations for China to promote the health and stable development of the Chinese herbal medicine market.}

abstract = {Background
Pharmacist prescribing has been introduced in several countries as a strategy to improve access to health care and medicines. However, the direct impacts of pharmacist prescribing on medicines access, and the overall accessibility of pharmacist prescribing services, are not well known.
Objectives
This systematic review aimed to assess the direct impacts of pharmacist prescribing on medicines access, and the accessibility of pharmacist prescribing services, in community and primary care settings.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL were searched for studies published in English between 01 January 2003 to 15 June 2023. Both quantitative and qualitative primary studies were included if they described pharmacist prescribing in a primary care setting. Outcomes included findings related to access to medicines as a result of pharmacist prescribing (primary outcome), and access to pharmacist prescribing services overall (secondary outcome). Narrative synthesis of outcomes was undertaken.
Results
A total of 47 studies were included from four countries (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand). Thirteen studies provided evidence that pharmacist prescribing may improve medicines access in several ways, including: increasing the proportion of eligible people receiving medicines, increasing the number of overall dispensed prescriptions, or reducing time to receipt of treatment. The remainder of the included studies reported on the accessibility of pharmacist prescribing services. Published studies highlight that pharmacist prescribers practicing in community settings are generally accessible, with pharmacist prescribers viewed by patients as easy and convenient to consult. There was limited evidence about the affordability of pharmacy prescribing services, and a number of potential equity issues were observed, including reduced access to pharmacist prescribers in more socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and those with greater proportions of populations at risk of health inequities, such as culturally and linguistically diverse communities.
Conclusions
This systematic review found that pharmacist prescribing services were both highly accessible and beneficial in improving access to medicines. However, measures of medicines access varied, and few studies included direct measures of medicines access as an outcome of pharmacist prescribing, highlighting a need for future studies to incorporate direct measures of medicines access when assessing the impact of pharmacist prescribing services.}

Classic randomized controlled trial design provides information about the effectiveness of a treatment at population level. In clinical practice based on precision medicine, we seek study designs that provide estimates accounting for individual patients’ demographics and context. Integrative medicine has a strong emphasis on personalization, and there is a pressing need for advancements in trial design to support clinical decisions.
Discussion
To enhance the generalizability and implementation of research evidence, study designs first need to mimic the real-world from both the clinicians’ and patients’ perspectives, which could be optimized based on stakeholder analysis. Previous stakeholder analyzes showed that the lack of personalization in clinical trial design is a key challenge for the adoption of evidence clinically. Variations of randomized controlled trial design including better-powered and better-designed subgroup analysis, pragmatic design, the N-of-1 cross-over design, and adaptive design have been introduced to personalize clinical trials. Each of these variations has unique advantages, assumptions and limitations. Stratified randomization can be used to divide a disease population into subgroups according to different schools of theory to match with the corresponding treatment, while preserving the generalizability to general readership. Patient-level meta-analysis can improve the power and precision of subgroup analysis. Enrichment design can increase the efficiency of a trial in detecting treatment effect(s) and in mimicking actual clinical use. Practical issues, including bias control and assessment in pragmatic trials, and N-of-1 trials are also discussed with recent trials as examples. We suggest strategies to maximize the validity and translation potential of clinical trials in integrative medicine with pragmatic or personalized design.
Conclusion
Variations of randomized controlled trial design improve the precision of estimates at patient level, which should be carefully considered in the trial design of integrative medicine according to the context of the future application of evidence.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Chinese patent medicine (CPM) is a type of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that utilizes Chinese medicinal materials as its raw ingredients. Following the principles of TCM theory, it undergoes specific processing techniques to create various dosage forms for the prevention and treatment of diseases. The current CPM guidelines, both domestically and internationally, are constrained by limitations in methodological quality and reporting, which do not adequately address the requirements of the majority of clinicians and patients.
Objective
To evaluate the methodological rigor and reporting quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in CPM, aiming to assess their current quality and provide recommendations for improving guideline development.
Methods
The study utilized the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE Ⅱ) tool and the Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare for Traditional Chinese Medicine (RIGHT for TCM) checklist to evaluate the methodological rigor and reporting quality of CPM guidelines. After the training session, the four investigators were divided into two groups to evaluate the guidelines of patent Chinese medicine included in this study based on the aforementioned criteria. In case of any discrepancies, a secondary analysis was conducted by all four researchers under the guidance of two clinical experts, ensuring an impartial evaluation outcome. Average score or average reporting rate were calculated for each domain.
Results
A total of 32 CPM guidelines that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The AGREE Ⅱ yielded an average score of 67.2%. The domain scores were as follows: scope and purpose (93.3%), stakeholder involvement (50.1%), rigor of development (76.8%), clarity of presentation (79.4%), applicability (40.1%), and editorial independence (63.6%). The average reporting rate of the RIGHT for TCM checklist was 70.0%, with the reporting rates for the seven domains as follows: basic information (94.2;), background (87.9%), evidence (97.5%), recommendation (57.5%), review and quality assurance (11.4%), funding and declaration and management of interests (26.6%), and other information (68.8%).
Conclusions
The methodological and reporting quality of CPGs for CPM have been deemed acceptable since 2020. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in enhancing the reporting quality to provide clinicians and patients with more effective and comprehensive guidance. Additionally, it may be beneficial to develop a comprehensive reporting checklist specifically tailored for CPM guideline development.}

To determine whether activity on Twitter was correlated with increasing impact factor (IF) among 6 orthopaedic sports medicine journals.
Methods
Twitonomy software was used to collect account activity for the American Journal of Sports Medicine; Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery; Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy; Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery; Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine; and Sports Health. Data from 2000 to 2020 were collected. Each journal’s annual IF score was collected via scijournal.org. A multivariate regression model was used to predict the influence of different Twitter metrics on IF from 2012 to 2019. The journal name, number of tweets, and interaction of the two were used to predict IF. Additionally, Pearson correlation was used to assess correlations between Twitter account metrics and IF.
Results
Over the study period, all IFs increased, with the exception of that for American Journal of Sports Medicine. The effect size between number of tweets and IF was not the same for each journal. For every additional tweet, American Journal of Sports Medicine increased its IF by 0.001 (P = .18). Sports Health and Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine increased their IF by 0.01 (P = .002) and 0.022 (P < .001), respectively. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy would expect a decrease in its IF by 0.004 (P = .55) and Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery and Arthroscopy would increase its IF by 0.002 (P = .71) and 0.001 (P = .99), but this was not significant. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between annual tweets and IF across all journals.
Conclusions
Markers of Twitter account activity, specifically the number of annual tweets, were predictive of an increase in IF among the orthopedic sports medicine journals included in this study.
Clinical Relevance
The findings of this study may allow orthopaedic sports medicine journals to make more effective, targeted, and productive use of their social media accounts to reach a broader audience, increase their influence, and increase the IF of their journal.}

abstract = {Background
The retraction of articles stands as the most significant mechanism employed to uphold the integrity of science, particularly in flawed studies.
Objectives
This study aims to explore the reasons for article retractions in the field of emergency medicine and elucidate the problems arising from such retractions. The goal is to identify parameters in retracted articles that compromise scientific knowledge and raise awareness.
Material and methods
Retracted articles within the emergency medicine category were analyzed and assessed using the Web of Science database. The study sought to address the following questions: 1. In which year or years were the most articles retracted? 2. In which journals were the retracted articles published? 3. What is the distribution of topics in retracted articles? 4. What are the reasons for the retraction of articles? 5. What is the time difference and citation count between the publication and retraction years of the articles?
Results
The study delved into reasons for article retractions, types of retracted articles, and other relevant factors. A total of 61 retracted articles were examined and analyzed, revealing an increasing trend in the rate of article retractions over the years. The majority of retracted articles occurred in 2023, with the highest retraction rate identified in the “Emergency Medicine International” journal. On average, articles were retracted 356 days after publication. Reasons for retracted articles included concerns related to data, authorship issues, plagiarism, duplication, and biased or fraudulent peer review.
Conclusions
This study provided an examination of retracted articles in the field of emergency medicine, highlighting a noteworthy increase in retractions due to various reasons. Despite retractions, it was observed that the citation counts of retracted articles increased. The growing number of retracted articles and frequent citations pose potential dangers from a scientific perspective, as citing retracted articles damages scientific integrity. The study underscores the importance of understanding the reasons for retracted articles and preventing the spread of such incidents in emergency medicine literature. The results, analyzed within various variables, indicate the need for further research and solutions, guiding future research efforts and contributing to the literature.}

Each condition possesses strong histopathologic associations, including glomerular obsolescence or acute tubular necrosis, respectively. Despite such characterization, there remains wide variation in patient outcomes and treatment responses. Precision medicine efforts, as exemplified by the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP), have begun to establish evolving, spatially anchored, cellular and molecular atlases of the cell types, states, and niches of the kidney in health and disease. The KPMP atlas provides molecular context for CKD and AKI disease drivers and will help define subtypes of disease that are not readily apparent from canonical functional or histopathologic characterization but instead are appreciable through advanced clinical phenotyping, pathomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic interrogation of kidney biopsy samples. This perspective outlines the structure of the KPMP, its approach to the integration of these diverse datasets, and its major outputs relevant to future patient care.}

abstract = {Objectives
Public health physicians (PHPs) are trained in both medicine and public health, yet practice models in each of these fields incompletely describe their work. A model of practice for public health physicians would better enable training and professional development in the specialty. The objective of this study was to develop an empirically grounded method of the practice of public health medicine by public health physicians.
Study design
This was designed as a constructivist grounded theory (CGT) study. Semistructured interviews with 18 public health physicians in Canada were conducted over the course of 1 year.
Methods
Transcribed interviews were coded in three stages (line-by-line, focused, and theoretical). Constant comparison, theoretical sampling, reflective and analytic memos, and team discussion on reflexivity were used to ensure rigor and the proper application of CGT methods.
Results
The key finding of this study is the population-centered medical method (POP-CMM), an empirically grounded method of PHP practice. In this model, PHPs bring values, knowledge, and stances to their practice of medicine with populations as patients. They work to diagnose and intervene on public health issues, with a focus on prevention and systems. Essential to this work is knowledge sharing and relationship building between physicians and populations.
Conclusions
POP-CMM represents a method of practice for PHPs. Further exploration of this method in other countries and systems would bring insight into PHP practice globally. The model has important connections to the practice of medicine and presents the possibility of developing a general model of physician practice for a range of patients, from individuals to populations.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
The financial impact of cancer medicines on health systems is not well known. We describe temporal trends in expenditure on cancer medicines within the single-payer health system of Ontario, Canada, and the extent of clinical benefit these treatments offer.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, we identified cancer medicines and expenditures from formularies and costing databases (the New Drug Funding Program, Ontario Drug Benefit Program, and The High-Cost Therapy Funding Program) during 10 consecutive years (April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2022) in Ontario, Canada. For intravenous medicines, we applied the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) to identify expenditures associated with substantial clinical benefit. We also identified treatments associated with improved overall survival or quality of life.
Findings
69 intravenous and 98 oral or injectable medicines were funded during 2012–22. Annual expenditure on cancer medicines increased by approximately 15% per year during 2012–22; the increase was more rapid in the most recent 4 years. Total expenditure on cancer medicines in the 2021–22 financial year was CA$1·7 billion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors were the single biggest expense by class ($284 million), representing 17% of the entire cancer medicine annual budget. Drugs with the highest individual costs were lenalidomide ($178 million) and pembrolizumab ($163 million), each accounting for around 10% of the entire budget. 29 (76%) of 38 indications eligible for ESMO-MCBS scoring met the threshold for substantial clinical benefit. Eight (21%) indications had no randomised trial evidence of improved overall survival, and only four (11%) were associated with improved QOL. $346 million (67% of the expenditure on intravenous cancer medicines) was spent on drugs that improved median overall survival by more than 6 months, $82 million (16%) was spent on medicines with overall survival gains of 3–6 months, and $32 million (6%) was spent on medicines with overall survival gains of less than 3 months. $53 million (10%) was spent on medicines with no established improvement in overall survival.
Interpretation
Costs of cancer medicines to the Canadian health system are increasing rapidly. Most funded indications met thresholds for substantial clinical benefit and two-thirds of the expenditure were for medicines that improve survival by more than 6 months. Whether this cost trajectory can be maintained in a sustainable, equitable, high-quality health system is unclear. Efforts are needed to ensure the price of medicines with substantial benefit is affordable and funding of treatments with very modest benefit might need to be re-assessed, particularly when alternative supportive and palliative therapies are available.
Funding
None.}

Sustainability can be defined as the state in which consumption or depletion do not exceed regeneration. It can further be considered in five dimensions: environmental, economic, social, human resources, and ecological.
Key findings
There are a number of key issues that threaten sustainability across nuclear medicine clinical and research practices, and across the five dimensions of sustainability there is a requirement for compromise between conflicting priorities. Nonetheless, the field of nuclear medicine benefits from an inherent culture of innovation and forethought which fosters adaptation in order to achieve sustainability.
Conclusion
The principles of sustainability are particularly challenging to navigate due to resource scarcity in nuclear medicine associated with both workforce shortages and supply disruptions. Specific challenges and adaptations are outlined for each of the five dimensions of sustainability.
Implications for practice
There are opportunities for improving sustainability of nuclear medicine practice although success is reliant on a deeper understanding of the interplay across the five dimensions of sustainability.}

abstract = {Introduction
Access to medicines remains elusive in low- and middle-income countries, including those belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Drug regulatory harmonization has been seen as a way to increase medicine access by reducing drug costs and improving regulatory efficiency and reliability in the region. This paper aims to review the various harmonization initiatives of ASEAN and evaluate the potential benefits of an ASEAN Medicines Agency, the challenges for regional harmonization, and recommendations towards achieving these goals.
Findings
Although several initiatives have been started decades prior, the most current initiatives include the ASEAN Pharmaceutical Regulatory Policy and the subsequent adoption of the ASEAN Pharmaceutical Regulatory Framework in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Despite these efforts, several challenges remain, such as a longer regional decision-making process, the highly individualized implementation of initiatives and disparity in laboratory and regulatory capacity between member states, and the complexities of Halal certification.
Conclusion
ASEAN must take advantage of its strengths as a region, ensure mutual cooperation of its members, and utilize existing partnerships locally and internationally. Furthermore, a central ASEAN Medicines Agency may help further facilitate these initiatives. While significant progress has been made by member states, a consolidated body, such as an ASEAN Medicines Agency, may assist in speeding up harmonization efforts in the region which may ultimately lead to equitable access to medicines.}

Drawn from qualitative interviews with medical providers in Tennessee, USA conducted between October 2022 and December 2022, this study shows how medical providers often must make medical decisions based on legal risks as opposed to standards of care. This is particularly significant as malpractice insurance does not cover criminal charges. In states with abortion bans, often hastily implemented and subject to changes by lawmakers, medical providers are now practicing a new kind of defensive medicine in an effort to protect themselves from legal threats. We call this hesitant medicine, where providers often experience a tension between their own legal protection and the well-being of their patients, making them hesitant to provide necessary abortion care. This has serious, far-reaching consequences. We focus on three distinct arenas impacted by this new form of defensive medicine, specifically: providers' decision-making around patient care, impacts on patient relationships, and finally, what we call the ultimate defense, leaving states with abortion bans to move to states with fewer legal risks. We conclude with commentary on potential ways to reduce the negative impacts of these trends.}

abstract = {Background
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is primarily managed by chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Traditional medicine is widely used worldwide due to availability, affordability, wide applicability and accessibility. While potential for traditional medicines in management of cancer is well-documented, there is limited literature that collates traditional knowledge and contemporary herbal medicine practice. To collate available evidence on herbal medicines used in the management of all cancers from traditional world-wide sources, and the management of lung and colorectal cancers in contemporary practice. Medicinal plants with anti-cancer properties were identified following JBI methodology for scoping reviews through searches of the following sources: Trove, Archive.Org, and Henriette's herbal medicine page (traditional texts), book list available from World Naturopathic Federation white paper (contemporary naturopathic texts), and in PubMed, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, AMED and JSTOR (case studies). Of the 1973 citations retrieved, 38 traditional texts, 3 contemporary naturopathic texts and 10 case studies were included in the review. The traditional texts (n = 110) noted the highest number of different anti-cancer herbal species, followed by case reports (n = 52) and contemporary texts (n = 13). This review identified various herbal medicines used to treat cancer traditionally which is distinct to those found in contemporary use. Moreover, this review identified the use of herbs from other native medical systems around the world in the contemporary naturopathic practice and individual case management. The evidence presented in the review could be utilized in pre-clinical settings to research traditional preparations of herbs.}
