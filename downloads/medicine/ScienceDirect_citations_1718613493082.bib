Introduction
Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that degrades patients' quality of life and adversely affects mental health. Since steroid therapy (ST) has limited efficacy and a risk of recurrence, East Asian herbal medicine (EAHM) combined with ST has been suggested as an alternative treatment. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted on the efficacy of EAHM combined with ST in AA treatment; however, the efficacy of EAHM combined with ST and the treatment effects of ST alone have not yet been compared. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination of ST and EAHM compared to ST alone in the treatment of AA.
Methods
We searched 10 databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, KoreaMed, Korean Medical Database (KMBASE), Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), ScienceON, and Korea Science. Bias was independently assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0), and meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager (Revman) 5.4.1 with the application of random-effect models. The primary outcome was defined as the cure rate.
Results
Fifteen studies were selected, and 1,119 participants were included in the study. According to the results of the meta-analysis, a higher cure rate (RR 1.50, 95 % CI : 1.31, 1.71, P<0.00001, I2=0 %), a higher total efficacy rate (modified Total Efficacy Rate 1 (mTER1); (RR 1.10, 95 % CI: 1,06, 1.15, P < 0.00001, I2=0 %), modified Total Efficacy Rate 2 (mTER2); (RR 1.09, 95 % CI: 1.03, 1.16, P = 0.006, I2=0 %)), and a lower recurrence rate (RR 0.28, 95 % CI: 0.16, 0.48, P<0.00001, I2=0 % %) were confirmed in the ST with EAHM group than in the ST group. Low IFN-γ levels and high IL-10 levels were identified in the ST combined with EAHM group. No serious adverse effects were observed during treatment.
Conclusions
Compared to ST alone in AA treatment, the combination treatment of ST and EAHM may effectively and safely increase the cure and total efficacy rates and may lower the recurrence rate. However, to strengthen the basis of this review, higher quality RCTs must be performed.

To formulate the most current, evidence-based recommendations for the role of medication, physical medicine, and rehabilitation in the management of acute low back pain lasting <4 weeks.
Methods
A systematic literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar databases was performed from 2012 to 2022 using the search terms “acute low back pain,” “drugs,” “bed rest,” “physical medicine,” rehabilitation.” Standardized screening criteria resulted in a total of 39 articles that were analyzed, including 16 RCTs, 8 prospective studies, 6 retrospective studies, and 9 systematic reviews. This up-to-date information was reviewed and presented at two separate meetings of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Spine Committee. Two rounds of the Delphi method were utilized to vote on the statements and arrive at a positive or negative consensus.
Results and conclusion
The WFNS Spine Committee finalized twelve recommendation guidelines on the role of medication, physical medicine and rehabilitation in the management of acute LBP. We advocate for a uniform approach to the treatment of these patients, including proper patient education and utilizing drugs with proven efficacy and minimal side effects. First-line pharmacologic agents are acetaminophen and NSAIDs; muscle relaxants can be used for spasms and pain reduction, and opioids should be minimized. Continued activity, rather than bed rest, is recommended, and lumbar spine orthotics may be used to reduce pain and augment functional status. Thermotherapy, cryotherapy, TENs, spinal manipulative therapy, and acupuncture may all be used as adjuncts to improve acute LBP.}

abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese medicine injection for Activating Blood Circulation (TCMi-ABC), which exhibits comparable anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects, is commonly used as an adjuvant treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in China.
Objective
The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of TCMi-ABC in combination with conventional western medicine in reducing mortality associated with AMI.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CBM, WanFang Data, and CNKI databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of TCMi-ABC (including Danhong injection, sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate injection, salvia miltiorrhiza ligupyrazine injection, and puerarin injection) for the treatment of AMI were included. The search included studies published from the inception of the databases up to December 2022. Two authors independently screened RCTs, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 17.0. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach.
Results
A total of 52 RCTs involving 5363 patients were included in the analysis, none of which described independent testing of the purity or potency of the TCMi-ABC product used. 19/52 reported random sequence generation. All RCTs lack adequate description of allocation concealment. 51/52 failed to assess blinding. The meta-analysis results demonstrated that the combined application of TCMi-ABC, compared with conventional western medicine treatment alone, significantly reduced in-hospital mortality in AMI patients [RR= 0.41, 95% CI (0.29, 0.59), P < 0.05], decreased the incidence of malignant arrhythmia [RR= 0.40, 95% CI (0.26, 0.61), P < 0.05], and increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [MD= 5.53, 95% CI (3.81, 7.26), P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups (P > 0.05). The GRADE evidence quality classification indicated that the evidence for in-hospital mortality, malignant arrhythmia, and adverse events was of moderate quality, while the evidence for LVEF was of low quality.
Conclusion
TCMi-ABC demonstrates additional clinical value in reducing mortality and the risk of malignant arrhythmia in patients with AMI. However, further validation of these findings is warranted through high-quality clinical trials due to methodological weaknesses in randomization, blinding, allocation concealment, and insufficient assessing for the purity/potency of herbs and the gram amount of active constituents.

abstract = {Introduction
Diabetes mellitus poses major health risks due to increased vulnerability to infections stemming from weakened immune systems and physiological complications. With antimicrobial resistance worsening prognosis, diabetic infections affecting multiple body systems present critical treatment challenges. This review examines the antimicrobial properties of alternative medicines used in the management of diabetic infections and addresses the apparent research gap in this area.
Method
A comprehensive literature search was conducted on databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar) using specified keywords. Exclusion criteria removed non-relevant articles, resulting in the selection of articles published between 2012 and 2023, focusing on medicinal plants, polyherbal formulations, and antimicrobial effects against pathogens associated with diabetic infections.
Results
The study revealed a significant research gap regarding the use of alternative medicines for diabetic infection treatment, as only 14 articles published between 2012 and 2023 were relevant to this review. Selected articles primarily addressed wound infections (39 %), diabetic foot ulcers (28 %), foot infections (17 %), urinary tract 11 %), and skin infections (5 %). Commonly used medicinal plants include Curcuma longa, Azadirachta indica, Zingiber officinale, and Glycyrrhiza glabra among others. The alternative medicines demonstrated significant antimicrobial potential against common microorganisms associated with diabetic infections, especially Gram-positive bacteria.
Discussion
This review shows the potential of alternative medicines in the management of diabetic infections. This efficacy was attributed to diverse secondary metabolites present in medicinal plants, offering promising prospects for novel antimicrobial agents. Given the susceptibility of diabetic patients to microbial infections, further investigation into the efficacy of medicinal plants for the treatment of infections in diabetic patients is essential. Further research is also imperative to validate and standardize these therapies and conduct clinical trials to evaluate their safety and efficacy in diabetic infection management.}

[Objective]
To analyze the current status and development trends of the patents of spleen-invigorating health food with the homology of medicine and food in China, and to provide ideas and references for the research and development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) spleen-invigorating health food with the homology of medicine and food.
[Methods]
The State Administration for Market Regulation website’s “Special Food Information Query Platform” and the incoPat global patent database were searched in this study. Based on the methods of bibliometrics, the registered health food and patents related to spleen-invigorating health food with the homology of medicine and food in China were sorted out. Furthermore, the research and development numbers, provinces, institutions, technology and efficacy classification, major drugs, active ingredients and others of invigorating spleen health food in China were analyzed, and filtered patent data were visualized and analyzed by R programming language and CytoScape software.
[Results]
A total of 285 patents of health food with the homology of medicine and food for invigorating spleen were included and analyzed. From 2012, the patent registration numbers of these spleen-invigorating health food with the homology of medicine and food increased significantly in China. Over the past 20 years, the top five provinces in terms of patent disclosures were Guangdong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Guangxi. It was found that the technical efficacy of over 20 patents was described as “immune enhancement” “digestion” “disease prevention”, etc. Patent applications were mainly aimed at the research and development of the preservation of food or ingredients, the specific therapeutic activity of compounds, and pharmaceutical preparations, which were led by corporation research and development registrations, and supplemented by applications from research institutions and individuals. Among the 285 patents, the top 10 raw materials of spleen-invigorating health food with the homology of medicine and food were Shanyao (Dioscoreae Rhizoma), Fuling (Poria), Shanzha (Crataegi Fructus), Baizhu (Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma), Chenpi (Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium), Dazao (Jujubae Fructus), Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma), Fengmi (Mel), Maiya (Hordei Fructus Germinatus), and Dangshen (Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma). The main functions were to nourish spleen and replenish Qi, invigorate spleen and benefit lungs, nourish blood and promote fluid production, and nourish spleen and stomach.
[Conclusion]
The main drug composition and functional components of spleen-invigorating health food with the homology of medicine and food are relatively clear, and the technical effects of invigorating the spleen and stomach, eliminating accumulation of food, and enhancing immunity are highly targeted. This paper provides evidence for the research and development, mechanism research, and process improvement of spleen-invigorating health food with the homology of medicine and food in the future.}

The long history of clinical experience in China have confirmed the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating prostate cancer (PCa). Until now, several bioactive compounds with anti-PCa potential, such as curcumin, gallic acid, and quercetin, have been extracted from TCM. Recent studies have shown that encapsulating these TCM bioactive compounds into nano-delivery system enhanced their bioavailability and improved their ability to target PCa tumors. Purpose: This review aims to summarize the anti-PCa effects and molecular mechanisms of TCM bioactive compounds and discuss the clinical application prospects and future research trends of nano-delivery system based on these compounds.
Methods
Literatures focusing on the treatment of PCa using traditional Chinese medicine compounds via nano-drug delivery system were searched from Electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus until December 2023.
Results
Polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, and quinones exhibit anti-PCa effects through various pathways. Notably, compounds like curcumin, gallic acid, quercetin, and tanshinone have been extensively studied in nano-delivery systems for anti-PCa purpose. Nano-delivery systems enhance the biological activity of free compounds and reduce toxic side effects, as well. Commonly used nanomaterials for delivering TCM compounds include polymer nanomaterials, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and niosomes.
Conclusion
Research on nano-delivery systems for TCM bioactive compounds holds promising prospects for anti-PCa therapy. However, extensive clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these nanodrugs.}

Gynecological disorders have the characteristics of high incidence and recurrence rate, which sorely affects female's health. Since ancient times, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially tonic medicine (TM), has been used to deal with gynecological disorders and has unique advantages in effectiveness and safety.
Aim of the review
In this article, we aim to summarize the research progress of TMs in-vivo and in-vitro, including their formulas, single herbs, and compounds, for gynecological disorders treatment in recent years, and to offer a reference for further research on the treatment of gynecological disorders and their clinical application in the treatment of TMs.
Materials and methods
Relevant information on the therapeutic potential of TMs against gynecological disorders was collected from several scientific databases including Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, Google Scholar and other literature sources.
Results
So far, there are 46 different formulas, 3 single herbs, and 24 compounds used in the treatment of various gynecological disorders such as premature ovarian failure, endometriosis breast cancer, and so on. Many experimental results have shown that TMs can regulate apoptosis, invasion, migration, oxidative stress, and the immune system. In addition, the effect of TMs in gynecological disorders treatment may be due to the regulation of VEGF, PI3K-AKT, MAPK, NF-κB, and other signaling pathways. Apparently, TMs play an active role in the treatment of gynecological disorders by regulating these signaling pathways.
Conclusion
TMs have a curative effect on the prevention and treatment of gynecological disorders. It could relieve and treat gynecological disorders through a variety of pathways. Therefore, the appropriate TM treatment program makes it more possible to treat gynecological disorders.}

Implementation science is the vehicle for ensuring that research evidence informs and shapes clinical practice. However, implementation models structured along linear and mechanistic lines are not necessarily aligned with the complexity of clinical practice. In this article we explore the development and value of a complexity informed implementation model primarily for use in traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine.
Discussion
Conventional linear mechanistic models of knowledge translation may be insufficient to address the needs of real-life clinical practice. Existing implementation models may pose particular challenges for use in traditional, integrative, and complementary systems of medicine due to their holistic orientation and perspective of human organisms as whole complex systems nested within other complex systems. This paper discusses how a complexity informed implementation model, non-linear in nature and founded on iterative processes, may better reflect the complex nature of the traditional, integrative, and complementary medicine clinical encounter and patient as a complex adaptive system.
Conclusion
The emergence of complexity science provides an opportunity to re-imagine implementation models and processes to support the translation of evidence into traditional, complementary, and integrative systems of medicine. We propose a complexity-informed implementation model to better meet the complex needs of real-life clinical practice.}

abstract = {Summary
Cardiometabolic disease is a major threat to global health. Precision medicine has great potential to help to reduce the burden of this common and complex disease cluster, and to enhance contemporary evidence-based medicine. Its key pillars are diagnostics; prediction (of the primary disease); prevention (of the primary disease); prognosis (prediction of complications of the primary disease); treatment (of the primary disease or its complications); and monitoring (of risk exposure, treatment response, and disease progression or remission). To contextualise precision medicine in both research and clinical settings, and to encourage the successful translation of discovery science into clinical practice, in this Series paper we outline a model (the EPPOS model) that builds on contemporary evidence-based approaches; includes precision medicine that improves disease-related predictions by stratifying a cohort into subgroups of similar characteristics, or using participants' characteristics to model treatment outcomes directly; includes personalised medicine with the use of a person's data to objectively gauge the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of therapeutics; and subjectively tailors medical decisions to the individual's preferences, circumstances, and capabilities. Precision medicine requires a well functioning system comprised of multiple stakeholders, including health-care recipients, health-care providers, scientists, health economists, funders, innovators of medicines and technologies, regulators, and policy makers. Powerful computing infrastructures supporting appropriate analysis of large-scale, well curated, and accessible health databases that contain high-quality, multidimensional, time-series data will be required; so too will prospective cohort studies in diverse populations designed to generate novel hypotheses, and clinical trials designed to test them. Here, we carefully consider these topics and describe a framework for the integration of precision medicine in cardiometabolic disease.}

Reproductive failure due to age, genetics, and diseases necessitates innovative solutions. While reproductive tissue transplantation has advanced, ongoing research seeks superior approaches. Biomaterials, bioengineering, and additive manufacturing, like 3D bioprinting, are harnessed to restore reproductive function. 3D bioprinting uses materials, cells, and growth factors to mimic natural tissues, proving popular for tissue engineering, notably in complex scaffold creation with cell distribution. The versatility which is brought to the reproductive medicine by 3D bioprinting allows more accurate and on-site applicability to various problems that are encountered in the field. Yet, in the literature, there is a gap of study encompassing the valuable applications of 3D bioprinting in reproductive medicine. This systematic review puts a perspective on the topic for better understanding and emphasizes on applications in several branches of reproductive medicine. Advancements span ovarian function restoration, endometrial regeneration, vaginal reconstruction, and male germ cell bioengineering. 3D bioprinting holds untapped potential in reproductive medicine.}

abstract = {Background
At present, many kinds of intervention and treatment methods for RD have been discussed, but there is still no set of RD prevention standard scheme in clinical practice.
Objective
To explore the clinical efficacy of RD patients treated with external Chinese medicine.
Methods
The trial was conducted by randomized control method.
Results
After 6 weeks and the end of radiotherapy, the number of skin defect cases and the rate of skin defect in the drug group were lower than those in the blank group. The three dimensions, total score and ECOG score of RD shindex in the drug group were lower than those in the blank group at 3, 4 and after treatment. The number of patients with symptom burden in the drug group was lower than that in the blank group at 1, 3 and 4 weeks after radiotherapy. None of the personnel in the drug group had adverse events related to drug use. The overall incidence of fever, radiation pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, bone marrow suppression and radiation oral mucositis in the drug group and the control group were 75.00% and 83.33% respectively.
Conclusion
RD patients treated with external Chinese medicine can prolong the time of skin damage and reduce the incidence of skin damage, and reduce the skin pain, burning sensation and mood of patients. In addition, it will not affect the quality of life of patients and has high-safety.}

This study aimed to explore the association of Traditional Medicine (TM) body constitution (BC) with BMI, which helps to find measures improving BC by intervening in BMI.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional design was conducted on first-year students at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City (UMP) from January 2023 to April 2023. All the participants were classified as BC types by the CCMQ standardized into Vietnamese. A Chi-square test and Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between TMBC types and BMI, using SPSS version 20.0.
Results
This survey enrolled 301 first-year University of Medicine and Pharmacy students in Ho Chi Minh city (55.1% were female and 44.9% were male). The prevalence of BMI levels was normal weight (49.2%), overweight-obesity (37.5%), and underweight (13.3%), respectively. The Balanced (Neutral) type was the highest (23.3%). The overweight-obesity group had associations with Phlegm-dampness and Qi-depression (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
The normal weight is the majority, nevertheless, overweight-obesity is increasing in the student community. Phlegm-dampness type and Qi-depression type are the risk factors for people having overweight-obesity.}

This case report details the unusual presentation of acute parkinsonism in a 66-year-old woman who had been ingesting black pills, an unidentified kind of traditional Chinese medicine, obtained from a pirate radio source. The patient displayed symptoms such as acute onset frequent falls, unsteady gait, and slow movements, prompting a detailed medical examination. The patient's neurological assessment revealed classic parkinsonian features, including mask face, cogwheel rigidity, and bradykinesia. Subsequent laboratory investigations disclosed an elevated blood mercury level (47 μg/L), and imaging studies, including 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT, confirmed bilateral putamina dysfunction consistent with secondary parkinsonism. Traditional medications of Parkinsonism provided minimal relief, leading to the introduction of chelation therapy with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), resulting in a significant improvement in symptoms following a 20-day course. The discussion emphasizes the distinctive clinical manifestations of organic and inorganic mercury poisoning, underscoring the delayed onset and central nervous system involvement in organic mercury toxicity. The unidentified black pills, known to exceed mercury standards, were identified as the likely source of mercury poisoning in this case. This report acknowledges the potential reversibility of certain causes of acute parkinsonism and highlights the importance of a thorough drug history and toxicology assessment in patients presenting with acute parkinsonism. This report also contributes to the existing understanding of mercury-induced parkinsonism and emphasizes the significance of timely intervention in managing similar cases.}

This research aims, firstly, to outline the possible factors of medicine counterfeiting; secondly, to propose a blockchain-based framework to prevent medicine counterfeiting; and thirdly, to evaluate the proposed framework. A content analysis and a semi-structured interview with the key personnel related to the medicine manufacturing and distribution system in Bangladesh were carried out to derive the current scenario of medicine counterfeit. Based on the interviews and content analysis, a set of use cases for preventing medicine counterfeiting in the context of Bangladesh was explored. The required features for developing a digital solution were extracted considering the derived use cases. A blockchain-based framework for preventing medicine counterfeit was proposed by adopting the extracted features. A prototype was developed based on the proposed framework, and an evaluation study was performed to evaluate the prototype. The evaluation study showed that the average block execution time is 201 ms, and the average block time is 482 ms. Again, the proposed framework was found secure, scalable, customer-oriented, and practical compared to other systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
Formularies of essential medicines, such as Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) and health emergency stockpiles, are intended to be always available, including in emergency situations, acting as important tools for access to medicines. The Emergency Medicines Buffer Stock (EMBS) in the United Kingdom (UK) was a stockpile of critical medicines managed by the UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). We propose a new methodology for selecting and including medicines in EMLs and health emergency stockpiles and empirically apply it for selecting medicines in the case of the UK EMBS.
Methods
We used Multi-Attribute Value Theory and Portfolio Decision Analysis to develop a three-phase methodological framework for medicines selection, involving: (i) the decision context definition and selection of evaluation criteria, (ii) the therapeutic area prioritisation, and (iii) the medicines value-for-money evaluation and product selection. The EMBS application took place in 2018–2019 and focused on therapeutic area prioritisation, involving primary data collection through expert interviews (n = 4), a workshop with DHSC decision-makers (n = 13), and an online survey with National Clinical Directors and relevant experts (n = 24). A Monte Carlo simulation supported therapeutic area prioritisation using the British National Formulary (BNF) classification.
Findings
Two criteria sets were selected for i) therapeutic area prioritisation, reflecting the value concerns of population need and shortage severity, and ii) medicines evaluation, reflecting magnitude of clinical benefit and supply vulnerability, among others. Primary evidence was collected for “national need” and “shortage severity”, based on which a “population health loss” index was developed. A total of 51 therapeutic areas were ranked using their index value while assessing the robustness of the ranking. The top ranked therapeutic area was antisecretory drugs and mucosal protectants, closely followed by diabetes drugs.
Conclusions
The methodological application generated a ranking of therapeutic areas based on expected “population health loss” index, while addressing evidence uncertainty. The methodology can be adapted for other EMLs and emergency stockpile contexts to inform medicines selection.}

Crossbow-medicine needle therapy (microneedle roller combined with crossbow-medicine) is one of the external treatment methods of Miao Medicine in China. It is a way of combining acupuncture with Chinese herbal medicine, which is widely used in clinical treatment of pain.
Aim of the study
To observe the transdermal absorption promoting effect of microneedle roller via transdermal administration, and to discuss the transdermal absorption characteristics and the safety of crossbow-medicine needle therapy.
Methods
Based on the determination of the content of the main components of crossbow-medicine prescription in our previous research, the present experiment was conducted in-vitro and in-vivo experiments and the skin of rats was used as the penetration barrier. For in-vitro experiment, the modified Franz diffusion cell method was used to determine the transdermal absorption rate and 24h cumulative transdermal absorption amount of the active ingredients of crossbow-medicine liquid. For in-vivo experiment, tissue homogenization was applied to compare the skin retention amount and plasma concentration of crossbow-medicine liquid absorbed at different time points via the aforementioned two modes of administration. Furthermore, the effect of crossbow-medicine needle on the morphological structure of rat skin stratum corneum was detected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The safety of crossbow-medicine needle therapy was evaluated according to the scoring criteria of the skin irritation test.
Results
1. In-vitro experiment: In the microneedle-roller group and crossbow-medicine liquid application group, the effect of transdermal delivery was identified in all the four ingredients of anabasine, chlorogenic acid, mesaconitine and hypaconitine. The 24h cumulative transdermal absorption amount and transdermal absorption rate of each ingredient in microneedle-roller group were significantly higher than those in crossbow-medicine liquid application group (all P < 0.05). 2. In-vivo experiment: Both microneedle-roller and crossbow-medicine liquid application could promote the transdermal absorption of the active ingredients of the drug in the skin and retain in the skin structure. After 8h of administration, the total retention amount of anabasine, chlorogenic acid, mesaconitine and hypaconitine in the skin of rats in the former group was significantly higher than that in the latter group (all P < 0.05). 3. HE staining: In the blank group, the stratum corneum showed an evenly zonal distribution on the active epidermis, and had a close connection with the epidermis, without exfoliation or cell dissociation of the stratum corneum. The crossbow-medicine liquid group had a relatively complete stratum corneum, with a small proportion of exfoliation or cell dissociation, loose arrangement and loose connection with the epidermis. In the microneedle-roller group, the skin had pore channels, and the stratum corneum was loose and exfoliated, which showed zonal distribution in a free state and a high degree of separation. The crossbow-medicine needle group had loose the stratum corneum, broken and exfoliated, which was separated from the active epidermis and showed zonal distribution in a free state. 4.Safety: No obvious erythema, edema and skin protuberance were observed in the skin of rats treated with microneedle roller, crossbow-medicine liquid and crossbow-medicine needle. Additionally, the skin irritative response score was 0.
Conclusion
Microneedle roller can promote the transdermal absorption of crossbow-medicine liquid, and crossbow-medicine needle therapy has good safety.}

abstract = {Introduction
Reliable systematic reviews are essential to inform clinical practice guidelines, policies and further research priorities in Africa. For systematic review findings to be trustworthy, they need to be conducted with methodological rigour and reported transparently. We assessed the methodological quality of systematic reviews published in African emergency medicine journals, comparing them to those published in international emergency medicine journals. Additionally, we describe the types of review literature published in the African journals.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional methodological study of systematic reviews published in selected African and international emergency medicine journals from 2012 to 2021. Studies were eligible if they were i) a systematic review on an emergency medicine topic, ii) published in one of the top five emergency medicine journals in the African region or internationally and iii) published between January 2012 and December 2021 in English or French. We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases and hand-searched selected journals. Two authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts independently and in duplicate. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer, using a standardised form, after completing a calibration exercise. We described the characteristics of systematic reviews and assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR II.
Results
We identified 34 (37%) African and 511 (54%) international systematic reviews from 92 and 948 review articles respectively across 10 journals. We included all 34 African and a random sample of 100 international systematic reviews. Methodological quality was low or critically low for all the African systematic reviews (n=34, 100%) and all but three international systematic reviews (n=97, 97%). The median number of critical domain weaknesses was 4 (IQR 4;5) and 2 (IQR 2;4) for African and international systematic reviews respectively. The most common weaknesses across both African and international systematic reviews were i) not establishing a priori review protocols, ii) unclear selection of study designs iii) not providing a list of excluded studies and iv) unclear reporting on funding sources for included studies.
Conclusion
Emergency medicine systematic reviews published in African and international journals are lacking in methodological quality. Reporting an a priori protocol, developing a comprehensive search strategy, appropriate evidence synthesis and adequate assessment of risk of bias, heterogeneity and evidence certainty may improve the quality of systematic reviews.}

To systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of integrated Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in elderly people.
Method
The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang Data and VIP Data databases were systematically searched from database inception to 30 June 2023 to identify cases of AML treatment with and without integrated Chinese and Western medicine. Fixed- and random-effect models were used to pool the main results, and the pooled risk ratio (RR) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) was used as the effect indicator.
Results
Eleven randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 828 patients were finally included. The meta-analysis results showed that the overall response efficiency of integrated Chinese and Western medicine in treating myeloid leukaemia in elderly people was better than that of Western medicine alone (RR = 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.13, 1.33, p ＜ 0.001). There was significant difference in the complete remission rate between the two groups (RR = 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.15, 1.65, p ＜ 0.001). The incidence of myelosuppression (RR = 0.49, 95 % CI: 0.32, 0.75, p = 0.001), hepatic and renal insufficiency (RR = 0.43, 95 % CI: 0.29, 0.66, p ＜ 0.001), infection (RR = 0.26, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.40, p ＜ 0.001) and gastrointestinal discomfort (RR = 0.31, 95 % CI: 0.22, 0.46, p ＜ 0.001) of integrated Chinese and Western medicine were significantly lower than that of Western medicine alone.
Conclusion
Compared with Western medicine alone, the application of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine can improve the total clinical remission rate and reduce adverse effects following chemotherapy. However, more high-quality results of randomised controlled trials and analysis are needed to confirm the findings.}

Information published between 2011 and 2021 of each country such as pharmaceutical profiles, official government documents, WHO/HAI/World Bank datasets and research studies on the implemented components were appraised. Significant progress has been made by 16 SADC countries over the period 2011–2021 in implementing the NMP. The most commonly implemented components included the concept of essential medicines, pricing, and regulation. Though traditional and herbal medicines component is yet to be implemented by the majority. The pharmacist-patient ratio of 1:2300 was below the target for all countries, prompting the need to strengthen the pharmacy personnel in the healthcare systems. Medicine pricing, affordability, and availability studies are necessary to develop equitable pricing policies that will improve the accessibility of medicines in all countries and the SADC region. With the exception of the Republic of Tanzania, SADC countries need to urgently revise their NMPs, thus adopting progressive processes such as incorporating Health Technology Assessment (HTA) in the NMP. All SADC countries require a strong, internationalistic evaluation culture built-in their policy formulation. As the first study to investigate the implemented NMPs in the SADC region, it could serve as a springboard for the countries to address their common pharmaceutical challenges thus improving their readiness for universal health coverage (UHC). Future in-depth cross-country studies in the SADC region are necessary to comprehensively evaluate the implemented components of NMPs.}

Inclusion criteria for scientific papers and reports encompassed focus on endoscopic examination techniques in cattle in the field of internal medicine and publication in a peer reviewed journal (case report/review/original research paper/short communication). Only papers written in English or German language were considered. Studies on laparoscopy, theloscopy, and bronchoscopy show that endoscopic approaches often enable more rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment options for single diseased animals as well as on a herd level. Oesophagoscopy, rumenoscopy, cystoscopy and thoracoscopy have also been increasingly studied and proven to be safe and effective tools with some limitations in diagnosing and/or treating various diseases in cattle. Scientific approaches explored the epidural space in cattle and comparison of different endoscope systems lead to recommendations for sinuscopy. Yet, this narrative literature review clearly shows that unlike in human medicine, where endoscopy as a minimally invasive technique is used for countless routine procedures every day, there is still some catching up to do in bovine medicine even though the potential of endoscopy in this field has been documented.}

Despite emerging evidence for sex differences in key aspects of sleep-wake and circadian regulation, much remains unknown, as females are often underrepresented in sleep and circadian research. This narrative review aims at highlighting 1) how sex differences systematically impinge on the sleep-wake and circadian regulation in humans, 2) how sex differences in sleep and circadian factors modulate metabolic control, and 3) the relevance of these differences for precision medicine.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy of Tongxinluo in reducing major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in STEMI patients. The study enrolled 3777 patients from 124 hospitals in China, all of whom received standard STEMI treatments in addition to either Tongxinluo or placebo for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of MACCEs at 30 days, with secondary endpoints including individual components of MACCEs, severe STEMI complications, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality at 1 yr. Results showed that Tongxinluo significantly reduced the 30-day MACCE rate compared to placebo (3.4 % vs 5.2 %), and this benefit persisted at 1 year (5.3 % vs 8.3 %). Cardiac death and myocardial reinfarction rates were also significantly lower in the Tongxinluo group. These findings underscore the importance of integrating traditional Chinese medicine with conventional Western medical treatments, providing significant evidence to support the development of evidence-based practices in traditional Chinese medicine. This study represents a pivotal advancement in the field of TCM, demonstrating its potential to contribute meaningfully to modern clinical practice and highlighting the necessity for further high-quality research in this area.}

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a highly heterogeneous, unpredictable and ultimately lethal chronic lung disease. Over the last decade, two anti-fibrotic agents have been shown to slow disease progression, however, both drugs are administered uniformly with minimal consideration of disease severity and inter-individual molecular, genetic, and genomic differences. Advances in biological understanding of disease endotyping and the emergence of precision medicine have shown that “a one-size-fits-all approach” to the management of chronic lung diseases is no longer appropriate. While precision medicine approaches have revolutionized the management of other diseases such as lung cancer and asthma, the implementation of precision medicine in IPF clinical practice remains an unmet need despite several reports demonstrating a large number of diagnostic, prognostic and theragnostic biomarker candidates in IPF. This review article aims to summarize our current knowledge of precision medicine in IPF and highlight barriers to translate these research findings into clinical practice.}

abstract = {Rationale & Objective
Limited data exist on patient perspectives of the implications of kidney biopsies. We explored patients' perspectives alongside those of clinicians to better understand how kidney biopsies affect patients' viewpoints and the clinical utility of biopsies.
Study Design
Prospective Cohort Study.
Setting & Participants
Patient participants and clinicians in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project, a prospective cohort study of patients who undergo a research protocol biopsy, at 9 recruitment sites across the United States. Surveys were completed at enrollment before biopsy and additional timepoints after biopsy (participants: 28 days, 6 months; clinicians: 2 weeks).
Analytical Approach
Kappa statistics assessed prebiopsy etiology concordance between clinicians and participants. Participant perspectives after biopsy were analyzed using a thematic approach. Clinician ratings of clinical management value were compared to prebiopsy ratings with Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests and paired t tests.
Results
A total of 167 participants undergoing biopsy (124 participants with chronic kidney disease [CKD], 43 participants with acute kidney injury [AKI]) and 58 clinicians were included in this study. CKD participants and clinicians had low etiology concordance for the 2 leading causes of CKD: diabetes (k=0.358) and hypertension (k=0.081). At 28 days postbiopsy, 46 (84%) participants reported that the biopsy affected their understanding of their diagnosis, and 21 (38%) participants reported that the results of the biopsy affected their medications. Participants also shared biopsy impressions in free-text responses, including impacts on lifestyle and concurrent condition management. The biopsy positively shifted clinician perceptions of the procedure’s clinical management benefits, while perceptions of prognostic value decreased and diagnostic ratings remained unchanged.
Limitations
Our study did not have demographic data of clinicians and could not provide insight into postbiopsy experiences for participants who did not respond to follow-up surveys.
Conclusions
Participant perspectives of the personal implications of kidney biopsy can be integrated into shared decision-making between clinicians and patients. Enhanced biopsy reports and interactions between nephrologists and pathologists could augment the management and prognostic value of kidney biopsies.
Plain-Language Summary
The utility of kidney biopsy is debated among clinicians, and patients’ perspectives are even less explored. To address these gaps, we synthesized perspectives from clinicians and patient participants of the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Both before and after biopsy, clinicians were surveyed on how the procedure affected their clinical management, diagnosis, and prognosis. After biopsy, participants shared how the procedure affected their diagnosis, medication, and lifestyle changes. Clinicians and patients shared an appreciation for the biopsy’s impact on medical management but diverged in their takeaways on diagnosis and prognosis. These findings highlight the need for greater collaboration between patients and clinicians, particularly as they navigate shared decision-making when considering kidney biopsy.}

Anxiety or depression after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a common clinical disease. Currently, conventional pharmacotherapy primarily involves the administration of anxiolytic or antidepressant medications in conjunction with anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and other cardiovascular drugs. However, challenges such as drug dependence, adverse reactions and related concerns persist in the treatment of this disease. Numerous pertinent studies have demonstrated that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) exhibits significant therapeutic efficacy and distinctive advantages in managing post-PCI anxiety or depression.
Aim of this review
This review attempted to summarize the characteristics of TCM for treating anxiety or depression after PCI, including single Chinese herbs, Chinese medicine monomers, compound TCM prescriptions, TCM patented drugs, and other TCM-related treatment methods, focusing on the analysis of the relevant mechanism of TCM treatment of this disease.
Methods
By searching the literature on treating anxiety or depression after PCI with TCM in PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and other relevant databases, this review focuses on the latest research progress of TCM treatment of this disease.
Results
In the treatment of anxiety or depression after PCI, TCM exerts significant pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-anxiety or anti-depression, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular protection, and neuroprotection, mainly by regulating the levels of related inflammatory factors, oxidative stress markers, neurotransmitter levels, and related signaling pathways. TCM has a good clinical effect in treating anxiety or depression after PCI with individualized treatment.
Conclusions
TCM has terrific potential and good prospects in the treatment of anxiety or depression after PCI. The main direction of future exploration is the study of the mechanism related to Chinese medicine monomers and the large sample clinical study related to compound TCM prescriptions.}

abstract = {Background
: Letters of recommendation for Maternal-Fetal Medicine(MFM) fellowship are a critical part of the applicant selection process. However, data regarding best practices for how to write LOR for MFM is limited. Similarly, within letters of recommendation, differences in the ‘code’ or meaning of summative words/phrases used at the end of letters of recommendation are seen between surgery, pediatrics and medicine. However, data regarding code MFM Letters of recommendation are quite limited.
Objective
: We sought to describe what Maternal-Fetal Medicine program directors value in letters of recommendation for fellowship applicants and how PDs interpret commonly used summative words/phrases.
Study Design
After IRB exemption, subject matter experts developed an e-survey querying the importance of various letters of recommendation ‘best practices’ described by other specialties. Content and face validation were performed prior to dissemination. This cross-sectional survey was administered to MFM program directors in February 2023. The primary outcome was the relative importance of letters of recommendation content areas. Secondary outcomes included the strength of each summative ‘code’ phrase. Descriptive analysis was performed and principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to reduce the list of phrases to their underlying dimensions. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 29.0.
Results
: Of 104 MFM program directors sent the survey, 70 (67%) responded. MFM program directors reviewed an average of 78 applications (SD, 30) with 60% writing ≥3 letters/year. Ninety-one percent of respondents noted that letters of recommendation are important/very important in shaping impressions of an applicant. Respondents reported the depth of interaction with an applicant, the applicant's specific behavior traits, the applicant's abilities and a summative statement including strength of the recommendation as important content for MFM fellowship letters of recommendation. Letter length, use of bold/italics, and restating the applicant's curriculum vitae were considered not important. Following PCA with varimax rotation, 14 specific phrases used in letters of recommendation were reduced to 5 themes: high qualitative assessments, average qualitative assessments, objective metrics, exceeding expectations and grit. These themes accounted for 64.6% of the variance in the model (KMO 0.7, Bartlett's Test of Sphericity p<0.01). Phrases that respondents considered positive included: ‘Top 5%’, ‘Want to keep’, and ‘highest recommendation’, (all mean score≥4.5/5), while ‘expected level’, ‘showed improvement’, and ‘2nd quartile’ were negatively associated code words (all mean score <2.5/5).
Conclusions
: MFM program directors reported that descriptions of an applicant's abilities, behavior traits, and depth of the writer's interactions with the applicant were all important components of an MFM fellowship letters of recommendation. Letter length, bold/italics, and highlights from the CV were not important. A clear ‘code’ emerged regarding summative phrases included in letters of recommendation. Dissemination of these data might help less experienced letter writers send a clearer message and ensure all letter writers have a shared mental model.}

Given the significant impact of long-term traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment on the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we aimed to develop nomograms, with or without consideration of TCM treatment duration, to accurately predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC treated with TCM.
Methods
Nomograms were developed from a training cohort comprised of 292 patients diagnosed with NSCLC, using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses to screen for various prognostic factors with and without TCM treatment. The nomograms were evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA), after which they were validated, using the bootstrap self-sampling method for internal validation, and a validation cohort comprised of 175 patients for external validation. Bootstrap validation is a resampling technique that involves randomly selecting and replacing data from the original dataset to make statistical inferences, thereby circumventing the issue of sample reduction that can arise from cross-validation.
Results
We identified seven significant prognostic factors for OS. For nomogram A (excluding TCM treatment time), the C-indexes (95 % confidence interval [CI]) were 0.674 (0.635–0.712) and 0.660 (0.596–0.724) for the training and validation cohorts, respectively. For nomogram B (including TCM treatment time), the C-indices (95 % CI) were 0.846 (0.822–0.870) and 0.783 (0.730–0.894), for the training and validation cohorts, respectively, indicating that nomogram B was superior to nomogram A. Both the calibration curves and DCA results exhibited favorable clinical concordance and usefulness.
Conclusion
The nomogram B yielded precise prognostic predictions for patients with advanced NSCLC treated with TCM.}

We tested versions of the new questionnaire in three samples of Tibetan adults (total n = 973) in Qinghai Province and evaluated its validity in 90 respondents randomly selected from the main samples. These respondents completed the questionnaire and were independently evaluated by Tibetan Medicine experts using traditional methods of constitution identification. A comparison of the results led us to revise the original questionnaire. Based on expert advice, we combined similar and overlapping items to simplify and improve the scale. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency and indicated that the final scale is reliable. There was 80–93 % agreement between experts’ identifications and self-assessment responses in the survey when both types of data were available.

abstract = {Background
Despite the increasing emphasis on rehabilitation training after orthopedic surgery, little is known about the pain caused by the procedure itself. Clinical practice is driven by beliefs in pain management.
Aims
This study aimed to explore the perspective of pain management during rehabilitation training after orthopedic trauma in China and its influencing factors from different perspectives in traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, respectively.
Design
A phenomenological qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews.
Settings
 
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted with 16 medical workers working in the Rehabilitation Medicine Department in eastern China from July 2022-February 2023. A directed method to thematic analysis was used to code the transcribed data and identify themes.
Results
Four main themes emerged. (1) Inconsistent perspectives and practice: Chinese doctors majoring in Western medicine felt sympathy, helpless, and had a lack of knowledge and misconception about pain. Traditional Chinese medicine deemed that pain is a protective mechanism and attached importance to holism and unique means. (2) Consistent outcome: Insufficient pain management will have a series of negative consequences for patients’ recovery, forming a vicious cycle. (3) Expectations: Though they are not optimistic about traditional analgesics, enhancement, cooperation and ideal analgesic methods still be expressed, and (4) Concept transformation: Conducting nitrous oxide is a process not only to promote analgesic technology but also to promote the awareness and concept of pain management.
Conclusions
Our study emphasized that medical workers should be aware of the importance of pain management at the same time while treating the disability. The study provides insight into pain management experiences within different educational backgrounds. The findings enable professionals to recognize the importance of pain management and its influencing factors to provide feasible and effective pain management strategies.}

The inclusion of new flavours (lemon, vanilla and peach) to obtain more information on patient preferences and the implementation of a mobile app to obtain patient feedback in real-time was also used. The 3D printed medicines controlled amino acid levels within target levels as well as the conventional medicines. The deviation of citrulline levels was narrower and closer within the target concentration with the chewable formulations. According to participants’ responses, the chewable formulations were well accepted and can improve adherence and quality of life. For the first time, 3DP enabled two actives to be combined in the same formulation, reducing the number of administrations. This study demonstrated the benefits of preparing 3D printed personalized treatments for children diagnosed with rare metabolic disorders using a novel technology in real clinical practice.}

abstract = {Introduction
Several herbal medicines have been reported to ameliorate sickle cell disease (SCD) complications in many African communities. However, no comprehensive review has evaluated the use of herbal remedies for treating SCD crises. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of the use of herbal medicines for the treatment of SCD in Africa.
Methods
Following registration of the review protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42022346755), searched PubMed, Embase, Africa Journal Online, and Web of Science databases using the keywords ‘herbal medicine,’ ‘SCD,’ and ‘Africa’ on 1st August 2022 for peer-reviewed articles without language restriction. We included articles that reported the prevalence of herbal medicine use for SCD treatment in Africa and excluded qualitative studies, letters to editors, case reports, and editorials. All included papers were assessed using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale for observational studies. We used the random-effect model to calculate the pooled prevalence of herbal medicine use for SCD treatment with STATA 17.0.
Results
Overall, 142 research articles were identified. Of this, three cross-sectional studies involving 702 children with SCD from Uganda (n = 1) and Nigeria (n = 2) met the eligibility criteria and were included. Four hundred thirty-four individuals from the included studies used herbal medicines for the management of SCD. The prevalence of current herbal medicine use in individual studies ranged from 36.4% to 78.0%, with a pooled prevalence of 59% (95% confidence interval: 35.0–82.0, I2 = 97.68%, P < 0.001).
Conclusions
Almost three in five persons with SCD in Africa use herbal remedies as a form of treatment. However, there is limited data detailing the magnitude of the prevalence of use of herbal medicines for the treatment of SCD across different regions. Therefore, further studies are encouraged to explore the prevalence of use of herbal remedies for the management of SCD in Africa.}

Advancements in the field of precision medicine have prompted the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Precision Medicine Working Group to update the recommendations for the use of tumour next-generation sequencing (NGS) for patients with advanced cancers in routine practice.
Methods
The group discussed the clinical impact of tumour NGS in guiding treatment decision using the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) considering cost-effectiveness and accessibility.
Results
As for 2020 recommendations, ESMO recommends running tumour NGS in advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Moreover, it is recommended to carry out tumour NGS in clinical research centres and under specific circumstances discussed with patients. In this updated report, the consensus within the group has led to an expansion of the recommendations to encompass patients with advanced breast cancer and rare tumours such as gastrointestinal stromal tumours, sarcoma, thyroid cancer, and cancer of unknown primary. Finally, ESMO recommends carrying out tumour NGS to detect tumour-agnostic alterations in patients with metastatic cancers where access to matched therapies is available.
Conclusion
Tumour NGS is increasingly expanding its scope and application within oncology with the aim of enhancing the efficacy of precision medicine for patients with cancer.}

Although higenamine contained in Chinese herbal medicines has been identified by previous studies, comprehensive investigation on the higenamine content of Chinese herbs and their concentrated preparations is still required. This study aimed to determine the levels of higenamine in Chinese medicinal materials and their concentrated preparations used in Chinese medicine prescriptions in Taiwan. The levels of higenamine in Chinese medicinal materials, including Cortex Phellodendri, Flos Caryophylli, Fructus Euodiae, Fructus Kochiae, Plumula Nelumbinis, Radix Aconiti Preparata, Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata, and Radix Asari, and their concentrated preparations were determined by a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Our results showed that the amounts of higenamine were detected and quantified in studied Chinese medicinal materials and their concentrated preparations, except for Flos Caryophylli, Radix Aconiti Preparata, and Radix Aconiti Lateralis Preparata. Plumula Nelumbinis and Cortex Phellodendri have higher levels of higenamine when compared to other Chinese herbs tested in the present study. The highest level of higenamine was 2100 μg/g found in the Plumula Nelumbinis medicinal material. In contrast with Plumula Nelumbinis and Cortex Phellodendri, higenamine levels below 10 μg/g were found in other most of the studied Chinese medicinal materials and their concentrated preparations. This study confirmed that various Chinese herbs and their concentrated preparations contained higenamine, and it provided more coherent and comprehensive information for reducing the potential risk of higenamine misuse in sports.}

abstract = {Background
Presbycusis/Age-related hearing loss is a sensorineural hearing loss caused by age-related deterioration of the auditory system that poses a risk to the physical and mental health of older people, including social and cognitive decline. It is also associated with frailty, falls and depression. There are currently no specific medications for the treatment of presbycusis, and early detection and intervention are key to its prevention and management. Traditional Chinese medicine interventions may offer opportunities in the prevention and treatment of presbycusis, but there is no relevant review.
Methods
Literature searches was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases for review articles, research articles, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and case studies in animal models and clinical trials.
Results
We summarized the pathological mechanisms associated with presbycusis, related to genetic factors, environment, lifestyle, and molecular mechanisms related to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory pathways. It is suggested that traditional Chinese medicine interventions may offer opportunities in the prevention and treatment of presbycusis using active ingredients of herbs or formulas, acupuncture, and exercise such as Tai Chi Chuan or Ba Duan Jin. The active ingredients of herbs or formulas may exert ear protection through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathways, NF-kB and NLRP3-related anti-inflammatory signaling, and regulation of autophagy.
Conclusions
Here, we review the pathogenetic factors and pathological mechanisms involved in presbycusis, as well as traditional Chinese medicine interventions and treatments, with the aim of providing a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of hearing loss in the elderly and further improving their quality of life.}

abstract = {Affordable access to healthcare including medicines is a key social policy goal in Europe. However, it has rarely been addressed in comparative social policy research. Although the concept of decommodification has already been used in the context of healthcare and sickness benefits, we argue that the scope of such studies should be expanded to medicines to understand how welfare states protect their citizens from market forces in case of illness. We examine and compare the relationship between income, other characteristics, and subjective financial burden of medicines (FBM) across five countries with universal health systems pursuing egalitarian aims (Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden). Analyses using 2017 EU-SILC microdata and linear probability models showed large differences in the level of FBM across countries, with the highest income quintile in Finland reporting FBM more frequently than the lowest income quintile in Denmark. Finland differed from the rest by increasing probability of FBM with age. In other countries, middle-aged adults tended to be the most affected, and older adults were well-protected. The association between income and FBM was strongest in the Netherlands; however, the higher probability of FBM was skewed towards the lower quintiles in all countries. FBM and financial burden of medical care were strongly associated although FBM tended to be more common. Unmet needs for medical examination were rare and lacked sensitivity in capturing manifestations of market risk. Decommodification literature has focused healthcare services as proxy of access; nevertheless, our study shows that further functions, and broader outcomes should be examined to capture market risk. Our evidence further highlights that important differences can be found even in countries with relatively similar health policy aims. The cost of medicines should be considered in comparative studies of health and welfare states.}

abstract = {Background
The incidence of Ulcerative colitis (UC), a key form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting the rectum and colon, is increasing globally. The advancement in microbiome and metabolomics research has revealed the crucial involvement of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and progression of UC. Chinese herbal medicines, characterized by structural diversity and multiple pharmacological activities, consistently serve as vital sources for developing anti-UC drugs.
Methods
In this review, we searched and focused on several online databases, including the Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar, using three keywords: “ulcerative colitis”, “intestinal microbiota”, and “Chinese herbal medicine” from 2013 to 2023. This review aims to uncover the mechanism of action of intestinal microbiota in the occurrence and development of UC and to explore the potential of Chinese herbal medicine in preventing and treating UC within the context of intestinal microbiota regulation.
Results
This review summarizes the critical role of the intestinal microbiota in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by facilitating the repair of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, modulating the immune system, and regulating pivotal metabolisms, including bile acids, amino acids, and short-chain fatty acids. Specifically, Chinese herbal medicines, comprising active ingredients such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids, as well as single Chinese herbal medicines and their extracts (extracts from Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regelcan, Ceandntella asiatica (L.) Urb., Heritiera littoralis fruit., and so on), and several combination preparations (for example, Ganluyin, Jiawei Gegen Qinlian Decoction, Baitouweng Tang), are capable of preventing and treating UC by regulating the gut flora. This, in turn, contributes to the repair of the intestinal epithelial barrier, modulation of the immune system, and regulation of those metabolisms.
Conclusion
Overall, our study presents a timely and comprehensive review of the regulation patterns of intestinal microbiota in the treatment of UC and the intervention of Chinese herbal medicines by modulating intestinal microbiota. This work provides a further understanding of the pathogenesis of UC and a new perspective for understanding the “multi-dimensional” means of Chinese herbal medicine in treating UC.}

Therapeutic strategies are shifting from a “one-size-fits-all” population-based approach to a stratified approach targeting groups with similar characteristics, or even individuals, tailoring treatments to the unique characteristics of each patient. Since such strategies rely on increasingly complex knowledge and healthcare technologies, along with an understanding of the tools of precision medicine, the appropriate dissemination and use of these strategies involves a number of challenges for the medical community. Having evaluation methodologies that have been jointly designed with the institutional, industrial, academic stakeholders, and also patients, like streamlining the processes and externally validating performances, could enhance the relevance of the “evaluation” aspect of precision medicine. Creating a network of expert precision-medicine centers and ensuring that precision-medicine procedures are reimbursed by social security would guarantee fair and sustainable access. Finally, training healthcare professionals, creating interfaces between precision-medicine expert centers and primary care professionals as well as patients, and integrating individual patient data into medical records are all key drivers that will enable information from precision-medicine to be made available and guarantee the proper use of these approaches.}

abstract = {Background
The gut microbiota is crucial in human health and diseases. Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution (TCMC) divides people into those with a balanced constitution (Ping-he [PH]) and those with an unbalanced constitution. Dampness–heat constitution (Shi-re [SR]) is a common unbalanced constitution in the Chinese population and is susceptible to diseases. However, unbalanced constitutions can be regulated by Chinese medicine and lifestyle interventions in clinical practice. Ermiao Pill (EMP) is a Chinese medicine known for clearing heat and draining dampness and improving SR. However, the efficacy and mechanism of EMP are unclear.
Hypothesis/Purpose
To determine alterations in the gut microbiota and metabolome in SR and any changes after EMP treatment combined with lifestyle intervention.
Study design
Randomized clinical trial.
Methods
We enrolled 112 healthy SR individuals and evaluated the efficacy of EMP along with lifestyle interventions. We further assessed serum cytokine levels, serum and urinary metabolomes, and the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis before and after the EMP and lifestyle interventions.
Results
107 SR individuals (55 in the intervention group and 52 in the control group) completed the 1-month-intervention and 1-year-follow-up. The intervention group significantly improved their health status within 1 month, with a reduced SR symptom score, and the efficacy lasted to the 1-year follow-up. The control group needed a further 6 months to reduce the SR symptom score. The gut microbiota of PH individuals was more diverse and had significantly higher proportions of many bacterial species than the SR. Microbiota co-occurrence network analysis showed that SR enriches metabolites correlating with microbial community structure, consistent with traits of healthy SR-enriched microbiota.
Conclusion
EMP combined with lifestyle intervention produced health benefits in SR individuals. Our study indicates a pivotal role of gut microbiota and metabolome alterations in distinguishing between healthy SR and PH. Furthermore, the study reveals structural changes of gut microbiota and metabolites induced by EMP and lifestyle intervention. The treatment enriched the number of beneficial bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactobacillus in the gut. Our findings provide a strong indication that several metabolite factors are associated with the gut microbiota. Moreover, the gut microbiome and metabolome might be powerful tools for TCMC diagnosis and personalized therapy.}

Purpose
Self-reported information on medical conditions and medicine use is widely used in epidemiological research. We investigated the validity of self-reported medical conditions and medicine use from Danish participants in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe.
Methods
Self-reported health data were linked at individual level with the National Patient Registry and the Danish National Prescription Registry (n = 5572). Agreement was assessed by kappa value and presented as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and odds ratios.
Results
The agreement of self-reported medical conditions varied by type (κ = 0.23–0.67), lowest for cholesterol-related diseases, highest for diabetes. Self-reported medicine use varied by medication type (κ = 0.33–0.90) lowest for painkillers, highest for diabetes. Women had lower odds for self-reporting medicine use correctly but higher odds for self-reported diseases. Higher age was associated with lower agreement, while higher education with higher agreement.
Conclusions
Although Danish data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe on medical conditions and medicine vary, the data are valid for epidemiological use for most medicine data, and for diseases associated with hospitalizations or influencing everyday life. Caution is warranted for self-reported data from 70+ year olds and people with lower educational level.}

abstract = {Background
Emergency physicians and trainees provide the initial care for critically ill patients. In times of emergency department boarding, this care may extend beyond the first few hours. To meet the needs of this population, a standardized novel critical care curriculum targeting third- and fourth-year medical students was developed.
Objectives
We hypothesized that the institution of such a curriculum is feasible and will provide an increased understanding of the underlying critical care principles within this learner population.
Methods
We developed a 2-month-long critical care curriculum (February–April) and carried out the course twice from 2022–2023. Our pilot study deployed this curriculum to medical students interested in critical care through the American Academy of Emergency Medicine/Resident and Student Association. The primary outcome included was the overall composite score comparison of the pre- and post-course evaluations, with a higher score indicating that the student improved their comprehension. Secondary outcomes included the individual factors of the pre- and post-course surveys.
Results
Fifty-one trainees completed the pilot course, including 11/51 (21.6%) third-year medical students and 40/51 (78.4%) fourth-year medical students. Overall, 39 had “no experience” in critical care and 12 indicated that they had “previous experience.” The students’ baseline pre-course from the pooled 2022 and 2023 Introduction to Critical Care in Emergency Medicine (ICCEM) curriculum data was 3 (interquartile range 4–3) and their post-course score was 9 (interquartile range 9–9), p-value 0.015 for the 51/54 students who completed the course.
Conclusions
The novel curriculum was found to be effective during its implementation in third- and fourth-year medical students. As such, it indicated that a critical care fundamentals course improves confidence in these topics for students with and without prior experience. Further work is necessary to understand the generalizability and knowledge retention of the proposed pilot curriculum.}

Images—both radiology- and pathology-derived—are a major source of information on presence, type, and status of disease. Exploring the mathematical relationship of pixels in medical imaging (“radiomics”) and cellular-scale structures in digital pathology slides (“pathomics”) offers powerful tools for extracting both qualitative and, increasingly, quantitative data. These analytical approaches, however, may be significantly enhanced by applying additional methods arising from fields of mathematics such as differential geometry and algebraic topology that remain underexplored in this context. Geometry’s strength lies in its ability to provide precise local measurements, such as curvature, that can be crucial for identifying abnormalities at multiple spatial levels. These measurements can augment the quantitative features extracted in conventional radiomics, leading to more nuanced diagnostics. By contrast, topology serves as a robust shape descriptor, capturing essential features such as connected components and holes. The field of topological data analysis was initially founded to explore the shape of data, with functional network connectivity in the brain being a prominent example. Increasingly, its tools are now being used to explore organizational patterns of physical structures in medical images and digitized pathology slides. By leveraging tools from both differential geometry and algebraic topology, researchers and clinicians may be able to obtain a more comprehensive, multi-layered understanding of medical images and contribute to precision medicine’s armamentarium.}

abstract = {Background
Patients undergoing pancreatic resection who decline blood transfusion represent a clinical challenge. While bloodless medicine programs are valuable, their impact remains unclear, especially for those with borderline-resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Methods
Retrospective review of institutional databases identified patients who did not accept blood transfusion and underwent pancreatic resection from 2013–2022. We collated hemoglobin values, interventions to minimize symptomatic anemia, and patient outcomes.
Results
Thirteen patients were identified. Median age was 63 years (range: 52–75 years) and eight (61.5 %) were female. All procedures were performed electively for invasive malignancy with PDAC as the most common diagnosis (11/13; 84.6 %) and pancreaticoduodenectomy as the most common procedure (11/13; 84.6 %). Vascular involvement was common in the 11 patients with PDAC (borderline-resectable: 7/11; 63.6 % and locally advanced: 3/11; 27.3 %), as was the use of multi-agent chemotherapy (n = 10) and preoperative radiotherapy (n = 8) prior to surgery. Median blood loss was 400 mL (range: 100–2200 mL). Intraoperative measures included acute normovolemic hemodilution in one patient and red blood cell salvage in three patients. Median preoperative hemoglobin was 12.3 g/dL (range: 10.3–14.2 g/dL) and median nadir hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dL (range: 5.2–11.8 g/dL). Median hospital stay was 10 days (range: 6–42 days). Thirty-day mortality was 0 % and one-year overall survival was 69.2 % with median follow-up of 26.4 months.
Conclusion
Pancreatic resections can be performed safely in patients who decline blood transfusion, even with borderline-resectable and locally advanced PDAC. Avoiding transfusions and employing blood-conservation techniques does not appear to detrimentally impact survival.}

Diabetes is a common chronic disease. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has a history of several thousand years in the treatment of diabetes, and active components with hypoglycemic effects extracted from various CHM, such as polysaccharides, flavonoids, terpenes, and steroidal saponins, have been widely used in the treatment of diabetes.
Aim of the study
Research exploring the potential of various CHM compounds to regulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex to improve type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Materials and methods
The literature data were primarily obtained from authoritative databases such as PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, and others within the last decade. The main keywords used include “type 2 diabetes mellitus”, “Chinese medicine”, “Chinese herbal medicine”, “mitochondrial respiratory chain complex”, and “mitochondrial dysfunction".
Results
Chinese herbal medicine primarily regulates the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in various tissues such as liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, pancreatic islets, and small intestine. It improves cellular energy metabolism through hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and lipid-modulating effects. Different components of CHM can regulate the same mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, while the same components of a particular CHM can regulate different complex activities. The active components of CHM target different mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, regulate their aberrant changes and effectively improve T2DM and its complications.
Conclusion
Chinese herbal medicine can modulate the function of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in various cell types and exert their hypoglycemic effects through various mechanisms. CHM has significant therapeutic potential in regulating mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes to improve T2DM, but further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and conduct clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of these medications. This provides new perspectives and opportunities for personalized improvement and innovative developments in diabetes management.}

Healthcare in China has historically relied on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has had far-reaching effects on healthcare systems in neighboring nations. TCM has generated anticancer herbal medications. Cancer clinical trials have also examined herbal remedies.
Methodology
Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar were among the online databases that were searched. Consequently, this review set out to compile a synopsis of the documented phytochemistry and pharmacological activities of the selected plant species. This literature review sought to illuminate TCMadjuvant cancer therapeutic role. New research reveals herbal medicines may inhibit cancer cell migration, adhesion, proliferation, and death.
Results
This review aimed to summarise herbs and their TCM processes for chemoprevention and treatment. TCM treatments that target cancer stem cells and alter the tumor microenvironment have also been studied. This review will underpin traditional Chinese medicine cancer therapy research.
Discussion
The bioactive chemicals in these herbs have been shown in clinical trials to have a wide range of cancer-fighting properties, with few side effects and a marked improvement in patient's quality of life.
Conclusion
Given these benefits, it's clear that incorporating Chinese medicines into cancer care could be a significant step towards a more effective and comprehensive approach to treating the disease.}

This scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of the evidence of point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) in emergency medicine. By emphasizing clinical topics, time trends, study designs, and the scope of the primary outcomes, a map is provided for physicians and researchers to guide their future initiatives.
Research Question
Which study designs and primary outcomes are reported in published studies of LUS in emergency medicine?
Study Design and Methods
We performed a systematic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases for LUS studies published prior to May 13, 2023. Study characteristics were synthesized quantitatively. The primary outcomes in all papers were categorized into the hierarchical Fryback and Thornbury levels.
Results
A total of 4,076 papers were screened and, following selection and handsearching, 406 papers were included. The number of publications doubled from January 2020 to May 2023 (204 to 406 papers). The study designs were primarily observational (n = 375 [92%]), followed by randomized (n = 18 [4%]) and case series (n = 13 [3%]). The primary outcome measure concerned diagnostic accuracy in 319 papers (79%), diagnostic thinking in 32 (8%), therapeutic changes in 4 (1%), and patient outcomes in 14 (3%). No increase in the proportions of randomized controlled trials or the scope of primary outcome measures was observed with time. A freely available interactive database was created to enable readers to search for any given interest (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/blinded/viz/LUSinEM_240216/INFO).
Interpretation
Observational diagnostic studies have been produced in abundance, leaving a paucity of research exploring clinical utility. Notably, research exploring whether LUS causes changes to clinical decisions is imperative prior to any further research being made into patient benefits.}

To assess the efficacy and safety of combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), specifically Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), with Western medicine (WM), compared to WM alone to treat breast cancer endocrine therapy-related osteoporosis (BCET-OP) by meta-analysis.
Methods
Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials involving 2170 participants were analyzed. Eight databases were searched for articles published between inception and December 2023. Quality assessment was performed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool.
Results
Significant increases were observed in the TCM-WM group in lumbar vertebrae bone mineral density (BMD) (P < .001, mean difference (MD) = 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06 to 0.08), lumbar vertebrae T-score (P = .0005, MD = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.09 to 0.33) and collum femoris BMD (P = .01, MD = 0.10, 95%CI: 0.02 to 0.19). No significant difference was observed between the groups in the collum femoris T-score and estradiol levels. Bone gla-protein levels were significantly increased in the TCM-WM group (P = .0002, MD = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.25 to 0.79). Beta-CrossLaps decreased significantly in the TCM-WM group (P = .0008, MD = −0.10, 95%CI: −0.16 to −0.04). No significant difference was observed between the TCM-WM and WM groups in alkaline phosphatase, in procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide, and in the Kupperman index. The visual analog score (VAS) was decreased in the TCM-WM group compared to the WM group (P < .001, MD = −1.40, 95%CI: −1.94 to −0.87). No significant difference in adverse events was observed between the two groups.
Conclusion
Combining CHM with WM in patients with BCET-OP significantly improved BMD, T-score, and certain bone turnover markers and reduced the VAS score, indicating potential benefits for bone health and related pain. Adverse event analysis revealed no differences between the groups, supporting the feasibility of the combination therapy. However, further research, particularly in diverse populations, is required.}

However, compared to glucose or glutamine metabolism, less attention has been paid to the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis. Recent developments in lipidomics technologies have allowed for detailed analysis of lipid profiles within cancer cells and other cellular players present within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and its bioactive components have a long history of use in cancer treatments and are also being studied for their potential role in regulating metabolic reprogramming within TME. This review focuses on four core abnormalities altered by lipid reprogramming in cancer cells: de novo synthesis and exogenous uptake of fatty acids (FAs), upregulated fatty acid oxidation (FAO), cholesterol accumulation, which offer benefits for tumor growth and metastasis. The review also discusses how altered lipid metabolism impacts infiltrating immune cell function and phenotype as these interactions between cancer-stromal become more pronounced during tumor progression. Finally, recent literature is highlighted regarding how cancer cells can be metabolically reprogrammed by specific Chinese herbal components with potential therapeutic benefits related to lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.}

abstract = {Objective
This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and its associated factors among diabetic patients in Fasa, a city in southern Iran.
Methods
Data were collected from diabetic patients who visited the endocrinology clinics at Fasa University of Medical Sciences. A structured questionnaire was administered to gather information on CAM use, including the types of CAM modalities used, and reasons for use. The patient's demographic and clinical characteristics, such as age, gender, duration of diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and quality of life (QoL) were also recorded. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the prevalence of CAM use, while logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with CAM use.
Results
A total of 376 diabetic patients participated in the study, with more than 89% reporting CAM use within the past year. Herbal preparations were the most commonly used type of CAM, with a prevalence rate of 99.4%. Factors associated with CAM use included patients’ psychological health, attitude towards the safety of CAM, belief in the synergistic effects of combining routine medications with CAM, and previous positive experiences with CAM.
Conclusion
The high prevalence of CAM use highlights the importance of considering it in diabetes management and the need for healthcare professionals’ engagement in open discussions with patients about their CAM practices. Understanding the factors influencing CAM use can inform healthcare providers and policymakers in developing appropriate strategies for integrating CAM approaches into conventional diabetes care.}

abstract = {Introduction
As our field of pathology continues to grow, our trainee numbers are on the decline. To combat this trend, the ASC Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee established the Science, Medicine, and Cytology SumMer Certificate program to improve exposure to pathology/cytopathology with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Herein, we report our findings of the first 2 years of the program.
Materials and methods
An online course was developed targeting students who are underrepresented in medicine at the high school and college level. It consisted of several didactic sessions, presenting the common procedures involving cytopathologists and cytologists. Interviews with cytopathologists were also included. Participants were surveyed for demographic information and provided course evaluations.
Results
In the first year of the program (2021), 34 participants completed the program, which increased to 103 in 2022. In both years there was a diversity in participant demographic backgrounds; however, only a minority of participants self-identified as being underrepresented in medicine. A vast majority (>85%) of participants in both years were high school or college students. In 2021, 100% of participants stated that the program format was effective and 94% thought the content was appropriate for their level of education; in 2022 the results were similar. In 2021, 66% considered health care as a potential career; this value increased in 2022 to 83%. In 2021 and 2022, 31% and 38%, respectively, considered cytology as a career.
Conclusions
Evaluations were excellent, generating interest in cytopathology. Barriers in reaching underrepresented minorities exist and additional work is needed. Expansion to a wider audience may increase outreach.}

Previously, small groups of clinicians crafted clinical practice guidelines based on their professional expertise, but guideline developers must increasingly consider patients’ lay expertise, global expertise, and principles of evidence-based medicine. This article analyzes how the World Professional Association for Transgender Health grappled with diverse forms of expertise and evidence-based medicine in the process of creating its “Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8” (hereafter, SOC-8), a prominent set of clinical practice guidelines in transgender medicine. Analysis is based on 83 interviews with clinicians, patients, and activists in the U.S. and Thailand between 2019 and 2021, as well as observation of transgender health conferences and content analysis of written materials. I find that despite the ostensible goal of incorporating more diverse expertise in this version of the guidelines, the SOC-8 ultimately reproduced traditional knowledge hierarchies in science and medicine in which the lay expertise of transgender and gender non-conforming patients and expertise from the Global South remain marginalized. I attribute this re-marginalization to the regulatory objectivity enacted in the SOC-8 revision process, which re-legitimized professional expertise, established no formal infrastructure for ensuring the equal participation of Global South stakeholders, and permitted limited inclusion of lay expertise from transgender and gender non-conforming people with relatively high levels of privilege (according to race, education, and other social statuses). These findings have implications for future research on knowledge hierarchies in science and medicine and the creation of clinical practice guidelines.}

Conventional treatments for Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) are limited. Herbal medicines (HM) are considered a potential intervention for the treatment of HT.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of HM for HT.
Materials and methods
A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted for patients with HT in randomized controlled trials identified in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Chi CTR), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (the VIP), China Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), and Wanfang Database were searched from their inception to Oct 1, 2022. Outcomes included the primary outcome (TPOAb), secondary outcomes (TSH, TGAb, FT3, FT4, and traditional Chinese medicine symptom scores), and adverse events. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022363640).
Results
Sixteen trials were reviewed and 16 HM formulae were compared. Compared with non-drug therapy (NDT), all therapies, except for Tiaoqi-Qingjie Therapy, reduced the primary outcome of TPOAb with different levels of effectiveness, ranging from 0.01 (95%CI 0.00, 0.02) to 0.92 (95%CI 0.56, 1.53). Ranking probability analysis indicated that Yiqi Huayu Recipe, Liqi Xiaoying decoction, and Shugan Sanjie therapy reduced thyroid antibody levels the most, including TPOAb (100.0%, 90.9%, and 90.3%, respectively) and TGAb (98.3%, 94.4%, and 87.3%, respectively). All HMs displayed a significant effect on the TCM Symptom score and possibly benefitted the treatment of HT, ranging from 6.62 (95% CI 2.06, 21.24) to 94.50 (95% CI 15.97, 559.14). No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions
Herbal medicines may be effective in the treatment of HT, especially in reducing thyroid antibody levels and improving clinical symptoms without affecting thyroid function. However, these results should be considered preliminary and further verified using high-quality evidence.}

Different healing possibilities can be identified in humans if we shift our focus from reductionist science to whole-person care. Each health condition is an outcome of disturbed homeostasis involving multiple body systems. Based on homeostatic balancing principles and clinical experience, five interrelated and interdependent pathways are discussed. Based on these pathways, a working model of integrative medicine is presented. It can act as a template for medical practitioners to start integrative medicine practice for the benefit of patients. To make integrative medicine mainstream, there is a need to standardize care, frame regulations, train and educate the practitioners. At the same, it shall be put to rigorous scientific experimentation, research, and scrutiny.}

abstract = {Objectives
Observational studies are not subject to the same requirements as randomized controlled trials, such as registration or publishing a protocol. The aim of this scoping review was to estimate the registration rate of observational studies in leading peer-reviewed medicine journals and to evaluate whether protocols were available in the public domain.
Study Design and Setting
In March 2023, we searched OVID Medline for observational studies published in 2022 in the top five general medicine journals according to impact factor (The Lancet, The British Medical Journal (BMJ), The Journal of the American Medical Association, The New England Journal of Medicine, and Annals of Internal Medicine). We defined an observational study as a cohort study, a case-control study, a cross-sectional study, or a case series. Information on i) the proportion of observational studies that have been registered and ii) the proportion of observational studies that have a protocol available in the public domain was extracted from a random sample of studies.
Results
Our search identified 699 studies; 290 studies were selected as full text, and a random sample of 200 studies was included. For half of the studies, the first author worked at a US institution. Most studies were cohort studies (n = 126, 63.0%) and used administrative healthcare records, electronic healthcare records, and registries. Of the 200 observational studies, 20 (10.0%) were registered. Among those, 14 were prospectively registered. Twenty-four studies (12.0%) had a protocol available in the public domain. Studies that were registered or had a protocol, were more frequently published in the BMJ (n = 12/28, 42.9%), had a first author working in the UK (n = 10/28, 35.7%) and used electronic health care records (n = 13/28, 46.4%) compared to studies with no registration and no protocol.
Conclusion
The rate of prospectively registered observational studies is worryingly low. Prospective registration of observational studies should be encouraged and standardized to ensure transparency in clinical research and reduce research waste.}

Our traditional medical mindset and healthcare culture are being severely challenged. In the face of novel infectious diseases, such as Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), along with rising levels of chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease and cancer, many argue that current healthcare practices are failing to meet our needs. Energy and vision for a new way of practicing medicine are colliding, from both top-down, driven by policy, and bottom-up, driven by clinicians and patients. Policy makers have laid out the need for integration of healthcare delivery to address the complex chronic disease burden; creating integrated care partnerships, health and wellbeing boards and primary care networks to bring together ‘at the place level’ primary and secondary care, mental and public health services, social care and the voluntary sector. In practice, this is starting to build lasting working relationships between previously siloed services, to address the complex environmental, social, cultural, lifestyle and biopsychosocial drivers of ill health rather than simply providing access to hospitals, doctors and medication. Similarly, out of frustration with our traditional pharmaceutically driven medical model, grass-roots clinicians have built a new vision for their role in this better integrated health system, with the discipline of lifestyle medicine.}

The paper examines how the sellers negotiated access into the loading bays, how they marketed their medicines, where they sourced their medicines from, and the challenges they faced. An exploratory qualitative survey design was adopted for the study. Through convenience sampling, 18 IMSs operating within the bus terminals in the Kumasi metropolis participated in this study. In-depth interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were thematically analysed. The study found that these hawkers negotiated access to the loading bays through multiple informal gatekeepers and employed direct customer engagement in marketing their medicines. It was further revealed that the IMSs sourced their medicines from both formal and informal sources for different reasons, such as affordability and informality of medicines acquisition. The participants operated outside government-prescribed regulations and faced challenges of low capital and sales revenue, poor reception by prospective clients, and government clampdown. The study concludes that medicine hawking is an illegal livelihood strategy and a public health concern. As a phenomenon outside government’s policy guidelines, it is recommended that government intensifies its clampdown activities on these hawkers and engage in public health education on the negative implications of accessing medicines from these IMSs.}

Taking the notion of 'the art of medicine' as an analytical frame, and drawing on interviews with medical specialists as well as participant observation of video consultations with patients (carried out between February 2022 and January 2023), this article investigates how video consultation technology changes the practices of medical specialists in the Danish healthcare system. Informed by post-phenomenology, we approach video consultations metaphorically as 'windows' between medical specialists and patients, unveiling three pivotal dimensions characterizing these changes. First, the shift from a physical to a virtual consultation room requires a reevaluation of the authoritative nature of the clinic, emphasizing the need for negotiating and staging the clinical space online. Second, while video consultations limit doctors' ability to rely on traditional non-verbal cues such as body language, they offer glimpses into patients' home environments, exposing the influence of social preconceptions on medical evaluations. Third, the adoption of video consultations introduces new conditions for doctors' use of senses, accentuating the importance of reflecting on the roles of different sensory impressions in the art of medicine. Our study illuminates how video consultation technology simultaneously expands and constrains the engagement between medical specialists and patients. Despite their inherent limitations, video consultations bring medical specialists closer to some of the intricacies of patients' lives. This proximity offers new insights and renders visible the roles of caregivers and relatives in the patient's care. The metaphor of 'the video window' encapsulates this tension between distance and closeness in video consultations, portraying the patient as both fragmented and socially situated. Our study extends beyond traditional patient and provider satisfaction evaluations, providing nuanced insights into how video consultations reconfigure the art of medicine.}

abstract = {Introduction
Case reports have a long history in Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), and even into the modern day, case reports are still a preferred format for traditional East Asian medicine (TEAM) practitioners. However, the tradition of case reports in teaching and research is not nearly as common in the English-speaking world as in China, possibly due to the lack of a specific case report guideline. This study aimed to co-design a CHM guideline (CHM-CARE) to assist practitioners in compiling structured and comprehensive case reports.
Methods
A two-phased mixed approach was used to develop the case report guideline. In phase one, focus groups of TEAM practitioners were used to determine what components of existing guidelines (e.g., Case Report (CARE) and Case Report in Chinese Medicine (CARC)) were relevant to include, along with any additions or changes. Content analysis of phase 1 provided the checklist items for a two-round Delphi process (Phase 2). All checklist items from the first Delphi round with a median of three or higher were included in the second round, with consensus set at >70 % for inclusion in the final guideline.
Results
A total of 18 CHM practitioners from four countries joined five separate focus group discussions. Focus group discussions led to 98 checklist items being used in the first round of the Delphi process. Fifteen international experts on case reports participated in two rounds of Delphi. A total of 69 checklist items moved forward into the second round where 61 items (88 %) reached consensus and formed the final CHM-CARE guideline.
Conclusion
Key elements of a herbal medicine case report checklist were identified, and a 61-item case report guideline (CHM-CARE) was produced, providing clear guidelines for case reports to TEAM practitioners operating in private practice.}

In this study, the regularity of drug containing borneol proprietary Chinese medicine was mined, to provide reference for the clinical application and new drug research and development of borneol.
Methods
The database of proprietary Chinese medicines on Pharmaceutical Intelligence Network was searched for internal and external prescriptions that contained borneols and the diseases they treat. Microsoft Office Excel 2019 and SPSS Modeler 18.0 were used to analyze the properties, flavors, meridians tropisms and association rule analysis of the medicines, and Origin 21.0 software was used to draw the association rules diagram.
Results
Among them, 528 prescriptions of internal Chinese patent medicine containing borneol and 387 prescriptions of external Chinese patent medicine were included. The diseases treated by internal prescription were mainly neurological diseases and heart diseases, among which Chinese medicines with higher frequency of compatibility with borneol were bezoar, licorice, cinnabar, musk and scutellaria. The diseases treated by external prescription were mainly physical disabilities, paralysis diseases, sore and ulcer diseases and so on. Among them, menthol, camphor, frankincense, angelica, and carthami flos and so on are the most frequently combined with borneol.
Conclusion
The prescription of Chinese patent medicine containing borneol is composed of cold or warm, pungent or bitter Chinese medicine. Internal prescription primarily targets the meridians of the heart, liver, and lungs, and is often combined with sedative, antipyretic and detoxicating drugs to treat stroke, infantile convulsion and angina pectoris. External prescription mainly acts on liver, heart and spleen meridian, and is often combined with drugs for clearing heat, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to treat rheumatic arthralgia syndrome and sore and ulcer diseases.}

Given that most medical school matriculants graduate and pursue residency training, medical school admission has been identified as the primary impediment to a career in medicine. Thus, this work aims to identify barriers in the journey of primarily Black, and secondarily underrepresented minority, premedical students. A systematic review of the medical literature was conducted for articles pertaining to the undergraduate/premedical period, Black experiences, and the medical school application process. The search yielded 5336 results, and 13 articles were included. Most papers corroborated common barriers, such as financial/socioeconomic burdens, lack of access to preparatory materials and academic enrichment programs, lack of exposure to the medical field, poor mentorship/advising experiences, systemic and interpersonal racism, and limited support systems. Common facilitators of interest and interventions included increasing academic enrichment programs, improving mentorship and career guidance quality and availability, and improving access to and availability of resources as well as exposure opportunities. No article explicitly discussed addressing racism. There is a dearth of studies exploring the premedical stage—the penultimate point of entry into medicine. Though interest in becoming a physician may be present, multiple and disparate impediments restrict Black men's participation in medicine. Addressing the barriers Black and underrepresented minority premedical students face requires an awareness of how multiple systems work together to discriminate and restrict access to careers in medicine beyond the traditional pipeline understanding.}

One of those areas is precision medicine for cancer therapy, offering tailored solutions for targeted drug delivery, cancer immunotherapy, imaging/biosensing, and therapy monitoring. Recent trends in bio- and nanomedicine have focused on developing biocompatible and biodegradable multifunctional nanocarriers that enhance drug delivery efficiency while minimize systemic toxicity. Fabricating sustainable nanomaterials with smart functionalities, such as stimuli-responsive behavior and targeted drug release mechanisms, holds great potential for improving the efficacy of therapy with more desirable outcomes. However, challenges persist in ensuring the biosafety, targeting efficiency, and specificity of these nanomaterials; also, clinical translation studies, optimizing scalability, and cost-effectiveness in production processes need to be addressed. The primary purpose of this review is to examine the recent advancements in sustainable nanomaterials for precision medicine in targeted cancer therapy via summarizing the progress made in this field. In addition, we mentioned about the crucial challenges related to these innovative solutions, such as ensuring the safety and sustainability of nanomaterials. Moreover, by exploring the future perspectives of this technology, we hope to provide insights into the direction of developments in sustainable nanomaterials for precision medicine, particularly in the context of targeted cancer therapy.}

abstract = {Introduction
The WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014–2023 emphasises the significance of traditional medicine systems for preventing and treating diseases, worldwide. As a result, many countries have developed national research programmes and research institutes dealing with traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) (WHO Global Report on Traditional and Complementary Medicine, Geneva, 2019) or integrative medicine (IM). Despite considerable public interest in IM in the Netherlands, no Dutch programme or research institute has been established, yet. In 2018, a consortium for integrative care and health was founded, and developed a national research agenda with research priorities for the Netherlands.
Methods
The consensus-based strategy for developing the research agenda involved: (1) conducting a literature review, (2) organising an online consensus meeting with a select group of integrative medicine (IM) experts, (3) conducting a survey among IM stakeholders, and (4) organising a second consensus meeting with the same group of IM experts to discuss the survey results and further refine the research agenda. Snowball sampling was used to recruit IM stakeholders, starting from a list of those interested in or connected to IM.
Results
Ninety-two stakeholders completed the survey. The most promising research areas were oncology, pain management and palliative care. Respondents awarded the highest priority to research on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of IM interventions. Directions for research included mind–body interventions, biological interventions and whole medical systems. Moreover, respondents strongly recommended developing reliable patient information tools. Facilitators for IM implementation were increasing attention on prevention, the rising incidence of chronic diseases and the shift from disease-focused to health-focused approaches. The identified barriers included a lack of knowledge about IM, the absence of health insurance reimbursement for complementary medicine, and governance structures of healthcare organisations.
Conclusions
The first Dutch IM research agenda was developed based on consensus among Dutch healthcare professionals, along with input from a smaller group of patients and researchers. This agenda provides clear research directions and distinguishes both positive developments and barriers for IM in the Netherlands.}

abstract = {Background
Fermentation, an ancient production method ingrained in the history of human civilization, has been extensively employed to enhance the biological activity of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), notably its antioxidant capacity. Higher antioxidant capacity of fermented CHM (FCHM) is evidenced by elevated free radical and reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity, increased expression of antioxidant enzymes, and activated Nrf2 signal pathway, making it widely applicable in the field of food and medicine.
Scope and approach
In this study, the scientific value of antioxidant properties of fermented herbs in the food and medicine field was explored. We comprehensively reviewed the techniques used in fermenting CHM, the microorganisms involved, and the benefits conferred by fermentation. Next, we delved into the functional and sensory advantages of incorporating FCHM in food, mainly focusing on its antioxidant properties, as well as its therapeutic role in diverse diseases including neuroinflammation, colitis, cardiovascular disease, systemic inflammation, diabetes, and cancer. Finally, we illustrated the application and prospective advancements of fermented herbs in the domain of synthetic biology and nanoparticle technology.
Key findings and conclusions
This review is of great significance in the development of herbal medicine formulations exhibiting elevated antioxidant activity and in advocating for the integration of FCHM in the realms of the food industry and medicine.}

The network medicine is successfully implemented to integrate multiple omics data to identify the disease modules in cancer. The cancer-specific disease modules are utilized for drug screening and targeted therapy. Additionally, the model developed using AI, and genomic data shows superior performance and also reveals relationships between the genomic variability of cancer and their response to drugs.

We examined the impact on the list prices for patented medicines had the amendment been implemented from 2013. Methods: Using IQVIA MIDAS® quarterly sales data, we selected branded products that were launched in Canada in 2013–2018. The list price for each product in each country was calculated as its average annual price during the 3rd year post Canadian launch. The median international price (MIP) was the median of the list prices of PMPRB7 (MIP7) and PMPRB11 (MIP11). We assumed the same IRP would be (scenario 1) or would not be used (scenario 2). Results: Among the selected 400 products, 80.3 % (321) had MIP7 and MIP11 (launched in at least one reference country); 18.3 % did not have MIP11. The total current expenditures were $7,134.4 M. In scenario 1, MIP11 would not be binding for most products and expenditures would decline only by 0.7 %. If IRP were abolished, expenditures might decline by 14.1 % if the launching sequence would not change. Conclusions: MIP11 might not be binding for most medicines. The impact depends on whether to retain the IRP and approaches taken for medicines without MIP11.}

abstract = {Aim
To explore the scope and form of prescriptions for blood and hematopoietic drugs that future advanced practice nurses (APNs) in the Department of Haematology and to establish a medicine prescription training content in China.
Background
Because the increasing number of doctors cannot meet the increasing demand for medical care with the population growth, many countries have begun to explore the medical team structure and practice areas, among which nurse prescribing rights have been the most effective. However, China's higher nursing education system still lacks education and training on nurse prescription.
Design
On the basis of literature research and semi-structured interviews, a set of nursing prescription content, education, training and practice system suitable for Chinese nurses was jointly created.
Methods
Two rounds of expert consultation between 23 haematology nursing experts and clinical experts determined the training content of blood system drugs and medicine prescriptions. Additionally, on the basis of the 23 experts，13 experts engaged in clinical and education, teaching and training experts were involved. Two rounds of expert consultation with 36 experts identified a general clinical practice training program for advanced practice nurses in China.
Results
Regarding contents and forms of hematopoietic drugs, the study concluded that advanced practice nurses in haematology department can prescribe anti-anemia drugs, anti-coagulant drugs and anti-thrombotic drugs in 2 categories and 16 drugs. Of these, four kinds of drugs should be prescribed in the form of protocol prescription. One kind of drug should be prescribed in the form of extended prescription and 11 drugs should be prescribed in the form of independent/extended or agreed/extended prescription. Regarding training content, the study obtained the training content of nurses' medicine prescriptions in eight clinical circumstances and the medicine prescription training content for common diseases of the blood system. The required specifications and the medicine prescription decision skills of nurses were sorted out according to different prescription types.
Conclusions
The degrees of expert authority were both higher in consultations. Moreover, the results after consultation were reliable. It was recommended that haematology APNs could prescribe anti-anaemic drugs and anti-coagulation and anti-thrombotic drugs. Furthermore, most drugs should be prescribed in the form of independent/extended or agreed/extended prescriptions. The establishment of a medicine prescription training content for haematology APNs is expected to provide a reference for clinical practice education and training for drug prescriptive authority applicants for blood and hematopoietic system nurses in China.}

abstract = {Background
Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease hospitalisations associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In hospitals, HF patients are typically managed by cardiology or physician teams, with differences in patient demographics and clinical outcomes. This study utilises contemporary HF registry data to compare patient characteristics and outcomes in those with ADHF admitted into General Medicine and Cardiology units.
Methods
The Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry was utilised to identify patients hospitalised with ADHF 30-day period in each of four consecutive years. We compared patient characteristics, pharmacological management and outpatient follow-up of patients admitted to General Medicine and Cardiology units. Primary outcome measures included in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.
Results
Between 2014 and 2017, a total of 1,253 patients with ADHF admissions were registered, with 53% admitted in General Medicine units and 47% in Cardiology units. General Medicine patients were more likely to be older (82 vs 71 years; p<0.001), female (51% vs 34%; p<0.001), and have higher prevalence of comorbidities and preserved left ventricular function (p<0.001). There were no differences in primary outcome measures between General Medicine and Cardiology in terms of: in-hospital mortality (5.0% vs 3.9%; p=0.35), 30-day readmission (23.4% vs 23.6%; p=0.93), and 30-day mortality (10.0% vs 8.0%; p=0.21).
Conclusions
Hospitalised patients with HF continue to have high mortality and rehospitalisation rates. The choice of treatment by General Medicine or Cardiology units, based on the particular medical profile and individual needs of the patients, provides equivalent outcomes.}

Its etiology is yet undiscovered and pathogenesis has tangled elements; therefore, it receives symptomatic management rather than eradicative treatment. This is reflected in lower levels of quality of life and poorer prognosis. The disease is described by Western medicine techniques to be stimulated by an antigen, that is thought to be pathogenic bacteria. It was also discovered that changes in bacterial community of the gastrointestinal tract and liver reflect as changes in the oral microbial community, giving rise to overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. On the other hand, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long described oral lichen planus as a consequence of spleen, liver and kidney deficiency with blood stasis. So, the authors question if the absolute truth about this mysterious disease is somewhere between the concepts of Western medicine and TCM. This correspondence aims to direct the attention to a more wholistic method of assessing and studying the disease following TCM footsteps. By doing so, OLP is expected to be effectively treated and its jeopardy would be a fairytale of the past. If future research corroborates the idea of this communication, a patient having oral lichen planus -who is nowadays asked to adapt with the disease and palliate its symptoms- will finally be cured of the disease completely.}

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and pain reduction, hospital readmission, and joint replacement in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) prescription patterns were further analyzed to confirm the association with prognosis and quality of life in OA patients.
Methods
We retrospectively followed 3,850 hospitalized patients with osteoarthritis between January 2018 and December 2022 using the hospital's HIS system. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used for data matching. Cox's proportional risk model was used to assess the impact of various factors on the outcomes of patients with OA, including pain worsening, readmission, and joint replacement. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve was applied to determine the impact of TCM intervention time on patient outcomes. Data mining methods including association rules, cluster analysis, and random walks have been used to assess the efficacy of TCM.
Results
The utilization rate of TCM in OA patients was 67.01% (2,511/3,747). After PSM matching, 1,228 TCM non-user patients and 1,228 TCM user patients were eventually included. The outcomes of pain worsening, re-admission rate, and joint replacement rate of the TCM non-user group were observably higher than those of the TCM user group with OA (p < 0.05). Based on the Cox proportional risk model, TCM is an independent protective factor. Compared with non-TCM users, TCM users had 58.4% lower rates of pain, 51.1% lower rates of re-admission, and 42% lower rates of joint replacement. In addition, patients in the high-exposure subgroup (TCM＞24 months) had a markedly lower risk of outcome events than those in the low-exposure subgroup (TCM ≤24 months). Data mining methods have shown that TCM therapy can significantly improve immune-inflammatory indices, VAS scores, and SF-36 scale scores in OA patients.
Conclusion
s TCM acts as a protective factor to improve the prognosis of patients with OA, and the benefits of long-term use of herbal medicines are even greater.}
