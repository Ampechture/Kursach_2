abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a low-cost, simple, fast, and non-invasive test. It can reflect the heart's electrical activity and provide valuable diagnostic clues about the health of the entire body. Therefore, ECG has been widely used in various biomedical applications such as arrhythmia detection, disease-specific detection, mortality prediction, and biometric recognition. In recent years, ECG-related studies have been carried out using a variety of publicly available datasets, with many differences in the datasets used, data preprocessing methods, targeted challenges, and modeling and analysis techniques. Here we systematically summarize and analyze the ECG-based automatic analysis methods and applications. Specifically, we first reviewed 22 commonly used ECG public datasets and provided an overview of data preprocessing processes. Then we described some of the most widely used applications of ECG signals and analyzed the advanced methods involved in these applications. Finally, we elucidated some of the challenges in ECG analysis and provided suggestions for further research.}

To identify the major active components of the C. tricuspidate leaf extract (CLE), HPLC-DAD analysis was conducted with a standard mixture of six flavonoids (rutin, isoquercitrin, nicotiflorin, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, and kaempferol). The unknown peaks were determined via molecular networking analysis using the mass dataset obtained by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS). For the subsequent pharmacokinetic study, CLE (1 g/kg) was orally administered to rats, and plasma samples were collected. The product ion mass data of plasma samples using LC-QTOF/MS were obtained and subjected to molecular networking analysis. The resulting molecular networking map indicated that the glucuronide metabolites of quercetin and kaempferol were the major circulating species. Accordingly, quercetin and kaempferol were determined following β-glucuronidase treatment, and their pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. These findings indicate that the proposed molecular network-based approaches are potential and efficient methods for the pharmacokinetic study of herbal medicines.}

However, most of its therapeutic approaches, like various medicinal herb recipes, lack impeccable evidence from rigorously designed laboratory studies and clinical trials for their effectiveness, adversity, and underlying mechanisms. In recent decades the Chinese government has injected prodigious funding into TCM research, especially into those projects that dissect how medicinal herbs affect the expression of genes along one or more molecular signaling pathways to achieve their effects. However, most researchers in the funded projects are TCM practitioners who lack training in the theory and techniques of molecular biology. For example, reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions are routinely used techniques in TCM research, but few of the researchers know well the principles and pitfalls of these techniques. As a result, the design and performance of the experiments, as well as the explanations and conclusions on the resulting data have often become porous, fallible, or biased. This worrisome trend needs to be corrected by tight collaborations among TCM practitioners, western medicine experts, and molecular biology pundits on the experimental design and performance and on interpretations of the resulting data.}

abstract = {Objective
Causes of and treatments for long-COVID syndrome remain unknown. Drawing on uncertainty management theory (UMT), this study elucidates the communicative nature of crowdsourced medicine as a means by which COVID “long-haulers” respond to their poorly understood illness.
Methods
31,892 posts on the long-haulers subreddit (r/covidlonghaulers) were analyzed, starting with its creation date, July 24th, 2020, until January 7, 2021. The Meaning Extraction Method was used to identify clusters of words that mathematically group together across the text observations.
Results
Analyses yielded 16 distinct factors of words, which we thematized based on their composition, the data, and UMT. The 16 themes encompassed symptoms (e.g., pain, respiratory, sensory), diagnostic concerns (testing, diagnosis), broad health concerns (immunity, physical activity, diet), chronicity, support, identity, and anxiety.
Conclusion
Findings provide a succinct, yet robust set of themes reflecting the information-seeking (i.e., “This is happening to me”) and support-seeking functions of long-haulers’ talk (i.e., “Is this happening to you?”). Findings have implications for collective uncertainty management, online crowdsourcing, and patient advocacy.
Practice implications
We recommend that health care providers employ sensitivity when addressing the anxiety that long-haulers are experiencing while also validating that their physical symptoms are real. Online communities help long-haulers manage their uncertainty.}

It makes the extracted information unavailable or inaccurate, limiting its application in the detection of complex components. Therefore, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) that was superior to traditional spectral analysis has been established, by extracting useful information under certain chemical or physical stimulus from a series of spectra to improve the spectral resolution. In this study, with the identification of the different origins and parts of Panax notoginseng as an example. First, as a comparison, the attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) of P. notoginseng samples combined with chemometric methods was applied to identify it. Then, we generated synchronous and asynchronous 2D-COS spectral images from the fingerprint regions in the spectrum, and established a Residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) to identify the different origins and parts. Finally, the externally verified was applied to evaluate the accuracy of the model. By comparison, the 2D-COS was more suitable for the identification of the origins and parts of P. notoginseng than traditional spectroscopy. The identification accuracy of these samples of synchronous 2D-COS spectral images in the training set and test set were both greater than 99%. And the results of the externally verified indicated that synchronous 2D-COS spectral images were significantly outperforming asynchronous 2D-COS spectral images, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the samples are both better than 0.99. Furthermore, when the sample number was relatively small or large differences in sample number were large, the synchronous 2D-COS spectral images could also successfully distinguish the different origins and parts well of P. notoginseng. In general, the ResNet model could provide a better discriminant model, and perform high-resolution processing.}

Herein, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of DST for treating NAFLD through modification of the liver and stool metabolome and microbiome by using STAM mice as a model of NAFLD. STAM mice were fed a high-fat diet with or without 3 % DST for 3 weeks. Plasma and liver of STAM, STAM with DST, and C57BL/6J (“Normal”) mice were collected at 9 weeks, and stools at 4, 6, and 9 weeks of age. The liver pathology, metabolome and stool microbiome were analyzed. DST ameliorated the NAFLD activity score of STAM mice and decreased the levels of several liver lipid mediators such as arachidonic acid and its derivatives. In normal mice, nine kinds of family accounted for 94.1 % of microbiome composition; the total percentage of these family was significantly decreased in STAM mice (45.6 %), and DST administration improved this imbalance in microbiome composition (65.2 %). In stool samples, DST increased ursodeoxycholic acid content and altered several amino acids, which were correlated with changes in the gut microbiome and liver metabolites. In summary, DST ameliorates NAFLD by decreasing arachidonic acid metabolism in the liver; this amelioration seems to be associated with crosstalk among components of the liver, intestinal environment, and microbiome.}

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
For thousands of years, different cultural groups have used and transformed natural resources for medicinal purposes focused on psychological or neurological conditions. Some of these are recognized as central nervous system (CNS) disorders and diseases, whereas other ethnopsychiatric interpretations are explained in culture-specific terms. In traditional Mayan medicine, several herbs have been part of treatments and rituals focused on cultural and ethnomedical concepts.
Aim of review
This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the medicinal plants used in Mesoamerica by traditional healers and Mayan groups to CNS disorders and associate the traditional use with demonstrated pharmacological evidence to establish a solid foundation for directing future research.
Methods
A systematic search for primary sources of plant use reports for traditional CNS-related remedies of Mesoamerica were obtained from library catalogs, thesis and scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar; and Science Direct), and entered in a database with data analyzed in terms of the usage frequency, use by ethnic groups, plant endemism, and pharmacological investigation.
Results
A total of 155 plants used for ethnopsychiatric conditions in Mesoamerica by Mayan groups were found, encompassing 127 native species. Of these, only 49 native species have reported in vitro or in vivo pharmacological analyses. The most commonly reported ethnopsychiatric conditions are related to anxiety, depression, memory loss, epilepsy, and insomnia. The extent of the scientific evidence available to understand the pharmacological application for their use against CNS disorders varied between different plant species, with the most prominent evidence shown by Annona cherimola, Justicia pectoralis, J. spicigera, Mimosa pudica, Persea americana, Petiveria alliacea, Piper amalago, Psidium guajava, Tagetes erecta and T. lucida.
Conclusion
Available pharmacological data suggest that different plant species used in traditional Mayan medicine may target the CNS, mainly related to GABA, serotonin, acetylcholine, or neuroprotective pathways. However, more research is required, given the limited data regarding mechanism of action at the preclinical in vivo level, identification of active compounds, scarce number of clinical studies, and the dearth of peer-reviewed studies.}

abstract = {Despite the availability of 28 antiseizure medications (ASMs), one-third of people with epilepsy fail to achieve sustained freedom from seizures. Clinical outcome is even poorer for children with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), many of which are due to single-gene mutations. Discovery of causative genes, however, has paved the way to understanding the molecular mechanism underlying these epilepsies, and to the rational application, or development, of precision treatments aimed at correcting the specific functional defects or their consequences. This article provides an overview of current progress toward precision medicine (PM) in the management of monogenic pediatric epilepsies, by focusing on four different scenarios, namely (a) rational selection of ASMs targeting specifically the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms; (b) development of targeted therapies based on novel molecules; (c) use of dietary treatments or food constituents aimed at correcting specific metabolic defects; and (d) repurposing of medications originally approved for other indications.

Quantification of the metal or semimetal bound with the organic molecule, and the control of foreign elements are very important to ensure the quality of the future medicinal products. In the synthesized compounds of Mn with dihydroquercetin (Mn-DHQ) and Se with arabinogalactan (Se-AG), it was required to determine the content of Mn and Se. The authors of the paper applied wavelength-dispersive (WDXRF) and total-reflection (TXRF) X-ray fluorescence methods to quantify above elements. In absence of suitable certified reference materials, the synthetic samples were prepared for calibration of WDXRF spectrometer. Two sample preparation procedures were used in the TXRF: acid digestion and dissolution by water. The Mn contents in compounds with DHQ amounted to 13.5–17.4% by WDXRF and 13.1–18.2% by TXRF. The Se contents in compounds with AG did to 0.5–12.9% and 0.5–13.6%, respectively. Statistical data processing did not reveal a significant difference between the results of two methods. To check the foreign elements in the synthesized substances the X-ray spectra were recorded. Some minor peaks in the energy range of 5.9–7.5 keV were found on TXRF spectrum of the Se-AG sample as the consequence of its contamination. The Mn complexes did not contain any foreign elements. Additionally, determined element contents were compared with ones calculated through chemical formulas of resulting compounds to characterize their cleaning level from impurities.}

A literature search for relevant articles was performed on PubMed, covering COVID-19 studies published up until January 21, 2021. The findings were summarized according to general and specific activities within the NM departments. The pandemic strongly challenged NM departments: a reduction in the workforce has been experienced in almost every center in Europe due to personnel diagnosed with COVID-19 and other reasons related to the coronavirus. NM departments introduced procedures to limit COVID-19 transmission, including environmental and personal hygiene, social distancing, rescheduling of non–high-priority procedures, the correct use of personal protective equipment, and prompt identification of suspect COVID-19 cases. A proportion of the departments experienced a delay in radiopharmaceuticals supply or technical assistance during the pandemic. Furthermore, the pandemic resulted in a significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic NM procedures, as well as a reduced level of care for patients affected by diseases other than COVID-19, such as cancer or acute cardiovascular disease. Telemedicine services have been set up to maintain medical assistance for patients. COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped human work resources, patient's diagnostic and therapeutic management, operative models, radiopharmaceutical supplies, teaching, training and research of NM departments. Limits of availability of resources emerged. Nonetheless, we have to provide continuity in care, especially for fragile patients, maintaining infection control measures. Challenges that have been faced should reshape our vision and get us prepared for the future.}

We tested the anti-pathogen and growth-promoting properties of the endophytic fungi 3714, 272 fermentation broth, and 12 different TCM extractions in various solvents alone or in combination. The experiment was conducted in the field by treating gentian with various mixtures and examining their effect in controlling gentian spot blight. The combination of TCM water extractions and endophytic fungi fermentation broth, Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge (ZM), ZM-272, Cnidium monnieri (L.). Cuss. (SCZ)-3714 and ZM-SCZ-3714 significantly controlled gentian spot blight at a control rate of more than 70%. Analyses of physiological and biochemical indexes, defense enzymes, soil enzymes, and soil properties suggest a mechanism for disease resistance and growth promotion. Specifically, different combination generally increases the number of microorganisms and soil enzyme activities in the rhizosphere of gentian, resulting in improvements in the accumulation of nutrients in soil, as well as the living environment of plants. The accumulation of nutrients in soil was improved by activating defense enzymes. The levels of secondary metabolites such as gentiopicrin increased, thus improving the disease resistance of gentian. Disease resistance was accomplished by directly suppressing the pathogen causing gentian spot blight on the surface of gentian plants and in the soil. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the biological control of gentian spot blight.}

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is one of the most common medical treatments, with more than 10 million units transfused per year in the United States alone. Alloimmunization to foreign Rh proteins (RhD and RhCE) on donor RBCs remains a challenge for transfusion effectiveness and safety. Alloantibody production disproportionately affects patients with sickle cell disease who frequently receive blood transfusions and exhibit high genetic diversity in the Rh blood group system. With hundreds of RH variants now known, precise identification of Rh antibody targets is hampered by the lack of appropriate reagent RBCs with uncommon Rh antigen phenotypes. Using a combination of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming and gene editing, we designed a renewable source of cells with unique Rh profiles to facilitate the identification of complex Rh antibodies. We engineered a very rare Rh null iPSC line lacking both RHD and RHCE. By targeting the AAVS1 safe harbor locus in this Rh null background, any combination of RHD or RHCE complementary DNAs could be reintroduced to generate RBCs that express specific Rh antigens such as RhD alone (designated D--), Goa+, or DAK+. The RBCs derived from these iPSCs (iRBCs) are compatible with standard laboratory assays used worldwide and can determine the precise specificity of Rh antibodies in patient plasma. Rh-engineered iRBCs can provide a readily accessible diagnostic tool and guide future efforts to produce an alternative source of rare RBCs for alloimmunized patients.}

abstract = {Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex lifelong disorder. While previous research reported on the effectiveness of acupuncture for PCOS symptoms, robust information on how PCOS is treated in community clinical practice remains sparse. This study explores how practitioners with training and certification in biomedicine and acupuncture for menstrual and reproductive health, American Board of Oriental Reproductive Medicine (ABORM) Fellows, approach the treatment of people with PCOS within the acupuncture clinic setting.
Methods
Between February and March 2020, ABORM Fellows (n = 346) received a link to an online survey collecting characteristics of point selection, rationale, treatment frequency, and outcome measures used. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data was coded, checked for interrater reliability, and analysed using a qualitative descriptive approach.
Results
One hundred and twenty-seven ABORM Fellows responded (36.7%). Practitioners reported a pragmatic approach to the treatment of PCOS in their acupuncture clinics, consistent with practising using a partnership model, especially with respect to treatment timings and frequency, often dictated by their patients’ practical and financial considerations. Acupuncture points SP6 (Sanyinjiao), SP9 (Yinlingquan), LR3 (Taichong), EX-CA-1 (Zigong), and CV4 (Guanyuan) were commonly used, following a combination of rationales provided including Drain Damp, Tonify the Spleen, and both Qi and blood movement. Local anatomy, timing of ovulation, and knowledge from research literature on acupuncture for PCOS also influenced point selection rationale.
Conclusions
When treating PCOS in clinical practice, ABORM Fellows rely on both traditional and modern aspects of acupuncture and biomedicine to inform diagnosis, treatment, and outcome measures.}

abstract = {Introduction
Since 2019, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has mandated that all residency programs develop initiatives to recruit underrepresented in medicine (URiM) applicants to increase diversity among physicians. The literature has described a variety of recruitment strategies, but the underlying viewpoints of leaders most responsible for these efforts have not been characterized. We aimed to describe the experience and perspective of program directors around URiM recruitment.
Methods
We conducted a qualitative analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with OB-GYN program directors recruited electronically about their perspectives on URiM recruitment between August 2018 and October 2019. We coded audio transcripts from these interviews in an independent and iterative fashion. Using inductive content analysis, we derived several themes.
Results
Fourteen OB-GYN program directors participated. Themes arising from data included an acknowledgement of the contextual nature of diversity, which included not just race but also other forms of self-identity; the visual nature of recruitment efforts; the lack of consistent support for programs despite shared goals in workforce diversity; the imperative of upending traditional approaches to recruitment (e.g., undue emphasis on Step 1 scores); and finally, the prerequisites of a critical mass of URiM residents, faculty diversity and supportive culture for successful URiM recruitment.
Discussion
Our findings shed light on the motivations and obstacles that program directors face in URiM recruitment, underscoring a need for more broad-based initiatives to ensure that society is served by a healthcare workforce reflecting the diversity of our patients.}

abstract = {Background
Food prescription and culinary medicine programs are gaining popularity as tools for decreasing food insecurity, increasing personal agency, promoting healthy eating, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. However, there is a gap in understanding of how health care professionals can deliver evidence-based how-to nutrition information that is tailored for culturally diverse, low-income populations.
Objective
To understand the barriers and facilitators for healthy eating among a low-income, diverse population with diabetes, and the gaps in knowledge and training needed for registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN) to address patient barriers when implementing a food prescription and CM program in a healthcare setting.
Design
A series of nine focus groups were conducted: six focus groups with patients with diabetes (n = 40) (three in English and three in Spanish) and three focus groups with RDN employees (n = 17).
Participants/setting
A convenience sample of 40 low-income food insecure patients with diabetes receiving care at a diverse, integrated, safety net health care system in an urban setting in Texas and convenience sample of 17 RDN employees.
Statistical analysis
All focus group transcripts were examined by independent reviewers and blind catalogued and organized into common themes and subthemes based on constant comparative methodology. Investigator group consensus was reached on emergent themes and subthemes for the respective focus groups.
Results
Patients reported frustration with mixed dietary messages from different health care providers, lack of culturally inclusive recommendations, and a desire for skills to prepare tasty and healthy food. RDNs desired more training and education in cultural humility, culinary nutrition skills, and behavioral change theory.
Conclusions
Our study describes how cultural humility, practical culinary nutrition skills, and consistent and coordinated messaging can help to improve patient nutrition care. Before implementation of a food prescription and culinary medicine program, efforts should promote training of RDN staff in culinary nutrition and related areas to increase acceptability and adherence of the program for patients.}

Byur dMar Nyer lNga Ril Bu (BdNlRB) is a classic Tibetan medicine prescription for treating " white vein disease". Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system, characterized by distinct "white vein disease". In the absence of effective drugs for AD, BdNlRB may be a possible treatment for AD.
Aim of the study
To verify the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of the proved Tibetan medicine BdNlRB on Alzheimer's disease.
Materials and methods
60 APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice (Mt) and 60 Aß1-40 protein-induced AD mice (Mi) were divided into 3 groups according to the dose of BdNlRB: BdNlRB-100, BdNlRB-200 and BdNlRB-400, with 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg*weight, respectively. The mice were administrated by gavage for 8 weeks. The cognitive ability of mice was detected by Morris Water Maze, the expression of Aß protein, p-tau and microglia was detected by immunofluorescent staining, the protein expression in the hippocampus was detected by proteomics, and the abundance of fecal intestinal flora was detected by 16S RNA.
Results
The learning ability and memory ability of Mi mice were significantly improved after BdNlRB administration. The learning ability of Mt mice was significantly improved, while the memory ability was not improved after BdNlRB administration. After the treatment with low and medium doses of BdNlRB, the expression of p-tau decreased significantly (the rate of decrease in BdNlRB-100 and BdNlRB-200 groups was 8.05% and 12.7%, respectively), and the number of microglia increased (39.3% and 31.6%, respectively). BdNlRB significantly affected the protein expression in the hippocampus of Mt mice. 382 proteins in different expression in all three groups mainly involved in amino acid synthesis, fatty acid degradation, glutamine metabolism, synaptic vesicular cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, PPAR signaling pathway and Fc gamma-mediated phagocytosis were activated. Meanwhile, the administration of BdNlRB can regulate the intestinal flora of Mt mice, which reduces the abundance of Muribaculum and uncultured bacteroidales bacterium, and improves the abundance of Ruminococcus-1 and Ruminiclostridium-9.
Conclusion
The oral administration of BdNlRB significantly improved the cognitive ability of AD mice, and neuroinflammation and intestinal flora regulation were the possible mechanisms.}

Pregnancy-related illnesses are commonly treated by herbal medicines in our country as well as around the world.
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to find out how common herbal use is among Bangladeshi pregnant women, what factors influence it, and how it affects pregnancy outcomes.
Methods
Random sampling was done among women who gave birth between July and September 2021 in the maternity ward of an NGO-based clinic and were requested to participate in the face-to-face questionnaire-based survey.
Results
275 women (71.80%) out of 383 used herbs during their pregnancy. Only 27.42% of women who used herbs informed their doctors, and 91.03% of users reported no side effects. Most users thought that herbs were safer than allopathic medications (71.8%). The ground behind the choosing herb was suggestion from family members or self-medication (34.73% and 31.83%, respectively). Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) (73.10%), lemon (Citrus limon L. Burm. F) (71.27%), black seed (Nigella sativa) (66.55%), mustard oil (Brassica Juncea Mane Kancor) (65.45%), and prune (Prunus domestica) (41.45%) were the most widely utilized herbs. The majority of women used herbs on a daily basis. There were statistically significant differences in several socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy outcomes between herb users and non-users.
Conclusions
The usage of herbs throughout pregnancy is quite prevalent amid Bangladeshi womenfolk, according to this study. Herbs appear to be safe when used often during pregnancy. Furthermore, physicians or medical practitioners have to play a vital role in ensuring the safe usage of herbs among pregnant women.}

abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of propranolol were investigated in obese and healthy weight groups. Research studies in relation to the presented topic were gathered, evaluated, and compared to distinguish variabilities involved amongst different lipophilic drugs and how they impacted the clinical effectiveness. Propranolol is a lipophilic drug so it was predicted that the pharmacokinetics would differ between obese and ideal-weight individuals. Previous research in other lipophilic drugs shows a trend to increase the volume of distribution and half-life in obese compared to ideal weight individuals. However, the majority of both clinical and preclinical studies gathered in this review, found a decrease in the volume of distribution (VD) and clearance, and minimal significant difference in the half-life, in the obese group when compared with the ideal weight group. Different explanations for this comparison have been theorised including differing tissue blood flow, plasma protein binding, or hepatic clearance in obese compared with ideal weight populations; though the exact reasoning as to why propranolol does not follow the general trend for lipophilic drugs is yet to be determined. These findings regarding propranolol pharmacokinetics can be utilised towards further research and development in personalised medicine for patients with obesity and comorbid cardiovascular disease. The comparative studies highlighted the pharmacokinetic parameters which demonstrated a need for personalised dosage regimes for propranolol and a proposed research direction to understand why the difference exists between these population groups. With the prevalence of obesity continuing to rise, the relative pharmacokinetics of drugs must be evaluated in obese patient groups in order to inform drug dosing regimens and improve current clinical practice.}

abstract = {Clinical databases, particularly those composed of big data, face growing security challenges. Blockchain, the open, decentralized, distributed public ledger technology powering cryptocurrency, records transactions securely without the need for third-party verification. In the health care setting, decentralized blockchain networks offer a secure interoperable gateway for clinical research and practice data. Here, we discuss recent advances and potential future directions for the application of blockchain and its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiovascular medicine. We first review the basic underlying concepts of this technology and contextualise it within the spectrum of current, well known applications. We then consider specific applications for cardiovascular medicine and research in areas such as high-throughput gene sequencing, wearable technologies, and clinical trials. We then evaluate current challenges to effective implementation and future directions. We also summarise the health care applications that can be realised by combining decentralized blockchain computing platforms (for data security) and AI computing (for data analytics). By leveraging high-performance computing and AI capable of securely managing large and rapidly expanding medical databases, blockchain incorporation can provide clinically meaningful predictions, help advance research methodology (eg, via robust AI-blockchain decentralized clinical trials), and provide virtual tools in clinical practice (eg, telehealth, sensory-based technologies, wearable medical devices). Integrating AI and blockchain approaches synergistically amplifies the strengths of both technologies to create novel solutions to serve the objective of providing precision cardiovascular medicine.
Résumé
Les bases de données cliniques, en particulier celles composées de mégadonnées, font face à des défis croissants en matière de sécurité. La chaîne de blocs, une technologie de grand livre public ouverte, décentralisée et distribuée, qui alimente la cryptomonnaie, permet d’enregistrer les transactions de manière sécuritaire sans nécessiter une vérification par un tiers. Dans le milieu de soins de santé, les réseaux décentralisés de la chaîne de blocs constituent une passerelle interopérable sécurisée pour les données de recherche clinique et celles recueillies dans le cadre de la pratique. Dans cet article, nous discutons des percées récentes et des possibles orientations futures pour l’application de la chaîne de blocs et son intégration dans l’intelligence artificielle (IA) en médecine cardiovasculaire. Nous examinerons en premier lieu les concepts fondamentaux sous-jacents de cette technologie avant de les contextualiser dans le spectre des applications actuelles bien connues. Nous évaluerons ensuite les applications propres à la médecine cardiovasculaire et à la recherche dans des domaines comme le séquençage de gènes à haut débit, les technologies portables et les essais cliniques. Nous ferons ensuite le point sur les obstacles à leur mise en œuvre efficace et les orientations futures. Nous résumerons également les applications pouvant être mises en œuvre dans les soins de santé en combinant les plateformes décentralisées fondées sur la technologie de la chaîne de blocs (pour la sécurité des données) et l’IA (pour l’analyse de données). En s’appuyant sur le calcul haute performance et l’IA capable de gérer en toute sécurité de grandes bases de données médicales en expansion rapide, l’intégration de la chaîne de blocs peut fournir des données prévisionnelles cliniquement significatives, contribuer à l’avancement de la méthodologie de recherche (p. ex. par l’entremise de solides essais cliniques décentralisés fondés sur l’association IA-chaîne de blocs) et fournir des outils virtuels pour la pratique clinique (p. ex. télésanté, technologies sensorielles, dispositifs médicaux portables). L’intégration des approches IA et de la technologie de la chaîne de blocs amplifie de manière synergique les points forts de ces deux technologies pour créer de nouvelles solutions avec l’objectif d’offrir une médecine cardiovasculaire de précision.}

Initial successful attempts of visualization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue with 75-selenomethionine were not translated into clinical practice due to the limited availability and rapid expansion of effective single-photon tracers and imaging protocols. The approach was revived through carbon-11 labelling of methionine and positioned as a useful second-line imaging option in patients with negative or nondiagnostic results of first-line imaging procedures. Fluorine-18 labelled glucose as the most widely used PET tracer in oncological imaging was shown to be useful in its usual clinical context of staging and restaging in the rare case of parathyroid carcinoma. Recently, imaging of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue with carbon-11 and in particular fluorine-18 labelled choline was demonstrated to have far superior diagnostic performance over conventional imaging. With the additional advantages of shorter imaging time, reduced radiation exposure and increasing availability, it is expected to evolve into the first-line imaging procedure of choice in hyperparathyroidism.}

Metabolic syndrome refers to the diseases that are associated with impairment in the metabolism of body essential substances glucose, protein, or fat and include obesity, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, and even some types of cancers. With the increasing size of aged population and modern sedentary lifestyle the metabolic disorders are increasing at an alarming rate. According to WHO report, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight in 2016. Of these over 650 million were obese. Many aspects and symptoms of the metabolic syndrome are moderately treatable with modern medicines available today based on their pharmacological properties. However, these interventions are almost always associated with moderate to severe side effects that abate their therapeutic importance. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative approaches for the management of metabolic syndrome and the associated disorders as an increasing number of patients and practitioners are looking for substitutes to puissant pills and injectable. Coincidentally, a plethora of preclinical and some clinical investigational studies has provided a number of promising evidence-based complementary and alternative approaches, especially plants-based medicines. Herbal medicines have drawn immense attention in this area considering the assumption that these medicines are associated with little or no adverse effects. The herbal medicines may offer patients and practitioners safe and effective alternatives to target not only the multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome but also obesity, which directly leads to former and many other disorders. This article discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and population-wide burden of metabolic syndrome and reviews several herbal medicines and approaches reported to be effective for the treatment of metabolic disease. Finally, we will apply evidence-based principles or pharmacological approach to discuss the various herbal therapies available for the treatment of metabolic syndrome for the sole purpose of educating the medical fraternity to increase the awareness about herbal medicines.}

Late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) syndrome is an endocrine disorder that is characterized by low levels of androgen and a subsequent decline in various physical functions. Regarding the treatment of LOH syndrome, the use of several agents, primarily testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), has been reported. In addition to TRT, certain therapies for LOH syndrome commonly include counseling, antidepressants, PDE5i and herbal medicine (Kampo).
Objective
In the present study, the effectiveness of initial treatment by combination therapy using TRT, herbal medicine and PDE5i in male patients with LOH were determined. The patients’ clinical background, changes in symptom scores and clinical parameters were analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the treatment intervention.
Methods
Between April 2017 and September 2018, 21 patients with LOH-associated symptoms, including chief complaints of decreased libido, ED, depression and general fatigue, visited the menopausal outpatient clinic. At their first visit, the patients were evaluated by reviewing their medical history, a physical examination and detection of clinical parameters, and their general LOH symptoms were judged according to Heinemann's Ageing Males’ Symptoms (AMS) scale. Voiding function was evaluated by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and sexual function was evaluated by the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score. Blood screening, including hemoglobin (Hb), aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, creatinine, total cholesterol (T-Cho), triglyceride, blood sugar and PSA, and endocrinological variables including FT, LH and FSH were determined prior to monitoring endocrinological variables for any treatment of LOH. TRT or an oral treatment, such as herbal medicines or PDE5i, was provided for each symptom. For the TRT, T enanthate was administered via intramuscular injection every four weeks for a total of 12 weeks or testosterone ointment was applied. The most appropriate herbal medicine was administered to the patients according to their pathogenic alterations. A total of three traditional Japanese herbal medicines were candidates for LOH treatment in the present study. Total of 21 patients were enrolled and after 12 weeks, the clinical efficacy was evaluated based on improvement of LOH symptoms via same laboratory parameters and questionnaires.
Results
The overall AMS scores, as well as the psychological, physical and sexual AMS factors prior to and after treatment in the TRT, testosterone enanthate (T enanthate) monotherapy and T enanthate + PDE5i treatment groups were significantly improved. In the herbal medicine group, only the AMS physiological factors were significantly improved after treatment compared with the baseline. The improvement of the overall AMS scores, as well as the physiological and sexual AMS factors, were significantly negatively correlated with the free testosterone (FT) value prior to treatment.
Conclusions
Treatment with combination therapy using TRT, herbal medicine and PDE5i improved AMS scores in patients with LOH syndrome. Particularly in patients with LOH syndrome and low FT, the symptoms were significantly improved following combination therapy.

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily affects the lungs but can spread to other organs. This is known as extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), which includes bone TB and central nervous system TB (CNS-TB). EPTB can alter the normal pathophysiological state of the affected tissue and affect drug absorption. Current treatment of bone TB and CNS-TB involves a combination of anti-TB drugs which can result in drug resistance; and also, the surgical intervention treatment, which has a slew of drawbacks such as, restricted donor sites and potential harvesting morbidity for autogenous bone grafts limitation. However, to mitigate drug resistance and surgical limitation of bone TB, a multi-purpose targeted therapy platform is necessary, capable of delivering drugs while promoting local bone regeneration. Although various nanotechnological-based drug delivery systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles, vesicular carriers, and metallic nanoparticles have been explored, they often lack mechanical properties and have yielded limited results in facilitating bone regrowth. This review article examines the current use of nanotechnology as a drug delivery system for anti-TB drugs, encompassing both pulmonary TB and EPTB treatment. Additionally, we explore the potential of integrating these nanoparticle systems into bioactive three-dimensional biomaterial scaffolds fabricated using the 3D-printing technology, with a specific focus on their ability to achieve concurrent bone regeneration and localised (targeted) drug delivery. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of bone TB and CNS-TB.}

abstract = {Purpose
Quality assurance (QA) is critical to the success of radiation therapy (RT) for patients with cancer and affects clinical outcomes. We report longitudinal findings of a prospective peer review evaluation system implemented at a major academic health system as part of RT QA during a 10-year period.
Methods and Materials
All cases treated within our department undergo prospective multidisciplinary peer review and are assigned a grade (A, B, or C). “A” cases require no changes, “B” cases require minor modification, and “C” cases require major modification before treatment planning. The z-ratio test for the significance of the difference between the 5-year baseline (2012-2016) and follow-up (2017-2021) period was used to compare grades between the 2 periods. A 2-tailed P value <.05 was considered significant.
Results
Of the 20,069 cases, 15,659 (78%) were curative and were analyzed. The fraction of A cases decreased from 74.8% (baseline) to 64.5% (follow-up), whereas B cases increased from 19.4% to 35.4% and C cases decreased from 5.8% to 0.1%. Of the 9 treatment locations, the main hospital site had a higher percentage of A grades relative to community locations in the baseline (78.6% vs 67.8%; P < .002) and follow-up (66.9% vs 62.3%; P < .002) periods. There was a decrease in the percentage of A cases from the baseline to the follow-up period regardless of plan type (complex vs intermediate vs simple). There was a decrease in the percentage of A cases among specialists from baseline to follow-up (78.2% to 67.7%; P < .002) and among generalists from baseline to follow-up (69.7% to 61.7%; P < .002).
Conclusions
Our 10-year experience in contour peer review identified increased opportunities in improving treatment plan quality over time. The drop in A scores and rise in B scores suggests increased scrutiny and findings-based improvements over time, whereas the drop in C scores indicates amelioration of “major failures” addressed in the startup years. Peer review rounds upstream of treatment planning provide valuable RT QA and should be considered by other departments to enhance the quality and consistency of RT.}

The wide and easy access to these products is an alarming issue to the global health systems and undermined the health of patients, especially with the thrive of online commerce. To tackle this threat to public health, new ways to access these products should be identified and detection technologies should be strengthened. The overarching aim of this study was to investigate if herbal supplements sold online claiming to be natural alternatives to Viagra® were amongst these SF medical products and how effective different analytical techniques are in providing information about these products. 3 products which claimed to be herbal supplements for men sexual performance were purchased from an e-commerce platform. Two products were received as unregistered generic sildenafil citrate tablets manufactured in India (and thus different to the products information on the website) while one product was received in the same packaging as shown on the website, claiming to be an herbal product. Nevertheless, all products were proven to contain sildenafil citrate, the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Viagra® after the comprehensive analytical tests. The results elucidated that the quality standards for the unregistered generic sildenafil citrate tablets were fulfilled according to the British Pharmacopeia, but the falsified product failed the quality tests and contained approximately 200 mg sildenafil citrate, which is equivalent to 2-fold of the daily maximum dose. Furthermore, physical characterisations, including powder x-ray diffraction and thermal analysis were performed and revealed that the polymorphic forms of sildenafil citrate were different, demonstrating the importance of employing thermal analysis in addition to the conventional analysis techniques for the substandard and falsified medical products. These techniques provided valuable insights into the physical form of the active ingredient in these products. What is more, the ease with which these SF products were obtained and confirmed to be misleading consumers emphasises the need for tighter regulation for e-commerce websites in line with those enforced on online pharmacies.}

abstract = {Background
To the best of our knowledge, there are no reporting guidelines for design, conduct and reporting of Finite Element studies in health sciences. We intend to propose specific and detailed guidelines for reporting these studies.
Method
After recognizing the need to have uniform guidelines for reporting of finite element analysis in medicine and dentistry, a group of 5 researchers working on FEA as their research area met in the summer of 2020 and drafted the methodology for the development of such guidelines. Each researcher individually made a list of major headings required for reporting these studies and met again in September 2020 to finalize the domains. Subsequently, sub headings and details were charted. The draft list of items for reporting the guidelines were presented to a larger team of 15 experts and some changes were further made based on their inputs.
Results
The guidelines entail seven major domains and their sub-domains, including parameters for model structure, segmentation, mesh structure, force application and model validation, etc. This checklist aims to improvise the reporting and consistency of FEA studies.
Conclusion
We hope that the usage and adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community would result in more thoughtful and uniform documentation. Also, the confidence in the results would be enhanced through model reproducibility, reusability and accountability. The proposed guidelines were named as ‘Reporting of in-silico studies using finite element analysis in medicine’ and the term ‘RIFEM’ was used as acronym.}

As a result of such immunological surveillance system, host immune response also edits cancer cells which is called as cancer immunoediting process. Interferon (IFN) produced by cancer antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and its downstream signaling pathway play an important role in cancer immunoediting process. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as anti-PD-1 antibody is an emerging cancer immunotherapy with high efficacy in the clinic, however, the clinical response has clear limitation. At present, many pre-clinical and clinical studies have been conducted to test the effective combination therapy with ICB that may enhance the anti-tumor immunity. Some type of Kampo medicines have long been expected to exert immunostimulatory effects as a biological response modifier (BRM), and in particular, Juzentaihoto has been known to modulate anti-immunity in various pre-clinical mouse cancer models. In this talk, I will present our recent data of cancer cell-host immune interaction in vivo by monitoring the antigen-specific CTL responses using bioluminescence imaging guide to dissect the immunological features of CTL during cancer immune editing process. I will also share our effort to test the combination of Juzentaihoto with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in pre-clinical mouse cancer model.}

Limited data exists regarding different specialties care of geriatric (>74 years-old) trauma patients (GTPs). We created a “Tier-III” designation for ground-level fall (GLF) GTPs to be managed by EM, with a trauma consult as needed.
Materials and methods
A single-center comparison of PRE (1/1/2013-4/30/2016) versus POST (5/1/2016-11/30/2019) Tier-III GTP GLFs. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included admissions, trauma bay procedures and length of stay (LOS).
Results
1,652 patients (314-PRE vs. 1,338-POST) were included. The admission rate was lower in the POST (56.9% vs. 88.9%, p < 0.001) cohort. There were no differences in LOS or trauma bay procedures between cohorts (p > 0.05). On multivariable analysis there was similar associated risk of mortality between groups (p = 0.68).
Conclusion
The associated risk of mortality was similar between GLF GTP cohorts managed initially by EM and trauma surgeons, however the admission rate was lower in the POST group suggesting EM management may improve hospital bed utilization.}

abstract = {Introduction: Despite governmental and industry-sponsored efforts, clinical trial participation among rural residents and racial and ethnic minorities remains low. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 directed the NIH to establish guidelines for inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration launched an action plan to improve the quality of demographic subgroup data collection, identify barriers to enrollment, employ strategies to increase participation, and promote transparency of related data. However subsequent studies (Green et al. Health Aff. March 2022, Kanapuru et al. Blood Advances. March 2022.) showed no improvement in participation of racial minorities, including Blacks and Hispanics since this plan was enacted. Various complex system- and individual-based factors, including lack of clinical trial availability; lack of diversity in the investigator work force; scant patient and provider awareness of clinical trials; lack of trust in the health care system; and issues with access to care-often driven by financial, geographic, or social constraints (Allison et al. Cureus. Apr 2022.), and stringent eligibility criteria are deemed responsible. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) IMPACT (Influential Medicine Providing Access to Clinical Trials) research grant strives to bridge this unrelenting care gap. Methods: The LLS IMPACT program includes a 5-year research grant which was launched in 2021. The IMPACT grants support the establishment of clinical trial networks involving academic cancer centers (“Hubs”) linked to community clinics and oncology centers (“Spokes”). The program's overall goal is to provide patients access to trials through participation at the community sites. Initially, 3 institutional sites were selected to participate. These institutions had unique and tailored strategies to improve engagement of underrepresented patients, including black, indigenous, people of color, Hispanic, Latina/Latino, and people from rural communities in vastly different climates and local cultures. The IMPACT grant expanded to encompass 4 additional sites given the imminent needs and clamor of the hematology clinical trials community (Figure 1A). The catchment areas and strategies employed at each institution are summarized in the table (Figure 1B). Results: At the start of the grant period, focus was on building clinical research infrastructure and opening non-interventional clinical trials to teach personnel about clinical research and create relationships with patients. Other programs such as webinar series, tumor boards, technological advancements, and educational workshops were also established to enhance engagement among physicians, match patients to clinical trials, and to provide clinical trial education to potential patients. One trial that has seen early success is the CHIVE IMPACT trial, a non-interventional registry and biorepository which has enrolled 24 patients at a rural and underserved site as of July 2023. The purpose of CHIVE is to enroll patients who have clonal hematopoiesis (CH) or are at risk of CH and follow prospectively in efforts to understand risk of progression and potential for early intervention. The Universal Protocol is another biorepository trial which has more than tripled its enrollment number at a community site between 2021 and 2022. Of the 63 patients enrolled in 2022, 66% of them identified as a race other than White. As our core goal is to increase access to interventional trials, we hope to bring industry sponsored phase II and phase III studies to underrepresented areas that serve a broad patient population. Lack of financial resources, lack of transportation and distance to trial sites, and residual distrust of the medical community (e.g., legacy of Tuskegee experiments) are barriers the grantees are focused on overcoming to enroll the intended populations into clinical trials. Conclusion: The innovative strategies employed to expand access to clinical trials for underrepresented population at the various institutions through the LLS's IMPACT research grant can be utilized during clinical trials design and implementation phases to improve generalizability of clinical trials in hematologic malignancies. In the third year of this program, 7 participating sites are engaging impactful strategies (Figure 1B) which will be reported at the end of the grant period.}

1. Self-report the ability to use a palliative extubation simulation curriculum to teach key palliative care topics to learners across various levels. 2. Self-report the ability to mitigate communication and procedural errors associated with suboptimal palliative extubations to provide maximum comfort for patients and families at end of life.
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic revealed gaps in the provision of end-of-life (EOL) care. In particular, the high number of mechanically ventilated patients at the EOL highlighted the need to standardize evidence-based palliative extubation (PE) amidst significant practice variation. Suboptimal PE practices can worsen symptoms, inappropriately hasten death, and add undue stress on patients, families, and healthcare staff. Effective training models are needed to standardize evidence-based PE. Simulation-based learning (SBL) has been shown to effectively improve medical knowledge, procedural proficiency, and interprofessional communication, all of which are necessary to successfully perform a PE. Unfortunately, the use of SBL in palliative care (PC) education is sparse.
Methods
An innovative educational activity using high-fidelity simulation and SBL models was created to teach key PC topics and skills within the context of a simulated PE procedure. The curriculum consists of a 1-hour didactic followed by 2 hours of simulation, divided into 4 sections. The simulation is designed to teach complex symptom management, communication strategies, and leadership skills. Each section concludes with a debrief to provide feedback and teaching points. This curriculum was piloted over multiple years among palliative medicine fellows. It will expand to include medical students this academic year with the plan to be further incorporated into medical resident education in the future. The following validated questionnaires will be used to study the efficacy of this SBL model: Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale, Simulation Design Scale, and Educational Practices Questionnaire. Participants will complete the questionnaires following the simulation.
Conclusion
Multiple specialties have adopted SBL as an effective modality to enhance training. The use of SBL in palliative medicine education is relatively sparse. An innovative PE-simulation educational activity may provide an optimal way to teach key PC concepts across graduate and undergraduate medical education.}

abstract = {Outcomes
1. Self-report the ability to describe what barriers residents perceive to having serious illness conversations in the outpatient setting. 2. Self-report the ability describe what interventions residents perceive to be most useful to increase their ability to have serious illness conversations in the outpatient setting.
Background
While primary care providers regularly engage patients in serious illness conversations (SIC), it is not well known what specific challenges resident physicians face to achieving this Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competency. This project assessed resident perceptions of barriers to conducting outpatient SIC as well as potential interventions to address these barriers.
Methods
We distributed an electronic survey to all categorical internal medicine and medicine-psychiatry residents at our institution. Questions addressed outpatient SIC barriers and potential interventions in several domains: structural issues, personal knowledge, and communication skills. We reported results using descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, comparing responses by year in training (interns vs second and third years). Likert-scale responses were dichotomized to a “not at all or slightly” versus “moderate or extreme” barrier or helpful intervention.
Results
Out of 149 residents, 71 completed the survey (response rate 48%). Highest-scoring barriers to having outpatient SIC were at the structural level, relating to (1) lack of time in clinic (99%), (2) need to prioritize other medical problems (94%), and (3) lack of continuity (62%). Discomfort with communication frameworks was not reported as a major barrier (21%). Highest-scoring interventions included the ability to schedule dedicated SIC visits with themselves (96%) or with another provider (82%). When comparing interns to second and third years, interns were significantly less confident in their ability to have SICs and more likely to report lack of knowledge areas (ie, not understanding SIC components, patient prognosis, or how to fill out paperwork, p<0.05).
Conclusions
Residents report significant structural barriers to SIC conversations, such as limitations in time, continuity, and competing medical priorities, that may warrant greater program attention to interventions such as clinic schedules and workflow. Additional trainings may be most beneficial if targeted to interns at the beginning of their medical training.}

abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate the current standing of the oral medicine (OM) curriculum in the predoctoral dental programs in the United States and its relation to the students’ perceptions of OM as a postgraduate specialty program option.
Study Design
A cross-sectional anonymous electronic survey was distributed by email to the academic deans of all Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA)-accredited dental schools in the United States. The survey consisted of 2 parts: (1) Part A was completed by the fourth-year dental students and (2) Part B was completed by the academic deans or faculty members serving in a similar role. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses using JMP 15.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
A total of 4 rounds of surveys were sent between November 2020 and January 2021. The response rate from the associate deans was 28.4% (n = 19). The mean number of American Board of Oral Medicine–certified specialists involved in teaching OM in each dental school was 1.6 (range, 0-5). OM specialists were involved in teaching OM courses in 74% of the schools in addition to other specialists, including oral pathologists (n = 11), oral radiologists (n = 2), oral surgeons (n = 2), and 1 orofacial pain specialist. Oral pathologists alone or with oral surgeons were responsible for teaching the oral medicine courses in 21% and 5% of the schools, respectively. A total of 224 dental students responded to the survey. Most students (n = 114; 51%) reported their first introduction to OM was during their second year of dental school, 39% (n = 87) during their first year, and 8% (n = 17) during their third year. Sixty-four percent of the students thought the OM specialty was not known, 12% thought it was very poorly known, and only 13% thought the specialty was known. Only 1% of the respondents expressed interest in pursuing OM as a future postgraduate specialty choice.
Conclusions
Although OM specialists were involved in teaching OM in the majority of dental schools, students’ perceptions and understanding of the specialty appeared to be low. Additional efforts are required to increase students’ awareness around OM to better serve the important needs of our patient population.}

abstract = {Regenerative medicine is a very promising field for the reconstruction of diseased or defective tissues. Biocompatible materials play an important role in making the synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) environments as three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for tissue regeneration. These scaffolds should be able to imitate some aspects of the extracellular matrix. Therefore, electrospun-based fibers that can mimic the main elements of the natural matrix are an inspired strategy for restoring tissue response. Nanofibers are effectively helpful for various medical, tissue engineering, and drug delivery applications due to their high surface area. In this regard, to achieve greater efficiency of nanofibers, their surface is functionalized with different strategies to continuously release various factors in drug delivery and increase cellular response in tissue engineering. This paper contains a comprehensive overview of the application of biomimetic electrospun nanofibers in tissue engineering and drug delivery. The article also focuses on the production, benefits, and applications of various biomimetic fibers that can be used in tissue engineering and drug delivery. In addition, the different techniques used to modify the surface of nanofibers in tissue engineering and drug delivery are briefly discussed.}

Although equal access to opportunities for healthy living medicine regardless of legal, political, economic, or other circumstances should be a basic human right, it is increasingly improbable for scores of people, particularly in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, to acquire this. In recent times, global initiatives have attempted to make ‘healthy lifestyles’ more equitable by pledging to be relevant to all economies, promoting prosperity, environmental protection, climate change interventions, and purposeful action to meet the needs of vulnerable populations, including women and children. Yet there remains much to be done to address and reduce the substantial international health equity gaps. Reducing disparities that disproportionately affect the lower end of social strata must entail collaborative and systemic action from important stakeholders across the whole system, an approach that translates theory and research into practice. Ideally, realist approaches that appreciate the importance of the context of problems and assume nothing works everywhere or for everyone, should be prioritised over linear/simple and non-scalable intervention strategies.}

Fortunately, distant metastases are seen in differentiated thyroid carcinoma not very commonly, only in about 10% of cases. Radioiodine therapy plays an important role in treating both, lymph node and distant metastases. For lymph node metastases the treatment of choice is surgical resection, especially if they constitute the only tumor lesions in a given patient. However, radioiodine has been shown to also be able to lead to complete remissions in patients with lymph node involvement and also can eliminate microscopic disease persisting after resection. In the context of distant metastases with uptake of radioiodine, 131I therapy is the treatment of choice with the potential to also achieve complete remissions or at least long-term disease stabilization. Data on other radioligand treatments and redifferentiation in cases with insufficient uptake of radioiodine is scarce so far; those treatments should be performed preferentially in the framework of clinical trials.}

1. Understand current availability of palliative care in the emergency department. 2. Partner with emergency providers to improve palliative care education.
Objectives
Patients with serious illness frequently seek care in the emergency department (ED). Understanding the attitudes and behaviors of emergency physicians (EPs) around palliative care (PC) is key to implementing successful PC-ED interventions. We sought to determine current PC utilization patterns, as well as knowledge and perspectives of EPs regarding PC in the ED.
Design and methods
Electronic survey distributed to Emergency Medicine Practice Resource Network (EMPRN) members. Respondents were asked to consider frequency and patterns of PC utilization, barriers to PC in the ED, and their current knowledge of PC.
Results
123 EMPRN members opened the survey link and 75 (61%) responded. The majority of respondents were white (80%) and male (68%). The median age was 56 years. Most EPs (53%) reported access to an in-person palliative care consultant, whereas 31% reported no access to PC. The majority of EPs either “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that the PC services added value for their patients (94%), their practice (87%), and the health system (96%). Despite high perceived value, 37% of EPs reported never consulted PC, and 41% only consulted one to two times per year. The majority identified “limited availability of PC” as “moderate” (56%) or “insurmountable” (36%) barrier. In terms of knowledge, only 22% of EPs felt they had received inadequate training on advanced directives, and 39% felt they had received inadequate training on end-of-life symptom management. The majority (81%) were interested in additional education in PC skills.
Conclusion
In a national sample of EPs, PC consultation is often available, but infrequently used. The main barrier to consultation is lack of 24/7 PC coverage. Despite this, support for PC is high among EPs, and the majority are interested in continued professional education. Future interventions could consider focusing on increasing both availability of PC consultation and EP utilization of that service.}

Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks are disproportionately burdened with the most common cancer types, having the highest death rate of any group. Racial health disparities are complex and have been identified at each step of the cancer care continuum, encompassing patient and provider factors and health care system processes. The higher cancer mortality among NH Blacks may reflect underuse of prevention strategies such as vaccination and screening, resulting in later stage of disease at diagnosis and underuse of cancer-directed therapy. Inequalities in the quality of care, including access to health care and receipt of recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions as well as supportive care also contribute to the excess burden of cancer-related deaths among NH Blacks. Non-clinical factors such as structural racism and lower socioeconomic status are associated with unequal access to resources such as housing, healthy foods, employment, and education, which have been demonstrated to drive racial disparities in cancer. Concerted efforts to understand and target the causes of the observed differences in access, screening, and treatment utilization will be critical for achieving more equitable treatment delivery and outcomes for all patients with cancer. Moreover, ongoing efforts to enhance diversity in clinical trials enrollment and access to novel precision medicine initiatives are processes warranted to reduce healthcare inequalities.}
