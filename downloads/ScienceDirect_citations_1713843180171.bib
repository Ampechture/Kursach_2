abstract = {While policies and academic interest in smart cities gain momentum, there remain significant gaps in practice and academic conceptualisations explaining it as a new source of innovation. Moreover, there is a need to synthesise reporting behaviours and tools thereof, supporting communication and transparency for citizens along with their involvement in innovation processes. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country analysis highlights gaps in transparency, reporting and communication of results, and the consequent allocation of resources in smart cities. Thus, this study identifies literature streams embracing the notion of smart cities and reporting. It employs a bibliometric and structured literature review analysis. Accordingly, this study proposes a framework comprising four macro-areas, several micro-elements, and the most appropriate implementation of technologies for sustainability challenges. Notably, it contributes to strengthening the smart city as an unconventional source of innovation, providing policymakers an opportunity to account for the smart city's weaknesses and identify areas for significant improvement efforts to be channelled.}

The cities with high population density (Metro cities inclusive) specifically face the problem of finding the nearest available parking space. The rising number of vehicles daily makes this problem more severe that questions the safety of vehicles as well. In this study, the issue of finding parking spaces in smart cities is addressed using an IoT-based methodology. The proposed Intelligent Parking System (IPS) consists of an IoT framework that collects real-time data, send it to the cloud, and thereby suggests to the user a suitable place for parking the vehicle at a nearby location. As a component of the framework, a mobile application has been developed that enables users to check the availability of nearby parking spots and subsequently reserve a parking place. This paper also describes different use-cases of a person for finding a parking space and parking it in right place. The proposed system has been implemented using Raspberry Pi, NodeMCU, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Infrared (IR) sensors. The results discussed in the later sections support the usability of this IPS.}

However, this view is now being challenged as V2G is being deployed at a large scale. The severe challenges of rapid population growth, ecological pollution, and energy deficiency have encouraged the design of smart grids and electric transport systems, especially electric vehicles containing central energy utilization systems in a smart city. This paper proposes a robust and distributed approach to balance supply and demand. This study have constructed a unique framework to manage the ambiguous performances of vehicles and supplied energy resources in a smart city.

Transitioning to a low-carbon heating system is critical to the forthcoming generation of energy systems and future carbon–neutral cities. It has been observed that the development of unban centralized heating systems includes both the diversification of energy sources and the development of “smart heating.” This paper firstly summarizes recent work in smart heating technology in the urban centralized heating system, which is representative of large-scale infrastructure smartification during the ongoing smart city transition as observed. It then delves into the essential cyber-physical system technologies that underpin smart heating solutions. Building on this foundation, the discussion pivots to the transition from smart heating to smart IES, examining four critical dimensions: the design of IES digesting renewable energy, the modeling of its dynamics, the vulnerability of multi-energy coupling, and the smartification of its operation control. The efficacy and limitations of this approach are demonstrated through empirical analyses of both real heating systems and park-scale IES cases. This paper should provide both theoretical and practical guidance for the integration of multi-energy systems and smart technologies to achieve comprehensive renewable energy utilization.}

A particle swarm approach is introduced to optimize the independent steering wheels angles taking into consideration the vehicle speed and slip angles. A validated eight degrees-of-freedom nonlinear MATLAB model is used to simulate different cornering scenarios. Moreover, two adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems are designed to obtain wheels steering angles at different cornering conditions. Finally, the results of FWISS show a significant improvement of the vehicle cornering performance that can influence the design and safety of roads in smart cities.}

Spectral clustering was adopted to recognize development patterns on three dimensions and 53 indicators. The results indicated four development patterns. Completing developing elements converged in comprehensive-development cities. Environmental-friendly cities enhanced environmental quality under government guidance supported by information and communications technology. Welfare cities showed good social welfare via the government's highly focused strategy but lacked economic support. Innovation, trade, capital investment, mental poverty, and poor living conditions characterized undeveloped cities.

While the literature is ripe with descriptions of those projects and pioneering cities, there is far less systematic research on why some cities are more advanced than others. As single locating entities, cities are posited to have strong geographic rootedness. Hence, spatial and socio-economic context, considered as the main stimulant of organizational innovation, can be particularly important for cities. We investigate 22 Swiss cities with smart city projects and use fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to determine the configuration of conditions that make some cities more advanced than others in their smart city development. Results indicate that a configuration of high share of service sector, presence of research institutions and high urban density is sufficient for the outcome, whereas population size, new residential development and participation to international networks appear as less important. By providing insights into the spatial and socio-economic underpinnings of smart city development, the study contributes to the understanding of the geographies of smart cities.}

In contrast, more attention should be paid to the question of appropriateness of smart city technologies. This entails that quite uniform urban issues in different contexts ask for distinctive approaches and as a consequence, for specific smart city technologies. In other words, the context plays a decisive role in the choice for the urban issues themselves and in the ways to ‘solve’ or govern these, and in the choice for specific smart city technologies. This study examines the role of context in the handling of urban issues with the help of smart city technologies in three smart city projects: Hangzhou City Brain (China), Singapore Smart Nation, and Amsterdam Smart City (the Netherlands). The results reveal that the specific contextual factors influence urban city developments and the application therein of smart city technologies. This includes: a technology-driven management approach to fixing Hangzhou's traffic congestion; a mixed technocratic and platform-oriented approach to effecting transformation in Singapore's government services, businesses and urban living; and a platform-oriented, open-minded mechanism to improve Amsterdam's livability and economic prosperity. This paper concludes that rather than treating the technology itself as smart, the real smartness in smart cities is to develop and implement appropriate technologies according to its local context to solve targeted urban issues.}

The radio frequency (RF) and microwave links seem to be incapable of offering sufficient bandwidth required by the data-hungry applications and consequently, the need for a more effective solution for tackling the issue of scarcity of bandwidth resources has become the necessity of current network infrastructure in India. In this study, a hybrid optical fiber-free space optical (OF-FSO) system for offering high-speed data services has been proposed to assist the implementation of smart city infrastructure in India. This study aims to inspect the system performance of the proposed model under the climatic conditions of mountainous, desert, flatland, and seaside regions of India. The proposed hybrid OF-FSO system comprises a fixed single-mode fiber (SMF) of 20 km and an FSO link (having a varied transmission range between 0–2 km). The proposed hybrid model can support an FSO link of 1.72 km for a fixed SMF of 20 km, corresponding to a bit error rate of the order of 10−4 for atmospheric conditions of the seaside location of Chennai and the range of FSO link varies from 1.32 km to 1.57 km for other locations of India, for the same length of SMF and bit error rate. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid OF-FSO has demonstrated a reduction of 30.8% in Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) cost in contrast to the conventional passive optical network (PON) system.}

Developing a smart network infrastructure is thus becoming a key component for the better development and efficient governance of smart cities. The main objective of this article is to examine the feasibility of utilizing moving vehicles to develop an efficient Vehicular-based Virtual Network Infrastructure (VVNI) for smart cities. The basic idea here is to divide the whole city into distinct cells, then predict and evaluate the vehicle eligibility to act efficiently as a centralized communication and information hub for each cell. Specifically, we present the basic framework of the proposed VVNI, and identify the corresponding efficiency requirements in terms of service availability, cost, and quality; then we introduce novel metrics to characterize the vehicle's ability to cope with these requirements. Several simulation scenarios were conducted to assess the efficiency of the proposed VVNI. The simulation results demonstrate how the proposed model outperforms existing models and improves system performance in three benchmark areas: throughput, packet delivery ratio, and latency, especially in medium- and high-density network scenarios with slower vehicle velocities. The simulation results are promising to further enhance the development of the proposed network infrastructure.}

In Brazil, few studies have addressed this issue. Thus, here I analyze the political agenda and economic dynamics involved in the transformation of Brazil's second largest city, Rio de Janeiro, into a climate-smart city. I develop an original conceptualization of “techno-utopian smart city” and apply this framework to analyze the case of Rio. Empirically, I perform a thematic content analysis, including the coding of policy documents, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest that the smart city agenda is still limited to address the challenges of climate change. While smart city and climate policies have been sparsely integrated, “smart” urbanism has privileged the financial, economic, and political dividends of a techno-driven urban transformation, rather than focusing on citizen well-being, climate change mitigation, and adaptation. My conceptualization and empirical analysis suggest that Rio de Janeiro has been i) framing climate governance as a technical issue instead of a complex social challenge, ii) neglecting the environmental footprint of smart technologies, and iii) collecting citizens’ private data with low levels of transparency.}

However, a comprehensive understanding of citizen discontent with the smart city is missing. This study systematically reviews academic research addressing citizen discontent with the smart city. Based on a set of 58 articles, two perspectives on citizens' discontent are identified. One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies’, ‘the right rules’, and ‘the right information’, or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment’ and the ‘right to participate and challenge’. Based on our findings, a fine-grained understanding of attitudes and behavior, and government actions to address citizen discontent is developed.}

Communities can indeed address problems linked to urbanization thanks to this technology through the Smart City concept and thus support a sustainable development of their cities. Artificial intelligence and namely its machine learning branch is expected to reinforce this trend by making smart cities even smarter. However, smart cities can only be successful if they can be trusted and, with this in mind, machine learning can potentially be an efficient tool to mitigate cyberattacks. This paper can be divided into two main parts. In the first part the ability of Gradient Boosting and Deep Learning to make long-term predictions of noise level is studied based on noise data collected in the suburb of an English city. In the second part, we proposed an approach for detecting noise levels anomalies based on predictions. Two types of injections were taken into consideration namely punctual noise level attacks and gradual noise level attacks. Specifically, for the punctual attacks, when the difference between the actual sensed and predicted noise levels is greater than a given threshold, we considered that there is an anomaly in the data. For the gradual attacks, we used a criterion comparing the mean absolute error of predictions in the attacked set of data to statistics of the absolute error in the training set. The obtained results show that our approach, which uses a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) hybrid network for the noise level prediction, can effectively be used to detect the aforementioned types of anomalies. In the case of punctual attacks an increase in sound intensity of 5 dB was detected, while for gradual attacks, smaller changes can be detected.}

abstract = {The Smart city is important for sustainability. Governments engaged in developing urban mobility in the smart city need to invest their limited financial resources wisely to realize sustainability goals. A key area for such sustainability investment is how to implement and invest in emerging technologies for urban mobility solutions. However, current frameworks on how to understand the impact of emerging technologies aligned with long-term sustainability strategies are understudied. This article develops a simulation-based comparison between different cities and autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption scenarios to understand which aspects of cities lead to positive AV implementation outcomes. As urban mobility and cities will become smart, the analysis represents a first attempt to explore the impact of AVs on a large scale across different cities around the world. Archetypes are formed and account for most, if not all, world cities. For three of our archetypes (car-centric giants, prosperous innovation centers, and high-density megacities), promoting AV-shuttle use would deliver the greatest advantage as measured by improvements in the model's KPIs. To develop urban powerhouses, however, micromobility would deliver greater benefits. For highly compact middleweights, a shift from private cars to other non-AV modes of transportation would be the smartest choice.}

This study inspects smart cities’ data portals and assesses their compliance with transparency requirements for open (government) data. The expert assessment of 34 portals representing 22 smart cities, with 36 features, allowed us to rank them and determine their level of transparency maturity according to four predefined levels of maturity - developing, defined, managed, and integrated. In addition, recommendations for identifying and improving the current maturity level and specific features have been provided. An open data ecosystem in the smart city context has been conceptualized, and its key components were determined. Our definition considers the components of the data-centric and data-driven infrastructure using the systems theory approach. We have defined five predominant types of current open data ecosystems based on prevailing data infrastructure components. The results of this study should contribute to the improvement of current data ecosystems and build sustainable, transparent, citizen-centered, and socially resilient open data-driven smart cities.}

The extensive experience with the benefits that these advanced urban roads provide informs decision-makers toward efficient investments in advanced systems for urban roads. However, there is no tool designed to evaluate the developmental status of urban roads in a smart city. Therefore, this study has developed a hierarchy table of indicators and measures specific to assessing the current status of urban road innovation for smart cities. A keyword network analysis was used to develop the hierarchy table. The procedures take three phases: data preparation, data analysis, and hierarchy table development. As a result, the hierarchy table includes 53 measures in 14 indicators connected to the five smart city components (e.g., environment, mobility, governance, economy, and living). The hierarchy table can be used for city officials to assess the current status of urban roads in the transition of a smart city, which leads to an explicit investment decision on urban road innovation. The procedures presented in this study can be adapted to develop indicators and measures for other service areas necessary for a smart city.}

Renewable energy storage, the solar, wind, and distributed resources can be better integrated into the grid. The leading theory in the digital domain for improved and broad use of all the situations with high digital media accessibility (i.e., video, sound, words, and pictures), nevertheless it is challenging to talk freely about such small appliances because of resource constraints (starving power and battery capacity), and large quantities of the information. The green communication approach for the smart city (GCA-SC) is proposed in this article. Thus, using saved video streams to solve these difficulties is recommended by Hybrid Adaptation and Power Algorithms and Delay-tolerant Streamed Algorithms. A new architecture is similarly proposed for the smart city network. Empirical findings such as power drainage, battery capacity, latency, and bandwidth are acquired and evaluated. It was reached that, with less effort than Baseline, GCA-SC optimises energy drainage, the battery capacity, variance, power delivery ratio of the IoT compatible gadgets in the smart city environment. The simulation analysis of the proposed GCA-SC method enhances the packet delivery ratio of 39% and throughput of 99 kbps. It reduces the delay by 2.5 s and the standard deviation by −0.9 s.}

Results display the SCP contributions to promoting urban green and low-carbon development. When we run the various robustness tests, the conclusions remain valid. The heterogeneity test shows that, in large cities and resource-based cities, the promotion effect is more obvious. We further test its transmission mechanism and find that SCP enhances urban green and low-carbon development by raising urban technical innovation levels, upgrading the construction of smart infrastructure and optimizing the quality of smart management and services.}

The results show a growing trend of research papers in this field, especially in the last five years. The findings show the significance of a systemic multi-dimensional view of innovations for the smart sustainable development of cities. We have identified four main perspectives through which the scholars discourse the SOI dimensions in the smart city context: technology perspective, organizational perspective, social innovation perspective with citizen engagement, as well as system-level changes with innovation ecosystems. Second, we have recognized various focused themes under each main perspective. The various types of innovations also have impacts on different components of smart cities. Although the technological innovation perspectives dominate, and governance aspects are also paid attention to in recent studies, the increasing amount of research outputs also report on the developments of other components and perspectives, such as new human-centric approaches like citizen engagement.}

The empirical results show that under the dual-pilot policy, the urban carbon emission reduction efficiency is significantly improved, and the efficiency is higher than that under the single-pilot policy. Dual-pilot policies of the low-carbon city and smart city can create a synergistic emission reduction effect by improving the level of urban digital innovation, market-oriented innovation, and industrial innovation. The carbon emission reduction effect of Dual-pilot policies has regional heterogeneity and is more obvious in the eastern cities in China. The research can provide theoretical support for the planning of pilot cities, which is conducive to the sustainable development of the low-carbon economy in China.}

Imbibed with utopian technological planning, understanding the convergence between smart development and sustainable practices for city development is necessary. Smart cities have succeeded in bringing high standards of living to its residents. This article evaluates the long-term sustainability performance of 35 leading European smart cities over time from 2015 till 2020 to understand on how these cities address sustainability to make the concept of smart sustainable cities more actionable. A novel Double-Frontier Slack Based Measure Data Envelopment Analysis (DFSBM-DEA) model considering undesirable factors in the technology set is proposed for the assessment. An integrated relative sustainability performance assessment model considering both the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoint simultaneously, in terms of interval efficiency is used to determine the most efficient smart city under 6 various dimensions of sustainable development. These key dimensions include; Energy and Environmental Resource, Governance and Institution, Economic dynamism, Social cohesion and solidarity, Climate Change and, Safety and Security. A productivity progress assessment from a double frontier perspective using a modified Malmquist-DEA model is then used to capture the response of each smart city in terms of their productivity growth towards achieving sustainable development. Results show Dublin (ranked 1st) as the most smart and sustainable European city under all the proposed dimensions of sustainable development from the double-frontier perspective. Along with Dublin lies Oslo, Zurich and Amsterdam as the cities with high aggregate sustainability performance. The results also revealed significant difference in the productivity progress values from the optimistic and pessimistic viewpoint, thus exemplifying the significance for the proposed aggregate productivity progress measurement model. The findings of the present study contribute to knowledge and practice for smart city modellers, decision makers and urban planners, by aiding methodological clarity in assessing sustainable capacity of cities from a double frontier perspective and, in particular, by drawing attention to underlying assumptions about the role of sustainability in smart city development. This research stands as a breakthrough in the field of relative sustainability assessment using non-parametric approaches and a benchmark for global smart cities to shape their development in light of sustainability.}

There is limited research that envisions how future cities can be backcasted with frugal innovation (FI) underpinning the sustainability pillars. This research aims to narrow the gap. The methodology is based on a systematic literature review and secondary exploratory case studies. The results of the TOWS (threats, opportunities, weaknesses, strengths) analysis on the suitability of FI on smart sustainable cities (SSC) developmental policies show that FI is an affordable and inclusive way to sustainably develop cities without injury to the environment. The findings reveal that the five pillars of a smart sustainable future city can integrate frugal innovation and lean engineering concepts to ensure sustainable development at lower costs. Through frugal innovation embedded in city infrastructure, cleaner methods of production can be realized, and inclusiveness can be fostered.}

One of the key factors to accomplish a smart city involves the use of IoT and information technology infrastructure which can be described as the foundation of a smart city. Its effective implementation will allow the city to meet its wide range of requirements while being able to respond to innovations, such as advanced sensors, analytic tools, measurement, and artificial intelligent based solutions. This paper investigates and compares between the use of low and high resolution infrared sensors as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate crowds in cities to enhance and optimise the efficiency of the transportation process and other public services for low density scenarios. A case study was conducted in Nottingham city at one of the tram stops. An experimental methodology is used where different number of people are captured and the results are compared using different image processing techniques. The findings show that both technologies are useful in the estimation of crowd density, however, the high resolution camera has been found to be more accurate in estimating the number of people albeit it is more expensive for the integration into infrastructures. The practical implication is that low-cost and low resolution infrared cameras could provide reasonable results. However, for higher accuracy, high resolution infrared cameras will be needed; and they are potentially more expensive. So a compromise might be needed between cost and performance to encourage the installation of more IoT systems using infrared technologies.}

abstract = {In the construction of smart cities, facial expression analysis plays a crucial role. It can be used in traffic monitoring systems to alleviate traffic pressure by analyzing the emotional states of drivers and passengers. In the field of smart healthcare, it can provide more precise treatment and services to patients. In the realm of social entertainment, it can offer more intelligent and personalized interactions. In summary, the application of emotion computing technology will play an increasingly significant role in the development of smart cities in the future. In the task of dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER), analyzing the spatial–temporal features of video sequences has become a common research approach. However, facial expression sequences often contain a significant number of neutral frames and noisy frames, potentially increasing computational costs and reducing performance. Effectively extracting key frames for spatial–temporal feature analysis is a critical aspect of dynamic facial expression recognition. To address this issue, we proposed a sampling-wise dynamic facial expression recognition via frame-Sequence contrastive learning method, called SW-FSCL. The SW-FSCL method aims to improve the performance of DFER by using intelligent dual-stream sampling strategies and frame-sequence contrastive learning, extract key frame and reduce the impact of neutral frames and noisy frames. We proposed a key frame proposal (KFP) block to analyze the spatial–temporal features of sequences, calculating weight ratios for key frame extraction. Due to potential information loss in long sequences, we introduce a temporal aggregation (TA) block to prevent data loss and ensure the integrity of temporal information. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that the proposed approach not only outperforms all current state-of-the-art algorithms on two widely-used benchmark datasets (DFEW, FERV39k), but also visualization results produces insights into the interpretability of the SW-FSCL method.}

The central argument made is that the smart city could exploit the synergies between city planning and three techno-scientific domains including Big Data, Geographic Information Science and Systems, and Data Science—which collectively constitute an emerging field known as Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)— to meet four overarching policy goals: 1) to enhance the efficiency of urban services and functions; 2) to improve quality of life for all urban citizens; 3) to address the pressing societal, ecological and economic challenges that could plague urban systems on different levels; and, 4) to contribute to the production of spatial data, information and knowledge on human-urban dynamics. In addition, the paper defines a human-centered conceptual framework illustrating how the cross-pollination between city planning and the three techno-scientific fields could enhance the planning practice and accomplish the smart-city policy goals. The methodology employed in this study entails a systematic review of the literature. In addition to discussing the latest achievements as well as the progress made on the nexus of city planning and GeoAI, the paper also highlights the barriers to the application of GeoAI in the planning, design and management of smart cities and identifies potential avenues for future research.}

abstract = {Existing studies are mixed about whether smart city construction (SCC) can alleviate urban environmental pollution. This study takes three batches of smart city pilots implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China as a quasi-natural experiment. We construct the panel dataset of 286 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period 2006 to 2018, then applies the multi-stage difference-in-differences method to investigate the environmental benefits of SCC policies. The results show that SCC can significantly reduce air pollution by 2.6% ∼ 18 %, except for ozone (increase by 13.9%), water pollution by 0.7%∼ 11.8%, and solid waste pollution by 5.8%∼ 19.7%. Meanwhile, SCC policy shows a more prominent reduction effect in eastern cities, megacities, young local officials and regions with high government capacity. The dynamic effect reveals that the environmental benefits take effect after 2∼4 years of SCC implementation, and then the benefit will increase significantly over time. The mechanism tests indicate that although the rebound effect will deteriorate the environmental quality, SCC can reduce pollution through industrial structure optimization and technological innovation. Overall, this finding inspires other emerging economies to solve the dilemma of economic development and environmental governance at the level of new infrastructure construction.}

In smart medicine, intelligent dialogue system is playing an important role in providing personalized and efficient healthcare services to improve the quality of life for human beings. The Bert model has become a popular way to construct intelligent medical dialogue system. However, the current Bert model is difficult to achieve desirable results for this task since its input does not reflect the difference in roles. To overcome this drawback, we present a role distinguishing Bert model for intelligent medical dialogue system to help construct the sustainable smart city. Particularly, we segment and label the utterances depending on different dialogue roles, and then construct the corresponding segment embedding as the input of our model. Furthermore, we substitute the NSP task with the SOP task to better learn the coherence between sentences. Finally, we verify the proposed model by comparing it with Ernie on some online E-commerce datasets for intent recognition, semantic matching, and session dialogue classification. The results demonstrate that our proposed model improves the average 1% accuracy for different tasks in dialogue system, proving the potential of the proposed model for establishing intelligent medical dialogue system in smart city.}

abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) revolution has emerged as a promising network that enhanced information dissemination about the city's resources. This city's resources are wirelessly connected to different constrained devices (such as sensors, robotics, and actuators). However, the communication of this wireless information is threatened by several malicious attacks, cyber-attacks, and hackers. This is due to unsecured IIoT networks that were exposed as a potential back door entry point for the attacks. Consequently, this study aims to develop a security framework for the smart cities’ sustainability edge computing vulnerabilities using Petri Net and Genetic Algorithm-Based Reinforcement Learning (GARL). First, a common trust model for addressing information outflows in the network using a distributed authorization algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is implemented on a secure framework modeling in Petri Net called secure trust-aware philosopher privacy and authentication (STAPPA) for mitigation of the privacy breach in the networks. Genetic Algorithm-based Reinforcement Learning (GARL) is used to optimize the search, detect anomalies, and shortest route during the agent learning in the environment. The detection and accuracy rate results obtained over a secure framework using reinforcement learning are 98.75, 99, 99.50, 99.75, and 100% during simulation in the network environment. The average sensitivity of the detection rate is 1.000, while the average specificity outcome is 0.868. The result of the GARL simulation model obtained shows the best distance of 238.84 * 10−3 fitness when the search space is optimized by reducing the number of chromosomes to 10 in the model. These approaches help to detect anomalies and prevent unauthorized users from accessing edge computing components in the city architecture.}

Motivated by the growing development of theory for smart cities, a review of the research literature pertaining to smart spaces is provided, followed by a review of the research literature for theory and smart environments. A conceptual framework in support of theory for smart spaces is formulated to guide research and practice in smart environments. Using an exploratory case study approach combined with an explanatory correlational design, this work identifies and explores variables of interest for learning more about, and developing an understanding of, smart spaces. This work also seeks to navigate a way of using theory to inform the work of researchers, practitioners, and those concerned with the making and enacting of smart environments. To this end, ambient theory for smart cities is advanced to accommodate smart spaces as a proposed, viable theory, using a number of variables such as connecting and collaborating. While a good correlation among such variables is found, this work also acknowledges limitations, opening the way for opportunities going forward. In conclusion, this work has implications for the mutual enriching of understandings about smart spaces and smart cities in support of dialogue, debate, and interpretation.}

abstract = {Effective waste management arises as a crucial challenge for smart city development in the current era of rapid urbanization, shifting towards sustainability and public health. Harnessing modern technologies, especially the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with intelligent waste bins, can revolutionize urban waste collection, optimizing efficiency and reducing costs. This paper delves into a multiagent simulation-based framework for understanding and assessing the dynamics of an IoT-enabled smart waste management system. Initiating with the intricate process of garbage generation, we shift our focus to the real-time monitoring capabilities of IoT-connected waste bins. The study further explores protocols to regulate bin status, along with timing mechanisms to trigger garbage collection rounds. Subsequently, a predictive routing system is introduced to determine the most efficient garbage collection routes. For the bins’ filled level tracking, the ultrasonic sensors are commonly used that send out sound waves and track their echo return time, whereas weight sensors measure the garbage load in the bin, providing insights into waste production trends. For data transmission from bins to the central system, various communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and long-distance networks are considered. Through a simulation, we contrast the innovative IoT-enabled sensor-based collection mechanism against the conventional periodic review strategy. Field experiments at the Al Rayyan locale, proximate to Doha, Qatar, facilitate the model demonstration. By leveraging region-specific data, we simulated various aspects including economic factors, environmental impact, public satisfaction, and operational efficiencies. The findings indicate that with an average daily garbage generation of 1.3 kg per individual, the sensor-driven mechanism remarkably outperforms the periodic review approach by covering fewer distances with fewer trucks, while concurrently achieving the key objectives of cost-efficiency, environmental preservation, public satisfaction, and reduced employee workload. This research contributes to the developing field of smart city technology by providing critical insights for urban planners, policymakers, and technologists attempting to build more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.}

Despite the existence of many platforms to support the development of smart city applications, most of them do not associate the offered services with geographical information, do not support performing semantic queries on the available data, and have limitations that may burden development tasks. This paper presents Smart Geo Layers (SGeoL), a platform for developing smart city applications. Besides integrating urban data with geographical information, SGeoL relies on an underlying middleware infrastructure and leverages it by including high-level abstractions for (i) context data management, (ii) integration of heterogeneous data, (iii) semantic support, (iv) data analysis and visualization, and (v) data security and privacy support.

These are implemented through optimized communication protocol stacks and algorithms that rely on actual physical layer and channel state information. The modeling and the prototype evaluation of protocol optimization approaches are mainly driven by pure simulation studies with abstracted physical layer and channel models. With the Radio-in-the-Loop (RIL) simulation (S. Böhm and H. König, 2023) and modeling (S. Böhm and H.

IoT technologies do, however, come with a number of drawbacks, including vulnerability of highly secure devices, energy consumption, governance, etc. in smart cities. Governance in smart city is more citizen-center and the decisions of government are focused on citizens’ demands. Government can identify influential spreaders from this huge voluminous population and take requisite preventive steps such as delaying the spread of rumor, identifying the information source, or blocking the source node. Hence, security of highly vulnerable IoT device and governance are the two main issues of the IoT environment of smart green city. This paper proposes a framework for identifying influential spreaders who play a key role in the governance of smart city as well as determining vulnerable IoT devices that needs to be protected from malware attacks. A framework named as Modified Dynamic Weighted Sum Method, is proposed for determining influential devices and spreaders in smart green cities. The connectivity between devices is considered as a network, then, distinct centrality measures are considered as the multi-attribute of the network, so as to take advantage of each centrality measure. Experiments are conducted on Santender testbed and it was found that static devices play an important role in IoT environment. Hence, they need to be protected from malware attacks. From future perspective, opportunities and challenges in smart city applications are discussed.}

abstract = {The principal goals of smart cities are to improve citizens' quality of life and foster economic growth while ensuring efficient service delivery and sustainable development. Accordingly, understanding and adequately meeting citizens' needs and desires is a fundamental step toward improving citizens' happiness. While prior studies have investigated the direct relationship between technology readiness and continuous intention to use the services, extant results are still fragmented. Hence, this study examines the relationship between citizens' readiness and intention to continue usage by introducing satisfaction and discomfort as mediators in a smart city services (SCS) context. We rely on a mixed-method approach to propose and validate a new readiness model for assessing smart city citizens' readiness for continuous usage and long-term adoption of SCS. In the first phase, qualitative research was used by conducting in-depth interviews with SCS experts to investigate and theorize the main factors perceived as enablers and inhibitors to the continuous usage of SCS. While in the second quantitative phase, data were collected from 350 citizens and structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings suggest three main enablers (empowerment, optimism, and innovativeness) and three main inhibitors (insecurity, mistrust, and legal considerations) that affect the intention to continuously use SCS. In the quantitative phase, satisfaction and discomfort emerged as mediators to intention of continuous usage. Moreover, we found that empowerment, innovativeness, and optimism enhance the continuous usage of SCS when mediated by satisfaction but have no significant effect when mediated by discomfort. Discomfort was found to be an effective mediator between inhibitors and continued usage intention. Our study highlights the role of technology readiness as a personality trait in shaping user satisfaction, discomfort, and intention to continue using SCS. Furthermore, it proposes a new scale and model for measuring users’ readiness to adopt and continuously use SCS. The proposed model has practical implications for SCS providers, and can inform the design of future SCS and ensure their sustainable and successful adoption by citizens, not only initially, but also in the long-term.}

Further, the 77 smart cities were classified according to SCI status, economic development level, and population density to conduct the PVAR model. Results showed that the two subsystems of urban smartness and sustainability are coordinated, and coordinated degrees exhibited an upward trend. The impacts of ICT, human capital, and smart governance on urban sustainability differed in smart cities with different contexts. ICT and smart governance had a long-term positive impact on urban sustainability, while human capital did not have an overall significantly positive impact.

While smart cities primarily aim at enhancing performance through innovative use of digital data and technology, a social sustainability perspective stresses the critical interconnections between people and place. Through a critical systematic literature review, this paper establishes a dialogue between the smart city and social sustainability.

This study aims to examine the impacts and potential mechanisms of SCI on air pollution governance from the objective satellite monitoring data within a quasi-natural experiment framework. We find that SCI directly reduces the air pollutants concentration such as PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and smog in urban China and improves the air quality very well, which also has significant and positive spillovers on air pollution governance in adjacent cities. This encouraging phenomenon can also be achieved through contributing to green technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, and decentralizing urban spatial structure, such that most of can be attributed to the technological effect. Heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that the governance effect of air pollution is more obvious in large smart cities, and increases with the expansion of city size. Additionally, the effect performs better in resource-based smart cities and smart cities with stronger financing capacity and air pollution pressure.}

Therefore, pollution problems must be actively managed. The prediction of environmental pollution is also an important subject in pollution control. This paper is based on neural network technology to study the prediction method of environmental pollution in smart cities. This paper introduces some neural networks commonly used in the field of environmental pollution prediction, and also introduces the processing method of environmental pollution data.

The first experiment is to compare the model in this paper with other three neural network models, and it is found that the model in this paper is smaller than other models in terms of ARE and MAE; the second experiment is to design an environmental pollution prediction system based on the model in this paper, and take sulfur dioxide as an example, use the system to predict the value of sulfur dioxide in two provinces. The results are as follows: the average error value of the system's prediction for Jiangxi Province is 0.31%, and the average error value for Hubei Province is 0.34%.

abstract = {Green environmental security refers to the state of human-environment interactions that include reducing resource shortages, pollution, and biological dangers that can cause societal disorder. In IoT-enabled smart cities, due to the advancement of technologies, sensors and actuators collect vast quantities of data that are analyzed to extract potentially useful information. However, due to the noise and diversity of the data generated, only a small portion of the massive data collected from smart cities is used. In sustainable Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) management, environmental deterioration resulting from improper land usage in the digital ecosystem is a global issue that has garnered attention. The deep learning techniques of AI are recognized for their capacity to manage vast amounts of erroneous and unstructured data. In this paper, we propose a morphologically augmented fine-tuned DenseNet-121(MAFDN) LULC classification model to automate the categorization of high spatial resolution scene images for environmental conservation. This work includes an augmentation process (i.e. erosion, dilation, blurring, and contrast enhancement operations) to extract spatial patterns and enlarge the training size of the dataset. A few state-of-the-art techniques are incorporated for contrasting the efficacy of the proposed approach. This facilitates green resource management and personalized provision of services.}

For the urban areas from the post-communist block the race to smartness started late and run into a series of obstacles related to financing, understanding, and stakeholders’ involvement. Our paper assesses the insertion, evolution, and implementation of smart city concept in such a territory (Romanian cities), while simultaneously addressing the issue of transparency of smart projects. The study found an increasing openness of authorities to integrate smart components within the city profile with a focus on smart mobility domain, mostly connected with smart apps and online platforms. However, little information is available regarding the smart projects, with discrepancies between the statistics and the available information, suggesting the need for clarifications and harmonized statistics in order to articulate more effective evidence-based policies.}

In addition, South Korea submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Nowadays, to mitigate the GHG emission every country explicitly planning to reduce non-renewable energy resource vehicles. The electric vehicle (EV) markets growing rapidly with various technologies, strategies and innovations to support decarbonization. In 2022, by the transportation CO2 (Carbon dioxide) emission report of International Energy Agency (IEA), the cars and vans contributes 48% in the over all CO2 emissions. Increasing the electric micro-mobility service would be one of the best effective approach in accordance to reduce CO2 emission. This research study support to reduce the GHG emission by increasing the clean energy vehicle. A case study conducted to analyze firm-wise e-scooter sharing service performance and its satisfaction in smart cities of South Korea. Lacking in the consistent good quality and performance affects the number of electric vehicle users. Hence, electric vehicle firm should focus into their product better performance and quality. This research supports to analyze the e-scooter based on the various criteria from the user’s perspective. This research study helps to firms to identify their lacking criteria and improve their quality and performance. We considered the performance, accessibility, tangibility, reliability and responsiveness factors which affects user’s perspective in e-scooter sharing services. A survey was conducted over sixty user’s for different e-scooter services with twenty four factors. Generally, MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision-Making) techniques holds two phases to determine the weight of the criteria and another phase to ranking the alternatives. The existing MCDM techniques lacks to handle the user’ satisfaction index analysis and not considering the influence grade of each factors in the analysis. To overcome this draw back and analyze the micro-mobility services based over the user’s point of view, we introduced a novel fuzzy based MCDM method name as Approach for Preference, Performance and Ranking Evaluation with SAtisfaction Level (APPRESAL) approach. The findings show that Lime, a micro-mobility firm, outperformed other firms with high-quality service and user satisfaction, followed by Wind, XingXing, Alpaca, and Beam. The influences of defected factors from the accessibility, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance dimensions had an adverse effect on quality of firm’s micro-mobility service with unsatisfactory performance.}

There are different dimensions that are to be considered for smart city planning and implementation. This complexity of the dimension, the use of technology, and their integration bring the risk perspectives into the implementation of the smart city concept. If such risks are not adequately understood and addressed, they can create issues in terms of privacy and security and, therefore, the functioning of smart cities. In this review, the identification of dimensions, smart city assessment tools, the available technologies, and the technical and non-technical risk parameters related to smart cities implementation are discussed. The current methods of risk assessment and the possible enhancements are highlighted. The findings of the literature review illustrate that not all smart cities adapt all of the smart city dimensions. The dominant technology used in smart cities’ applications is found to be the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and blockchain. The paper also provides some research directions for the design, implementation, and operation of smart cities.}

To explore urban vitalisation, we offer a conceptual framework connecting two theoretical terms, trust/distrust and citizenship regimes, and we ask in what ways relations between trust/distrust (of residents in their municipality) and citizenship regimes explain residents' engagement in smart urban vitalisation. To answer this question, we present a case study of a group of Haifa residents who used a digital platform to push for improvement in the ways the local government accommodated their needs. Based on our analysis, we make two arguments of potential interest to scholars and stakeholders involved in smart city initiatives. First, both trust and distrust can motivate residents' involvement in smart city initiatives. Second, examining trust and distrust in light of the relevant citizenship regime (individual-liberal and civic-republican) sheds light on relational and dynamic configurations of residents' involvement in the process of smart urban vitalisation.}

With the proliferation of smart sensor nodes (IoT) generating real-time data, there is a pressing need to overcome device limitations, including finite battery life and computational resources. Our proposed framework leverages HAP-based MEC servers, offering on-demand computation and communication resources without extensive physical infrastructure. Additionally, WPT, through terrestrial networks, addresses IoT device battery constraints by enabling energy harvesting from nearby access points. The primary focus is joint optimization, aiming to maximize computing bits while minimizing energy consumption under system constraints. Given the optimization problem’s complexity, we employ a decomposition approach, breaking it into sub-problems. The first part handles mode selection and task segmentation, determining optimal placement and mode selection variables. The second part addresses resource allocation, optimizing transmission power, offloading time, energy harvesting time, and device computational resources. Numerical results demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness compared to relevant benchmark schemes. This approach holds promise for enhancing IoT device performance and energy efficiency in smart city applications.}

The Chinese government proposed enhancing citizens' sense of gain to achieve the citizen-centric development goal. To develop a more realistic improving path for the sustainability of smart city services (SCS), it is necessary to clarify the factors that affect citizens' sense of gain of smart city services (CSGSCS). To achieve this objective, 9 hypotheses were developed based on the modified expectation confirmation theory. Hypothesis testing, mediating effect testing, and heterogeneity analysis was conducted based on data collected from Nanjing citizens. The results indicate that: 1) Expectation-Perception Performance, including Content of SCS, Channel of SCS, and Support of SCS, all have positive direct effects on CSGSCS; 2) Expectation Confirmation directly affects CSGSCS and mediates the positive effect of the Expectation-Perception Performance on CSGSCS; 3) Heterogeneity of age and usage frequency have significant effects on CSGSCS. Finally, three policy implications were proposed, including encouraging citizens to participate in SCS supply, bridging the digital divide created by SCS, and improving the policy and legal system on SCS. This research enriches the academic framework and provides guidance for sustainable supply of SCS in similar cities around the world.}

This article argues that power imbalances between citizens and other organisational participants structurally mute citizens' voices, ultimately compromising smart cities' aims. Living laboratories are a popular smart city intervention that have the potential to address this power imbalance and empower citizens to influence smart city development. This research theoretically and empirically explores this role of living labs through a multiple-case study of urban living labs in the region of Catalonia. The findings uncover a ‘power banking’ mechanism which, coupled with other critical factors, facilitates the effectiveness of such initiatives. The considerable efforts required to engage citizens at a fairly basic level suggest that incorporating citizens into smart city models is more challenging than simplistic Quadruple Helix discourses convey.}

However, intermittent power generation from renewable energy sources and increased peak load due to EV charging can pose technical challenges for the power systems. Improved load matching through energy system optimization can minimize these challenges. This paper assesses the optimal urban-scale energy matching potentials in a net-zero energy city powered by wind and solar energy, considering three EV charging scenarios: opportunistic charging, smart charging, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G). A city on the west coast of Sweden is used as a case study. The smart charging and V2G schemes aim to minimize the mismatch between generation and load, and are formulated as quadratic programming problems. The simulation results show that the optimal load matching performance is achieved in a net-zero energy city with the V2G scheme and a wind-PV electricity production share of 70:30. The load matching performance in the optimal net-zero energy city is increased from 68% with opportunistic charging to 73% with smart charging and further to 84% with V2G. It is also shown that a 2.4 GWh EV battery participating in the V2G scheme equals 1.4 GWh stationary energy storage in improving urban-scale load matching performance. The findings indicate that EVs have a high potential to provide flexibility to urban energy systems.}

However, although the benefits of such units are well known, their proper positioning in a city is challenging when considering a limited set of available units. In this sense, data-driven approaches can be leveraged to provide a better perception of the urban environments under consideration, allowing emergency management systems to be tailored to the specificities of a target city, thus improving the positioning of EDUs. This article proposes the processing of geospatial data of emergency-related urban infrastructure to support the computing of risk zones in a city, which is retrieved from the OpenStreetMap database together with the map of streets within a defined area. Since risk zones indirectly indicate the proportional number of detection units to be deployed, for each configuration setting of the EDUs, we propose an algorithm that computes the positions for such units only on streets, in a balanced way. Furthermore, considering that EDUs are expected to report detected emergencies through a wireless connection, we have also modelled the coverage area of existing networks in a city, which is also processed according to a suitable dataset. The proposed algorithm performs a fine-grained positioning of EDUs based on the number of active networks, flexibly favouring the EDUs' connectivity requirements such as reliability, throughput, latency, and transmission costs according to the actual demands of any urban emergency management system. Experimental results with real data demonstrated the applicability of the proposed mathematical model and the associated algorithm, reinforcing its practical application for the planning and construction of smart cities.}

We implement both synchronous and asynchronous communication modes for agents interacting with the knowledge graph. When occurring in conjunction, directed acyclic graphs of derivations can arise, with changing data propagating through the knowledge graph by means of agents’ actions. While the framework itself is domain-agnostic, we apply it in the context of smart cities as part of the World Avatar project and demonstrate that it is capable of handling sequential events across different timescales.

abstract = {A data fusion and information integration (DFII-VT) framework is proposed to solve the batch-based vehicle matching/tracking problem using heterogeneous fixed-location and mobile sensing data available in smart cities. To make the model more realistic, traffic knowledge such as lane-choice decision, traffic merging, travel time and vehicle characteristics are calibrated using the historical dataset and then integrated into the model. The problem can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization model, and solved using a dynamic programming/Kuhn-Munkres algorithm-based two-step approach. By doing so, the proposed method can obtain individual travel times of the matched data pairs, and these can be directly used to estimate the corridor travel times of individual vehicles. The experimental results show that the fusion of mobile sensing data and fixed-location data yields significantly better results than using single-source data. Significant improvements in matching accuracy are obtained as more traffic information is integrated into the model. Therefore, the method may be considered a framework for integrating the manifold traffic information acquired within smart cities to obtain more accurate matching results and further used to optimize other fine-grained traffic applications, such as estimating vehicle trajectories along arterial corridors, estimating individual vehicle-based fuel consumption/emissions, and helping to infer real-time queuing processes at signalized intersections. The paper also studies some practical issues related to the use of heterogeneous traffic data, such as data errors, and detection failures.}

Yet, it is not clear how policymakers narrow down the topics to focus on with respect to their smart city agenda. As a result, the aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical contribution that explains how local governments define their smart city policy agenda. It is suggested that the agenda is influenced by policy priorities at the local level from other urban domains. To support this notion, policy studies literature is used to show that three streams of problems, policy, and politics, when aligned, set the policy agenda. The smart city agenda will be formed from key ideas existing at the local political level, such as policy priorities, that have now been matched with solutions framed in the smart city context, all underpinned by a favourable political environment. In addition, from smart city policy related documents, a topic modelling analysis illustrates a set of topics that are associated to the smart city policy agenda in two cities, London and Melbourne. This shows how some topics on the smart city agenda can be likened to issues that are the primary topic of another policy domain.}

Previous studies have concentrated on analyzing the spatial distribution of urban services, with less attention on their contribution as local urban amenities. In this study, we propose a spatial dynamic modeling approach based on urban amenities using social media data from Google Place API to provide locational information on potential resident interactions. We use a representative region in Europe (Stockholm County, SE) to simulate and project urban development in the region until 2050. Our circular conceptual framework of spatial information and feedback supports decision-makers in testing possible urban planning scenarios that align with the vision of a smart city. Simulation results reveal the interplay between human-land interactions on a specific spatial-temporal scale, and we analyze scenario outcomes in relation to commercial and residential land uses. Overall, our study provides a new perspective on human-social behavior-driven urban development, through a smart, spatial dynamic model as a planning support system that can enhance realism, and ultimately help realize planned development objectives in the region.}

It gives extra control to the client for matching its needs according to the application but with confiscated network performance. For a reliable end-to-end service assurance, guaranteed QoS and controlled scalability, MQTT based IoT must be examined for various network parameters. In this work, an improved TCP based transparent MQTT network is proposed for massively deployed connected devices in smart cities. The mathematical modeling is carried out by analyzing end-to-end quality assurance. Network latency, content delivery rate, number of subscribe/publish requests and services offered by the MQTT broker for various topic IDs are then verified on physical network. These parameters are examined over a transparent gateway-based network for verifying the agreement of devised probability based mathematical model with the actual content delivery, service rate and request hold time at virtual machine based MQTT broker, local network broker and remote server respectively. The Improved MQTT model surpasses Apollo, RabbitMQ and Mosquitto server by evidencing the message queueing delay of 3.5 ms for QoS-0 and 3.6 ms for QoS-1 service IoT.}

The well-defined structural hierarchy of managing organizations in a smart city face several data management issues. The integration of emerging technologies, such as (IoT), has introduced more complexity to data maintenance in the smart city. At present, cloud-based information systems have become the norm for managing IoT data. Due to the centralized administrative control, the cloud-based information management is untrusted. Hence, it fails to guarantee the integrity of IoT data and traceability of operations to achieve transparency within the smart city organizations. Adoption of blockchain-based information systems can be viable solution to address these challenges. However, it introduces a new challenge of interoperability of transactions among different smart city organizations. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized hierarchy of blockchains, named Blockchain-of-Blockchains (BoBs), for ensuring data integrity and blockchain interoperability at the same time. We implement the proposed concept using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethermint as a proof-of-concept for evaluating the performance of the proposed concept.}

However, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as issues related to data privacy and security and the potential for job displacement. Blockchain technology can be used to securely store and manage data related to smart cities, such as information about energy usage, traffic patterns, and public services. It can also be used to enable secure and efficient communication and transactions between different stakeholders in a smart city, such as government agencies, businesses, and residents.

The manuscript strives to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to Twitter messages using supervised learning to achieve real-time automated event detection in smart cities. A semantic-based taxonomy of risks is devised to discover and analyse associated events from data streams, with a view to: (i) read and process, in real-time, published texts (ii) classify each text into one representative real-world category (iii) assign a citizen satisfaction value to each event. To select the language processing models striking the best balance between accuracy and processing speed, we conducted a pre-emptive evaluation, comparing several baseline language models formerly employed by researchers for event classification. A heuristic analysis of several smart cities and community initiatives was conducted, with a view to define real-world scenarios as basis for determining correlations between two or more co-occurring event types and their associated levels of citizen satisfaction, while further considering environmental factors. Based on Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA), we established the relationships between scenario variables, obtaining a variance of 60%–90% between the dependent and independent variables. The selected combination of supervised NLP techniques leverages an accuracy of 88.5%. We found that all regression models had at least one variable below the 0.05 threshold of the f−test, therefore at least one statistically significant independent variable. These findings ultimately illustrate how citizens, taking the role of active social sensors, can yield vital data that authorities can use to make educated decisions and sustainably construct smarter cities.}

Among all sources of renewable energy, tidal energy is one of the most efficient. In order to accurately simulate and predict tidal current (TC), a novel two-stage methodology is suggested in this paper which not only can benefit the smart cities, but also can help for a more fitting landscape design in offshore areas. The integration of digital twin technology in landscape planning facilitates a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy systems in smart cities, enabling proactive decision-making and sustainable development strategies. To extract the most desirable characteristics from the dataset measuring TC speed and direction, the suggested method uses a unique fuzzy feature selection (FFS) technique. The Long short-term memory (LSTM) is further trained for precise prediction using the chosen characteristics. In order to improve the performance of the LSTM, an evolutionary optimization technique is developed to train the parameters of the proposed model to reach the best training objectives. The efficiency and precision of the model are evaluated using real tidal data from the Qinhuangdao beach. The outcomes demonstrate the proposed model's suitable performance and excellent precision in contrast to other well-known techniques like shallow NNs and well-known linear techniques.}

This conclusion remains valid in the placebo test, instrumental variable method, and a series of robustness verifications. 2. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between energy efficiency and per capita CO2 emissions, and most cities in China have crossed the inflection point; smart city construction achieves energy savings and reduces per capita CO2 emissions by improving energy efficiency. 3. The effect of smart city construction on CO2 emission reduction is more obvious in cities with higher administrative levels, higher levels of neutral technological progress and green innovation, and higher levels of advanced industrial structure. This research provides an empirical basis for how developing countries or regions can move toward sustainable development through digital and intelligent transformation and demonstrates the importance of providing new infrastructure construction such as smart cities from the perspective of a low-carbon economy.}

abstract = {The evaluation of smart cities involves multiple stakeholder groups and has multiple objectives. Therefore, a multi-criteria approach is required to facilitate inclusive decisions. In view of covering classic fuzzy sets, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) with parameters q can provide a wider range to represent uncertain information. Considering the flexibility and robustness of the Frank aggregation method, this study investigates a new framework for smart city evaluation by integrating the Frank operator with q-ROFS. First, it defines the Frank operational rule of q-ROFS, and based on this rule, it presents q-rung orthopair fuzzy Frank weighted averaging/geometric operators. In addition, it analyzes some properties of the proposed operators and discusses their exceptional cases. Subsequently, by combining an improved TOPSIS model and the proposed operators, it presents a novel multi-attribute evaluation approach within q-ROF situations. Finally, it proves the feasibility of this method through its application in a smart city evaluation.}

To fill this gap, we develop a new index system involving three dimensions of digital infrastructure, smart living, and digital economy. Moreover, compared with studies that use subjective weighting methods to rank the smartness of cities, we combine the Shannon entropy weighting method with three multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods to show the objectiveness of the evaluation process. Through analyzing the quantitative data from nine cities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China, we find that digital infrastructure is the most important first-level indicator, accounting for 46.92%, followed by the digital economy and smart life accounting for 32.48% and 20.60% respectively. More importantly, when the nine cities in the PRD region are ranked by three MCDM methods, the correlation between the results is over 90%, thus proving robustness. We contribute to the current smart city literature by enriching the components of the smart city index system, as well as evaluation methods. Our findings also guide decision-makers in formulating more targeted smart city construction plans.}

We investigate the security challenges related to MCC in smart cities and provide viable solutions to these issues in this study. To examine the current state of security in MCC in smart cities, we did a literature analysis of previously published work on the topic and utilized a combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches.

Smart cities have become an increasingly essential component of urban development in recent years, harnessing new technologies to improve inhabitants’ quality of life. MCC has emerged as a vital technology for smart cities, allowing users to access data and apps from anywhere, at any time, and on any device. However, the usage of MCC poses a number of security risks, which can negate the benefits of this technology. We investigate the security challenges connected with the use of MCC in smart cities in this research. We begin by doing a thorough evaluation of previously published work on this topic. We then assess the existing level of security in MCC in smart cities using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Our findings indicate that the usage of MCC in smart cities raises a number of security problems, including data leaks, cyber-attacks, and privacy concerns.

One dimension of a smart city, i.e., smart people/society, suggests that a smart city requires high-quality social interactions and social relationships that help cities connect with their residents and the outside world. For this purpose, smart cities in Indonesia have developed digital platforms (internet websites and mobile applications) to disseminate the cities' programs and information and facilitate sharing of information among its residents. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affect the seeking and sharing of information on the smart city digital platforms. We used a quantitative approach by conducting surveys in 8 smart cities in Indonesia, with 1161 respondents. The survey data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that social factors (sense of belonging and seeking reputations) have dominant roles in determining residents' intention to seek information on smart city platforms. In turn, the intention to seek information is the key factor that affects the residents' intention to share information on the smart city platforms and on their online social network. This paper provides insights on the factors that need more attention from smart city administrators to improve resident engagement and enhance the dimension of smart people.}

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer technology have been promising for empowering and enabling seamless operation of wireless sensors and developing sustainable systems such as wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). Relying on this technology and focusing on WRSNs, this paper proposes an adaptive charging scheduling algorithm called the three-stage fuzzy metaheuristic algorithm (TSFM) by using the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and a multiobjective function designed to meet the application requirements of WRSNs in smart cities. The TSFM algorithm benefits from the WOA for the automated configuration and optimization of the fuzzy rule-base table in a three-stage fuzzy inference system for clustering, routing, and scheduling mobile charging simultaneously. Unlike the other methods, the TSFM algorithm determines the ratio of effect of fuzzy input parameters of every stage based on application and environment in addition to considering effective parameters for every stage, especially for charging scheduling (e.g., the energy of a charge-request node, the distance between a charge-request node and a mobile charging (MC), the density of a charge-request node, the average energy consumption rate of a charge-request node, and the time elapsed after a charge request). Furthermore, for the proper distribution of energy in a network, better responsiveness, and optimal use of a charging robot, two energy thresholds are defined in the TSFM algorithm, namely as the charging request issue threshold and the charging operation completion threshold. The TSFM algorithm is adaptable to applications, environments, and requirements of WRSNs not only by using the features of nodes (as the fuzzy input parameters) but also by considering the application-specific features, environments, and infrastructure (e.g., network size, number of nodes, base station (BS) positions, and designer’s goals) within the process of optimizing tunable parameters. The TSFM algorithm was evaluated and compared with some common methods such as FCFS, NJNP, and ESS in terms of functional metrics such as energy utility, charging latency, survival rate, death rate of nodes, system stability, number of packets received by BS, number of request nodes, number of alive nodes, average residual energy, adaptability analysis, and statistical validation in two scenarios and six applications. According to the simulation results, the proposed TSFM algorithm improved the performance criteria and outperformed the other methods by far in terms of application. For instance, the TSFM algorithm improved the minimum system stability rate by 167%, 0.73%, and 123% compared with FCFS, NJNP, and ESS methods, respectively.}

A smart city pilot policy (SCPP) with innovative advantages and environmentally friendly features provides a feasible way to scientifically achieve carbon emission reduction targets while maintaining industrial growth. However, there is a lack of specific understanding of the microscopic carbon reduction mechanisms of the policy. Thus, based on the data of A-share listed industrial firms from 2009 to 2018 in China, this study explores the impact mechanism of the SCPP on the CO2 emissions from industrial firms with the time-varying DID methodology and the mediating effect model. The results demonstrate that the SCPP can curb CO2 emissions from industrial firms in China by 23% by strengthening the intensity of environmental regulation and promoting green technological innovation. Further analysis indicates that the mediating effect of resource allocation efficiency only works in industrial firms in low-carbon industries, not high-carbon industries. In addition, the heterogeneity test suggests a pronounced reduction effect of the SCPP on non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs), and industrial enterprises in low-carbon industries, resource-based cities and eastern China. This paper is of great significance for providing theoretical and practical implications for making rational use of smart city policies to improve the carbon reduction performance of enterprises.}

The environmental features of urban cities mean that signal transmission can be affected across communication networks, with packet delays, packet loss and higher error rates occurring during data exchange. There is a need for sustainable and robust low-energy signals for smart EV communication. The present paper proposes a novel method for continuous, robust video data transmission at low energy via multi-sensory-enabled 5G technology. The transceivers (transmitters and receivers) are designed with multiple low-energy sensors for detecting data availability at the receiver device. By applying a threshold level detection technique, data availability is identified dependent upon energy level and successive data exchange occurs between transceivers. The application of low-energy signal transmission reduces power usage during video data transmission and leads to a sustainable solution for intelligent EV applications. The performance of the proposed multi-sensory technique is tested and verified using various calibrated parameters considering key metrics including collision error, propagation error, sensing error and accuracy. The proposed model significantly improves accuracy, with higher sensing capabilities and lower delays and propagation errors compared to the existing buffer model.}

This paper proposes an authentication protocol with a full aggregation signature to secure the smart city applications. A certificate-less aggregate signature (CLAS) is used for smart city real applications such as secure routing and database outsourcing. The proposed CLAS achieves message authentication, user anonymity, constant signature size, unlinkability, and is resistant to replay attacks. Also, we have proved that the proposed scheme is resistant to all malicious adversaries.

Due to reduced public funding, many public transport systems are already facing challenges to maintain their services. For a smart city, the goal of public transport is not simply the movement of people, but the provision and enhancement of mobility for living. This will be particularly challenging due to changes in habitation trends and work patterns. For example, the growth of mega-cities has led to extreme traffic congestion in city centres and urban sprawl on their outskirts. In order to provide sufficient coverage and frequency of service, an integrated co-ordinated multi-modal public transport system is needed, leading to substantial increase in operational complexity. Environmental concerns and the recent pandemic may also change work and commuting patterns in the future, with more people working from home and companies adopting flexible work shifts. For smart cities, public transport must offer ubiquitous access, real-time response to demand, convenience and quality service, and energy-efficient operations. This paper will discuss the challenges in network design, operations planning, scheduling and management of smart public transport systems. A brief survey of recent research and innovations will also be presented.}

Despite efforts in recent years, no current developed MaaS has fully addressed all evaluation criteria. Moreover, no research has evaluated the sustainability of MaaS in the context of determining its optimality. As such, this research's pivotal contribution is to present an evaluation of simulation tools for sustainable MaaS in autonomous vehicles operating in smart cities. This evaluation leans on the advanced extension of a newly proposed an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set (IVFFRS) incorporated within integrated MCDM methodologies. The IVFFRS is designed to capture intricate and uncertain evaluative data. The initial phase of the evaluation methodology involves formulating the evaluation criteria using an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set, fuzzily weighted for zero inconsistency. The subsequent phase adopts the interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough decision via the opinion score method to prioritize alternatives in light of data variations. This study evaluates ten distinct simulation tools for MaaS in autonomous vehicles based on seven criteria. The methodology's robustness is further ascertained through sensitivity and comparative analyses.}

Each existing air quality monitoring method carries inherent limitations alongside its advantages. This study addresses the drawbacks of both satellite-based and fixed monitoring stations by proposing a drone-based air quality monitoring solution. The entire urban area was surveyed using a multi-rotor drone equipped with sensors capable of measuring atmospheric components, resulting in the creation of high-resolution air pollution maps. The expansive urban area, exceeding the coverage capacity of a single flight, was systematically subdivided into subregions. Distinct measurements were conducted in each subregion, and a consolidated mapping was generated by combining the individual results obtained. The drone, operating autonomously, conducted precise measurements on a citywide scale, enhancing the consistency of pollutant mapping by eliminating potential errors associated with manual control. Pollution sources were identified throughout the city, and real-time data revealed how transportation-induced air pollution affected different regions. Environmental factors like wind and pressure differences were identified as influential in the varied spread of air pollutants across different parts of the city. The study underscores the pivotal role of transportation in urban air pollution, laying the groundwork for the development of targeted pollution control strategies in urban environments. Furthermore, the research validates the potential of UAVs in advancing the efficient management of smart cities, particularly through the monitoring and analysis of air pollution stemming from transportation.}

abstract = {Enhancing urban resilience is increasingly crucial for cities to achieve sustainable development. However, existing studies have a limited understanding of the resilience of shrinking cities and their response policies. Taking Yichun, a typical shrinking city in China, as an example, this study constructs a system dynamics model to assess urban resilience from a subsystem perspective and explores the relationship between the dynamic development of resilience and urban shrinkage from 2008 to 2028. Then, a smart decline response policy of Yichun is put forward. The findings indicate that the evolution curve of urban resilience shows a fluctuating growth trend as a whole and that the dominant subsystems of resilience are changing. The occurrence of urban shrinkage inhibits the dynamic development of urban resilience and has various effects on the subsystems of resilience. Compared with the regrowth strategy, the smart decline strategy can effectively improve the resilience and mitigate the adverse impact of urban shrinkage on the resilience under the condition of limited resources. Resilience can be proven to be a viable perspective to help formulate a response strategy of shrinking cities. These findings will enhance comprehension of the resilience of shrinking cities and provide a reference to address urban shrinkage and formulate corresponding governance strategies.}
