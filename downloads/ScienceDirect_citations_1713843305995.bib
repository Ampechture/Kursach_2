abstract = {Dimensions of electrical distribution network datasets have been increasing exponentially as result of global acceptance of toward smart metering projects for secure implementation of demand response strategies and attaining satisfactory operation of electrical distribution network. Traditional approaches of analyzing these datasets have often been prone to losing of important information for instance averaging and aggregating of data; such loss of information can prove imperative in this era of demand side management and demand response. High dimensionality of distribution dataset is prominent factor for popularity of such conventional perspective toward large datasets. However, recent evolution in data mining have tossed various dimensionality reduction techniques expressing minimal loss of information. This paper proposes a feature based clustering algorithm aimed at dimensionality reduction, load profile characterization and probabilistic load variation assessment as a case study for smart village project of Nana Kajaliyala village, Gujarat, India. Proposed algorithm attains profile characterization using classical k-means alongside an empirical feature selection countering high dimensionality. A comparative evaluation of proposed algorithm with other popular techniques like self-organizing map (SOM) and classical k-means is presented in this paper. Moreover, a novel probabilistic analysis approach is conferred, which is directed at assessment of load variation, peak risk analysis of individual consumers. Determined statistical assessment measures in this paper would aid the utility with capability to execute cognitive decision making and reduce aggregate technical and commercial losses. Furthermore, load labels assigned to each characteristic profile could help managing load requirements, and planning future operations.}

abstract = {The governmental initiative of high-quality development (HQD) marks a shift in the Chinese development paradigm from prioritizing speed to prioritizing quality towards comprehensive goals of economic growth, social vitality, innovation capacity, industrial upgrading, regional cooperation, and green transformation. This initiative is increasingly discussed within the framework of mega-regions, with prior studies demonstrating that they are critical arenas for promoting HQD visions. However, unevenness within mega-regions has become an important limitation to this vision. Namely, significant disparities exist between mega-regional core cities and the smaller neighboring cities in most HQD indicators. This paper conceptualizes these smaller players as secondary cities. Based on this, this paper aims to understand and differentiate the specific challenges of secondary cities facing intra-regional unevenness in the context of HQD. We build an evaluation framework and employ the TOPSIS method to evaluate 34 core cities and 180 secondary cities. Then, we introduce typological thinking to develop a meaningful classification of secondary cities based on the results of these evaluations. K-means clustering analysis identifies five secondary city types with similar profiles. The analysis supports the discussion of the characteristics and challenges of each type and may contribute to policy recommendations for a balanced HQD in mega-regional secondary cities.}

abstract = {Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a crucial direction in realizing the next-generation smart manufacturing. With the deployment of IoT technologies, massive production data and information are real-timely accessible for decision-makers. However, the enemies: complexity and uncertainty, that researchers and practitioners have been fighting for decades still hinder the development of smart manufacturing. In the realm of manufacturing optimization like production planning and scheduling, considerable research efforts have been made. However, more or less similar results are generated, which are theoretically optimal but lack the ability to cope with disturbances in the real-life industry. This study develops a framework of the Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and proposes a smart digitalization solution to achieve real-time visibility, traceability, and information sharing. Also, a novel Spatial-Temporal Finite Element Analytics (ST-FEA) based on real-time cyber-physical visibility and traceability is innovated to achieve real-time advanced production planning and scheduling in the Hybrid Flow Shop. By discretizing the space and time of the original problem in meshing, the complexity and uncertainty are substantially reduced. The simpler models can thus be established and solved with a more straightforward method. Case studies will be conducted to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method in future research.}

Based on the hypothesis that “emotional comfort” emerges in places where people feel “at home,” the research reflects on the place attachment theory, on its application to health-care spaces, and argues on how smart technologies can activate it. For this reason the authors start by exploring place attachment theories to show how increasing people–place bonding is beneficial to an individual’s well-being. Then, they explore the role of certain smart technologies to form positive bonds between individuals and the spaces around them in a health-care setting, arguing that this will result in an increased patient well-being. Personalization, privacy, and control were identified as key concepts in domestic settings to recreate in health-care environments where smart technologies could be the vital elements to link these fields.}

However, while private actors frequently make use of the business model concept to actively manage their service provision, public organizations struggle with adopting it. This has led to a separate literature stream in which public management scholars developed public sector adaptations of the business model concept. As the business model conceptualizations in the general and public management literatures diverge, insight transfer between both streams is becoming increasingly difficult. Building on the need for more conceptual alignment in business model research, this article explores how the divergent conceptualizations of business models in the general and public management literatures can be reintegrated. It first presents the results of a focused literature review to illustrate their commonalities and differences. The article then introduces an integrated business model framework for the private and public sectors to merge the findings of both streams as well as to provide a common language for public-private business model realization. By advocating an integrated approach, we aim to bridge the emerging gap between the general and public management business model literatures, thereby seeking to counteract the gap's adverse implications for business model research as well as practice.}

In these systems, the assisting services are provided by use of the sensors that detect the location of inhabitants. Even though the cost and performance efficiencies of sensor networks depend directly on the number of the deployed sensors as well as the approaches that are employed to track the location of inhabitants, these factors are separately considered in research studies. In this paper, we propose an approach to track a target in smart homes. We present a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that i. optimizes the number of the deployed sensors according to our proposed target tracking approach, ii. determines the placement of sensors in the network while considering the layout of the Region of Interest (RoI), iii. proposes appropriate settings for the sensors' field of view and their orientation, and, iv. deploys sensors according to the satisfaction of a reliability level in the network. In order to validate the proposed model and show its applicability, we use two sets of data, including real data gathered from a living lab and randomly generated data, as well as a test scenario. We also present a user interface that employs the concepts, which are presented in this research. The interface helps to easily monitor the location, energy consumption and well-being factors of a target in an AAL environment.}

The development of a conceptual model explores smart customer experiences and their consequences on smart technology, customer, and retailer-level outcomes. Guided by technology adoption research, this research examines the relationships between smart customer experience, customer satisfaction, perceived risk, behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, stickiness to retail store, shopping effectiveness, and consumer well-being. This study uses a multi-phased research approach. Findings indicate that smart customer experience directly enhances satisfaction and reduces perceived risk towards smart retail technologies. Customer satisfaction increases behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, stickiness to retailer, shopping effectiveness, and customer well-being. Perceived risk reduces behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, shopping effectiveness, and stickiness to retailer. Finally, customer satisfaction and perceived risk both mediate the relationships between smart customer experience and outcome variables.}

UB Card is a student’s official ID at the University at Buffalo and is used across campus for various activities including Stampedes and Shuttles (on-campus bus system), facilities access, library services, dining, shopping, and etc. Two activity–mobility trajectory construction algorithms are developed. The base algorithm constructs students’ activity–mobility patterns in space–time dimension using a set of smart card transaction data points as the only inputs. The modified individualized algorithm constructs activity–mobility patterns with prior knowledge of students’ previous patterns as they have similar patterns for certain days of the week. A database of 37 students’ travel survey and UB card transactions that contains a period of 5days have been used to illustrate the results of the study. Three measures of errors have been proposed to capture the time allocation, location deviation, and activity sequences. These errors present an acceptable accuracy (12–25% error ranges for activity types and average 0.04–0.16 miles of error for location predictions) and show the potential of inferring activity–mobility behaviors based on smart card transaction type data sets.}

This requires deployment of a large number of sensors to obtain sufficient information that can help the owners and engineers to timely detect anomalies in the structural performance. Considering the challenges, such as high deployment cost, low durability, and weak compatibility, for the use of conventional sensors in the long-term monitoring of concrete structures, self-sensing cement composites with intrinsic strain- and damage-sensing capabilities can be a more practical and sustainable approach for condition monitoring. Although various nano- and microfillers have been used to develop such smart cement composites, graphene and its derivatives have gained significant attention in developing functional cement-based composites over the past decade. Graphene sheets are two-dimensional nanomaterials and offer various advantages such as excellent mechanical properties, ultrahigh specific surface area, and relatively low cost. This chapter provides a comprehensive review on the use of graphene-based nanomaterials in the development of self-sensing cementitious composites. First, different forms of graphene-based nanomaterials are described and their use for self-sensing applications is assessed. Then various techniques for the dispersion of graphene nanomaterials into a cement matrix are discussed, followed by a discussion on the experimental techniques that can be used to assess the quality of dispersion. Also, different methods used for electrical and self-sensing characterization tests of cement composites are described. A summary of earlier studies on self-sensing graphene-reinforced cement composites is provided. Next, the piezoresistive behavior of graphene-reinforced cement composites under applied loads is presented for a mortar composite filled with different types of graphene materials. Finally, opportunities for the use of these self-sensing composites in smart infrastructure applications are discussed and potential challenges are noted.}

abstract = {A new community based polygeneration smart energy system is proposed to meet the demands of a community in a sustainable manner and applied to case study where we aim to balance Ontario’s energy requirements while minimizing carbon emissions. In this case study, the smart energy hub utilizes a 30 MW small modular nuclear reactor which provides a unique and novel gas system at high temperature level integrated for the production and transportation of chemical energy; this occurs through a circuit in which an endothermic reaction (steam methane reforming plant) is connected to an exothermic reaction (methanation plant) and appears to be an attractive and preferable solution that meets the environmental requirements for a stable and efficient energy supply process. Complex multiscale subsystems are developed, modeled and simulated in the Aspen plus. Thermodynamic analyses on different sub-plants are presented, considering natural gas as the main feedstock, and incorporating power and heat production through chemical looping. The energy hub is capable of generating 10.8 MW of electricity and supplying 17.9 MW of heat for district heating. Hence, the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the smart energy system are found to be 54% and 76% respectively. Also, a power to gas plant is integrated into the energy hub for the production of anhydrous ammonia with a capacity of 1816.22 tons/day and 100% carbon capture capabilities. Moreover, the impact of varying the input proportions of the system on the products and functionality of the energy hub are investigated.}

Probabilistic forecasts are generated for the residential solar photovoltaic (PV) and secondary substation levels. The test case consists of 44 micro-generation units and 10 secondary substations from the Smart Grid pilot in Évora, Portugal. The benchmark model is the well-known autoregressive forecasting method (univariate approach).

Many cities have initiated bike-sharing schemes to promote sustainable mobility, increase bicycle usage, and enhance public transport's first and last-mile connectivity options. During the last few years, India also experienced a boom in bike-sharing schemes. However, unlike developed countries in Europe and America, limited research is available on bike-share schemes in developing countries like India. As a result, these countries face many problems in planning, designing, and operating bike-share schemes. This article considered Delhi a case study to address some of these problems and contribute to India's knowledge of bike-share schemes. The study considered different bike-share scheme operations in Delhi to analyse the bike-share characteristics and evaluate their impact on bike-share usage and ridership. Further, spatial analysis of bike-share schemes was also conducted to analyse the accessibility of bike stations to other facilities such as public transport systems, points of interest and their impact on bike-share usage and ridership. Moreover, a user-based survey was conducted to understand bike-share users' socioeconomic, trip characteristics, and preferences. Furthermore, a swot analysis was conducted to explore the city's strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for operating bike-share schemes. Finally, based on the evaluation of bike-share schemes in Delhi, the study proposed various planning and policy-level recommendations to improve the bike-sharing schemes in similar size cities in developing countries like India.}

So, reliable-economical operation of grids during extreme weather conditions is one of challenges for grid operators. In this regard, this paper proposes resilience enhancement programs in order to increase resilience and economic profits in a smart grid. In proposed approach, resilience improvement is done by modeling weather effects on branches outages and then re-scheduling of distributed energy resources and energy storages, load shifting and dynamic reconfiguration of distribution network. In this paper, hourly variation of weather depended failure probabilities are considered. Resilience enhancement programs aim to mitigate effects of events which may cause by extreme weather before fault inception by rescheduling of resources and selecting suitable reconfigurations. Also, reconfiguration isolates damaged parts after fault inception. The objectives in the proposed approach are defined as minimizing operational cost of distribution network and energy not supplied penalty costs from the system operator’s viewpoint, as well as, maximizing benefits of energy resources owners by considering weather conditions. A multi-objective optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm and epsilon constraint method using fuzzy decision maker is employed to choose the best solution from a provided Pareto optimal set. In order to evaluate performance of proposed resilience enhancement programs and its effect, resilience assessment metrics are studied. Various simulations prove the efficiency of proposed model in compare with traditional grid during extreme weather conditions.}

Segmented profiles cover a time window that is less than or equal to 24h. Simulation results show that Canberra distance outperforms the other distance functions. Results also show that the segmented cluster centres produce more accurate load estimates than daily cluster centres. Higher accuracy estimates were obtained with cluster centres in the range of 16–24h.

This study aimed to provide basic data to respond to the continuously increasing demand for ESs by analyzing the potential value of cultural ecosystem services (CESs). These services are among the most important ESs and represent the most intimate interactions between humans and nature. The ongoing Busan Eco Delta City development was selected as the study subject. Using the concept of compensating surplus as a theoretical framework, the benefit derived from CESs by local citizens was determined. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted on the willingness to pay and its influence on CESs. Results from the 1,477 survey responses showed that the willingness to pay for CESs was affected by the offer amount, age, place of residence, willingness to visit, and environmental organization membership. The average value ascribed to CESs was KRW 9,044, based on a dichotomous-choice response logit model. Among the CESs, the existence CES had the strongest influence on willingness to pay, indicating that the natural resources of the urban ecosystem were of the highest value to the residents. This study presents a clear approach to estimating the potential value of cultural services derived from the urban ecosystem and provides reference data for decision-making processes such as planning and policy establishment.}

Because of the deep interactions between the cyber and physical systems, the detection of cyberattacks targeting the smart grid has become a challenge in recent years. False data injection (FDI) attacks can bypass the bad data detection algorithm to overflow multiple transmission lines and eventually cause cascading failures or blackouts. In this paper, a simplified neural network is developed to detect FDI attacks targeting transmission line overflows. Compared with the state-of-the-art that mainly focused on stealthy attacks bypassing state-estimation, the novelty of the proposed approach is detecting stealthy attacks that not only bypass the state-estimation, but also result in congestion of transmission lines in smart grids. A bad dataset, created by an attack model, is mixed with a set of clean data to train the proposed detection framework. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy of this method in detecting cyber–physical attacks. Also, several case studies are included to test the resilience of the proposed method in various scenarios.}

However, most of the existing studies ignore the temporal dependence of the spatial pattern evolution of CEE and the scale variability of the factors influencing CEE. With the help of an exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis framework, this paper examined the spatiotemporal interactions of CEE across 110 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). In addition, a multiscale geographically weighted regression model was employed to reveal the scale effects of influencing factors on CEE. The main conclusions are as follows: first, the CEE of cities in the YREB shows a fluctuating upward trend, but the overall level is still low, and a certain polarization phenomenon exists. Second, the spatial pattern of the CEE of cities in the YREB is generally relatively stable, with strong spatial integration and path dependence. Finally, the factors influencing CEE exhibit obvious scale variability and spatial heterogeneity. Our findings can provide a basis for localized and differentiated carbon emission reduction decision-making at the city level, as well as new insights for the formulation of sustainable urban spatial planning and low-carbon development strategies.}

Public transport models are commonly applied to predict ridership due to structural network changes, using a calibrated parameter set. Predicting the impact of planned disturbances, like temporary track closures, on public transport ridership is however an unexplored area. In the Netherlands, this area becomes increasingly important, given the many track closures operators are confronted with the last and upcoming years. We investigated the passenger impact of four planned disturbances on the public transport network of The Hague, the Netherlands, by comparing predicted and realized public transport ridership using smart card data. A three-step search procedure is applied to find a parameter set resulting in higher prediction accuracy. We found that in-vehicle time in rail-replacing bus services is perceived ≈1.1 times more negatively compared to in-vehicle time perception in the initial tram line. Waiting time for temporary rail-replacement bus services is found to be perceived ≈1.3 times higher, compared to waiting time perception for regular tram and bus services. Besides, passengers do not seem to perceive the theoretical benefit of the usually higher frequency of rail-replacement bus services compared to the frequency of the replaced tram line. For the different case studies, the new parameter set results in 3% up to 13% higher prediction accuracy compared to the default parameter set. It supports public transport operators to better predict the required supply of rail-replacement services and to predict the impact on their revenues.}

The roof control of (MR) in safe and efficient mining of coal mine is analyzed and studied to solve the obstacles to the development of wireless intelligent sensors in the intelligent transportation system. The idea of controlling roadway deformation by using the deformation and development of plastic zone has been innovatively put forward. Based on the butterfly-shaped plastic zone theory of surrounding rock of MR and the countermeasures of asymmetric roof support, Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC3D) software is used to construct the numerical model of uneven deformation and failure of roof, and the uneven failure of surrounding rock of MR in Lijiatun Coal Mine is analyzed. The uneven distribution characteristics of MR under dynamic influence conditions show that after the mining effect, the roadway surrounding rock will produce large deviatoric stress, and the direction of the maximum principal stress will tilt to one side of the working face, to maximize the plasticity of one side of the roadway roof. Especially after secondary mining, the maximum position of plastic failure on the side of the roadway roof is more obvious, accompanied by the uneven failure of the roof. On this basis, the asymmetric support strategy of the roadway roof is proposed to strengthen the roof on the side with serious deformation. The maximum uneven expansion of the plastic zone after reinforcement occurs in the 11,209 working face 200m, not more than 45mm. This reinforcement scheme reduces the uneven deformation of the roof. The new technology clears the obstacles for the development of wireless intelligent sensors and lays a good foundation for the rapid development of smart cities.}

We refine the notion of connectedness by comparing three mechanisms through which knowledge spillovers occur between cities (geographically, technologically, and socially via social media links). We also examine how local psychological openness facilitates this diffusion and absorption process. Using 360 U.S. cities as our empirical context, we find geographically mediated and socially mediated (but not technologically mediated) knowledge spillovers to show positive relationships with the rate of patenting. Moreover, results confirm a positive moderation effect of psychological openness on the relationship between socially mediated knowledge spillovers and the rate of patenting. By providing a more comprehensive test of knowledge spillover mechanisms, our study indicates that the often-quoted physical proximity to knowledge pools remains a robust driver. However, a city's virtual connection to knowledge pools (e.g., via social media links between people) also matter, particularly if that city is psychologically more open. This catalyst of local openness might occur because open populations better absorb inflowing knowledge and utilize it more effectively via key innovators. We discuss implications for research and policy with a particular focus on virtual human (vs. geographically bounded) connectedness and psychological openness as intertwined key areas of a new human geography of innovation.}

This work considers potentially influential factors for the acceptance of smart charging from the literature and tests their viability employing a structural equation model, following the partial least squares approach. For a sample of 237 early electric vehicle adopters from Germany our results show that contributing to grid stability and the integration of renewable energy sources are key motivational factors for acceptance of smart charging. In addition, the individual need for flexibility should not be impaired through charging control. Further well known influential factors like economic incentives do not seem to have a significant impact in the sample group under scrutiny. These and further findings should be taken into account by aggregators when designing attractive business models that incentivize the participation of early adopters and ease market rollout.}

This data can be used to study the spatiotemporal range of the activity as it usually happens between an alighting and the next boarding transaction. This kind of activity can also be inferred from the start time and duration of the activity, and the available land use in the vicinity. This paper proposes a model which considers the three main characteristics of the activity to measure similarities between passengers’ activities. The model consists of two parallel steps—one for the spatiotemporal aspects and the other for the activity type. The first one uses the concept of Space Time Prism (STP) to measure the spatiotemporal similarity of two activities in a three-dimensional continuous space. The latter models the activity type using a probabilistic decision tree to measure the activity type similarity. The final activity similarity value is the product of the activity type and the spatiotemporal similarity values. The model is implemented for four-day smart card data in Brisbane, Queensland [Australia]. In order to confirm the results of the model, the passengers are clustered and discussed based on the measured activity similarity. The results show more than 81 per cent of the passengers have partial or complete activity similarity with their fellow passengers.}

In this study, the authors suggest a new concept of ocean nuclear power plant (ONPP) by using SMART as a reference reactor, which is the most recent Small Modular Reactor (SMR) developed by Korea, to demonstrate that the proposed concept can improve the safety of NPP from earthquake and tsunami. The proposed concept utilizes Gravity Based Structure (GBS), which is a widely spread construction technique of offshore plants. Because, floating type or submerged type NPPs can be easily affected by severe ocean environments such as tsunamis and storms, additional safety features have to be added to the existing land based plant. In contrast, the newly proposed GBS-type ONPP does not require going through significant design modifications due to inherent characteristics of the construction method. The authors have demonstrated this concept can be applied to the large nuclear power plant in the previous work and will expand this concept for SMRs in this paper. The authors discuss the new concept by presenting design parameters, design requirements, and the new total general arrangement. Furthermore, due to the unique configuration of ONPP SMART, innovative passive safety features can be added to the existing SMART design. The performance of proposed concept to resist earthquake as well as newly added passive safety feature will be discussed by presenting simplified analysis results.}

Transit agencies can raise revenue or relieve overcrowding via fare increases, but they are always confronted with the possibility of heavy ridership losses. Therefore, the outcome of fare changes should be evaluated before implementation. In this work, a methodology was formulated based on elasticity and exhaustive transit card data, and a network approach was proposed to assess the influence of distance-based fare increases on ridership and revenue. The approach was applied to a fare change plan for Beijing Metro. The price elasticities of demand for Beijing Metro at various fare levels and trip distances were tabulated from a stated preference survey. Trip data recorded by an automatic fare collection system was used alongside the topology of the Beijing Metro system to calculate the shortest path lengths between all station pairs, the origin–destination matrix, and trip lengths. Finally, three fare increase alternatives (high, medium, and low) were evaluated in terms of their impact on ridership and revenue. The results demonstrated that smart card data have great potential with regard to fare change evaluation. According to smart card data for a large transit network, the statistical frequency of trip lengths is more highly concentrated than that of the shortest path length. Moreover, the majority of the total trips have a length of around 15km, and these are the most sensitive to fare increases. Specific attention should be paid to this characteristic when developing fare change plans to manage demand or raise revenue.}

Some of these constraints can be set by the owner, for example, timelines for washing machine or charging electric vehicles, not necessitating a smart agent. However, most appliances are subject to physical constraints, for example, washing machine being non-interruptible, and consequently, the modeling of the decision space is non-trivial.

Traditional business models based on manufacturers selling trucks to operators could conceivably disappear. As with passenger transport, the rapid obsolescence of the technology and the cost will drive a non-ownership model and an evolution from products to services. Therefore it is expected that a new network operator will emerge to run this service, which in the future will likely develop into a fully smart network. As the value of the truck technology is reduced and the software component becomes the core source of value creation, it opens up the possibility of new entrants to the market who do not need to purchase physical assets at all and may instead rent them from a competitive pool of asset providers. Despite the recent growth in research on Mobility as a Service (MaaS) in passenger transport, these issues have been neglected in freight transport. The goal of this paper is to establish the features of this new smart network and derive a range of potential business models incorporating the changing roles of each actor, which are then evaluated against an analytical framework of business model innovation. The research concludes by proposing an update to the well-known OECD transportation model to include the network operator concept.}

UAVasBSs help 5G/B5G mobile communication systems to rapidly recover from emergency situations and handle the instant traffic of the flash crowd. In this context, multiple UAVs might form a flying ad-hoc network to establish a flying access network to enhance the network connectivity and service quality. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal number and locations of UAVasBSs in a fast and efficient way to cover the target area to provide temporary yet reliable cellular connectivity. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and network data analysis are key tools to fulfill the above issues. In this article, we propose a smart UAVasBS placement (SUAP) mechanism to improve the mobile network operations in flash crowd and emergency situations. We have modeled such an UAVasBS placement task as an optimization problem to obtain required network connectivity and system performance, and resolved it with a genetic algorithm using the network context information. Simulation results show that our proposal could cover 90% of mobile users, and it provides nearly 90% packet delivery ratio for users with a fast convergence rate.}

abstract = {Multi-robotic services are widely used to enhance the efficiency of Industry 4.0 applications including emergency management in smart factory. The workflow of these robotic services consists of data hungry, delay sensitive and compute intensive tasks. Generally, robots are not enriched in computational power and storage capabilities. It is thus beneficial to leverage the available Cloud resources to complement robots for executing robotic workflows. When multiple robots and Cloud instances work in a collaborative manner, optimal resource allocation for the tasks of a robotic workflow becomes a challenging problem. The diverse energy consumption rate of both robot and Cloud instances, and the cost of executing robotic workflow in such a distributed manner further intensify the resource allocation problem. Since the tasks are inter-dependent, inconvenience in data exchange between local robots and remote Cloud also degrade the service quality. Therefore, in this paper, we address simultaneous optimization of makespan, energy consumption and cost while allocating resources for the tasks of a robotic workflow. As a use case, we consider resource allocation for the robotic workflow of emergency management service in smart factory. We design an Edge Cloud based multi-robot system to overcome the limitations of remote Cloud based system in exchanging delay sensitive data. The resource allocation for robotic workflow is modelled as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem and it is solved through a multi-objective evolutionary approach, namely, NSGA-II algorithm. We have redesigned the NSGA-II algorithm by defining a new chromosome structure, pre-sorted initial population and mutation operator. It is further augmented by selecting the minimum distant solution from the non-dominated front to the origin while crossing over the chromosomes. The experimental results based on synthetic workload demonstrate that our augmented NSGA-II algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art works by at least 18% in optimizing makespan, energy and cost attributes on various scenarios.}

On the one hand, considering the problem of safe driving of autonomous cars in intelligent transportation systems, it is essential to ensure the transmission safety of vehicle data and realize the load balancing scheduling of data transmission resources. On the other hand, convolution neural network (CNN) of the deep learning algorithm is adopted and improved, and then, the DTs technology is introduced. Finally, an autonomous cars DTs prediction model based on network load balancing and spatial-temporal graph convolution network is constructed. Moreover, through simulation, the performance of this model is analyzed from perspectives of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The experimental results demonstrate that in comparative analysis, the accuracy of road network prediction of the model reported here is 92.70%, which is at least 2.92% higher than that of the models proposed by other scholars. Through the analysis of the security performance of network data transmission, it is found that this model achieves a lower average delay time than other comparative models. Besides, the message delivery rate is basically stable at 80%, and the message leakage rate is basically stable at about 10%. Therefore, the prediction model for autonomous cars constructed here not only ensures low delay but also has excellent network security performance, so that information can interact more efficiently. The research outcome can provide an experimental basis for intelligent development and safety performance improvement in the transportation field of smart cities.}

However, the simple use of biometrics cannot be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are related to the data transmission method between the medias, where the users require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon registration, are stored. In this paper, we use smart cards as an effective yet efficient solution to this critical data storage problem. Furthermore, iris texture has been used as a human identifier for some time now. This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a person from another as its unique yet perfectly stable over time. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of iris texture verification on smart cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card. Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner’s card, guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. In a first approach, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are improved using circular translations of the matched iris codes. However, after a thorough analysis of the achieved results, we show that the proposed method introduces a significant increase in terms of execution time of the matching operation. In order to mitigate this impact, we augmented the proposed technique with acceptance threshold verification, thus decreasing drastically the execution time of the matching operation, and yet achieving considerably low FAR and FRR. It is noteworthy to point out that these characteristics are at the basis of any access control successful usage.}

The aim of this study is to compare smart training method and traditional training method in learning-retention processes of Mathematics. Among 9724 grade 3 students in Yazd, 60 students were selected from a traditional school by using cluster random sampling method. They randomized into two equal classes. After getting a pre-exam, the multiplying section of grade 3 Mathematics was presented in six sessions every week by using the researcher-made multimedia software in “smart class” and traditionally in other class. The “learning score” was assessed at the end of every session, while the “retention score” was assessed two weeks after each session. Independent-samples T test was used to compare learning and retention scores between two groups and paired-samples T test to compare retention and learning scores in each group. The mean learning score is significantly higher in the smart training group (19.33+0.9 vs. 17.66+0.68; P<0.001) than traditional group. Also, the mean retention score is significantly higher in the smart training group (18.57+1.91 vs. 16.65+1.95; P<0.001) than traditional group.

abstract = {The trends of electrification, decentralization, and digitalization underpin the transition of energy systems toward climate neutrality. These trends also create a new need for greater flexibility as situations of peak demand and excess production become acute and matching demand and supply becomes more challenging. The required flexibility can be addressed by means of backup and energy storage solutions, but a wider systemic perspective is also required to make the network function “more smartly.” Flexibility can be improved by means of several technological part-solutions commonly related to the concept of smart grids. This chapter first discusses the concepts of smart grids and flexibility with reference to their role in electric energy system transformation. These concepts are rendered concrete by means of case studies on large-scale industrial loads as flexible resources, smart metering, power-based grid tariffs, and energy communities and microgrids, which offer useful insights on the development of some aspects of smart grid measures.}

Given the growing volume of data, there is a need to identify challenges associated with the processing, visualization, and analysis of the generated data from an urban scale. This study proposes a framework to investigate the capabilities of dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, and UMAP) applied to city-scale data to identify key features of high consumption and generation areas based on building characteristics. The analysis is performed on measured data from 2735 postcodes consisting of 72000 households/buildings from a city in the Netherlands. The evaluation results showed that the UMAP's algorithm mean sigma quickly approaches a threshold of 0.6 at n_neighbor values of 50 and the low dimensional shape does not change with increasing values. Whereas the t-SNE's mean sigma value increases continuously with the increasing perplexity value, implying that t-SNE is significantly more sensitive to the perplexity parameter. The UMAP algorithm was used to extract information about the high photovoltaic generation and consumption regions. The proposed framework will assist grid operators and energy planners in extracting information from energy consumption data at the neighbourhood level by utilizing high dimensional reduction techniques.}

abstract = {Research on smart homes has significantly increased in recent years owing to their considerably improved affordability and simplicity. However, the challenge is that people have different needs (or attitudes toward smart homes), and provision should be tailored to individuals. A few studies have classified the functions of smart homes. Therefore, the Kano model is first adopted as a theoretical base to explore whether the functional classifications of smart homes are attractive or necessary, or both. Second, three models and test user attitudes toward three function types of smart homes are proposed. Based on the Kano model, the principal results, namely, two “Attractive Quality” and nine “Indifferent Quality” items, are found. Verification of the hypotheses also indicates that the entertainment, security, and automation functions are significantly correlated with the variables “perceive useful” and “attitude.” Cost consideration is negatively correlated with attitudes toward entertainment and automation. Results suggest that smart home providers should survey user needs for their product instead of merely producing smart homes based on the design of the builder or engineer.}

abstract = {The threat of fire is pervasive, poses significant risks to the environment, and may include potential fatalities, property devastation, and socioeconomic disruption. Successfully mitigating these risks relies on the prompt identification of fires, a process in which soft computing methodologies play a pivotal role. Although, these fire detection methodologies neglected to explore the relationships among fire-indicative features, which are important to enable a model to learn more representative and robust features in remote sensing scenarios. In the context of small fire detection from aerial view using satellite imagery or unmanned arial vehicle (UAVs) presents challenges to capture rich spatial detail, hinder the model ability for accurate fire scene classification. Furthermore, it is significant to manage model complexity effectively to facilitate deployment on UAVs for fast and accurate responses in an emergency situation. To cope with these challenges, we propose an advanced model integrated a modified soft attention mechanism (MSAM) and a 3D convolution operation with a MobileNet architecture to overcome obstacles related to optimising features and controlling model complexity. The MSAM enabling the model to selectively emphasise essential features during the training process which acts as a selective filter. This adaptive attention mechanism enhances sensitivity and allowing the model to prioritise relevant patterns for accurate fire detection. Concurrently, the integration of a 3D convolutional operation extends the model spatial awareness, to capture intricate details across multiple scales, and particularly in small regions observed from aerial viewpoints. Benchmark evaluations of the proposed model over the FD, DFAN, and ADSF datasets reveal superior performance with enhanced accuracy (ACR) compared to existing methods. Our model surpassed the state-of-the-art models with an average ACR improvement of 0.54%, 2.64%, and 1.20% on the FD, ADSF, and DFAN datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the use of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique enhances the validation of the model visual emphasis on critical regions of the image, providing valuable insights into its decision-making process.}

The dataset comprises information on ten water quality variables collected by AAQ-RINKO device for 20 field sampling stations, encompassing different depths within the water columns. First, an in-depth data analysis was conducted to process and characterize variations in key parameters. Then, four deep learning models were developed and evaluated, including the Gated Residual Variable Selection (GRVS), Deep and Cross (DC), Deep and Wide (DW), and Base models for estimating two important water quality parameters, namely dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). To justify the performance of deep learning methods, they were compared to four traditional machine learning techniques: MLP, SVR, AdaBoost, and LR-Lasso models. The GRVS model emerged as the most effective method, achieving high accuracy with R2 and RMSE values of 0.98 and 0.38 for the DO parameter and 0.84, and 0.45 for the Chl-a parameter, respectively. Finally, two SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Softmax layer model interpretation approaches were employed to highlight the influential factors affecting the predictions in the best model. Results from the SHAP analysis identified pH, depth, and temperature as the most significant variables, with mean SHAP values of 1.8, 0.75, and 0.36 for DO and 0.74, 0.37, and 0.3 for Chl-a, respectively. The data-driven framework implemented in this study holds promise for efficiently approximating hard-to-measure water quality indicators in monitoring projects using cost-effective inputs, which is particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings.}

Further, connected “things” can be used as physical interfaces to enable users to cooperate, leveraging multiple devices via parallel and distributed actions. Yet creating prototypes of IoT systems is a complex task for developers non-expert in IoT, as it requires dealing with multi-layered hardware and software infrastructures. We introduce RapIoT, a software toolkit that facilitates the prototyping of IoT systems by providing an integrated set of technologies. Our solution abstracts low-level details and communication protocols, allowing developers non-expert in IoT to focus on application logic, facilitating rapid prototyping. RapIoT supports the development of collaborative applications by enabling the definition of high-level data type primitives and allowing interactions spread among multiple smart objects. RapIoT primitives act as a loosely coupled interface between generic IoT devices and applications, simplifying the development of systems that make use of an ecology of devices distributed to multiple users and environments. We illustrate the potential of our toolkit by presenting the development process of an IoT application ideated during a workshop with non-expert developers and addressing real-world challenges affecting smart cities. We conclude by discussing the strength and limitations of our platform, highlighting further possible uses for collaborative applications.}

An evaluation of current research on access control for smart spaces highlights that personalized context-based access control can provide better control over shared content.

As a first step, understanding the similarity among subway stations is imperative. In this paper, we proposed a semantic framework inspired from natural language processing (NLP) to interpret subway stations as compound words. Specifically, we transplanted context and literal meaning of compound words into mobility and location attributes of stations. Using smart card data, we trained stacked autoencoders (SAE) with designed flow matrices as an embedding method to learn the mobility attributes. Subsequently, to discover the location attributes, we have applied affinity propagation clustering to classify 9 point of interest (POI) categories. Combined with urban planning knowledge, we manage to comprehend the land use meanings of 9 POI clusters. The location semantics is chosen from those categories reflecting its urban land use pattern. By choose meaningful combination of mobility and location semantics for stations’ similarity case studies, we summarized potential applications of this semantic framework.}

With the widespread integration of smart meters, consumers can leverage the high temporal resolution of energy consumption data to optimize a PV system based on their individual circumstances. In this article, such an optimization strategy is developed to enable the optimal selection of size, tilt, azimuth and retail electricity plan for a residential PV system based on hourly consumption data. Hourly solar insolation and PV array generation models are presented as the principal components of the underlying objective function. A net present value analysis of the potential monetary savings is considered and set as the optimization objective. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized, modified to include a penalty function in order to handle associated constraints. The optimization problem is applied to real-world Australian consumption data to establish the economic performance and characteristics of the optimized systems. For all customers assessed, an optimized PV system producing a positive economic benefit could be found. However not all investment options were found to be desirable with at most 77.5% of customers yielding an acceptable rate of return. For the customers assessed, the mean PV system size was found to be 2kW less than the mean size of actual systems installed in the assessed locations during 2015 and 2016. Over-sizing of systems was found to significantly reduce the potential net benefit of residential PV from an investor’s perspective. The results presented in this article highlight the necessity for economic performance optimization to be routinely implemented for small-scale residential PV under current regulatory and future smart grid operating environments.}

abstract = {Smart grid is one of the most important topics to be covered with the increasing penetration of renewable energy in the power system grid to improve grid energy efficiency by managing the relationship between the demand and the generation. Load forecasting is playing a crucial role in this process as well as the output power generation from different renewable energy resources. The accuracy of the forecasting models is very important to deal with the new energy generation and consumption. Conventional approaches used in the literature work done for load forecasting can not handle the requirements of new generation of renewable energy and their uncertainties. This paper is proposing a novel technique for short-term load forecasting based on hybrid of different models and using clustering techniques to improve the overall system performance and quality. These models involve different combinations of Kalman filtering (KF), Wavelet and Artificial Neural Network (WNN and ANN) schemes. Six different models are proposed based on the clustering techniques. Simulations proved higher performance of the proposed models. The data used is commercial data, so it is scaled in this paper. The proposed work is validated by using different dataset for two different locations in Egypt and Canada.}

At an immediate level, this approach holds the potential for enabling increased public awareness of what is at stake in urban planning - both on the part of citizens and on the part of public officials, policy-makers, and decision-makers – and consequently enhancing understanding and improving participation in public life and citizenship. It may also open up a new field of research and development in human-computer interaction, to leverage the richness of meaning and modes of expression which exist in various cultures and societies, rather than ignoring them and imposing dumbed-down or prescribed command methods. Thus, it aims to facilitate new levels of empowerment of users in the use of digital systems and data. The active utilization of cultural meaning in gestures, rituals, and social practices may also support and promote better inclusion and participation of minority groups and migrant communities in contemporary, technology-rich life.}

abstract = {This study proposes a probabilistic framework to infer passengers’ responses to unplanned urban rail service disruptions using smart card data in tap-in-only public transit systems. We first identify 19 possible response behaviors that passengers may have based on their decision-making times and locations (i.e, the stage of their trips when an incident happened), including transferring to a bus line, canceling trips, waiting, delaying departure time, etc. A probabilistic model is proposed to estimate the mean and variance of the number of passengers in each of the 19 behavior groups using passengers’ smart card transactions. The 19 behavioral responses can be categorized from two aspects. From the behavioral aspect, they can be grouped into 5 aggregated response behaviors including using bus, using rail (changing or not changing route), not using public transit, and not being affected. The inference of the 19 behaviors can be classified into four cases based on the information used (historical trips vs. subsequent trips) and the context of the observed transactions (direct incident-related vs. indirect incident-related). The public transit system (bus and urban rail) of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is used as a case study based on a real-world rail disruption incident. The model is applied with both synthetic data and real-world data. Results with synthetic data show that the proposed approach can estimate passengers’ behavior well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the estimated expected number of passengers in each behavior group is 20.5%, which outperforms the rule-based benchmark method (60.3%). The estimation results with real-world data are consistent with the incident’s context. An indirect model validation method using demand change information and incident log data demonstrates the reasonableness of the results.}

Next, we implement the frequent pattern mining method on the data to identify the city's popular locations by their sequenced co-occurrences among the usual tourism activities, which can be visualized into a word network. Finally, we develop a max-confidence based method to detect travel routes from the network. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to the data from a blog web-site run by a Chinese online tourism service company.

In this context, it is very difficult to assess the potential of smart grids, given the high uncertainty associated with the many challenges that this technology is supposed to face. We apply the analytical tools of complexity theory to (1) identify the different definition of smart grid that are associated with different future visions about their performance; and (2) provide a critical appraisal of these future visions in relation to the stated goals and social contexts in which they are generated.

We aimed to explore the potential benefits of using smart glasses – wearable computer optical devices with touch-less command features – in the surgery room and in outpatient care settings in urology.
Materials and methods
Between April and November 2015, 80 urologists were invited to use Google Glass in their daily surgical and clinical practice, and to share them with other urologists. Participants rated the usefulness of smart glasses on a 10-point scale, and provided insights on their potential benefits in a telephone interview.
Results
During the testing period, 240 urologists used smart glasses, and the 80 initially invited rated their usefulness. Mean scores for usefulness in the surgery room and in outpatient clinics were 7.4 and 5.4, respectively. The interview revealed that the applications of smart glasses considered most promising in surgery were live video streaming and static image playback, augmented reality, laparoscopic navigation, and digital checklist for safety verification. In outpatient settings, participants considered the glasses useful as a viewing platform for sharing test results, for browsing digital vademecum, and for checking medical records in emergency situations.
Conclusions
Urologists engaged in our experience identified various uses of smart glasses with potential benefits for physician's daily practice, particularly in the urological surgery setting. Further quantitative studies are needed to exploit the actual possibilities of smart glasses and address the technical limitations for their safe use in clinical and surgical practice.

In regard to energy portfolio, we need to make it in line with these under smart energy solutions. With the developed cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence applications, we need to change the course of action in dealing with energy matters by covering the entire energy spectrum under five categories, namely, energy fundamentals and concepts, energy materials, energy production, energy conversion, and energy management. It is important to highlight the importance of a recent event. On 17 January 2017 a total of thirteen leading energy, transport and industry companies in the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) have launched a global initiative, so-called: Hydrogen Council, to voice a united vision and long-term ambition for hydrogen to foster the energy transition. It has aimed to join the global efforts in promoting hydrogen to help meet climate goals. This is a clear indication that smart solutions are not possible without hydrogen options. This study focuses on introducing and highlighting smart energy solutions under the portfolio pertaining to exergization, greenization, renewabilization, hydrogenization, integration, multigeneration, storagization, and intelligization. Each one of these plays a critical role within the smart energy portfolio and becomes key for a more sustainable future. This study also focuses on the newly developed smart energy systems by combining both renewable energy sources and hydrogen energy systems to provide more efficient, more cost-effective, more environmentally benign and more sustainable solutions for implementation. Furthermore, a wide range of integrated systems is presented to illustrate the feasibility and importance such a coupling to overcome several technical issues. Moreover, numerous studies from the recent literature are presented to highlight the importance of sustainable hydrogen production methods for a carbon-free economy.}

A 3D steady-state RANS CFD simulation with a SST k-ω turbulence model was used to evaluate the temperature distribution and age of air for two cases of heat source and smart windows and two ventilation openings. The model was first validated for the first case with full-scale experimental data. For window-to-wall-ratio (WWR) ranges of 20–40% and four different room outlet opening locations, the validated model was used to determine the thermal comfort metrics of the studied building with smart windows cases. The mixed-climate environmental conditions of Atlanta-GA was used for setting up the boundary conditions. The results of thermal comfort analysis showed WWR = 30% and 40% are preferred for all studied windows and smart windows with electrochromic glazing, respectively. It also showed that up to 50% temperature difference reduction between the floor and ceiling is achievable with electrochromic windows. Smart windows with/without electrochromic glazing reduced the maximum relative air temperature between the floor and ceiling by 87%/30% compared to regular windows. This paper provides a resource for designing climate-adaptive buildings, improving occupant thermal comfort in existing buildings, and enhancing building aesthetic view characteristics.}

Many other cities in the world have experienced the same, and sooner or later, this is likely to happen everywhere. Seeing this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain valuable information from the available data. However, the case of Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS devices and the smart card presents an overall 97% penetration rate. We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of buses and service quality indicators, among others. Several examples of specific uses of the information for public transport policy and planning in Santiago are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of what else can be obtained from this data and why we believe that this can change the way we do transport planning.}

This study investigates potentials of a smart site concept based on domestic renewable energy generation. The study addresses site scale integration of hybrid renewable sources and grid energies as well as investigates possible advantages of the use of hybrid renewable energy systems based on solar and wind power. A continuous energy mixing strategy is used for DC integration of hybrid renewable energy (wind+solar) and the grid energy to meet site power demand. The proposed case study demonstrates that the smart site with hybrid renewable sources considerably reduces energy dependence of the house appliances to the grid which in turn presents a feasible solution for implementation of distributed generation provision for future smart grids.}

MR foam can be identified as one of the MR materials, consisting of magnetic particles and porous absorbent matrix with the rheological properties that can be regulated continuously, rapidly, and reversibly using an external magnetic field. In particular, it is crucial to highlight the types of MR foam fabrication methods as it will be a significant parameter that would affect the designed and the final properties of MR foams. In other words, the main classifications and properties of MR foam are strongly dependent on the types of the fabrication method that were used such as ex situ and in situ. MR fluid foam, MR elastomer foam, MR plastomer foam, and in situ MR foam are the varieties of MR foam, which can be categorized accordingly based on the different types of the fabrication methods. Besides, the components of MR foam, such as the magnetic particles and absorbent foam matrix, are entirely evaluated to provide the researchers with a clear guidance on the selection and the use of suitable main components for the developments of MR foam. In this overview, the main intensive focuses on the fabrications of MR foam, classifications and potential applications have also been revised to enhance the real-world practicality of this material.}

The formed Fe3O4 could be developed inside the hydrogels by increasing the concentrations of precursor Fe2+/Fe3+ ions, and the magnetic sensitivity of hydrogels was enhanced, while the pH sensitivity and swelling degree were weakened.

Per neighborhood and per waste type, three models are developed: a Seasonal Näıve Benchmark model, ensemble models of Error, trend, seasonality models with external variables (ETSX), and Quantile Regression models with external variables. According to the RMSE, the ETSX model is the outperforming model for 74% of the time. It is also found that poor weather conditions such as precipitation, wind gusts and thunderstorms result in less waste disposal. The proposed prediction models can be used for more efficient waste collection, in order to collect waste before the fll rate percentage exceeds 100%. In future studies the inclusion of spatial variables and clustering of the containers can be considered.}

abstract = {Although the growth of urbanization based on economic construction has produced an economic miracle, it has also brought up significant obstacles to the sustainable growth of the economy and society. China has established a new-type urbanization policy (NTUP) since 2014 to address the carbon emission issues brought on by traditional development. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of the impact and mechanisms of the NTUP on carbon emission performance (CEP). This study employs the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to investigate the impact, spatial spillover effects, and mechanisms of the NTUP on CEP by adopting a panel dataset from 2003 to 2020 for China's 283 cities. The empirical findings indicate that (1) new-type urbanized cities' carbon emissions are lowered by 1.37 % compared with nonpilot cities, and their carbon emission efficiency is raised by 31.56 %. After several robustness and hypothesis tests, this finding is still true. (2) The NTUP has a spatial spillover effect on CEP, significantly improving CEP for cities in the [0,1000] km range. (3) The key mechanisms by which the NTUP influences CEP are green technology innovation, energy structure, industrial structure, and resource allocation. (4) The NTUP has a stronger effect on CEP in medium-sized cities, cities with medium economic development, and resource-based cities. Finally, a response is briefly proposed.}

However, our existing knowledge on the patterns of built environment stocks across and particularly within cities is limited, largely owing to the lack of sufficient high spatial resolution data. This study leveraged multi-source big geodata, machine learning, and bottom-up stock accounting to characterize the built environment stocks of 50 cities in China at 500 m fine-grained levels. The per capita built environment stock of many cities (240 tonnes per capita on average) is close to that in western cities, despite considerable disparities across cities owing to their varying socioeconomic, geomorphology, and urban form characteristics. This is mainly owing to the construction boom and the building and infrastructure-driven economy of China in the past decades. China’s urban expansion tends to be more “vertical” (with high-rise buildings) than “horizontal” (with expanded road networks). It trades skylines for space, and reflects a concentration–dispersion–concentration pathway for spatialized built environment stocks development within cities in China. These results shed light on future urbanization in developing cities, inform spatial planning, and support circular and low-carbon transitions in cities.}

Milk consumption in China has experienced a rapid growth over the past few decades. This study explored milk consumption habits of Chinese older adult regular milk consumers, by investigating what, where, when, with whom, why and how milk was consumed. This study (n = 1000) was conducted in 5 cities in China (first-tier: Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou; second-tier: Chengdu and Shenyang) with participants balanced by gender and age groups (45–55 and 65–75 years old). Given different economies, general dietary habits, and lifestyles, differences in milk consumption habits between cities were hypothesized. The results showed that almost all participants consumed cow milk, at home and by direct drinking. Most participants consumed milk during breakfast, with their family and for nutrition and health purposes. However, variations by city were found in what type of, what fat level of, what brand of, when and how milk was consumed. Multiple factor analysis showed that ‘what' variable differentiated cities between tiers and among the first-tier cities, and that ‘when' and how' variables also separated the 2 s-tier cities and from the first-tier cities. Although variation in how milk was consumed was also observed between genders and age groups, hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the 4 clusters of milk consumption habits derived were mainly differentiated by city: Beijing & Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenyang. This study provides comprehensive insights into the milk consumption habits of Chinese older adults and highlights the significant heterogeneity in milk consumption habits in China by city.}

abstract = {Purpose
To measure how an integrated smartlist developed for critically ill patients would change intensive care units (ICUs) length of stay (LOS), mortality, and charges.
Materials and methods
Propensity-score analysis of adult patients admitted to one of 14 surgical and medical ICUs between June 2017 and May 2018. The smart list aimed to certain preventative measures for all critical patients (e.g., removing unneeded catheters, starting thromboembolic prophylaxis, etc.) and was integrated into the electronic health record workflows at the hospitals under study.
Results
During the study period, 11,979 patients were treated in the 14 participating ICUs by 518 unique providers. Patients who had the smart list used during ≥60% of their ICU stay (N = 432 patients, 3.6%) were significantly more likely to have a shorter ICU LOS (HR = 1.20, 95% CI:1.0 to 1.4, p = 0.015) with an average decrease of -$1218 (95% CI: -$1830 to -$607, P < 0.001) in the amount charged per day. The intervention cohort had fewer average ventilator days (3.05 vent days, SD = 2.55) compared to propensity score matched controls (3.99, SD = 4.68, p = 0.015), but no changes in mortality (16.7% vs 16.0%, p = 0.78).
Conclusions
An integrated smart list shortened LOS and lowered charges in a diverse cohort of critically ill patients.}

This study is the first attempt to apply fuzzy logic theory to smart reinforced concrete structures equipped with MR dampers under collision forces for structural impact hazard mitigation. The parameters of the fuzzy controller are optimized using a backpropagation neural network. To train the fuzzy controller, a number of experiments were conducted using a smart reinforced concrete beam under a variety of impact loads. The smart reinforced concrete beam is equipped with a magnetorheological (MR) damper, accelerometers, linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), strain gages, and a voltage–current converter. It is implemented using National Instruments hardware with the LabView software. A proportional integral derivative controller (PID) is used as a baseline. It was shown from the comparisons of the fuzzy with the PID controllers that the smart fuzzy controller is an effective way to mitigate the complex impact response of reinforced concrete structures employing an MR damper.}

The term Smart Mobility has come to signify the use of ICT for organizing shared personal transportation tailored to individual needs. Smart Mobility has so far mostly been adopted in urban areas. However, rural areas can also potentially reap benefits from adopting Smart Mobility. When applied in, and adapted to rural regions, Smart Mobility elements offer to reduce several typical disadvantages of rural living and working conditions, such as deficient public transport supplies and older people's restricted access to various amenities. This chapter explores how Smart Mobility can help to align improved job and service accessibility conditions, as well as entrepreneurial initiatives, with environmental, economic, and societal sustainability goals. The chapter first outlines some conceptual considerations that highlight (1) typical rural transport demands, (2) rural context conditions that shape the implementation of digitally enhanced sustainability innovations, and (3) conceptual elements required to study the rural adoption of Smart Mobility solutions. The innovation-decision-model of Rogers (2003) and the macro-, meso-, micro-level approach of Esser (1999) serve as cornerstones for conceptualization and research methodology. Then empirical results of an ongoing case study are presented. The case study consists of Smart Mobility-related developments in Heinsberg County, Germany, a rural region in the west of the country. A mixed methods approach combines qualitative and quantitative means of data acquisition and analysis. The findings reveal some interesting clues toward the adaptation and adoption of Smart Mobility in rural areas. Major promoting factors, but also impediments are identified, relating to interdependent macro-, meso- and micro-level characteristics. Finally, some policy conclusions are drawn.}

This study thus proposes a framework integrating IVHF-DEMATEL method enhanced by an operator of AVL (average vector-length) on CVPs. Given that smart PSS involves multi-stakeholders and its value is co-created, stakeholder types are proposed to define stakeholder value flow network (SVFN). Based on quality characteristics of smart PSS's core elements, dimensions and criterions of CVPs are courageously proposed to align specific CVPs captured from a SVFN. Since different knowledges and skills of experts, their weights are assigned by the operator of intuitionistic fuzzy number. Compared to other techniques handling uncertainty of expert judgement, IVHF element is more powerful in term of hesitancy. To evaluate the interdependent CVPs, IVHF-DEMATEL method is employed to derive the total-relation of CVPs. Moreover, an operator of AVL is firstly proposed to prioritize the CVPs, also is feasible and simpler than multiple operators of modified-CFCS. Furthermore, influence-dependence (I-D) map with cut-offs of hesitant interval and interval value is utilized to give much richer interpretations on evaluation results. Finally, an illustrative case of smart fridge-service system is demonstrated to justify this proposal methodological framework.}

abstract = {Over the past few decades, increased attention has been paid to domestic waste (DW) generation. DW comprises a large percentage of municipal solid waste (MSW), and its handling and processing involves serious technical issues while also consuming a major portion of municipal budgets. The accurate estimation, prediction, and characterization of DW is an ongoing challenge for many cities, municipalities, and local governments as they strive to implement sustainable strategies for MSW. The main objective of the present study is to estimate and correctly predict DW quantities using machine-learning (ML) algorithms. Several different ML algorithms are used in the research, including linear regression, regression trees, Gaussian process regression, support vector machine, and autoregressive integrated moving average methods for time series analysis. Two case studies are presented in this paper. In the first, domestic waste data covering the period from 2010 to 2021 were collected from the Saudi and Bahrain authorities, and in the second, the domestic waste-generating behavior of a family of eleven members was followed for one month. The results show that the biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes generated by the family were in the range of 1.7–7.9 kg and 0.0–2.0 kg, respectively, and promising outcomes were obtained using an appropriate selection of input predictors in conjunction with time series analysis. The trained models are validated and tested using several types of evaluation metrics, including calculated residuals, mean square error, root mean square error, and coefficient determination (R2-Score). The latter values are in the range of 0.67–0.85 for the training and testing datasets for many of the predicted waste quantities. The results obtained from the study show that these algorithms can be used to reduce the environmental, economic, and societal impacts of waste by designing a smart waste management engineering system.}
