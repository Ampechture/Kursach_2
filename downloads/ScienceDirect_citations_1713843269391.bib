abstract = {Nowadays, energy crisis is considered an essential active issue for future urbanization in megacities. While the rate of population growth increases, the volume of municipal solid waste production increases significantly. This highlights the need of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for both developed and developing countries. This paper constructs a novel smart framework for supplying biogas energy. Our study is applicable for fields of waste management and energy supply in green buildings. The proposed framework integrates the Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Petri net modeling. In this regard, the AI techniques including the Random Tree (RT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and, Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are employed. In addition, for creating the optimum condition, a dynamic control system using the Petri Net modeling is applied. Among all machine learning methods, ANFIS with 0.99 correlation coefficient had the best accuracy for Accumulated Biogas Production (ABP) based on effective factors. Finally, the main findings of this paper are to introduce a novel framework for addressing different scientific issues such as supplying the clean energy in green buildings, the development of a smart and sustainable biogas production control system, integration of solid waste management with the SDGs in green buildings.}

abstract = {The arising awareness of drug safety has brought tremendous demands on improving traceability and transparency in the supply chain. Conventionally, centralized/distributed database-based traceability platforms are adopted by many drug companies to control drug quality and improve transparency levels. However, it is still challenging to link drug stakeholders into an information-sharing chain due to the potential data manipulations and interest conflicts. In this context, this paper proposes a unified five-layer Blockchain and Internet of Things-based smart tracking and tracing (BIoT3, in short) platform to provide a decentralized traceability solution in the drug supply chain. Following the five-layer blockchain platform architecture, a practical roadmap is provided for the drug industry to achieve blockchain design, development, application, and evaluation. Moreover, three core enabling components are presented: IoT-based drug identity management, on-chain & off-chain mechanism, smart contract-enabled drug services. According to the real data from collaborating companies, the feasibility and efficiency of the BIoT3 platform have been verified using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The case study demonstrates that it not only gains useful insights into transaction sizes configuration for optimal blockchain performance, but also provides a feasible blockchain-based solution for drug traceability and visibility.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Excessive use of digital smart devices, including smartphones and tablet computers, could be a risk factor for myopia. We aimed to review the literature on the association between digital smart device use and myopia.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE and Embase, and manually searched reference lists for primary research articles investigating smart device (ie, smartphones and tablets) exposure and myopia in children and young adults (aged 3 months to 33 years) from database inception to June 2 (MEDLINE) and June 3 (Embase), 2020. We included studies that investigated myopia-related outcomes of prevalent or incident myopia, myopia progression rate, axial length, or spherical equivalent. Studies were excluded if they were reviews or case reports, did not investigate myopia-related outcomes, or did not investigate risk factors for myopia. Bias was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists for analytical cross-sectional and cohort studies. We categorised studies as follows: category one studies investigated smart device use independently; category two studies investigated smart device use in combination with computer use; and category three studies investigated smart device use with other near-vision tasks that were not screen-based. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs), β coefficients, prevalence ratios, Spearman's correlation coefficients, and p values for associations between screen time and incident or prevalent myopia. We did a meta-analysis of the association between screen time and prevalent or incident myopia for category one articles alone and for category one and two articles combined. Random-effects models were used when study heterogeneity was high (I2>50%) and fixed-effects models were used when heterogeneity was low (I2≤50%).
Findings
3325 articles were identified, of which 33 were included in the systematic review and 11 were included in the meta-analysis. Four (40%) of ten category one articles, eight (80%) of ten category two articles, and all 13 category three articles used objective measures to identify myopia (refraction), whereas the remaining studies used questionnaires to identify myopia. Screen exposure was measured by use of questionnaires in all studies, with one also measuring device-recorded network data consumption. Associations between screen exposure and prevalent or incident myopia, an increased myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were reported in five (50%) category one and six (60%) category two articles. Smart device screen time alone (OR 1·26 [95% CI 1·00–1·60]; I2=77%) or in combination with computer use (1·77 [1·28–2·45]; I2=87%) was significantly associated with myopia. The most common sources of risk of bias were that all 33 studies did not include reliable measures of screen time, seven (21%) did not objectively measure myopia, and nine (27%) did not identify or adjust for confounders in the analysis. The high heterogeneity between studies included in the meta-analysis resulted from variability in sample size (range 155–19 934 participants), the mean age of participants (3–16 years), the standard error of the estimated odds of prevalent or incident myopia (0·02–2·21), and the use of continuous (six [55%] of 11) versus categorical (five [46%]) screen time variables
Interpretation
Smart device exposure might be associated with an increased risk of myopia. Research with objective measures of screen time and myopia-related outcomes that investigates smart device exposure as an independent risk factor is required.
Funding
None.}

abstract = {All people in the world are entitled to enjoy a clean environment and a good quality of life. With big data and artificial intelligence technologies, it is possible to estimate personalized air pollution exposure and synchronize it with activity, health, quality of life and behavioural data, and provide real-time, personalized and interactive alert and advice to improve the health and well-being of individual citizens. In this paper, we propose an overarching framework outlining five major challenges to personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, and respective methodologies in an integrated interdisciplinary manner. First, urban air quality data is sparse, rendering it difficult to provide timely personalized alert and advice. Second, collected data, especially those involving human inputs such as health perception, are often missing and erroneous. Third, the data collected are heterogeneous, and highly complex, not easily comprehensible to facilitate individual and collective decision-making. Fourth, the causal relationships between personal air pollutants exposure (specifically, PM2.5 and PM1.0 and NO2) and personal health conditions, and health-related quality of life perception, of young asthmatics and young healthy citizens in Hong Kong (HK), are yet to be established. Fifth, whether personalized and smart information and advice provided can induce behavioural change and improve health and quality of life are yet to be determined. To overcome these challenges, our first novelty is to develop an AI and big data framework to estimate and forecast air quality in high temporal-spatial resolution and real-time. Our second novelty includes the deployment of mobile pollution sensor platforms to substantially improve the accuracy of estimated and forecasted air quality data, and the collection of activity, health condition and perception data. Our third novelty is the development of visualization tools and comprehensible indexes, by correlating personal exposure with four types of personal data, to provide timely, personalized pollution, health and travel alerts and advice. Our fourth novelty is determining causal relationship, if any, between personal pollutants, PM1.0 and PM2.5, NO2 exposure and personal health condition, and personal health perception, based on a clinical experiment of 150 young asthmatics and 150 young healthy citizens in HK. Our fifth novelty is an intervention study to determine if smart information, presented via our proposed visualized platform, will induce personal behavioural change. Our novel big data AI-driven approach, when integrated with other analytical approaches, provides an integrated interdisciplinary framework for personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, easily transferrable to and applicable in other domains and countries.}

With the advancement of the digital age and smart cities, the use of mobile phone data and the location of users is considered an important tool for collecting urban data, which, due to its purity, can form the basis for studies on human mobility. The existing problem, the lack of proper identification and understanding of human mobility, is the most important factor in the design of the city. This problem is introduced as the starting point of the problems in the city because the beginning of the problems of urban life is related to the beginning of human mobility, and this is necessary for urban life. Therefore, the identification of the pattern of human mobility as urban exploration and the discovery of intra-urban relations play an important role. This study focuses on how traffic indicators and daily trips based on mobile phone data influence the formation of congested places based on human mobility. This mobility is determined based on the generated and recorded trips. The proposed pattern is based on real-time data.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence-enabled applications on edge devices have the potential to revolutionize disease detection and monitoring with smart health (sHealth) applications. The major challenges are user-friendly and flexible sensors for seamless collection of physiological data for long hours, online and on-device processing of sensitive medical data to facilitate privacy protection, reliable extraction of disease-related biomarkers, and implementation of lightweight artificially intelligent algorithms for inference at the edge without degrading the system performance. In this pilot project, we conducted a yearlong field study with 9 participants conducting 480 data collection sessions in the “living lab” environment. We used smartphones as the edge computing device and implemented pre-trained machine learning algorithms in the smartphone app for computing disease-related Events-of-Interest (EoI). We considered real-time data processing on the smartphone itself without sharing raw data with the cloud or any other computing facility to minimize privacy concerns, and network bandwidth requirements. We used a commercial smart band and a custom-designed zero-power inkjet-printed sensor for physiological sensing and capturing health biomarkers such as heart rate variability (HRV) and core body temperature. The extracted HRV feature values are within the 95% confidence interval of normative values. On top of that, the extracted HRV shows some informative trends i.e. hammock pattern for healthy subjects which may be helpful in subsequent research studies. Moreover, we used core body temperature with user-reported outcomes for estimating flu-related symptoms severity and visualizing the spatiotemporal trend in a cloud-server to facilitate personalized as well as community-wide health monitoring. Inference at the edge provided a data reduction of 3 order while the runtime latency, power consumption, memory requirement, and storage size of the smartphone app were 500 ms, 51.90 mAH, 9.4 MB, and 2.4 MB, respectively. Our developed framework of sHealth enables automated community-wide monitoring of symptoms severity in addition to personalized monitoring which paves the way for early monitoring of a disease outbreak for a smart and connected community.}

Based on this introduction, the author of this book proposed the development of a layered-rule model of project management in Smart Cities—Layers and Rules Model for Smart Cities (LaRSC). This model is a combination of a layered reference model with a set of rules for the selection of tasks for the product backlog in Smart Cities projects. Two sets of principles and principles proposed by the author and recommendations for process support project management for Smart Cities on two levels: High-level architecture providing rule-based project principles (defining task priorities) and providing recommendations for determining task complexity. The layered-rule project management model in Smart Cities also integrates project teams producing Smart Units and those responsible for designing the Smart Bus by the city hall. Then, both silo and interdisciplinary projects will be implemented in project management processes, but only if they can be integrated with the Smart Integration Bus. The starting point is also the analysis of the first chapter. This chapter discusses the open data in Smart Cities. The importance of these data for urban development was pointed out as well as the cases of providing these data. This chapter also points to business models using open data by creating an introduction to defining assumptions for the management framework. Therefore it was assumed that this chapter will be built according to the following idea. First, experience will be collected and an analysis of the first chapter will be carried out, which will allow us to isolate components relevant from the point of view of designing Smart Cities systems. Next, examples (based on the author’ knowledge) of projects will be selected, which will be related to the components analyzed in this chapter. This design is aimed at selecting potential components that will be relevant from the point of view of open data design. It can be assumed that they will be technologies. It will be necessary to take into account the structure and tasks of the project team. It should also indicate the conditions for the functioning of the teams and the technologies they use. Therefore this distribution will present the construction of a layered-rule model for managing open data projects from IoT in Smart Cities. At the beginning the assumptions for the model are based on own experience and a compendium of knowledge presented in previous parts of this book. Then, based on actual open data acquisition projects, open data acquisition processes are presented. The processes of building business models for open data were also discussed in order to justify the desirability of implementing previously presented projects. The next part of the chapter is a discussion of the process of creating two new entities: the Smart Cities Trio and the Smart Unit and the processes of designing the Smart Bus for the integration of these entities. These are two key developing processes necessary for the implementation of Smart Cities projects. Based on the processes described and own experience, project management models are presented that can be used in the model (LaRSC) for the design of Smart Cities systems.}

Currently, there is a rapid growth of industrial, commercial, residential and other service supplying institutions. All of these institutions need reliable power supply. Due to this, utilities must work hard and ensure that the customers are getting a reliable power supply. However, higher power interruption frequency and longer interruption duration are the most serious problem facing Ethiopian power distribution systems and this problem affects the daily activity of customers. In this paper, smart grid technology applications using optimal placement of switching/automating devices, network reconfiguration and rapid power restoration is performed to improve the reliability problem of Bahir Dar power distribution system. Optimal placement of switching/automating devices and network reconfiguration is determined by the Genetic Algorithm optimization technique using mat lab software. The rapid power restoration is carried out by Prim‘s Algorithm used for constructing the Minimum Spanning Tree in mat lab software. The study is tested at Bata the 34 bus feeder of Bahir Dar distribution system. The existing network is assessed and the reliability indices such as SAIFI, SAIDI, ASAI, CAIDI and EENS are evaluated using ETAP 12.6.0 software.}

Healthcare services are recent and challenging aspects in analytics and sensor technology. People migrating from rural areas to urban areas affect healthcare services to a large extent. Due to migration and developing technology, cities around the world are investing in digital transformation, which aims to provide people with a healthier environment. New healthcare applications are based on activity recognition of people and can include wearable or ambient sensors to gather information related to health and human activity. Consumption of energy is analyzed along with the activity pattern of humans by determining the level of appliance usage that relates to human activity. The pattern determined is used to monitor elderly people living alone. The activity monitored can be learned just from appliances and their time usage. The proposed model detects appliance usage in particular with reliable accuracy. Mining is done purely based on absolute prediction along with clustering models.}

abstract = {In the present era of rapid economic development, successive governments in India have placed priority on ‘inclusive economic growth and social justice’. After independence, India chose to adopt mixed economy model and central role for development planning and resource allocation across sectors have been done by the State's planning machinery. It has been the resolve of the Government of India to achieve development and welfare of all social groups including scheduled tribes in the country. In this pursuit, several tribal development programmes have been undertaken from time to time entailing enormous human, financial and material resources. However, data driven planning involving data analytics has not been in use for overall planning process for tribal development instead traditional statistical approach has been mostly in practice. The aim of this paper is to bring to the fore the usefulness of data driven gap based planning using data analytics tools. The endeavour is to put in place a scientific mechanism to identify and prioritize the infrastructural gaps in tribal dominated areas for the State of Telangana using twenty-two different parameters. Expert workshop conducted to cluster twenty-two parameters into seven broad clusters viz Finance Infrastructure, Village Material Infrastructure, Household Material Infrastructure, Information Infrastructure, Social Infrastructure, Education Infrastructure, Health Infrastructure. Moreover, the paper aims to connect the smart and sustainable village development considering various parameters such Information and Social Infrastructure. AHP and TOPSIS multi-criteria approaches have been applied to identify and prioritize the infrastructural gap areas for all nine districts and 1663 tribal dominated villages of Telangana. Analysis reveals that Mahbubnagar being the top ranked district while Adilabad being lowest ranked district in the Telangana in terms of gaps in infrastructure facilities. Villages in all nine districts have been clustered into three categories viz. Good, Fair and Poor. Findings and recommendations have been provided in the paper.}

The researcher gathered information on the various public transportation bodies’ functions. There were data gathering trips to several European transport authorities. Data was gathered throughout analyzing different case studies to study the impact of internet of things on the global transport system. In order to find examples of IoT technologies that may be used internationally, a literature review had been constructed based on the activities and goals of these public bodies. These included long-term parking calculation, weather monitoring, scheduling and simulation. Aviation companies tend to use Internet of Things in its aviation operations to monitor weather, schedule and simulate flights. Using Internet of Things can help Aviation companies to stay on top of critical systems including engines, powertrains, and fuel tanks to identify and correct issues before they become potentially catastrophic, and to provide maintenance professionals with real-time data analysis capabilities.}

Here, nearly 100,000 articles on urban planning are analysed to objectively determine divisions, temporal trends and influential references and actors of urban planning. In terms of the structural composition, four broad divisions are identified: (1) governance and policy, (2) economics and markets, (3) housing and (4) built and natural environment. In terms of the temporal evolution, the earliest trends were related to “welfare economics”, “agglomeration economies”, “urban economics”, and “urban growth machine”. During the 1980s and 1990s, the focus moved towards “regional policy and development”, “social welfare”, and “urban renaissance”. This trend continued during the 2000s and 2010s, heading to “urban morphology”, “participatory planning”, “urban sociology”, “global cities”, and “political economy”. The field has recently headed towards areas of “resilience”, “smart cities” and “urban green space”. These transitions have been derivative, and the paradigm shifts have been very gradual. Another key observation is a notable increase in author connectivity and international collaboration. The results provide objective insights into how the science of urban planning has historically transitioned and where it is headed.}

abstract = {By now, there have been many standards battles fought within the same industry or by multiple industries in the market-based standardization. In these battles, incompatible standards compete to win market dominance. While there is some research on standards battles found within a single committee, competitions in the committee-based standardization between standards from different committees or SDOs are underexplored. This paper categorizes the types of standards battles by the mode of standardization and the heterogeneity of actors. A new type referred to as ‘committee standards battles for converging systems’ is introduced and the dynamics of such battles is explored with two cases. The battle between the electric vehicle charging and the smart meter communication standard and the battle between two different vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication standards are analyzed. The failure in achieving compatibility between different committee standards on the same frequency bands results in communication interference that adversely affects the operation of smart systems. Social incompatibilities between actors and alliances from a mix of industries with vested interests towards a particular standard complicate the battling scene. The findings provide implications in terms of heterogeneity, actors, and government role in standards battles.}

abstract = {CityZones is an online tool to support when computing risk zones in a city, which is performed by mathematically evaluating the emergency response capability of an urban area using real data. The tool allows users to define polygonal Areas of Interest (AoI) on a map, which are categorised into low, medium, and high-risk levels. As urban emergencies in general will typically demand the assistance of hospitals (to attend victims), firefighters (for rescue operations and damages reduction), policemen (to control and manage critical situations), and even metro stations (for evacuation), the risk zones within an AoI will be computed according to the distances to such existing infrastructure, which is extracted from the OpenStreetMap database. The coordinates of an AoI are defined at the client-side and submitted to a server as a regular or irregular polygon, which is then stored in a GeoJSON file along with the computed classifications for further processing according to a multi-tier pipeline. Adopting a configurable square-based mathematical model to compute distances and relative risk levels, the risk zones are computed on-demand and exported to CSV files to be used by any application, with an additional representation for web-based visualisation. Moreover, as a practical exploitation of the computed maps, the CityZones tool also suggests ideal positions for sensors-based Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) within an AoI according to the chosen positioning algorithm, assuming that the computed risk zones indicate how severe an undetected emergency would be. While the CityZones tool is not intended to provide a mitigation approach at all, since it does not have knowledge about current emergency situations, it stands as a valuable pre-mitigation tool to be used in the planning phase of emergency management in smart cities, bringing an important contribution for practical applications in this area.}

abstract = {Energy optimization plays a vital role in energy management, economic savings, effective planning, reliable and secure power grid operation. However, energy optimization is challenging due to the uncertain and intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (RES) and consumer’s behavior. A rigid energy optimization model with assertive intermittent, stochastic, and non-linear behavior capturing abilities is needed in this context. Thus, a novel energy optimization model is developed to optimize the smart microgrid’s performance by reducing the operating cost, pollution emission and maximizing availability using RES. To predict the behavior of RES like solar and wind probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) are proposed. Contrarily, to resolve uncertainty and non-linearity of RES, a hybrid scheme of demand response programs (DRPS) and incline block tariff (IBT) with the participation of industrial, commercial, and residential consumers is introduced. For the developed model, an energy optimization strategy based on multi-objective wind-driven optimization (MOWDO) algorithm and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is utilized to optimize the operation cost, pollution emission, and availability with/without the involvement in hybrid DRPS and IBT. Simulation results are considered in two different cases: operating cost and pollution emission, and operating cost and availability with/without participating in the hybrid scheme of DRPS and IBT. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed energy optimization model optimizes the performance of smart microgrid in aspects of operation cost, pollution emission, and availability compared to the existing models with/without involvement in hybrid scheme of DRPS and IBT. Thus, results validate that the proposed energy optimization model’s performance is outstanding compared to the existing models.}

This paper analyses that the micro smart grid works as a sociotechnical imaginary and boundary object across a specific actor constellation with plural backgrounds, interests and perspectives. Empirical data has been gathered for this study from an urban innovation campus in Germany, an ascribed living lab for innovation and research that represents an especially designated place combined with spatially embedded visions of the future city and energy system. Here the micro smart grid imaginary is closely interlinked with the place and becomes materialised: it is argued that despite the micro smart grid's incomplete status in terms of technical advancement and reliability, the imaginary already generates cooperation and commitment across actor groups and sectors. The place provides a shared, protected experimental space as well as boundary objects, thus, first, enabling the actors to cope with the perceived uncertainty in the transition process. Second, it fosters innovation, new business models and forms of cooperation, and thereby, third, contributes to the energy system transformation.}

In this perspective, some studies identified shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as being a crucial element of on-demand mobility services. There is, however, limited evidence from practice on what roles SAVs play in delivering smart urban mobility. In other words, SAV in the context of smart urban mobility is an understudied area of research with limited review studies. To bridge this gap in the literature, this study aims to investigate and map out the service attributes and impacts of SAVs on urban mobility, infrastructure and land use, travel behavior, and the environment. As the methodological approach, the paper adopts the systematic literature review technique. The study findings reveal that: (a) Providing dynamic ridesharing services could result in significant reduction of SAV fleet size, congestion, travel cost, parking demand, vehicle ownership, and emissions; (b) Positive environmental outcomes could be enhanced with full electrification of SAV fleet through renewable energy charging; (c) Integration of SAV, as a smart urban mobility system with dynamic ridesharing services, could promote sustainability and social and transportation equity, and their adoption. In the light of the findings, this study advocates the consolidation of urban/transport policy to achieve desired urban mobility outcomes.}

Parent engagement lowers relapse risk, but there are myriad barriers to engaging parents in residential treatment and continuing care. Parent SMART (Substance Misuse in Adolescents in Residential Treatment) is a technology-assisted parenting intervention that was designed to circumvent barriers associated with traditional, office-based continuing care interventions to better engage parents. This pilot randomized trial assessed the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of Parent SMART as an adjunctive intervention to adolescent residential treatment-as-usual (TAU). Sixty-one parent-adolescent dyads were randomized to Parent SMART+TAU or TAU-only. Thirty-seven dyads were recruited from a short-term facility and 24 dyads were recruited from a long-term facility. Those randomized to Parent SMART received a multi-component technology-assisted intervention combining an off-the-shelf online parenting program, coaching sessions, and a parent networking forum. Parent and adolescent assessments were conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 24-weeks post-discharge. Feasibility (e.g., parental effectiveness) and acceptability (e.g., parental satisfaction, willingness to recommend the intervention) benchmarks were specified a priori as the primary hypotheses. Secondary effectiveness indicators were the proportion of days adolescent used alcohol, cannabis, and any substance. All acceptability and feasibility benchmarks were met or exceeded among dyads in both short- and long-term residential. Generalized linear mixed models showed no significant effects pooled across sites. Analyses by facility revealed two significant time by condition interactions. Adolescents in short-term residential whose parents received Parent SMART showed fewer drinking days and fewer school problems over time, relative to adolescents whose parents received TAU. Results indicate that Parent SMART was both acceptable and feasible, with preliminary indication of effectiveness among those in short-term residential. A fully-powered trial is warranted to reliably test the effectiveness of Parent SMART and understand possible mechanisms of improvement.}

For smart communities, it is possible to synergize the energy management of smart buildings with the vehicle operation/travel information available from transportation infrastructure, e.g. the intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Such information enables the prediction of upcoming building occupancy and upcoming charging load of electric vehicles (EVs). This paper presents a predictive energy management strategy for smart community, which features water-based district cooling for a cluster of buildings driven by a multi-chiller central plant, and each building hosts a number of EV charging stations. A scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (SCMPC) framework, in which the upcoming building occupancy and charging load, ambient temperature, humidity and solar irradiance are assumed to be stochastically predictable. The SCMPC targets demand response operation at community level, involving both time-of-use and demand charges, and the combined power consumption by the central plant and EV charging observing to the transformer limit as a coupled constraint. To evaluate the propagation of the above uncertain factors through the receding-horizon SCMPC process, moving-horizon probabilistic models are established for EV arrival information. By developing a functional mockup interface (FMI) based co-simulation platform developed with Modelica and Python, the proposed method is validated via simulation study, and the performance indices are evaluated.}

For the first time, this study coupled hydrological data mining, Machine Learning (ML), and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) as smart alarm and prevention systems. Likewise, it created the platform for conditional management of floods in Iran's different clusters of climates. According to the KMeans clustering system, which determines homogeneity of the hydrology of a specific region, Iran's rainfall is heterogeneous with 0.61 score, which is approved high efficiency of clustering in a vast country such as Iran with four seasons and different climates. In contrast, the relation of rainfall and flood disaster is evaluated by Nearest Neighbors Classification (NNC), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC), and Neural Network (NN) algorithms which have an acceptable correlation coefficient with a mean of 0.7. The machine learning outputs demonstrated that based on valid data existence problems in developing countries, just with verified precipitation records, the flood disaster can be estimated with high efficiency. In the following, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a Game Theory (GT) technique ranked the preventive flood damages strategies through three social (Se 1), environmental (Se 2), and economic (Se 3) crises scenarios. The solutions of flood disaster management are collected from literature review, and the opinion approves them of 9 senior experts who are retired from a high level of water resource management positions of Iran. The outcomes of the TOPSIS method proved that National announcement for public-institutional participation for rapid response and funding (G1-2), Establishment of delay structures to increase flood focus time to give the animals in the ecosystem the opportunity to escape to the upstream points and to preserve the habitat (G 2–8), and Granting free national financial resources by government agencies in order to rebuild sensitive infrastructure such as railways, hospitals, schools, etc. to the provincial treasury (G3-10) are selected as the best solution of flood management in Social, Environmental, and Economic crises, respectively. Finally, the collected data are categorized in Social, Environmental, and Economic aspects as three dimensions of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ranked based on the opinion of 32 experts in the five provinces of present case studies.}

Digitalization enables smart cities such as Moscow to do more work with less resources. This article identifies and analyzes the existing waste management facilities in Moscow with respect to drawbacks and the ways forward to mitigate the bottlenecks. To improve its waste management, lessons drawn from Berlin's experiences in waste management are discussed to inspire a transformation in the city's waste sector in the framewok of resource recovery. In line with the 2030 UN Agenda, this work proposes a digitalization to accelerate a societal transition through waste recycling industry. Its global relevance is elaborated by presenting a perspective of digitalization in waste management practices. In this work, case-study was selected as the research method to provide a means to investigate a complex waste problem in Moscow and Berlin (Germany). It was evident from a cleaner production paradigm that digital technology can minimize the amount of unrecycled MSW, while conserving raw materials and reducing operational cost and GHG emissions. Digitalization builds cities' resilience by strengthening local waste management practices to respond to the Covid-19 global pandemic. In Moscow, the transition towards the digitalization of waste recycling through informal waste sectors has created 5,000 new jobs that reduces unemployment rate. This maximizes pick up time and enhances efficiency with a lower cost of operating trucks up to 75%. A convolutional neural network–based identification system that classifies identified materials yields almost perfect accuracy. A single robot arm can handle four varying fractions of construction and demolition waste with 99% of purity. Robotic deployment could reduce the volume of unrecycled waste by 20%. This could be replicated worldwide to resist the pressure of resource consumption and deliver socio-economic and environmental benefits.}

However, there has not been much comprehensive analysis on how pandemics shape urban societies, yet more than half of the human population now lives in cities. This paper attests to the question of whether pandemics disrupt or seed transformations in cities. The paper draws on a qualitative systematic review of academic literature, using Black Death in the middle ages of European societies as the mark to the advent of COVID-19 in metropolitan China. The evidence reveals that drastic disease-control measures and unprecedented restrictions on urban mobility, not only interrupt stable and coherent meanings of urban life but also negate the notion of carefully planned transformations. The analysis highline is that pandemic-induced transformations often come with conundrums within economic sectors, cyber security, public health and civil liberties, which makes the semblance of disruptive transformations appear inevitable. The evidence shows that pandemics often seed transformations in cities through fluid contexts of emergent changes in governance and urban design. Although mathematical and computer simulations predominantly guide decision-making on containment and recovery from pandemics, the evidence indicates that such data accounts for only a fraction of the information needed to confront the risks faced by cities. The paper recommends that efforts around recovery and containment of pandemics, need to be rooted in a culture of transdisciplinarity, which calls for stronger contributions from and collaborations amongst different tribes of science and sectors of governments.}

abstract = {As the first legally binding global agreement on climate change, the Paris Agreement aims to limit long-term global warming to less than 2 °C, preferably below 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels. Road transport, as one of the primary sources of energy consumption and carbon emissions, has great potential for energy conservation and emission reduction in achieving the climate goals. However, current approaches cannot efficiently reduce road travel, making it challenging to decarbonize in the transport sector. Therefore, in this paper, we propose STRICTs, a blockchain-enabled motor vehicle restrictive and trading system based on the carbon emissions cap. STRICTs allows automated carbon emission auditing and carbon emission violation punishment without relying on third-party escrow. Through a decentralized enforcer, STRICTs also enables carbon permit trading reliably and transparently. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the system based on Hyperledger Fabric and conduct experiments for comprehensive performance evaluation through CO2 Emission by Vehicles dataset. The experiment results show the practically affordable performance of STRICTs.}

Applying heat is one of the most effective methods to prevent apple flower bud damage. However, growers generally determine when and how to apply heat in orchards based on their experiences and available labor force, leading to either insufficient heating or energy waste. In this study, a frost protection cyber-physical system (CPCPS) was developed to make heating decisions based on real-time ambient temperature and wind direction data. The CPCPS consisted of a real-time temperature sensing system, an angle auto-adjusted heater, and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to move the heating system. The results show that the CPCPS improved protection performance during the field tests. Compared to the non-CPCPS, the CPCPS increased the percentages of canopy protected time by 198.8 % and 111.9 % in two low-temperature field tests. The outcome of the study can be beneficial for enhancing protection performance of canopies in apple orchards.}

However, such potential cannot be achieved without blockchain “oracles” needed to bridge the on-chain (i.e., blockchain system) and off-chain (i.e., real-life physical project) worlds. This study presents an innovative solution that exploits smart construction objects (SCOs). It develops a SCOs-enabled blockchain oracles (SCOs-BOs) framework. To instantiate this framework, the system architecture of a blockchain-enabled construction supply chain management (BCSCM) system is developed and validated using a case study, whereby four primary smart contracts are examined in the context of off-site logistics and on-site assembly services. The validation results show that accurate data is retrieved against malicious data in each request, and the corresponding reputation scores are successfully recorded. The innovativeness of the research lies in two aspects. In addition to mobilizing SCOs as blockchain oracles to bridge the on-chain and off-chain worlds, it develops a decentralized SCO network to avoid the single point of failure (SPoF) problem widely existing in blockchain systems. This study contributes to existing research and practice to harness the power of blockchain in construction.}

abstract = {Summary
As renewable electricity becomes cost competitive with fossil fuel energy sources and environmental concerns increase, the transition to electrified chemical and fuel synthesis pathways becomes increasingly desirable. However, electrochemical systems have traditionally taken many decades to reach commercial scales. Difficulty in scaling up electrochemical synthesis processes comes primarily from difficulty in decoupling and controlling simultaneously the effects of intrinsic kinetics and charge, heat, and mass transport within electrochemical reactors. Tackling this issue efficiently requires a shift in research from an approach based on small datasets, to one where digitalization enables rapid collection and interpretation of large, well-parameterized datasets, using artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-scale modeling. In this perspective, we present an emerging research approach that is inspired by smart manufacturing (SM), to accelerate research, development, and scale-up of electrified chemical manufacturing processes. The value of this approach is demonstrated by its application toward the development of CO2 electrolyzers.}

abstract = {In a globally connected world and increasingly smart cities, the demand for living in a physical neighborhood where one can walk and cycle among familiar people and a variety of services is always alive. It is a quality of life which meets the deep desire of community and place identity. In this regard, the 15-minutes city is the contemporary version of the classical “human measure”. The model offers a refreshing chrono-centric vision for the city that prioritizes people’s time, energy and physio-psychological health by relieving their daily commutes. The recent pandemic clearly showed this potential; the daily outdoor movement by soft mobility allowed for social life even during lockdown periods. The paper is subdivided into two main components: a theoretical discussion of the 15-minute city model as part of a broader sustainable urban planning narrative, and a practical application mapping the potentials of Milan as a 15-minute city, focusing on population distribution and urban fabric structure as a measure of performance evaluation. The emergence of the 15-minute model rebalances the building volume concentration of the consolidated Transit Oriented Development paradigm; suggesting an innovative and more articulated vision. The 15-minute approach, rooted in the organic planning of the ‘60, is pushed by the covid-19 emergency, making treasure of the experience of urban regeneration masterplans of the last decade. The approach falls in line with real estate strategies for place making, which aim to create new sustainable urban districts that are pedestrian oriented and carbon free. After interpreting the international framework of urbanism trends with respect to the 15-minute model, the paper focuses on the Milan case. The potentials for neighborhoods across the city of Milan is investigated to conform to an inclusive 15-minute city model, using fully-fledged and innovative mapping of proximity. This analysis aims to explore the resilience of urban resources to support walkable living environments with a guaranteed basic level of accessibility to daily needs by walking. The support to this model offered by soft mobility modes and micro-mobility devices is also raised. The results show, in a number of urban neighborhoods, a limited level of walkability although related to a spatial city structure which is able to be regenerated as a dense and effective network of 15-minute neighborhoods through tactical urbanism actions on existing open spaces and soft mobility policies, combined with long term strategies (infrastructure capacity and digital upgrading). It is a first methodological test which opens up the research towards a new inclusive concept of accessibility.}

Doctors and patients are now using their smart-phones to control and monitor implantable medical devices (IMDs) such as cardiac implants, insulin pumps, deep brain neurostimulators, etc. via the Internet or Bluetooth connections. Although such connectivity expands the devices’ ability to fulfill healing and diagnostic functions in a quick and cost-effective manner and can help save many lives, too much reliance on software also results in exposure to several security threats. Control of such devices via the underlying communication network may allow attackers to exploit the critical system vulnerabilities of these devices. Attackers could manipulate the settings of these devices and may try to harm the patients and these malicious attacks can originate from anywhere in the world. However, there have been very few real attempts to hack such devices and harm patients. We investigate the practical security risks involved with the use of IMDs and the motivations for an attacker to hack these devices. While some risks discussed in research are genuine and can be prevented using various security measures, it seems that quite a few risks are mere exaggerations. In our paper, we review the aspects mentioned above of IMDs and also outline some practical security measures that can further enhance the security and privacy for patients using IMDs.}

Although chemotherapy is a vital intervention, its effectiveness is frequently inadequate and is associated with metastasis, multidrug resistance, off-target effect, and normal cells toxicity. Phototherapies are employed in cancer therapy, encompassing photo-dynamic and photo-thermal therapies which under favorable NIR laser light irradiation initiate the included photosensitizers and photo-thermal agents to generate ROS or thermal heat respectively for cancer cells destruction. Photo-therapy is considered noninvasive, posing no resistance, but it still suffers from several pitfalls like low penetration depth and excessive heat generation affecting neighboring tissues. Improved selectivity and tumor-homing capacity could be attained through surface modulation of nanoparticles with targeting ligands that bind to receptors, which are exclusively overexpressed on cancerous cells. Developing novel modified targeted nanoparticulate platforms integrating different therapeutic modalities like photo-therapy and chemotherapy is a topic of active research. This review aimed to highlight recent advances in proteins, nucleic acids, and biological cell membranes functionalized nanocarriers for smart combinatorial chemotherapy/photo-therapy. Nanocarriers decorated with precise targeting ligands, like aptamers, antibody, and lactoferrin, to achieve active tumor-targeting or camouflaging using various biological cell membrane coating are designed to achieve homologous tumor-targeting.}

We investigate here energy systems design to increase the use of renewable electricity (RE) such as photovoltaics and wind power in cities. We analyzed the hourly temporal and spatiotemporal energy demand and supply patterns in Delhi, Shanghai and Helsinki to understand how energy systems respond to high RE shares, and to determine realizable levels of RE power. The results indicate that if limiting the RE output to the instantaneous power demand, a 20% yearly share of electricity could be reached. Increasing the RE beyond this limit without a smart design adds only limited benefit. Adding short-term electrical storage could increase the RE share of power in Shanghai to 50–70%, in Delhi to 40–60%, and in Helsinki to 25–35%. An electricity-to-thermal conversion strategy in which surplus RE power is utilized for heating, enables to increase the wind power use in Helsinki up to 64% of the yearly electricity demand, but in addition, to cover 30% of the yearly heat demand. Such a scheme would add ca 10% to the overall wind power investment. A high RE share affects the existing power mix and the plant capacity factors, which need to be re-optimized. In the above cases, RE replaces fossil fuel and coal power plants and therefore the CO2 emission reductions from smart design are proportional to the RE shares shown. Smart energy system design could help mainstreaming renewable electricity as part of the cities' carbon reduction strategies.}

Different power-to-X strategies have been applied to twenty-seven REC configurations. The systems have been separately simulated by means of the EnergyPLAN software. Power-to-heat strategy turns out to be the most cost-effective solution to integrate the RES excess, however, its potential often is not enough to fully accommodate it. Power-to-vehicle has low infrastructure costs, but its limit depends on the electric vehicle penetration and citizens’ participation. Exploiting the electric vehicle batteries is always more cost-effective than installing stationary batteries. The competitiveness of power-to-power is extremely linked to the REC electrification level. Power-to-gas is promising in high-RES excess conditions, but rarely represents the best solution due to current high electrolyser costs. The implementation of energy storage systems is crucial for improving the local self-consumption and the cross-sector integration is a better solution in energy, economic and environmental terms than focusing only on the electricity sector.}

This study has proposed a proximal sensing system by means of using a color camera towards smart irrigation based on computer vision and deep learning to identify water requirements of three soil texture classes under different illumination conditions. An imaging station was composed to reduce the workload in obtaining training images required for training deep convolutional neural network models. Five deep learning architectures were employed to identify texture-water classes: AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet, VGG16, and SqueezeNet. Those models were experimented with and investigated to determine the best models in terms of detection performance and speed. By using cross-validation rules, approximately 12,214 images were studied individually for the purpose of training and testing. The AlexNet model outperformed the other deep learning models with an F1-score of 0.9973 in identifying twelve soil texture-water classes. GoogleNet and ResNet displayed the fastest detection speeds with an average processing time of 16.92 ms.

Geo-gerontological aspects of the care and supply networks are becoming essential in the processes of deinstitutionalisation of long-term care and services and are crucial for the successful development and implementation of Ambient Assisted Living technologies (AAL_T). A growing number of older adults suffer from declining functional capacities and, thereby, experience decreased mobility and increasing frailty, which can lead to difficulties in carrying out essential activities of daily living as well as increased exposure to the risk of falls. Aid in managing one's daily life needs to be provided on time and in a properly built environment. Ambient intelligence for real-time monitoring of daily activities and supporting older residents with AAL_T will become essential means by which ageing cities will be able to maintain and improve the quality of life for older adults with declining functional capacities. This development will further influence the delineation of service areas and the timing of services. AAL_T and ambient intelligence will enable older adults to live longer in their dwellings and specialised facilities in the community and postpone or even avoid relocation to a nursing home altogether. Development in AAL_T has raised the possibility of developing more efficient services if the functional area of service networks is optimised. Based on these developments, we propose the adaptation of a multi-state competing risk model based on time to failure as modelled in reliability engineering to model and control the trajectories of declining functional capacities and related events that lead to the ill-health and disabilities. In this model, the built environment and timing in service networks are supposed to be embedded. The final goal of such a model is to support decision making that would extend the physically and mentally active life of seniors and enable them to live autonomously and be engaged with their communities. This paper aims to review the development of condition monitoring systems in ambient technologies, shape the model and propose a future research agenda.}

abstract = {Many countries, including Korea, are striving towards carbon-neutrality by 2050. Accordingly, this study proposes a method for cutting carbon emissions by reducing the use of passenger cars through a travel demand management scheme called mobility hub. The effectiveness of this approach has been estimated by designing a mobility hub for Seoul using a location plan and mobility design. In particular, some locations of area widely scattered transport facilities, including bus stops, subways, public parking lots, and gas stations have been selected and adjusted to design mobility hub in order to enhance mobility metabolism. A design involving smart mobility and retrofitting of the existing facilities towards the mobility hub has been presented and evaluated in the traditional travel demand modeling framework. If the mobility hub is to be implemented, a significant number of vehicles would be converted to public transportation, and vehicle kilometers traveled would be also decreased substantially. The resulting decrease in carbon emissions would contribute around two percentage reduction by transport sector in the Seoul area in the initial stage. Thanks to the design of the mobility hub, it is effective not only for the environmental benefits by modal shifts to public transportation, but also for health promotion by changing people's travel behavior.}

abstract = {This paper suggests a novel framework to co-optimize the power and heat in smart cities considering the local air pollution from energy generation units and traffic fumes. To achieve the aim, a smart city comprised of power and heat generation units is addressed. The energy system of the smart city can be connected to the main grid or be operated as a stand-alone power system. Connecting to the main grid, the city trades power in the wholesale electricity market with price uncertainty. In order to co-optimize the operation cost of energy units and to control the pollution levels of the urban area, a Combined Economic Pollution Dispatch Problem (CEPDP) is developed. The CEPDP is optimized under air pollution constraints from both energy generation units and traffic fumes. Increasing the applicability of the suggested approach, pollution density is addressed using the Box model while the wind speed and surface roughness influence on it. To solve the CEPDP, a multi-objective Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA II) is proposed. The suggested approach is implemented in a virtually-designed smart city located in the center of Iran. The results show that although the use of distributed generation decreases the global emission all over the world, it transmits the air pollution from suburban areas to cities increasing the local pollution. The two conflict objectives, i.e. global and local pollutions, may change the operation of distributed generation to meet the local environment requirements of cities.}

abstract = {Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data for public transport analyses has received much research interest recently, including its use for the estimation of passenger route choice preferences. However, an important problem persists since AFC data only includes information about the trip within the public transport system, that is stop-to-stop (tap-in to tap-out). Not knowing the full trip from door-to-door might lead to estimation bias, especially when estimating route choice models based on only the chosen stops, which is common practice in current research using AFC data. To avoid this, we propose an improved method for estimating route choice models in public transport using AFC data. The method is based on randomly generating pseudo origin (and destination) points in close vicinity of the actually chosen origin (and destination) stops, thus allowing pseudo access and egress times to be incorporated into the route choice model. The framework is compatible with any probability density function. We suggest using the Beta distribution for generating points when knowledge about access and egress distances are available, whereas the Uniform distribution is suggested when no knowledge is available. The method was applied on replicated AFC data based on traditional travel survey data from the Greater Copenhagen area in Denmark. The results of the model estimations confirm estimation bias in parameter estimates when not correcting for the lack of access/egress information. The proposed method notably improves in-vehicle-time parameter estimates of the route choice model compared to estimation assuming AFC stop-to-stop data, whereas access/egress time and hidden waiting time parameters are still biased, although to a lesser extent than a traditional naïve estimation based on stop-to-stop data.}

The data received is processed near the end-user to reduce processing delays that could affect time-sensitive applications. This study employs a novel method for data gathering and an effective scheduling framework for intelligent agricultural systems. The suggested paradigm for UAV-based IoT data collection encompasses three primary components: optimal UAV trajectory, data gathering, and data scheduling. These components are specifically designed to incorporate trajectory, energy efficiency, and resource optimization to improve performance. IoT sensors are strategically placed throughout the data collection process to ensure optimal clustering. The clustering is determined by considering various parameters such as distance, latency, energy usage, trust, and quality of service (QoS), among other important factors. The integration of the Lion Algorithm (LA) and Cat Mouse-Based Optimization (CMBO) techniques has led to the proposal of a unique optimization methodology called Lion Mated with Cats Optimization (LMCO). This approach aims to identify the optimal cluster head (CH) in a new and innovative way. To gather data from all clusters, the UAV plans the most efficient route, following a direct path while also avoiding any possible collisions via the LMCO model. The trajectory is computed using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. The base station (BS) receives the data transmitted by the UAV in close vicinity. Subsequently, the BS selects the most appropriate cloud node based on factors such as response rate, ideal five-fold power efficiency, quality of service (QoS), execution time, and availability. The simulation results are showcased to verify the effectiveness of the suggested approach and are compared with the existing model to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.}

Bikeshare as a feeder mode to metro helps solve the last mile problem. Thus, it is necessary to monitor and analyze metro-bikeshare transfer characteristics. The primary objective of this study is to derive a reproducible methodology that isolates bicycle-metro transfer trips using smart card data. Two recognition rules proposed are a maximum transfer time of 10 min and a maximum transfer distance of 300 m. To explore the general characteristics of metro-bikeshare transfer trips, transfer stations served at less than 30 transfer trips during three consecutive weeks were eliminated to ensure that a non-typical transfer pattern would not distort the results. The results show that more than 89% passengers recognized have less than 6 transfers in 3 weeks, indicating that most users integrate bikeshare with metro impromptu. Two transfer peaks on workdays are during 7:00–9:00 and 17:00–19:00, especially in suburban areas, while at weekends, transfers show quite even during 8:00–19:00. As to “Return-Enter” and “Exit-Lease” transfer modes, the “time difference” phenomenon does exist, which means that the transfer peak of “Return-Enter”mode always happens one hour earlier than that of “Exit-Lease”. Furthermore, the demographic differences in metro-bikeshare usage pattern are revealed. Finally, policy implications are involved to improve the performance of metro-bikeshare integration for all kinds of people without creating inequality.}

abstract = {Smart grids are at risk of a dangerously covert attack called coordinated cyber–physical attack (CCPA), which may cause large-scale line outages or even cascading failures. This is because that the damage of the physical attack can be masked by the coordinated cyberattack. Towards this goal, the attacker usually injects false data into the sensor measurements to manipulate the results of state estimation. In this paper, we propose a moving target defense (MTD) approach that applies controlled randomization to the set of measurements used in state estimation, which invalidates the attacker’s prior acquired knowledge regarding power grids, and thus mitigates the coordinated false data injection (FDI) attack. To ensure that the measurement set is able to observe the system, a formal model with observability constraints is developed to select the measurements. Extensive simulations are performed on the standard IEEE bus systems using the MATPOWER simulator, and results show that the proposed MTD approach can prevent more than 50% of the states from being attacked.}

The basis of Project SMART is a cooperative educational game originally designed to raise kids awareness of sustainable active transportation to and from school. In Project SMART, we adapt this game to focus on the health and educational benefits of moderate to vigorous physical activity, leveraging organized physical activity opportunities during the school day. In the game, a class cooperatively earns credit for performing physical activity. This credit takes the form of distances traveled on a virtual path (e.g., along Route 66 across the United States). As the class makes progress, they unlock waypoints that contain learning modules defined by their teachers to be directly tied to their curricular content. The paper describes the manner in which Project SMART has used community based-participatory research to develop a game that integrates with the school and community, and reports on the results of a pilot study carried out during the 2019–2020 academic year.}

These Constraints have motivated researchers to put forward a solution for energy efficient green communication. However, the increasing number of devices annually is also a matter of concern. To deal with such an invidious situation, we have brought together two magnanimous technologies- NB-IoT and Green IoT. The concept of Green IoT has been of paramount importance as it addresses a very important IoT challenge by restricting energy usage of IoT devices and bringing forwards new tactics to deal with it. LPWA technology has come to the rescue, by connecting numerous devices over a wide domain with optimized battery life, utilizing very less power for connectivity and hence curbing the cost to a great extent. Various LPWA technologies like LoRA, Zigbee, Sigfox etc offer prominent solutions to the users by reducing Carbon emissions and making efficient Utilization of power resources but to provide a maximum global outreach of devices to the users and avoid Infrastructure cost, 3GPP in Release-13 provided a cellular based Licensed Technology called NB-IoT. This Technology provides features which can bring maximum benefits to LPWA technology in Market like Low power Consumption, massive connection to IoT devices and enhanced Indoor Coverage.

In order to have a successful smart PSS that satisfies customers’ requirements, investigation and evaluation of the innovation value propositions (IVPs) became one of the critical necessities. The main advantage of adopting smart PSS is the ability to gather and process a large amount of information to help in decision making and development processes. This study proposes an integrated framework using DEMATEL and CRITIC methods based on the neutrosophic set. Due to the variant of the evaluation process and ambiguity in information, neutrosophic numbers can be used as an efficient expression to guarantee successful evaluation. By comparing the neutrosophic set with other approaches that deal with uncertainty and inconsistency of information, it is more powerful in handling uncertain judgments by considering the truth-membership function, falsity-membership function, and indeterminacy-membership function. Smart PSS can improve an overall quality in the healthcare sector extensively as many solution types, such as sensors, smart pills, and smart surgeries. An illustrative case of smart Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) sensors is demonstrated to examine the proposed framework.}

In the top-down landscape approach, the public authority's integrated administrative capability and capacity is important as a means by which to link the various types of stakeholders. This has to be done, in the process of managing a city's transition and reducing the risk of transformational failure, by reinforcing the four types of capital assets – namely manufacturing capital, natural capital, human capital, and social capital.}

How mines and wells are superintended is restructuring the geographies of employment as more of the day-to-day mining operations are centralized in urban locations distant from sites of extraction. Digital infrastructures allow for greater control over distant non-urban extractive geographies, but they also are remaking urban spaces. While the tendency today is to create ever more geographically extensive extractive-labor regimes, these regimes are increasingly modulated by digital technology advances, a feature that also central in the drive for cities to become “smart.” Here, in a review of the literature, we theorize these transformations and show that they raise pressing new research questions at the (digitalized) nexus of urban — carbon — labor. We argue that to date, research, particularly that on digitalization, has at any time tended to focus on two of the three nodes in this nexus, and better integrating all 3 of them raises unique theoretical challenges. We offer 4 inquiries as an agenda that can guide future research. First, how should urban labor be brought to bear on digital extraction scholarship? Second, how is digitalization of carbon-extractive economies shaping social divisions of labor in the smart city? Third, does the datafication of “nature” in energy-extractive industries transform political ecology relations? Fourth, how does the particular context of the extractive industries make us rethink urban economies of digital labor?}

abstract = {Background
The SMall Annuli Randomized To Evolut or SAPIEN (SMART) Trial was designed to compare the performance of the two most widely available commercial transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices in patients with symptomatic severe native aortic stenosis with a small aortic valve annulus undergoing transfemoral TAVR. Patients with small aortic valve annuli are typically female and are often underrepresented in clinical trials.
Methods
The SMART Trial is an international, prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled, post-market trial. The trial will be conducted in approximately 700 subjects at approximately 90 sites globally. Inclusion criteria include severe aortic stenosis, aortic valve annulus area of ≤430 mm2 based on multi-detector computed tomography, and appropriate anatomy for both the Medtronic Evolut PRO/PRO+ self-expanding and Edwards SAPIEN 3/3 Ultra balloon-expandable devices. The primary clinical outcome composite endpoint is defined as mortality, disabling stroke or heart failure rehospitalization at 12 months. The co-primary valve function composite endpoint is defined as bioprosthetic valve dysfunction at 12 months which includes hemodynamic structural valve dysfunction, defined as a mean gradient ≥20 mmHg, non-structural valve dysfunction, defined as severe prothesis-patient mismatch or ≥moderate aortic regurgitation, thrombosis, endocarditis, and aortic valve re-intervention. Powered secondary endpoints will be assessed hierarchically.
Conclusions
The SMART trial will be the largest head-to-head comparative trial of transfemoral TAVR using the two most widely available contemporary TAVR devices in the setting of small aortic annuli and the largest trial to enroll primarily women.

Then, relying on a simple industrial-organization model of the electric market, we analyze the impact of smart grids on competition among energy suppliers and on the incentives of distribution system operators to invest in it. We show that the risk-reduction effect of smart grids pushes firms to supply more energy. However, the latter can be compensated by an indirect competition effect of investments in smart grids which prevents the entry of firms into the market, though the aggregate effect on energy supply is always positive. We also find that distribution system operators under-invest in smart grids because they fail to internalize positive externalities on energy consumers and producers.}

Our results evidence a population-weighted average reduction of 56.8% in accessibility to jobs in a regular workday morning peak due to crowding discomfort, as well as reductions of 6.2% due to travel time unreliability and 59.2% when both are combined. The findings of this study can be of invaluable help to public transport planners and policymakers, as they show the importance of including both aspects in accessibility indicators for better decision making. Despite some limitations due to data quality and consistency throughout the study period, the proposed approach offers a new way to leverage big data in public transport to enhance policy decisions.}

abstract = {Decentralized peer-to-peer energy sharing techniques are highly promising to become the next-generation regime for smart building energy management, which can impulse the realization of nearly net-zero energy buildings. In this context, this paper proposes a comprehensive energy sharing framework for smart buildings in considering multiple dynamic components covering heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), battery energy storage systems (BESS) and electric vehicles (EVs). Specifically, both the power loss and shadow price of shared energy are explicitly modeled in a combined optimization framework, which is aimed to maximize the social welfare through peer-to-peer energy cooperation. Moreover, the role of agents acting as producers or consumers can be endogenously determined in the proposed model. In addition, distinguished with the classical distributed algorithms, we develop a fully decentralized algorithm based on dual-consensus version of alternating direction method of multipliers (DC-ADMM). The proposed algorithm avoids the need of coordinators at both the primal and dual variable updates in the iteration process, which suggests distinctive merits on high-level privacy protection as compared to most of the distributed optimization-based methods. Extensive case studies based on a smart building community demonstrate that the proposed peer-to-peer transactive framework can admirably improve the overall welfare for the involved smart buildings.}

Drawing upon a two-year study of large-scale digital platforms in US cities, this paper investigates conflicts over data sharing between city transportation departments and ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft. By maintaining data monopolies, platform companies obfuscate the detrimental impacts of their services (e.g., increased congestion and pollution, dangers to cyclists and pedestrians) and interfere with city transportation planners’ tasks of diagnosing city needs and providing services for the public good. Ride-hailing companies’ resistance to data sharing serves the strategic goals of prolonging monopoly status and slowing regulation for maximum capital extraction, but I argue that it also performs a more insidious function of entrenching platform practices and logics, making alternatives difficult to imagine or implement. Against this backdrop, I explore the notion of a “data commons” approach to transportation management.}

It is designed and prototyped entirely inside a window frame without compromising architectural aesthetics. This self-powered sensing platform is achieved by maximizing the harvested energy from building envelopes and optimizing the wireless sensing unit’s energy consumption. It harvests milli-watt level thermoelectric power from the temperature gradient across building envelopes through thermoelectric generators with an optimized thermal connector. The harvested energy is voltage-boosted and regulated through two integrated circuits that are tailored for ultra-low-power input. A low power system-on-chip is used to supervise the environmental sensing and wireless data communication. The energy consumption is tailored by adjusting the system sleep time to match the harvested energy. The proposed platform is prototyped in a window frame and thoroughly tested, where 1.5 mW of power is harvested from thermoelectric generators under 6 °C of temperature difference, and a 33.4% efficiency to the battery. In the meantime, 0.42 mW power is consumed by the wireless sensing unit under a sampling period of 2 h, which reaches the energy equilibrium state. The energy equilibrium algorithm can project the battery energy based on historical weather conditions, so as to achieve the self-powered condition given a geographic location. This smart building envelope systems include the unique innovations in self-powered system architecture, thermally optimized internal structure, and milli-watt level power management.}

However, recent findings from European smart metering trials have reduced the optimism, suggesting only modest savings from energy feedback. In this paper, we investigate the potential of HEMS to foster reductions in energy use, focusing on a population segment of particular relevance; high-income and highly educated households, considered as early adopters of smart grid technologies. Covering 154 households participating in a field trial in a sustainable city district in Stockholm, Sweden during one year, this study draws on the analyses of smart meter electricity and hot tap water data and in-depth interviews to provide an increased understanding of how feedback and features are perceived, used, and acted upon, and resulting effects on awareness, behavior, and consumption. Our results show that impact on energy consumption varies widely across individual households, suggesting that households respond to energy feedback highly individually. Although HEMS may lead to increased awareness of energy consumption, as well as increased home comfort, several obstacles for energy consumption behavioral change are identified. Drawing from these findings, we suggest policy implications and key issues for future research.}

Smart windows represent a typical energy-saving technology; ultraviolet indicators can sense radiation safety limits, and the around-the-clock photocatalysts can be used for pollutant degradation and bacterial disinfection applications. These materials, their distinct properties, and the effects of their application must be comprehensively understood prior to commercialization. In this work, we first summarize the affiliation between the crystallographic properties-optical features-photochromic behavior of WO3. Several photochromic models and kinetic equations are then presented, accompanied by the related characterization techniques and evaluation methods. The factors affecting photochromic efficiency (e.g., light absorption, surface reaction, and carrier migration) are delineated to clarify the advantages of the specific nanostructured WO3 and the most efficient available strategies for constructing WO3-based nanomaterials. The theory, technique, and performance associated with chromogenic applications in smart devices, energy conversion, and environmental remediation are deliberated in detail.

It is anticipated that such informed consumers in control of their consumption patterns will contribute to reduced energy usage and thus a sustainable environment. Smart meter technology in smart homes provides real-time information to customers through devices such as in-home displays and web portals, and provide half-hourly consumption data to electricity distributors and retailers. Such data enables the profiling of consumers making it possible to understand different life styles and electricity usage behaviours to provide customised electricity billing. To obtain the anticipated benefit from such highly granular and high frequency data, it is essential to have big data technologies which can process such volumes of data in near real time. The research described in this paper focus on addressing the key requirements of large volume data processing and making use of the highly granular nature of the data. Adapting a new scalable algorithm introduced by the authors for big data processing, this work demonstrates the practicality of processing large volumes of data at multiple levels of granularity. The faster processing capacity makes it possible to continuously analyse consumption data at frequent intervals as they are collected and at a highly granular level thus providing a practical solution as a smart home application. The advantages of the technique is demonstrated using electricity consumption data for 10,000 households for a year from an Australian electricity retailer.}

Cities based on integrated technological systems can respond to rapidly changing needs by providing pre-built facilities within the city’s infrastructure environment, with the help of the flexible urban planning structure of the city, which cannot be achieved without advanced analysis technology that define the threats and the weaknesses and help to find the solutions. These cities are not limited to those that are established from the beginning by new technology, but also existent cities could turn into smart cities.

abstract = {Smart mobility entails the coordinated use of technology to increase the quality and efficiency of mobility provision, while minimizing or reducing the space consumed and externalities generated by transportation supply. In order to plan and design for such smart mobility systems, it becomes necessary to understand how their dynamics play out in response to urban design elements. Smart city urban design, therefore, cannot be conceived of without considering details about the mobility system that will serve it. This chapter starts with an introduction to transportation demand planning and modeling approaches. It considers traditional four-step travel demand modeling and compares it to later approaches that consider the effects of individual activity–travel behavior and decision-making. It also provides an overview of integrated transportation and land-use planning, where the interaction of the transportation system and its resulting accessibility affects location choice behavior of firms and households. Agent-based modeling approaches capable of capturing the high degree of complexity and coordination in emerging smart mobility systems are introduced. In what follows, two contrasting approaches to the question of integrated urban systems design with smart mobility systems are set forth. In the first approach, the agent-based traffic simulation, MATSim, is integrated into an urban design workflow such that an agent-based travel demand this rapidly produced from typical urban design digital drawings such as a road network layer, massing of buildings by use, and other design elements such as the location of transit stops, parking space, active mobility network, etc. In this sketch planning approach, future mobility systems are made available to serve the transportation demand that would be plausibly produced from the urban design. In this way, the urban designer can then evaluate and compare designs and mobility systems, tinker with various design elements and system parameters, and rerun the simulation to have the design and mobility flows that it will produce coevolve. This approach is tested in an application of a prospective neighborhood design in Singapore. A hypothetical new transit system, served by autonomous vehicles and capable of moving the passenger between any combination of stops in the study area without predetermined routes, is tested for three different network designs. The experiment reveals that, in order to provide a predefined level of service, each of the three designs will require a different fleet size, while producing radically different experiences to the individuals who will be living and working in the neighborhood. The second experiment explores how the spacing of transit stops in a neighborhood affect the performance of such a dynamically routed transit service, resulting in different levels of use of the road network and associated externalities that residents will be exposed to. Insights from how this smart mobility system will perform can inform trade-offs about where to invest in infrastructure expenditure: should one build more transit stops or should one rather invest in maximizing walkability to a smaller set of transit stops and so be able to bundle rides together?}

A novel non-cooperative Stackelberg game is introduced that incorporates the profitability of the supply-side and helps in solving problems related to overgeneration and photovoltaic curtailment. The non-cooperative game is intended to find the optimal dynamic prices that would leverage distributed storage through the demand-side to stabilize the power grid operation. Ten cases are studied with five photovoltaic plant sizes and two battery designs. A novel quantitative analysis of high levels of solar penetration as a percentage of the total electricity demand is introduced to evaluate the technical feasibility of the studied cases. To evaluate the economic viability of the proposed smart grid system, four metrics were used: the levelized cost of energy, the levelized cost of storage, the payback period, and the net present value. Two out of ten studied cases were concluded to be the most promising cases, one with a solar photovoltaic plant size of 200 MW and the other with 300 MW. The case with 300 MW solar plant is preferred as it paves the way for more solar energy deployment with a solar penetration percentage up to 67.78%. This case had a payback period of 10.72 years and a net present value of $51.44 M for the solar plant and a payback period of 12.06 years and a net present value of $40.75 M for the demand-side.}

Therefore, the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) requires reliable fast-charging stations (FCSs). However, random allocation of FCSs and PV adversely impacts the performance and operation of the traffic flow and power networks. Thus, this paper proposes a new planning approach for the optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs in large-scale smart grids and transportation networks. Unlike existing approaches, the well-known Dynamic Network Assignment Simulation for Road Telematics (DYNASMART) is updated and employed in the proposed planning approach to accurately simulate the EVs within the traffic stream. The average waiting time of the EVs at the charging stations (including charging time) and the total annual costs are utilized as conflicting objective functions to be minimized. To effectively solve this comprehensive model with conflicting objectives, a bi-layer multiobjective optimization based on metaheuristic (NSGA-II) and deterministic (GAMS) algorithms is established. The outer layer optimizes the allocation of FCSs and PV accurately, while the inner one optimally dispatches the generated power of the conventional generation units. The proposed planning approach is tested on a 26-bus electrical transmission network and 92-node transportation system. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. The optimal allocation of FCSs and PVs with 80% EVs penetration increases the net profit by 85.36% while maintaining a maximum of 30 minutes for both charging and waiting time.}

abstract = {To achieve net-zero emissions, smart microgrid technologies like building-electric-vehicle (building-EV) energy networks with distributed renewable energy (RE) and energy storage are receiving growing attention. Nonetheless, there are few easy-to-use simulation platforms for conveniently and fast modeling and optimizing building-EV energy networks since it involves many research fields. In this study, a novel open-sourced simulating platform, BEVPro, was proposed to easily and accurately model and evaluate building-EV networks integrating buildings, REs, onsite electric batteries, and EVs. Firstly, the development of BEVPro was introduced. Then, a series of simulations on a community microgrid with 30 buildings, solar panels, onsite batteries, and 30 EVs, was conducted via BEVPro to optimize the investigated network. To be specific, in the comparison of annual energy amounts and grid powers for validating the accuracy of BEVPro with TRNSYS, the differences are smaller than 1.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Then the influences of different quantities of energy components (like the EV) were explored, and the four rule-based strategies were compared via BEVPro, of which the optimal strategy with the largest economic benefits (reducing 61.5% energy cost for residents) was selected for the parametric optimization of the energy components and control strategy, to further improve the energy flexibility of the building-EV network.}

The sustainable development of the logistics sector has important practical significance for the evolution of smart cities. This study assessed the inefficiency rate and total factor productivity (TFP) of logistics in 36 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2015. The directional distance function (DDF) and Luenberger productivity index analytical approaches were used to assess the relevant parameters. The results revealed that the logistics system inefficiency rate of the eastern region was much higher than that of the central and western regions, while that of the western region was slightly higher than that of the central region. This study identified the main constraints of the logistics TFP in different regions in China. This finding is used to promote policy-making and investment planning to improve China's competitive advantage. The results documented that the central region of China needs to accelerate logistics reforms and use its location advantage of its location to form an organic connection with the eastern and western regions. Countries can use such metrics to take actions to improve their logistics performance, as such an improvement has a causal relationship with economic development.}

However, they are exposed to natural and anthropogenic stressors, such as strong windstorms, extreme wind events and accidents; inducing tree falling which can cause personal damages, economic losses and infrastructural destructions. The current study is the first of its kind, presenting a tree monitoring system, and using smart sensing devices installed on more than 8000 trees in Hong Kong's rural and urban landscapes. A description of the key components of the system, followed by big data analysis and three case studies of strong wind events over the past 2 years, are presented. A network of smart sensing devices was deployed to develop a large-scale, long-term, smart tree monitoring framework; to help identify potentially hazardous trees in urban areas, particularly during extreme weather events. The changes in tree tilt angle under natural wind loading were recorded. Patterns and responses of tree tilt angles were analyzed, with prediction using time series models based on the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Extreme Gradient Boosting time series forecasting (xGBoost). The results showed the highest correlation for 1-hour forward forecasting, by applying xGBoost model on tree tilt data and weather observations (R2=0.90). On the other hand, SARIMA model produced one-step-ahead prediction with correlation (R2) ranging from 0.77 to 0.93, while lower correlation (R2 ≤ 0.55) was observed for long term prediction (15 days) of the tree tilt angles. Finally, a dashboard and mobile applications of tree monitoring systems were developed, to transfer knowledge and engage the public in understanding associated hazards with tree failures in the urban area.}

Rapid degradation of Mg alloys compromises the mechanical performance and interfacial bioactivity, hindering clinical adoption. Deposition of a surface coating is an effective technique to improve the corrosion protection and bio-efficacy of Mg biomedical implants. Because of the natural degradability and corrosion, the surface is inevitably damaged in the complex physiological environment. Therefore, it is essential to form a self-healing coating that can repair damage to restore the stable mechanical structure and functions of biomedical Mg alloys. This paper reviews the recent advances in coating technology and the related properties including biodegradation behavior, self-repairing activity, biocompatibility, and other biological effects, and the healing mechanism is discussed. Self-healing coatings suitable for Mg alloys include conversion coatings, encapsulation coatings, and multilayered coatings, and their properties in vitro and in vivo are reviewed by focusing on drug-controlled and prolonged release, sterilization, cytocompatibility, osteogenesis, hemocompatibility, and angiogenesis. This review aims at providing guidance for the future research and development of practical healing coatings for biomedical Mg implants.}

Through the lens of Ethiopia’s flagship Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), we trace the role of climate discourses in impeding progress towards socially transformative outcomes, despite the importance of social protection for building resilience. We argue that intertwining narratives of moral leadership and green growth associated with Ethiopia’s national climate strategy shape how the PSNP is rendered ‘climate-smart’. These narratives, however, are embedded within politics that have historically underpinned the country’s drive for modernisation and growth-oriented policies, particularly in dealing with food insecurity. Like pre-existing narratives on development and the environment, they rationalise the presence of a strong central State and its control over natural resources and rural livelihoods. The PSNP is thus conditioned to favour technocratic, productivist approaches to adapting to climate change that may help reproduce, rather than challenge the entrenched politics at the root of vulnerability. Ultimately, this case study demonstrates how climate discourses risk diluting core rights-based dimensions of social protection, contradicting efforts to address the structural dimensions of vulnerability to climate change.}

NLP has been applied for information extraction and exchanging and many downstream applications to facilitate management and decision-making. The role of NLP in smart construction and current challenges for fully reaping its benefits are discussed, and four research directions are identified, i.e., improving relation extraction, realising knowledge base auto-development, integrating multi-modal information, and achieving an accuracy-efficiency trade-off by developing an NLP application framework.

A nation-wide, web-based contingent valuation survey was implemented for the sample of 1,613 households in 2018. Nearly 80 percent of respondents expressed their intentions to use the Eco-toilet at home. About 70 percent of the sample stated a positive willingness to pay for the construction of a bioenergy facility inside their community. Furthermore, about 41 percent of the sample expressed their willingness to pay for adding a health monitoring sensor. The respondents’ stated preference for the SETS project was influenced by their perceptions and attitudes toward human feces, water usage of flushing toilets, and efficiency of bioenergy and renewable energy. The willingness to pay for constructing the Eco-toilet system was estimated to be around $12 USD per month. The willingness to pay for the smart health services was estimated to be about $3.45 USD per month.}

A classification of the behavior of smart card users is important in the field of public transit demand analysis. It provides an understanding of people’s sequence of activities within a period of time. However, classical metrics such as Euclidean distance is not appropriate when dealing with time-series classification. To solve this problem, in this article a method for the classification of public transit smart card users’ daily transactions, which are represented in time series, is presented. The chosen approach uses cross-correlation distance (CCD), hierarchical clustering, and subgroups by metric parameter to understand the users’ temporal patterns. The clustering results are compared with dynamic time warping (DTW) distance (a common method to measure time-series distance). After a brief pedagogical example to explain the DTW and CCD concepts, a program is developed in R to validate the method on a real dataset of smart card data transactions. The dataset concerns the use of the public transit system in the city of Gatineau in September 2013. The results demonstrate that CCD performs better than DTW to classify the time series, and that the classification method identifies different public transit users’ daily behaviors. The results will help transit authorities to offer better services for smart card users from diverse groups.}

A smart parking lot (SPL), renewable energy sources (RESs) such as photovoltaic systems (PV) and wind turbines (WT), and local dispatchable generators (LDG) such as microturbines (MT) and fuel cells (FC) are integrated as a microgrid (MG) while an energy management system is presented in this study which considers the uncertainties of wind speed, solar irradiation, and load consumption. The optimal operation of the SPL, which serves as a load and energy generation source for the distribution network, is done in this article with the goal of lowering costs. To cut costs, demand response program (DRP) based on a time of use (TOU) tariff is utilized, which moves a part of load from on-peak to off-peak time intervals, flattening the load curve. The goal is to reduce the operational expenses of the upstream grid (UG), LDGs, and SPL while taking into account the technical and physical limits of the units. Furthermore, for dealing with the uncertainties of load consumption and wind generation, this research employs a new uncertainty modeling method based on Hong's two-point estimate method. The suggested model is investigated by applying the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software and is formulated as mixed linear programming (MIP). The suggested model includes both a spinning reserve of LDG and a SPL, and the simulation results verified that the DRP has a good impact on lowering operation costs.}

Therefore, it is crucial to enhance transit ridership in a city by providing a more competitive transit service. Meanwhile, with the recent development of traffic information collection technologies, it is possible to acquire more accurate and rich information on transit and auto travel times through smart card data and map-based application programming interface (API) services. In this study, we analyze transit competitiveness compared to autos in Seoul using smart card data, which can represent actual transit travel times. Auto travel information is obtained from the T map, which is the most popular navigation application in Korea. As a methodology, we present a new transit competitiveness index to measure transit competitiveness for the network-wide analysis based on the travel time. The analysis of the results shows that the transit is more competitive for the people commuting to and from two major business districts, i.e., Gangnam business district (GBD) and Central business district (CBD), in Seoul on peak hours. This means that the transit system in Seoul is well-equipped, and people can easily access to employment or other opportunities by using transit. However, there are some residential and another major business district where transit is not competitive. The results also show that variability in transit travel time at peak hours may cause a decrease in transit competitiveness. We also suggest recommendations to improve transit competitiveness in Seoul. Based on the recommendations, the Seoul government should strive to improve transit competitiveness.}

To accomplish the key objectives of L-AKM, a lightweight continuous authentication was preferred that adopts the valid authentication period and continuous user authentication session to speed up the authentication process. The performance analysis proves that the L-AKM scheme achieves better security efficiencies to resist various potential attacks such as forgery, replay, password guessing, etc. However, the experimental analysis shows that the proposed L-AKM consumes more transmission delay and throughput rate due to extra authentication phases.}

Fisher’s exact test was used to determine relationships between two or more variables.
Findings
Results of the survey revealed that the vast majority (98%) of respondents perceived changes in temperature, rainfall and weather patterns. Reduction of crop yields and the emergence of new weed species and new crop pests are the main impacts on agricultural activities. Although 87.6% of respondents have no means of adaptation and resilience, some of them use crops rotation, fallow practice, fertilizers and bio-pesticides. A framework for CSA is proposed for the Yangambi landscape.
Practical implications
Policies and strategies to promote CSA in the study area should take into account local farmers' perceptions of climate change and consider first the adequacy of CSA practices for the specific conditions of the target area before its promotion. This study is thus useful for many REDD+ initiatives that are currently being promoted in DRC and particularly in the Tshopo Province.
Originality/value
This study is one of the first studies to focus on CSA in the Yangambi landscape, DRC. It assists the use of agriculture as a response to reducing deforestation while at the same time lowering agriculture’s carbon footprint and promoting a resilient and more productive farming system.}

Hence, development of these energy-related technologies have become an important priority across Europe. To this end, this study examines the literature on interactions between several social actors regarding the advancement of smart and green energy technologies. The analysis is based on the identification of three levels of formal social decision-making units, namely, Formal Social Units, Collective Decision-Making Units, and Individual Consumers engaging in joint contracts. The attitude dimensions, motivators and barriers concerning the energy behaviors of the three decision-making units are identified through a comprehensive literature review. Similarities and differences in decision-making processes related to each level and the reasons for delays in achieving targets are identified. Moreover, a policy framework for involved stakeholders of smart and green energy technologies is presented.}

This paper contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the EC profiles in a Southwest European city through the combination of high-resolution data from smart meters (daily electricity consumption) with door-to-door 110-question surveys for a sample of 265 households in the city of Évora, in Portugal. This analysis allowed to define ten power consumption clusters using Ward's method hierarchical clustering, corresponding to four distinct types of annual consumption profiles: U shape (sharp and soft), W shape and Flat. U shape pattern is the most common one, covering 77% of the sampled households. The results show that three major groups of determinants characterize the electricity consumption segmentation: physical characteristics of a dwelling, especially year of construction and floor area; HVAC equipment and fireplaces ownership and use; and occupants’ profiles (mainly number and monthly income). The combination of the daily EC data with qualitative door-to-door survey-based data proved to be a powerful data nutshell to distinguish groups of power consumers, allowing to derive insights to support DSOs, ESCOs, and retailers to design measures and instruments targeted to effective energy reduction (e.g. peak shaving, energy efficiency).}

However, the recent literature fails to present the mechanism for developing demand side management for energy flexibility. This article addresses the importance of developing an electric power consumption and renewable energy generation short-term forecasting model using a supervised machine learning approach. In this work, random forest and decision tree regression models are developed and used to forecast future electric power consumption and renewable energy generation. To validate the forecasting model performance using the MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2. This article proposes a day ahead dynamic pricing model for the demand response scheme. The day ahead dynamic pricing minimizes the peak time demand and end-user electricity tariff. A smart grid system must know the future short-term electric power consumption and renewable energy generation to enable the demand response scheme. The educational institute smart substation and weather station are integrated into the internet of things devices to enable real-time monitoring and control of the electric power consumption and renewable energy generation. The results show that the proposed DR scheme benefits end electricity users and smart grid operators.}

In many cities, worldwide public transit companies use smart card system to manage fare collection. Analysis of this acquisitive information provides a comprehensive insight of user's influence in the interactive public transit network. In this regard, analysis of temporal data, describing the time of entering to the public transit network is considered as the most substantial component of the data gathered from the smart cards. Classical distance-based techniques are not always suitable to analyze this time series data. A novel projection with intuitive visual map from higher dimension into a three-dimensional clock-like space is suggested to reveal the underlying temporal pattern of public transit users. This projection retains the temporal distance between any arbitrary pair of time-stamped data with meaningful visualization. Consequently, this information is fed into a hierarchical clustering algorithm as a method of data segmentation to discover the pattern of users.}

abstract = {The electrification of transport seems inevitable as part of global decarbonization efforts, but power system integration of electric vehicles faces numerous challenges, including a disproportionately high demand peak necessitating expensive infrastructure investments. Moreover, long-term developments in the power sector are characterized by great uncertainty, which increases the risk of making incorrect investment decisions leading to stranded assets. A cost-effective system integration of electrified transport would therefore not be possible without the implementation of smart charging concepts in combination with strategic network expansion planning that considers the impact of uncertainties. This paper proposes investment and operation models of Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V), Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), and Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) for the large-scale and long-term network expansion planning problem under multi-dimensional uncertainty. Additionally, it presents a multi-stage stochastic planning framework that can identify optimal investment strategies such that the expected system cost is minimized and the risk of stranded investments is reduced. The models are demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus test system and applied in a case study of the power system of Great Britain. The results highlight G2V, V2G and V2B as effective non-network alternatives to conventional reinforcement that could generate substantial economic savings and act as hedging instruments against uncertainty. For the case of Great Britain, the Option Values of G2V, V2G, and V2B could amount to £1.2bn, £10.8bn, and £10.1bn, respectively, over a 40-year horizon. Although the quantified values are system-specific, the paper presents key observations on the role of smart charging concepts as investment options that can be generalized for any low-carbon power system.}

These modes of governance are characterized by problems ranging from a lack of a transparent planning process, to ineffective collective decision-making. Rural migrants also play only a marginal role, or no role at all, in the regeneration practices, resulting in actual and potential social conflicts and inequality. This article contributes to current debates on social sustainability by presenting smart governance for the engagement of marginal migrants and other marginal social groups, and the establishment of an equitable relationship between the three key actors in the regeneration process. It firstly analyzes issues and problems of existing modes of governance in the regeneration of Chinese migrant communities. It then sheds light on the further exploration and application of new types of web-based Planning Support Systems, which can be developed based on SoftGIS methodology and easily used in social media on smartphones, in formulating smart governance. This article finally presents a framework on smart governance and social sustainability for migrant communities in China.}

The findings reveal that industrial intelligence enhances urban energy-environmental performance. Technological innovation, industrial agglomeration and labor upgrading constitute critical conduits for reaping such benefits. Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that industrial intelligence has more pronounced effects in non-resource-based cities, non-old industrial base cities, big cities and megacities. Our findings impart valuable insights to guide policymaking for expediting China's industrial intelligence advancement and facilitating sustainable urban industrial development.}

This paper is the second part of the companion paper on the integration of smart watch and geographic information system (GIS) to identify post-earthquake critical rescue area. In the first paper, we proposed a new system through an application installed on a wearable device to dissipate the information of trapped victims called the Earthquake Emergency Micro Response System (EEMRS) Hossain et al. (2020) [27]. In the current paper an analytical model is developed to evaluate the effectiveness of it in the search and rescue (SAR) operations. The information dissemination formulation is postulated through observations and interactions with experts. The process of local first responders' immediate post-earthquake activities from dispatch to extricating the trapped victims at the affected area is carefully calibrated with the firefighter activities recorded in the aftermath of Kobe earthquake. Evaluation using the developed analytical method imply that the increase in use of smart watches in earthquake prone areas can significantly increase the extrication efficiency of firefighters. In addition, this proposed model can be used by emergency managers to know the robustness of their post-earthquake initial situation assessment techniques.}
