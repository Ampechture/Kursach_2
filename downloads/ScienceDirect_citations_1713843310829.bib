It is important to ensure security and efficiency in smart health. However, existing smart health systems still have challenging issues, such as aggregate authentication, fine-grained access control and privacy protection. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing SSH, a Secure Smart Health system with privacy-aware aggregate authentication and access control in IoT. In SSH, privacy-aware aggregate authentication is enabled by an anonymous certificateless aggregate signature scheme, in which users' identity information is protected based on symmetric encryption mechanisms. In addition, privacy-aware access control is based on anonymous attribute-based encryption technologies. Our formal security proofs indicate that SSH achieves batch authentication and non-repudiation under the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Extensive experimental results and performance comparisons show that SSH is practical in terms of computation cost and communication overheads.}

abstract = {Graph databases are taking place in many different applications: smart city, smart cloud, smart education, etc. In most cases, the applications imply the creation of ontologies and the integration of a large set of knowledge to build a knowledge base as an RDF KB store, with ontologies, static data, historical data and real time data. Most of the RDF stores are endowed with inferential engines that materialize some knowledge as triples during indexing or querying. In these cases, deleting concepts may imply the removal and change of many triples, especially if the triples are those modeling the ontological part of the knowledge base, or are referred by many other concepts. For these solutions, the graph database versioning feature is not provided at level of the RDF stores tool, and it is quite complex and time consuming to be addressed as black box approach. In most cases the indexing is a time consuming process, and the rebuilding of the KB may imply manually edited long scripts that are error prone. Therefore, in order to solve these kinds of problems, this paper proposes a lifecycle methodology and a tool supporting versioning of indexes for RDF KB store. The solution proposed has been developed on the basis of a number of knowledge oriented projects as Sii-Mobility (smart city), RESOLUTE (smart city risk assessment), ICARO (smart cloud). Results are reported in terms of time saving and reliability.}

Three algorithms that calculate the variation in users’ mobility are assessed.

The results show that NEDC can significantly reduce carbon emissions by about 15.34%. The policy effects of NEDC are characterized by time lag and increasing intensification. NEDC has a stronger effect on reducing carbon emissions in western cities and non-resource-based cities. NEDC can reduce carbon emissions through industrial structure effect, environmental decentralization and information technology effect. NEDC has a synergistic emission reduction effect, which can reduce about 20.39% of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 18.70% of sulfur dioxide (SO2). NEDC has policy spillover effect, which can not only reduce the carbon emissions of pilot cities, but also reduce the carbon emissions of neighbouring cities. The space emission reduction effect of NEDC is better within 400 km. Finally, this paper puts forward policy recommendations to strengthen decentralized energy governance to reduce carbon emissions.}

A multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is presented for addressing the associated privacy, security, management, and scalability challenges. Each participant shares their encrypted data to the blockchain network and can transact information with other participants as long as both parties agree to the transaction rules issued by the owner of the data. Data ownership, transparency, auditability and access control are the core principles of the proposed blockchain for smart mobility data-market. In a case study of real-time mobility data sharing, we demonstrate the performance of BSMD on a 370 nodes blockchain running on heterogeneous and geographically-separated devices communicating on a physical network. We also demonstrate how BSMD ensures the cybersecurity and privacy of individual by safeguarding against spoofing and message interception attacks and providing information access management control.}

Speed, security and portability properties enable smart cards to have a widespread usage in various fields including telecommunication, transportation and the credit card industry. However, the development of smart card applications is a difficult task due to hardware and software constraints. The necessity of the knowledge of both a very low-level communication protocol and a specific hardware causes smart card software development to be a big challenge for the developers. Written codes tend to be error-prone and hard to debug because of the limited memory resources. Hence, in this study, we introduce a model driven architecture which aims to facilitate smart card software development by both providing an easy design of smart card systems and automatic generation of the required smart card software from the system models. Differentiating from the previous work, the study in here contributes to the field by both providing various smart card metamodels in different abstraction layers and defines model-to-model transformations between the instances of these metamodels in order to support the realization of the same system on different smart card platforms. Applicability of the proposed methodology is shown for rapid and efficient application development in two major smart card frameworks: Java Card and ZeitControl Basic Card. Lessons learned during the industrial usage of the architecture are also reported in the paper. Finally, we discuss how the components of the architecture can be integrated in order to provide a domain-specific language for smart card software.}

Measures to mitigate and adapt cities to climate change might lead to undesired outcomes regarding gender equality or, in contrast, may help to improve equality. Ideally, cities should prioritise actions that aim to reduce their carbon footprint but also help promote gender equality. The aim is to facilitate the inclusion of gender perspective in the 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 European Mission. We propose a Multicriteria Decision-Making Method to assess urban policies and relate them to climate and gender criteria. We describe urban decarbonisation policies with non-negative gender outcomes and compare their impact when using climate and gender criteria. The objective is to analyse how the prioritisation of actions varies from different perspectives: one taking into account the field of expertise of the different experts and the other taking into account the different typologies of criteria separately. A DEMATEL-ANP technique is used to determine how policies contribute to climate action and gender equality. Experts in different areas and city planning respond to the DEMATEL-ANP model by comparing and relating criteria and actions. The results show which policies have a significant potential to reduce cities’ carbon footprint and increase gender equality. Prioritisation of policies changes when only gender criteria or climate criteria are considered. Regarding the former, it can be concluded that gender criteria will contribute to closing the gender gap while having a widening impact on decarbonisation. Nevertheless, including gender criteria is not enough to avoid bias, and multidisciplinary teams must participate in the decision-making process.}

abstract = {Fish is the most perishable of fresh foods, but it is held in high regard for its flavor, taste and nutrition for the human body. Until now, most studies on monitoring the freshness of fish have used semiconducting metal oxide sensors that consume much power in sensing operation. To supply the operational sensing power and the power for wireless communication, any wireless sensor module needs a battery attached, and this entails extra effort for a regular battery change. Therefore, we developed a novel fish monitoring system in which no battery is needed for the sensing module. This study proposes a novel proximal fish freshness monitoring system. The novel smart sensing tag module has been developed as a self-powered device by using an additional energy harvesting circuit that operates at a frequency of 13.56MHz. The harvester can collect sufficient radio frequency (RF) energy from the reader by using RF energy coupling within a maximum distance of 30cm; then, the received power is stored in a single energy chip for supplying to the sensing circuit. The fish freshness is monitored by sensor modules for temperature and either hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or ammonia (NH3) gas concentration measurement in the fish packaging. The sensing module is designed using ultra-low-power sensors that consume less than ∼10mW, enabling us to extend the distance between the RF reader and the smart sensor tag for effective RF energy coupling and sensing data transmission. The results of freshness monitoring of a seafish package are classified into four grades to indicate the food quality: good, normal, caution, and bad. The proposed sensor tag can be used to predict the quality of packaged fish by accurate monitoring of temperature and the concentration of H2S or NH3 in range of −40 to 105°C, 0–200ppm, and 0–100ppm, respectively.}

A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model is developed to explain how the use of microgrid at a port can effectively enhance the port’s performance in four key activity domains: operations, environment, energy, safety and security under operation uncertainty. The proposed model consists of an investment master problem on the first stage and a multi-objective operation planning subproblem on the second stage. Benders decomposition is implemented for solving the two-stage stochastic model, and Lexicographic Goal Programming is applied to the subproblem to deal with multiple objectives. Simulation results, compared with the minimum cost planning approach, indicate that the proposed framework is capable of guaranteeing an improvement in productivity, sustainability, and reliability of port operations.}

This study introduces a population-weighted proximity index to analyze the supply, surplus, and deficits of UGS provision for residents, both inside and outside UGS access radii. We assessed spatiotemporal changes in UGS provision from 2012 to 2021 in Shanghai to identify areas lacking UGSs, planning irrationalities, and needs for new UGS construction. We calculated the priority locations for new UGSs, focusing on residents most in need yet situated outside UGS access radii. Based on these, we accordingly create detailed and specific UGS development proposals. The findings show that the UGS provision on proximity that residents actually obtained in Shanghai citywide has improved at the city, community, and neighborhood levels over the past 10 years. Shanghai has undergone a phase of increasing UGS construction, resulting in more residents, previously outside UGS access radii, now being within these areas. However, despite these developments, many residential locations within UGS access radii still face insufficient UGS provision. At the neighborhood level, large proximity UGS deficits, where residents are located out of an access radius, still need to be solved. At the city and community levels, large UGS deficits within access radii also need to be solved. The proximity deficits in most urgent need to be solved at any level are for residents located outside of a UGS access radius. We also find that many of the newly built UGSs, which were constructed to address the proximity deficits for residents located outside of an access radius at both the city and community levels, were not smartly or efficiently planned. In the future, more UGSs could be newly built at locations with optimal priorities according to the findings of this study to solve efficiently the proximity deficits for residents still located outside of a UGS access radius, and to improve UGS provision on proximity at all three levels.}

In this paper some of the possible factors are highlighted as those are responsible for the degradation of LoRa channel quality. Aslo an experimental study was undergone in the foliage medium (a line of five date palm trees) to investigate the LoRa physical layer performance utilizing different spread factors (SF7-SF12). The RSSI values were measured for the propagation through a line of trees and compared with the expected RSSI values.

abstract = {To design water distribution network infrastructure, water utilities formulate daily demand profiles and peaking factors. However, traditional methods of developing such profiles and peaking factors, necessary to carry out water distribution network modelling, are often founded on a number of assumptions on how top-down bulk water consumption is attributed to customer connections and outdated demand information that does not reflect present consumption trends; meaning infrastructure is often unnecessarily overdesigned. The recent advent of high resolution smart water meters allows for a new novel methodology for using the continuous ‘big data’ generated by these meter fleets to create evidence-based water demand curves suitable for use in network models. To demonstrate the application of the developed method, high resolution water consumption data from households fitted with smart water meters were collected from the South East Queensland and Hervey Bay regions in Australia. Average day (AD), peak day (PD) and mean day maximum month (MDMM) demand curves, often used in water supply network modelling, were developed from the herein created methodology using both individual end-use level and hourly demand patterns from the smart meters. The resulting modelled water demand patterns for AD, PD and MDMM had morning and evening peaks occurring earlier and lower main peaks (AD: 12%; PD: 20%; MDMM: 33%) than the currently used demand profiles of the regions’ water utility. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of widespread smart water metering systems for enhanced water distribution infrastructure planning and management as well as the benefits to customers.}

abstract = {Under the construction of smart grid, transmission grid investment is faced with many potential risks, and high flexibility of decision-making is asked. Based on technology readiness theory, stage financing issues for transmission grid investment are studied. Then transmission grid investment is divided into several stages, and in order to form an optimal investment scheme and find reasonable fund for each stage, a decision-making model for transmission grid investment based on technology readiness is established. The model is validated through three-stage transmission grid investment project in IEEE-24 bus system, to consider the optimal investment decision between transmission lines and TCSC devices.}

In order to fully utilize the potential power of these connected objects of IoT, trust existence among these objects is essential. Traditional security measures are not enough to provide the comprehensive security to this smart world. Trust is used to mitigate the risk of uncertainty while connecting nodes to the internet. Different trust models for IoT environment have been proposed. However, these have not completely mapped with the uncertain and dynamic environment of smart IoT. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of existing surveys on trust models of IoT. It provides classification of Trust Related Attacks (TRA) and comparison of existing trust models with respect to TRA and Function Requirements (FR) of IoT. The aim of this comparison is to summarize the FR of IoT which must be considered while designing Trust Management System (TMS). Furthermore, this survey categorizes and compares existing trust models with respect to their resiliency against TRA, including: attack on node, attack on service, and attack on communication path. The paper expands on current open issues and identifies possible future research directions to address them. Finally, a conceptual framework has been proposed which shows the minimum requirements to make a successful trust model for smart IoT environment. Precisely, this study will help the reader to understand the vulnerabilities in existing IoT trust models and will direct towards future work to propose new models which can cater all possible and highlighted threats.}

This paper proposes an Enterprise Operating System (EOS) to effectively handle the execution of enterprise models by integrating a diversity of functionalities. The goal of an EOS is to manage the resources (i.e. humans, applications, and machines) of an enterprise to fulfil its operations. The Sensing, Smart, and Sustainable Enterprise Reference Model (S3E-RM) is proposed to guide the implementation of the EOS. This reference model uses the viewpoints defined in the Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP), i.e. enterprise, information, computation, engineering, and technology viewpoints. The EOS presented has been successfully applied in more than 27 industry sectors, including government.}

Given the magnitude of the challenges faced by both the smart grid and ITS, the aim of this work is to identify the elements comprising a convergence platform capable of supporting future services for data traffic associated to smart grid operations as well as ITS-related commercial service applications and road traffic safety messaging. A seaport terminal scenario is used to present a convergence network platform incorporating WSN (wireless sensor network) theory. The results of the simulation of the proposed network confirms the suitability of WSN to be used in the transmission of data traffic associated to meter readings which is required for effective energy consumption and management policies in industrial environments comprising equipment with high energy demands.}

New methods including co-design, co-creation, citizen participation and user experience (UX) feedback foster inclusive cities.

Transdisciplinary approaches are needed more than ever to expand our scope of inclusion to all life forms, including the rights of animals and nature as stakeholders.

Japan also has one of the lowest rates (20 %) of renewable energy of OECD countries, and recently has decided to reactivate nuclear power plants. In contrast, cases of local circular economy initiatives are increasing in Japan. This suggests an opportunity for progress towards more ambitious circular economy goals. Circular Cities (CC) embrace the principles of the circular economy (CE) by managing resources to minimize waste, maximize efficiency, and promote sustainability. The idea of circular cities is taking hold in the country. This work assesses in a top-down approach CC from a general perspective considering the current state of the art, and then, its application to the Japanese scheme to be contrasted within three particular case studies. CC in Japan represents a holistic and sustainable approach that enhances well-being and the economy by using CE principles. It incorporates Japanese cultural attributes and the necessary stakeholders' involvement to maximize closed loops, reduce resource consumption, and establish a regenerative society. The paper recognizes current progress towards circularity in Japan's cities, towns, and villages, even though they may not call themselves “circular cities” per se. The paper proposes a definition for circular cities specifically for Japan. It analyses three case studies: Kamikatsu, Osaki, and Kitakyushu, urban areas with very different circumstances as examples of circular cities, with the final goal to provide recommendations to policymakers to help increase the circular cities phenomenon.}

The new era of revolution in information technology will rely on processing and analyzing big data that are gathered by tremendous numbers of intelligent sensors, which are disseminated in the surrounding regions. However, most of these devices suffer from restrictions on power resources and processing capabilities, which in turn will enforce stringent restrictions on the network operations. In view of this, the development of novel and efficient energy algorithms for IoT paradigm is a challenging issue bearing in mind that the performance of this state-of-the-art network paradigm cannot be handled effectively by the existing techniques or solutions that are utilized in wireless sensor networks. To meet the requirements of maximizing the IoT network lifetime, we address in this work the challenge of IoT networks as of embedding energy-constrained devices by proposing a novel protocol, namely, Life Time Maximizing Based on Analytical Hierarchal Process and Genetic Clustering (LiM-AHP-G-C) protocol. In particular, the proposed protocol presents a novel optimal clustering algorithm for un-rechargeable battery-powered IoT devices, an efficient IoT heads selection algorithm, a heuristic method for optimal hop selection, and a model for avoiding intra- and inter-cluster interferences for IoT networks. The simulation results show that our proposed protocol outperforms the other existing works in terms of network lifetime, resource utilization, and scalability metrics.}

One of the key improvements of smart sensor technologies in the healthcare monitoring system is the wearable sensor technology. Integrating of smart wearable sensors in healthcare has led to the development of smart applications such as smart healthcare and intelligent healthcare monitoring systems. Today, health informatics represent an important area to improve healthcare efficiency by optimizing the acquisition, storage, and the retrieval of crucial patient’s health information. In this context, there is a lot of excitement about the progress of machine learning techniques which play a crucial role in recognizing human activity. In this chapter, an intelligent smart healthcare system is presented to deliver pervasive human activity recognition (HAR) in an automated manner by using machine learning techniques in order to model and recognize activities of daily living in an accurate and efficient manner. Moreover, we focus on the dataset containing body motion and vital sign recordings from volunteers of diverse profiles while carrying out different physical activities for HAR purpose. In addition, this chapter shows how these approaches are used in two different datasets, a mobile phone and wearable body sensors, for robust and precise HAR. This study has shown that the identification of human activity based on sensor data is very challenging, especially with the existence of a variety of machine learning methods.

The in-home display allows the treatment group members to voluntarily alter their power use during “red alert” (critical peak) days. The smart thermostats also installed for the treatment group enable the utility to reduce AC usage of that group during red alert days by remotely turning up the temperature setting by 3 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) (i.e., a form of direct load control). We use hourly fixed effects models to examine peak time energy use changes in the summer of 2010. We find that treatment group members reduced their peak time energy use relative to the control group, which had no in-home displays or smart thermostats. Treatment group members who had the enabling technologies used, on average, 0.47 less kW, or 15% less energy, during peak hours on an average red alert day.}

Short-term load forecasting models enable prediction of future power consumption, thereby encouraging shifting of loads and optimizing the use of stochastic power sources and stored energy. To make the electric grid system smart and sustainable, two-way communication between the utility and consumers must be set up and the working equipment must respond digitally to the quickly changing electric demand. The proposed work exploits the power of embedded systems to design a low-cost solution for interconnecting electrical and electronic devices, controlled by the intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. This work primarily focuses on implementing standard regression and machine learning-based architectures for smart grid load analysis and forecasting. A state of the art ecosystem for a portable load forecasting device is proposed by means of low-cost, open-source hardware that is experimentally found to be functioning with a high degree of accuracy. Further, the performance of the classical and advanced machine learning models, emulated on the device, are analyzed on the basis of various parameters, including error percentage, execution time, CPU core temperatures, and resource utilization. Overall impressive performance is demonstrated by some specific machine learning models which are considered to be suitable for the proposed framework.}

abstract = {River-valley cities are susceptible to compound floods induced by intense rainfall and high riverine water level, especially where design standard of levees is low and overtopping-induced fluvial flood are very likely to run into urban area. However, the holistic impact of high riverine water level and intense rainfall on a river-valley city still needs to be assessed within a quantitative analyzing framework. In this study, a typical river-valley city named Yingde in Guangdong Province of China is selected as the study area. A framework combining multivariate statistical analysis and numerical hydrodynamic modeling is proposed to quantitatively assess the compound flood hazard in river valley cities. To be specific, a compound flood numerical model that can integrate rainfall and overtopping flow processes is first developed and validated based on historical observations. Then, the joint probability distribution of rainfall and riverine water level is established based on the copula function. After that, the compound flood scenarios corresponding to different joint return periods are simulated and compared. Considering only one factor may underestimate the probability of flooding occurrence. The compound flood severity in terms of both inundation area and depth for the study area is majorly dominated by intense rainfall, but the extra contribution from upstream water level cannot be ignored. An inundation amplification factor can be used to assess the amplification effect of high upstream water level on the flood hazard of the riparian area. For a site that is quite near the river, the inundation amplification factor can be drastically decreased as the levee crest elevation is heightened. Without the contribution from the fluvial floods, the rainfall-induced inundation could be several times smaller than the compound floods.}

Cognitive radio networks are apt communication solutions capable of offering reliable opportunistic data transmissions through spectrum reuse. Reliable opportunistic data transmissions ensure strategic decision making and to execute critical control operations for sustainable energy utilizations. Accurate spectrum sensing and efficient spectrum sharing are vital to aspects of reliable peak energy consumption data transmission. Cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed as a more reliable method for gaining accurate spectrum availability detection. Trustworthiness of the local decisions of cooperating users is vital for the accuracy of the final spectrum availability decision. However, measures which can assess the trustworthiness of cooperating users are given less attention. In this paper, we describe a novel multi-attribute trust based framework to facilitate reliable spectrum sensing and priority based spectrum access allocation to enhance delay sensitive data transmissions. We have evaluated our solutions using extensive simulation experiments. Furthermore, we comparatively analyzed the reliability of the proposed user selection method for known spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack behaviors to accurately identify the non-malicious users. As evidenced by the results proposed novel multi-attribute trust based transmission strategies offer greater reliability in ensuring timely availability of peak period energy utility data for SHEM.}

However, these resources impose more uncertainties on the power system in addition to the uncertainty of load demands. These uncertainties and correlations among them confront operation decisions with serious challenges. In this paper, a new multi-objective probabilistic approach is proposed for smart voltage control of wind-energy-integrated systems through tap adjustment of power transformers and voltage regulation of generators. The objectives include improving voltage stability margin, voltage profile improvement, and power loss reduction in the presence of wind and demand uncertainties. A data clustering algorithm is employed to handle the uncertainty of the random input variables, and a Cholesky decomposition method is used for modeling the correlation between them. The proposed multi-objective optimization is solved using NSGA-II. The power system has been modeled in DIgSILENT-Powerfactory linked with MATLAB, where the NSGA-II is programmed. The IEEE 14-bus system has been employed to evaluate the performance of the conducted approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in decreasing the losses, increasing the voltage stability margin, and improving the voltage profile of wind-energy-integrated power systems.}

Using advanced communication and computing capabilities, the Smart Grid offers a new avenue of controlling end-user assets, including small units such as home appliances. To enable such evolution, shifting from centralized to decentralized control strategies is required. Effective demand-side management (DSM) and demand response (DR) approaches hold the promise for efficient energy management in homes and neighborhood areas, by enabling the precise control of resources to reduce net demand. However, with such strategies, independently taken decisions can cause undesired effects such as rebound peaks, contingencies, and instabilities in the network. Therefore, the interactions between the energy management actions of multiple households is a challenging issue in the Smart Grid. This paper provides a review of the background of residential load modeling with DR and DSM approaches in a single household and concepts of coordinating mechanisms in a neighborhood area. The objective of this paper is to classify, via comparison, the various coordination structures and techniques from recent research. The results of recent research in the field reveal that the coordination of energy management in multiple households can benefit both the utility (i.e., the service provider) and the customer. The paper concludes with a discussion on the prevalent critical issues in this area.}

In both countries policies, programs, and initiatives have emerged to promote technological and social changes associated with SG, and different patterns of SG implementation and governance are apparent at local, regional, and national levels. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of SG media content in nationally-circulating newspapers in the U.S. and Canada to explore patterns of SG conversations in the two countries. Media reporting about SG provides a valuable lens that reflects public discourse and also contributes to setting the public agenda by shaping public opinion and framing key issues. Despite similarities in terms of policy, program design, and SG deployment strategies, several prominent differences between the two countries emerge in public conversations. Firstly, Canadian SG newspaper content focuses more on implementation and describing people's experiences with smart meters, while the U.S. content focuses more on commercial opportunities with more reference to private sector actors and various technological components beyond smart meters. Secondly, although media coverage in both countries frequently highlights technological and economic benefits of SG, positive SG framing is more frequent in the U.S. newspapers than in the Canadian ones. Negative SG portrayals, including cultural, political and health and safety risks, are more frequently mentioned in the Canadian newspapers. These differing SG framings could be due to national level cultural differences. In the U.S, considered to be more of an individualistic society, there is more emphasis on business opportunities, being entrepreneurial, and more private sector involvement in the electricity sector. By contrast, in Canada, public authorities, more prominent in the electricity market than in the U.S., play a key role in smart grid deployment. Furthermore, in Canada, considered to have more social support structures for individuals and communities, there was more emphasis on the experiences of people. This suggests that cultural differences at the national level be a further contextual lens helpful to policy makers and technology proponents as they embark upon energy system change initiatives.}

abstract = {An unplanned urban sprawl is a significant challenge for cities in developing nations. Such growth damages the environmental fabric (quality) of the city. The environmental parameters that are mainly affected due to urbanization need to be monitored for sustainable urban development. Hence, it becomes essential to adopt a sustainable framework for a thorough critical examination of environmental parameters that are altered due to urbanization as its consequence. Thus, this paper analyses the spatial-temporal changes that occurred in three vital environmental parameters: Land Surface Temperature (LST), Vegetation Cover (VC), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5), due to unplanned urbanization in the Bhopal city of Madhya Pradesh state in India. The study evaluates the relationship among these parameters. Then, an Environmental Quality Index (EQI) is quantified from 2000 to 2020 to analyse the environmental quality of the city. Further, a trend analysis for these parameters and the EQI is done. Based on the results of EQI, the city's environmental quality is classified. The findings show that in various parts of the city, LST and PM2.5 were found to be increased by 1–2 °C and 23–25 μg/m3, respectively. The severity analysis of the EQI revealed that environmental quality was found to be good to moderate in 2005 whereas, it deteriorated to poor and very poor levels by the year 2020. Overall results show that severe environmental degradation was significant in some specific locations in dense urbanization, heavy traffic areas, industrial zones, and major highways. The research reveals the environmental consequences of unplanned urbanization, offering valuable insights for policymakers and urban designers to improve the quality of urbanization and advance sustainable development. It also suggests strategies and policy interventions for managing industrial and vehicular pollutants and advocates the vital role of urban greening, which can aid in raising the quality of the urban environment.}

Likewise, a simplified system frequency response model is presented, in which the demand-side participation in providing ancillary services is considered.

A key enabler in the smart city paradigm is the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which facilitates automated real-time sensing, communication, and actuation, assisting in unmanned monitoring of physical phenomenon and supports intelligent decision making. Nevertheless, designing a smart and energy-efficient IoT network for sustainability and near-perfect device actuation is a major challenge. To address this, our preliminary work (Roy et al., 2019) proposed a gene regulatory network (GRN)-based distributed event sensing and data collection framework called bioSmartSense. It attempted to make sensing and reporting tasks energy-efficient through bio-inspired self-modulation of IoT device energy levels. In this paper we extend it, under the name bioSmartSense+, to conceive realistic sensing and reporting mechanisms by incorporating device heterogeneity, probabilistic sensing, and priority-based event reporting. For experimental study, we used both simulated and real data to evaluate energy and coverage-related performances. Experimental results establish the efficacy of our framework in terms of energy-efficiency and event reporting rate compared to a state-of-the-art data collection approach.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate flooding attack detection and prevention for smart meter networks. The default Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol is vulnerable to flooding attacks because intermediate meters forward packets blindly. To detect and prevent flooding attacks, we propose a new AODV-based routing protocol called FLOoding aWareness AODV (FLOW-AODV) considering both with and without Internet Protocol (IP) spoofing. If no IP spoofing exists, we modify the route request forwarding procedure by adding new features. The main idea is to enable one-hop neighboring meters to detect attackers by counting the received route requests from the same source. Specifically, when a meter receives a request, it first determines whether it is a one-hop neighbor to the source or not. If yes, the one-hop neighboring meter updates its request counter for every received request from that source. When the received requests exceed a predefined number (e.g., 2), it perceives the source as an attacker and just discards the following requests, so the flooding is avoided. In this way, the receiver can prevent flooding attacks when there is no IP spoofing from flooding attacker. If IP spoofing exists, the flooding attacker will hide its real IP address. In this case, we have extended our algorithm and included trustworthiness of each neighbor in the neighbor routing table. Extensive simulations are conducted in NS3 to evaluate the performance of FLOW-AODV. Results show that FLOW-AODV obtains considerably higher performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, and average delay compared with the default AODV routing protocol. In addition, the FLOW-AODV significantly improves network performance and eliminates congestion when multiple attackers are involved.}

Its qualitative analysis focuses on the regulatory setting, challenges and perspectives, and on the feasibility to ‘smartly regulate’ this issue. The analysis demonstrates that Mexico’s shale gas development is especially difficult to regulate due to its high complexity. Increasing environmental impacts, lack of regulatory and industry expertise and a novel regulatory setting with multiple regulators and levels of accountability increase the regulatory challenge. Innovative and complementary regulatory tools, best practice and specialised regulation are likely to lessen the environmental impacts associated with shale gas development and regulators have already made significant progress in this direction. The first competitive bidding for unconventional terrestrial resources was announced in March 2018 and is the tip of the iceberg of commercial production of Mexico´s vast shale gas resources. Nevertheless, the particular complexity of regulating shale gas development in Mexico, suggests that even if ‘smart regulation’ is possible and is properly implemented substantial adverse environmental impacts may still occur.}

Cities, states, utilities, countries, and regions are all developing a vision and a path toward a twenty-first-century grid—a smart grid. While these myriad efforts can sometimes seem unfocused, unstructured, slow, and less productive than desired, changes are already occurring. Consumers are beginning to understand and make small but important decisions to manage their energy use differently, based on timely and accurate information. Eventually consumers will embrace these changes the way they have in other markets, and they will demand solutions that go far beyond today.}

abstract = {Smart and ongoing commissioning (SOCx) of buildings can result in a significant reduction in the gap between design and operational performance. Ontologies play an important role in SOCx as they facilitate data readability and reasoning by machines. A better understanding of ontologies is required in order to develop and incorporate them in SOCx. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art research on building data ontologies since 2014 within the SOCx domain through sorting them based on building data types, general approaches, and applications. The data types of two main domains of building information modeling and building management system have been considered in the majority of existing ontologies. Three main applications are evident from a critical analysis of existing ontologies: (1) key performance indicator calculation, (2) building performance improvement, and (3) fault detection and diagnosis. The key gaps found in the literature review are a holistic ontology for SOCx and insight on how such approaches should be evaluated. Based on these findings, this study provides recommendations for future necessary research including: identification of SOCx-related data types, assessment of ontology performance, and creation of open-source approaches.}

In this paper, we address the problem of collaboration between logistics objects. This collaboration aims to effectively plan, implement, and control the flow of services and goods between a point of origin and a point of destination while ensuring their secure, optimized, and efficient distributions to consumers anytime, anywhere. To this end, we propose a multi-agent based solution where the architecture of each agent includes concurrent individual and collective Belief-Desire-Intension (BDI) structures to support and balance self and collaborative objectives. Our solution, which is adapted and applied to the context of smart logistics, puts a special focus on the important issue of logistics risk management.}

This paper uses the synthetic control method(SCM), propensity score matching difference-in-difference model(PSM-DID), spatial Durbin difference-in-difference model (SDM-DID) and other methods to explore the policy effect of energy-saving policy on the green innovation efficiency of Chinese cities based on the New Energy Demonstration City(NEDC) policy as a quasi-natural experiment. The paper has found that establishing NEDC can significantly improve the green innovation efficiency of pilot cities, and its positive impact continues to increase over time. The effect of energy-saving policy has regional heterogeneity, and NEDC can promote the improvement of urban green innovation efficiency more in eastern and central China. The results of PSM-DID further verify the robustness of the previous conclusion. The results of SDM-DID show that NEDC has a positive spatial spillover effect on the improvement of urban green innovation efficiency. NEDC policy can effectively promote the improvement of green innovation efficiency in neighboring cities of pilot cities. Mechanism analysis shows that NEDC affects urban green innovation efficiency by optimizing industrial structure, reducing resource dependence and gathering innovative elements. This paper enriches the research on the effect of urban energy-saving policies and provides policy references for improving urban green innovation capabilities.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) includes various technologies, including sensing devices, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), and Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS). Despite numerous advantages of IoT, security and privacy are important challenges. IoT infrastructures are frequently attacked by different invaders, including white hat hackers whose mission is to test the system's penetrability. Other attacks are orchestrated by adversaries that misuse system vulnerabilities to seize information for personal benefits. Hence, security is a key factor and fundamental requirement of IoT design. Thus, increased cyberattacks call for an appropriate strategic plan to ensure IoT security. Enhancing data security in IoT has proved to be a major concern, and one solution to mitigate this is to apply suitable encryption techniques when storing data in the IoT. An intruder will be able to control IoT devices without physical access if the network is not secure enough. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a security design based on Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) algorithm, and the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to boost the security of IoT-based smart irrigation systems. The proposed model applies the ABC algorithm to generate the private key for ECC. The results show that the optimal encoding and decoding times were 100 and 150 iterations, respectively. Moreover, compared to 3DES&ECC&SHA-256 and RC4&ECC&SHA-256, the total throughput of the proposed model was about 50.04% and 55.29% higher in encryption and 51.36% and 58.41% higher in decryption. The evaluation indicates a significant improvement (>50%) in the throughput rate. The performance results obtained indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of performance and security.}

Intelligent Parking Lots (IPL) can be utilized for smoothing renewable sources, thus reducing the need for large battery energy storage systems (BESS). However, the integration of intermittent RES with IPLs can be challenging. A proper energy management system (EMS) is need to optimize resource operations, reduce investment costs, and support higher penetrations of renewable energy. This paper presents a novel, heuristics-based EMS for an IPL coupled with wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, and expansion turbines, which avoids the need for BESS installation. Extensive simulation results for the case of the city of Isfahan show that the proposed EMS can smooth the output power of RES with a maximum variation of 5% during each 10-minute window. The method utilizes a small number of electric vehicles (EVs), and preserves the EVs battery lifetime by reducing the number of switching actions to an average of 0.2 for each EV, while satisfying the requested EV charge level.}

Finally, the institutional work theory has been used to read the results of the analysis concerning the three main institutional works identified by scholars: political, technical, and cultural work. The study has revealed eight different trends concerning sustainable cities research, involving topics such as urban development, public management, environmental issues, and cultural impact on citizens. Additionally, topic analysis has resulted in a strong connection with the SDG 11. Conclusions of the analysis include the realisation that the sustainable city is supported by the political work of local governments and by the contributions of either the cultural or the technical work of city institutional actors.}

In addition, a variety of applications (VoIP, messaging, video, etc.) with different requirements is putting more constraints in community networks such as delay, packet loss, and bandwidth. Due to its particular architecture, which is very dense and very dynamic, the traditional one-pair-node shortest path solution, which is currently used in metro or WAN networks, is no longer efficient in community networks. This paper presents an analytical framework for dynamically optimizing data flows in community network using Software-defined networking (SDN). We formulate a QoS-based routing optimization problem as a constrained shortest path problem, and then propose an optimized solution to determine minimal cost between all pairs of nodes in the network taking into account the different types of physical accesses and the network utilization patterns. Our experiments show the proposed solution improves resource utilization up to 90%, and outperforms the traditional shortest cost based algorithm with a gain that reaches 13% for the majority of criteria, with 83% for distance, 77% for bandwidth and 51% for packet loss.}

Water-smart, energy-smart, carbon-smart and knowledge-smart practices and technologies significantly contributed directly or indirectly to improve productivity, enhance resilience and reduce GHG emission. Cotton is one of the important cash crops of Pakistan. It is a climate sensitive crop and suffered by multiple shocks as climate change and market discrepancies during the last two decades. The present paper aimed to estimate and compare the resource use efficiency including technical, economic and water use efficiency of adopters of CSA and non-adopters in cotton production. The study was conducted along Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) irrigation system in Punjab, Pakistan. First-hand information was gathered through a well-structured and comprehensive questionnaire from 133 adopters of CSA and 65 farmers cultivating cotton with traditional methods. Input-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis technique was employed to investigate the technical, economic and water use efficiency, assuming variable return to scale. The Bootstrap Truncated Regression was used to identify the factors influencing the resource use efficiency. The results showed that the adopters of CSA were using inputs more efficiently. The analysis revealed that adopters have higher cotton yield from per m3 irrigation water than non-adopters. Adopters were found to be financially sound, having easy access to credit and fast adaptation behavior towards environmental changes, and therefore, economically better off as compared to non-adopters. Bootstrap Truncated Regression analysis revealed that easy access to credit, provision of extension services, awareness regarding CSA, availability of good quality groundwater and right of ownership of tubewell were significantly affecting resource use efficiency. The finding suggested certain policy implications for creating awareness and financial support for the cotton growers to expedite the adaptation of CSA practices and technologies in the cotton growing area. This can enhance resource use efficiency, net farm income and livelihood of rural masses.}

Blockchain technology can be leveraged in the healthcare domain to achieve the delicate balance between privacy and accessibility of electronic health records. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for secure, interoperable, and efficient access to medical records by patients, providers, and third parties, while preserving the privacy of patients’ sensitive information. Our framework, named Ancile, utilizes smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain for heightened access control and obfuscation of data, and employs advanced cryptographic techniques for further security. The goals of this paper are to analyze how Ancile would interact with the different needs of patients, providers, and third parties, and to understand how the framework could address longstanding privacy and security concerns in the healthcare industry.}

Henceforth, the present investigation utilizes geographically weighted regression (GWR) to examine the influence of urban expansion and population growth on air quality. The examination will use a decade of data on the variation in PM2.5 levels from 2010 to 2020 in eight Indian metropolitan cities.

A grazing trial was performed (2014 and 2015) in a randomized complete block design with two grazing management targets and four replicates. Treatments were traditional rotational stocking (RT), with pre- and post-grazing sward heights of 25 and 5 cm, respectively, and ‘Rotatinuous’ stocking (RN), with pre- and post-grazing sward heights of 18 and 11 cm, respectively. Castrated crossbred Texel and Polwarth lambs were used. Results indicated that diet cost per kg of dry matter (p = 0.001) and per hectare (p < 0.001) were lower for RN than for RT treatment. Final live weight (p = 0.022) and hot and cold carcass weight (p = 0.006) were greater for the RN treatment. All commercial cuts were greater for RN than for RT treatment. The RN treatment presented greater (p < 0.001) production of carcass, edible food and crude protein. Feed efficiency and feed cost conversion were better for RN than for RT treatment. CH4 intensity per kg of carcass, edible food and crude protein gain were 2.6, 2.7 and 2.1 times lower (p < 0.001) for RN. Moreover, CH4 yield was lower (p = 0.014) for RN than for RT treatment, with an average of 7.6 and 8.3% of the gross energy intake, respectively. We conclude that the ‘Rotatinuous’ stocking results in a greater carcass production, carcass quality and lower diet cost, and CH4 intensity and yield of grazing lambs. Adopting this grazing management strategy could enhance both lamb production and mitigation of CH4 intensity and yield in grazing ecosystems, which could be considered a good example of climate-smart livestock production.}

In order to provide an efficient connection among IIoT devices, CRNs enhance spectrum utilization by using licensed spectrum. However, the routing protocol in these networks is considered one of the main problems due to node mobility and time-variant channel selection. Specifically, the channel selection for routing protocol is indispensable in CRNs to provide an adequate adaptation to the Primary User (PU) activity and create a robust routing path. This study aims to construct a robust routing path by minimizing PU interference and routing delay to maximize throughput within the IIoT domain. Thus, a generic routing framework from a cross-layer perspective is investigated that intends to share the information resources by exploiting a recently proposed method, namely, Channel Availability Probability. Moreover, a novel cross-layer-oriented routing protocol is proposed by using a time-variant channel estimation technique. This protocol combines lower layer (Physical layer and Data Link layer) sensing that is derived from the channel estimation model. Also, it periodically updates and stores the routing table for optimal route decision-making. Moreover, in order to achieve higher throughput and lower delay, a new routing metric is presented. To evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, network simulations have been conducted and also compared to the widely used routing protocols, as a benchmark. The simulation results of different routing scenarios demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms the existing protocols in terms of the standard network performance metrics involving packet delivery ratio (with an improved margin of around 5–20% approximately) under varying numbers of PUs and cognitive users in Mobile Cognitive Radio Networks (MCRNs). Moreover, the cross-layer routing protocol successfully achieves high routing performance in finding a robust route, selecting the high channel stability, and reducing the probability of PU interference for continued communication.}

Considering that public resistance or blatant opposition could jeopardize the grid modernization in the whole country, this study focused on the responses of groups of citizens from the two French communities where the new meters were first installed: Château-Renault (rural) and Lyon (urban). This study used the method of reconvened focus groups to inform policymakers about the reasoning of citizens in this situation. The discussions and the material generated by the groups provided very concrete elements on how the participants tried to make sense of the meter device itself and the policy goals, in relation to their daily and social life. The exchanges between participants seemed to fit into three main dialogical pairs, or themata: collective vs. individual (daily life); private (my behaviour) vs. public spheres (others’ behaviours); and consumption: individualist vs. collectivist. The collective elaboration throughout the group sessions reinforced the empowerment of the groups and led to considering more collectively-oriented approaches in contrast to the prevailing individualistic lifestyles.}

A design theory is developed using interface modeling and discrete event simulation methodology. Interface modeling shows the types of in-transit services that are possible to introduce using smart goods. An empirically grounded simulation demonstrates how transporters can achieve incremental efficiency improvements through hybrid shipment control as customers adopt in-transit services. The results show how in-transit services offered to customers constitutes a platform on which transporters can implement hybrid shipment control, which can substantially reduce resource requirements and the carbon footprint of LTL transportation networks. The design theory articulates a strategy for simultaneously improving customer service and operating efficiency through the introduction of smart goods. The originality and value of the paper is the demonstration of how smart goods can simultaneously benefit transport-buying customers and transporters, thus showing how to overcome the bootstrapping problem of digital infrastructure creation and enabling the vision of a Physical Internet in transportation.}

Nonstructural elements consist of “smart” screen walls, anchored through stiff, steel connection details to the floor. Wind tunnel measurements of floor accelerations were derived from an aeroelastic model of the high-rise building, replicating the fundamental mode response characteristics of the prototype structure. The model's dynamical properties were inferred from a pilot experiment conducted on a shaking table; estimated natural frequencies and modal damping ratios were used to re-scale accelerations measured in wind tunnel. The model's dynamic properties, influenced by wind loads, were later reconstructed through the Random Decrement Technique (RDT). Ranges of acceptability for accelerations and lateral inter-story drift are provided and examined in the context of nonstructural element design.}

The nano platform (GC@MCS NPs) was composed of hypoxia-responsive hyaluronic acid-nitroimidazole (HA-NI) as shells, MnO2 NPs as oxygen modulators and reduction-responsive functionalized poly (l-glutamic acid) derivatives (γ-PFGA) as cores to deliver gambogic acid (GA) and Chlorine6 (Ce6). After endocytosis, the approximately 100 nm of GC@MCS NPs achieved hypoxia-responsive shell degradation and MnO2 release, followed by reduction-activated charge conversion to form positively charged cores. With the damage effect of superficial tumor cells by the partially released GA, GA&Ce6-loadedγ-PFGA penetrated deep inside through electronic interaction step by step. Upon irradiated with 638 nm of laser, widely permeated Ce6 was activated for enhanced PDT under the high oxygenation by MnO2 NPs. The generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in return facilitated the GA-induced paraptosis by clearing high level of GSH. As a result, this mutual promotion strategy contributed to 92.41% of 4T1 tumor inhibition rate, exhibiting outstanding advantages. Our GC@MCS NPs provided a smart combination of chemo-photodynamic therapy and focused on addressing the tumor hypoxia and low penetration issues.}

The proposed system has a layered architecture that includes a smart grid, a data collection layer, an analytics bench, and a web-based portal. A smart metering infrastructure was installed in a residential building to conduct an experiment for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, a novel hybrid nature-inspired metaheuristic forecast system and a dynamic optimization algorithm are designed behind the analytics bench for achieving accurate prediction and optimization of future energy consumption. The main contribution of this study is that an innovative framework for the energy-saving decision process is presented; the framework can serve as a basis for the future development of a full-scale smart decision support system (SDSS). Through the identification of consumer usage patterns, the SDSS is expected to enhance energy use efficiency and improve the accuracy of future energy demand estimates.

The site selected is favourable for electricity generation from PV systems with an average global solar radiation of 5.82 kWh/m2day. Solar energy changes periodically with annual and daily variations and is not steady due to seasonal changes. The step-by-step performance assessment and the annual performance of the 100-kW solar PV system, which was instituted in 2019, with the forecasted parameters, are presented in this paper. Therefore, the assessment analysis is carried out in four phases: feasibility assessment, Energy yield assessment, Life cycle assessment, and Power quality assessment. To improve the solar PV output and efficiency, considering the solar irradiation, temperature, wind velocity, etc., PV yield is measured to evaluate the PV system's energy metrics. This paper also considers the carbon credits earned, solar power generated in the location, and the payback period. The power quality assessment is carried out in this paper to test the PV plant's compliance with effective grid integration.}

In addition, the effect of neutron irradiation on the glucose response of these hydrogels is also of interest, because the hydrogels could be used with minor modification to deliver boron to tumors during boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). We show that the glucose response of the smart hydrogels is unaffected by exposure to neutrons in the dose range typical for BNCT. The effect of gamma rays on the glucose response depends on the method used to cure the smart hydrogel. If the hydrogel is cured with a thermal free-radical-initiator, then the hydrogel can be sterilized by gamma irradiation with no adverse effects upon the glucose response. However, if the hydrogel is cured with a UV-initiated free radical initiator, then the glucose response decreases in magnitude with increase in the gamma radiation dose.}

To address the challenges of real-time sensing, power supply, and wireless signal transmission in current wireless sensors, a self-powered wireless sensing e-sticker (SWISE) based on the triboelectric-discharge effect has been proposed. However, the previously designed SWISE can only detect the unquantifiable signal of its own, which limited its applications. Herein, through studies about electromagnetic (EM) wave characteristics, we couple commercial sensors of different mechanics with EM wave generated by the triboelectric-discharge effect to realize a general self-powered wireless sensing solution for various physical signals. In addition, the integrated device is designed to combine with multiple sensors, with the characteristics of being thin and flexible. Based on this solution, a self-powered wireless temperature and pressure sensing system is demonstrated, with an error rate down to 0.18 %, and a multi-point sensing array was also realized for broad potential applications. This work proposes a self-powered wireless sensing platform that is compatible with various commercial sensors with different physical signals, which promises great potential for self-powered wireless sensing in the smart city and Internet of Things, such as robotic dynamic sensing, infrastructure monitoring, human-machine interface, etc.}

abstract = {Connections of distributed generation (DG) units based on the use of photovoltaic cells are highly increasing in low voltage distribution grids. In that way, one of the major problems met by the Distribution System Operators (DSOs) comes from overvoltage in the neighbourhood of dispersed units. Consequently, it is important for them to have an analysis tool that computes statistical voltage profiles and allows to assess maximal penetration rates of photovoltaic generation (PV) on low voltage (LV) distribution feeders. In previous studies, it has been shown that such a tool could be obtained by using a Probabilistic Load Flow based on analytical techniques or Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, given its simplicity of implementation, a pseudo-chronological Monte Carlo simulation is used and the statistical behaviour of prosumers (consumers with PV units) is directly based on smart meters measurements. Thanks to this tool, and using collected measurements from smart meters that are expected to be massively deployed in the future, it will be possible for the DSO to directly assess voltage profiles at all the nodes of the LV grid. Moreover, in the context of alleviating the impact of photovoltaic generation on the recorded voltage profiles, smart meters data will also be used in order to not only quantify the influence of reactive power flows on the collected results but also to estimate the auto-consumption potential over some critical nodes of the grid.}

Urban areas face multiple demands on sparse space whilst various stakeholders similarly aim to promote greening efforts. In this context, authorities need to balance various policy objectives with demands from diverse urban stakeholders. Part of this challenge is the question how generalized data-driven green space planning approaches can be connected to local, contextualized understandings, practices and values related to green space. In this paper, we present a participative application of GIS that contributes to bridging the gap between data-driven and citizen-centred approaches in urban greening. Through an empirical study in Amsterdam, we show how this can link local priorities with larger-scale policy frameworks through deliberative and data-driven co-creation. In our case study, local stakeholders and researchers jointly identified criteria for greening, translated these into indicators and eventually identified potential locations for small-scale greening. Site visits by local experts helped to validate the model results and translate this into concrete plans for greening several locations. Our approach promoted a dialogue between stakeholders, linking spatial data with practical experiences and aligning local priorities with policy programmes. Combining various knowledges from involved stakeholders also contributed to the quality of analysis and validation of modelling results. By increasing transparency and inclusiveness of planning, it also contributed to acceptance of process outcomes and empowering local stakeholders. With increasing urgencies for environmental measures in many cities, we emphasize the potential of transdisciplinary GIS-approaches to navigate different interests and integrate various types of valuable knowledge. We suggest that similar approaches may be applied to other environmental challenges that have a strong spatial character.}

We examine the role of transport infrastructure in gender-gap in labor force participation and its variations by gender-norms across communities. Using India Human Development Survey and city-level data on transport infrastructure, the causal effects of differential employment status of women and men are related to size and quality of transport in twelve Indian cities. Interaction effects are explored to understand varying impacts of transport on employment by gender-context in communities. We find that an improvement in the size and quality of transportation infrastructure improves women’s labor market participation more than that of men. In gender egalitarian communities, stronger positive effect of transport on female labor and reduction of gender gap in employment. Along with generation of new job opportunities suitable for women, it is important to encourage a gender-friendly institutional and social fabric to allow women to connect to new jobs. Using a novel data, the paper highlights the importance of ostensibly gender-neutral development policies for shaping gender inequalities in outcomes.}

abstract = {Using poly-generation schemes based on energy hub (EH) concepts is one of the new ways to efficiently supply energy (electrical/thermal/cooling/water) demanded by smart buildings equipped with building energy management system (BEMS). Regarding severe uncertainties pertaining to renewable generation and demands, BEMS is faced with challenges to optimally operate EH during day-ahead. The present study proposes a stochastic day-ahead optimization model for BEMS to minimize the operation costs and emissions under a number of techno-economic constraints considering extreme uncertainties related to generations, demands, and prices. The proposed grid-connected EH includes combined cooling, heat, power (CCHP) system as dispatchable generation, and wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) as non-dispatchable generations. To enhance the reliability of energy and water supply, two energy storage systems (ESSs), namely battery energy storage (BESS) and thermal energy storage systems (TESS) and one water storage tank (WST) have been installed in EH. Moreover, to improve flexibility of the proposed EH, it utilizes a seawater desalination (SWD) with reverse osmosis (RO) technology as an active load and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) as a new technology for generating electrical power by means of thermal power. Also, it considers a demand response program as time of use (TOU) to enhance the flexibility of the operation. The proposed stochastic model is solved by a two-stage algorithm. The first stage formulates the uncertainties of the demands and renewable generations by two-point estimate method (TPEM) while the second stage models the extreme uncertainty of the gas price by information gap decision theory (IGDT) method as well as economically dispatching the generations and storages with risk-averse and risk-seeker strategies. The efficacy of the proposed model is evaluated on a smart commercial building in Gheshm located not far away from the southern coast of Iran in Persian Gulf. It is seen that the total cost of the EH equipped with a WST reduced by 16.55% compared to the one without a WST.}

abstract = {Medullated fibres, due to their higher resistance to bending and pressure, constitute a problem for the textile industry. Thus, having practical instruments to identify them is essential. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop and validate a novel, swift, automatic system (referred to as S-Fiber Med) for medullation and diameter assessment of animal fibres based on artificial intelligence. The medullation of 88 samples of alpaca, llama and mohair fibres (41, 43 and 4, respectively) was evaluated. Additionally, 269 samples of alpacas were considered for average fibre diameter (AFD) and the results were compared with the Portable Fiber Tester (PFT) and Optical Fibre Diameter Analyser (OFDA) methods (72 and 197 samples, respectively). The preparation of each sample to be analysed followed the procedure described in IWTO-8-2011. Version 5 of “You Only Look Once” and DenseNet models were used to recognise the type of medullation and diameter of the fibres, respectively. Within each image (n = 661 for alpaca), all fibres were labelled (as Non-Medullated, Fragmented Medulla, Uncontinuous Medulla, Continuous Medulla and Strongly Medullated) using the LabelImg tool. Data augmentation technique was applied to obtain 3 966 images. Such data set was divided into 3 576 and 390 images for training and test data, respectively. For mohair samples (n = 321), a similar process was carried out. The data to train the model used to infer the diameter contained 16 446 fibres labelled with his respective AFD. A complementary hardware composed of three subsystems (mechanical, electronic, and optical) was developed for evaluation purposes. T-test, Pearson and Concordance correlation, Bland-Altman plot and linear regression analyses were used to validate and compare the S-Fiber Med with other methods. Results indicate that there was no significant difference between medullation percentage obtained with the projection microscope and the S-Fiber Med. The Pearson and Concordance correlation analysis shows a strong, high and significant relationship (P-value < 0.001). The AFDs of alpaca and llama fibre samples obtained with the two methods are very similar, because no significant difference was found at the t-test (P-value > 0.172), and they have a strong, high and significant relationship between them, given the high Pearson correlation value (r ≥ 0.96 with P-value < 0.001), high Concordance coefficient and bias correction factor. Similar results were found when PFT and OFDA100 were compared with S-Fiber Med. As a conclusion, this new system provides precise, accurate measurements of medullation and AFD in an expeditious fashion (40 seconds/sample).}

abstract = {The focus of this study is on locating surface and sub-surface defects that occur in rail tracks using Rayleigh waves that were emitted and sensed by a fully non-contact laser transduction system. As the quality of received signals varies with respect to the rail surface characteristics, spotting the reflection from a defect can be extremely challenging. These signals are in general contaminated with noise and have low repeatability that could hinder the proper identification of the defect signal. In view of this, an innovative signal processing technique called a self-adaptive-smart algorithm (SASA) was designed and developed. In SASA, the incident wave that is the first coming wave-packet is taken as a mother wavelet. A library of possible mother wavelets was designed based on the experimental data. As the incident wave for each sensing point varies because of the physical condition of the rail surface and the laser excitation, the algorithm automatically picks the mother wavelet from the library that generates the largest absolute cross-correlation with the incident wave. SASA is found to be able to suppress the unwanted wave packets from the overall signal leaving behind only the incident wave for a healthy specimen, and the incident wave and its reflection from the defect for a damaged specimen. The functioning of the algorithm was successfully tested by carrying out extensive experiments on a real rail track in the presence of different types of surface and sub-surface defects on its head and web. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of using SASA in localizing defects in rails with a marginal error. Notably, the proposed method has benefits such as being self-adaptive, can help suppress high levels of noise, bring the peak of defect reflected wave in the center, and distinguish between a healthy and damaged sample.}

To harvest more pulsed mechanical energy and improve the quality of electrical output for immediate utilization, we propose a bidirectional energy harvesting floor with a sustained-release regulation mechanism (BEHF-SRM). The pulse and irregular excitation on the road can be converted into continuous unidirectional rotation of the working wheel and the reset motion of the system can also drive the work wheel unidirectional rotation, and the rotational kinetic energy is slowly converted into electrical energy. A dynamic model is established and validated experimentally. One person can easily light up 20 LED bulbs (rated power 1 W) by stepping on the prototype of BEHF-SRM. The prototype can continue to provide electricity for about 7 s after stepping on it. Self-powered automated pedestrian crosswalk warnings that can improve pedestrian safety was demonstrated based on BEHF-SRM. The results show that the proposed harvester has the potential to provide a sustainable, convenient, green, and zero carbon energy supply to smart transport and smart cities.}

On the other side, evaluation of ambient services is often a laborious task. This work presents an approach that simplifies the evaluation by making use of two frameworks from robotics to perform tests in simulated smart environments. A method based on the language as action principle is used to extract realistic behavior of people living in real-world smart environments. Using this data, many different scenarios with varying configurations (different floor layouts, numbers and types of sensors, different number of people and pets) can easily be simulated and the performance of the ambient services evaluated.}

In this research, we seek to describe and discover how, why and to what extent MAR apps contribute to smart retail settings by creating additional value to customers as well as benefiting retailers. In particular, by adopting a retail customer experience perspective on value creation, analysing the content of MAR shopping apps currently available, and conducting large-scale surveys on United States smartphone users representing early technology adopters, we assess level of use, experiential benefits offered, and retail consequences. Our findings suggest that take-up is set to go mainstream as user satisfaction is relatively high and their use provides systematic experiential benefits along with advantages to retailers. Despite some drawbacks, their use is positively associated with multiple retail consequences. MAR apps are seen as changing consumer behaviour and are associated with increasingly high user valuations of retailers offering them. Implications for more effective use to enable smart retail settings are discussed.}

The bike-sharing platform provides users with systematic services: members refer to annual bike-sharing service subscribers and casual users refer to holders of a day pass or single ride ticket. Even though casual users account for a large share of ridership and revenue at bike-share systems in New York City (NYC), very little is known about the characteristics and preferences of casual users and how they compare to members. Based on the open-docked bike-sharing dataset from Citi Bike, we analyze the bike usage patterns of members and casual users in NYC, and how these patterns change in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic on a typical day level. We find that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced members' bike trip counts on weekdays; bike travel time increases for members during the pandemic and decreases for casual users after the pandemic. To make a profound study concerning spatial heterogeneities, we employ Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster the spatiotemporal changes of the station-level bike usage and obtain four clusters for each user type. Combined with the Points of Interest (POI) information, we find that member-related cluster with commuting POIs is significantly affected by the pandemic, while leisure trips are the most severely affected for casual users. Compared with the central area, peripheral clusters with residential and religious POIs are less affected by the pandemic. According to our findings, new operational strategies such as flexible subscriptions can be developed to attract more users, maintain their stickiness, and improve the bike-sharing level of services.}

In our design, SRTs are connected via a network that enables monitoring data to be collected and pump-control commands to be issued to individual tanks. These connected tanks form part of a rainwater grid system (RGS). It will also be possible to monitor rainfall amount using the RGS since it functions as a high-resolution rain gauge. This is important because Heavy rainfall can cause serious attenuation of the reflectivity of rain cells monitored by X-band multi-parameter (MP) weather radar networks. A prototype SRT system has been installed in a gravel-filled 110 tons underground tank in the Oginoura Garden Suburb, which is a maisonette-type housing complex, where its functions are now being tested. Initial results indicate that measuring rainfall using the gravel-filled underground tank is not suitable due to spikes in the water level after a heavy rainfall event has occurred. So, we decide to install a void type of 5.6 tons rainwater tank to the personal house for Moriyama. It will be installed a sensors at the first quarter of 2016. For pre-discharge of rainwater before heavy rainfall, diagnosis for heavy rainfall by using SOM is installed. This diagnosis is installed on “Internet Cloud” and possible to send a order to SRTs with pumps. The accuracy of diagnosis for heavy rainfall is investigated, but it is only for Aug. 2014, it should be more investigation.}

This study aims to identify the main commuting centers and zones by using cellular data with Nanjing City as the example. This study analyzes the operational features of the internal spatial structures of the city from two dimensions by merging multi-source data, namely, commuting centers and zones, thus achieving an understanding of the existing problems with the urban spatial structures and their internal causes. Results showed that the commuting zones of Nanjing are distributed in a pattern of “multiple commuting centers”, with Xinjiekou–Hunan Road and Hongwu Road–Chaotiangong–Shuangtang as the core, Mochou Lake as the main commuting area, and Dongshan and Jiangpu as the secondary commuting zones. Significant differences and similarities are discovered in our comparisons along the two dimensions of commuting zones and centers in terms of spatial structural factors, such as land use, transportation, and commuting in the city. The similarity is shown as a common declining trend in the values of all our indicators with the increase in the distance of commuting zones from the city center. However, the differences are significant in terms of the clustering features of the various parameters concerning commuting centers and zones. Specifically, four clustering patterns are discovered, namely, “monocentric clustering”, “circular monocentric clustering”, “polycentric clustering”, and “sparsely dotted distribution”. This study sheds light on the existing problems with the city's spatial structure and proposes some overall suggestions toward urban spatial structure improvement on the basis of these findings.}

Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility was performed for 235 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) isolates from 18 Taiwanese hospitals. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of eravacycline, omadacycline, lipoglycopeptides, and other comparator antibiotics were determined using the broth microdilution method. Nearly all isolates of VREfm were not susceptible to teicoplanin, dalbavancin, and telavancin, with susceptibility rates of 0.5%, 1.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Tigecycline and eravacycline were active against 93.2% and 89.7% of the VREfm isolates, respectively. Moreover, the susceptibility rates of quinupristin/dalfopristin, tedizolid, and linezolid were 59.1%, 84.2%, and 77.4%, respectively. Additionally, 94% of the VREfm isolates were classified as susceptible to daptomycin, and the MICs of omadacycline required to inhibit VREfm growth by 50% and 90% were 0.12 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. Susceptibility rates of VREfm isolates to synthetic tetracyclines and daptomycin were slightly lower and to oxazolidinone-class antibiotics were much lower in Taiwan than those in other parts of the world. Continuous monitoring of VREfm resistance to novel antibiotics, including synthetic tetracyclines, oxazolidinone-class antibiotics, and daptomycin, is needed in Taiwan.}
