abstract = {Concrete is the second most globally consumed material in the world after water and the most used construction material. Yet, its benefits are masked with many ecological setbacks through the way it is produced, transported, or used. Concrete occurs in a brittle state characterized by low tensile strength, weak resistance to crack formation, and strain properties. Recent studies have focused on improving concrete properties by integrating it with innovative solutions such as fibers, admixtures, and supplementary cementitious components. The infrastructure of modern structures demands components with greater durability, and higher mechanical strength. This solution can only be achieved through the addition of nanomaterials to cement-based products, thus, enhancing their mechanical features. Examples of nanomaterials include carbon nanotubes (CNTs), nano-ferric oxide (nano - Fe2O3), and graphene oxide. Nanomaterials can be added to cement with the addition of other reinforcements such as glass, steel fibers, fly ash and rice hull powder. With optimum dosages, the compressive, tensile, and flexural strength of cement-based materials, workability and water absorption are improved. The use of nanomaterials enhances the performance and life cycle of concrete structures. This study looks at some of the recent concrete improvisations, analyzing them on the spectrum of technical performance, durability, ecological sustainability, and economic benefits.}

The model is usually estimated using travel survey data; however, little is known about how to use smart card data (SCD) for this purpose in a public transport network. Our study extracted trip information from SCD to model location choice of after-work activities. We newly defined the metrics of travel impedance in this case. Moreover, since socio-demographic information is missing in such anonymous data, we used observable proxy indicators, including commuting distance and the characteristics of one's home and workplace stations, to capture some interpersonal heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity is expected to distinguish the population and better explain the difference of their location choice behaviour. The approach was applied to metro travellers in the city of Shanghai, China. As a result, the model performs well in explaining the choices. Our new metrics of travel impedance to access an after-work activity result in a better model fit than the existing metrics and add additional interpretability to the results. Moreover, the proxy variables distinguishing the population seem to influence the choice behaviour and thus improve the model performance.}

It is done by means of the friction pendulum isolators (FPS) combined with smart magnetorheological dampers (MR), the latter calibrated through the use of a Seismic Early Warning System (SEWS). Hybrid systems, widely investigated by researchers in last years, generally represent a suitable solution in case of base-isolated bridges. As a matter of facts, the introduction of an isolation system allows to reduce shear and bending moment in piers, but may increase decks’ relative displacements. A possible effective strategy for limiting this undesired effect may be the adoption of a dissipative system. Herein the passive smart use of MR devices is proposed. The MR dampers are smart in the sense that their mechanical properties can be tuned almost in real time, once before the earthquake strikes the site. A properly designed control algorithm modifies dampers' characteristics according to the intensity of the seismic event is going to occur, as forecasted by the SEWS. This retrofit strategy makes the structure someway adaptive, leading to a significant enhancement of the seismic performance against earthquakes even very different one each other. The case study is an existing reinforced concrete highway bridge built in the 70’s, located in the city of Naples, southern Italy.}

We then developed a scalable algorithm to recognize temporal motifs from daily trip sub-sequences extracted from two smart card datasets. Our method shows its benefits in uncovering the potential correlation between varying topologies of trip combinations and specific activity chains. Commuting, different types of transfer, and other travel behaviors have been identified. Besides, varying travel-activity chains like “Home→Work→Post-work activity (for dining or shopping)→Back home” and the corresponding travel motifs have been distinguished by incorporating the land use information in the GIS data. The analysis results contribute to our understanding of transit riders’ travel behavior. We also present application examples of the travel motif to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach. Our methodology can be adapted to travel pattern analysis using different data sources and lay the foundation for other travel-pattern related studies.}

abstract = {The current advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices is revolutionizing conventional farming operations into precision agriculture. The agricultural UAVs combined with IoT use an open channel i.e., the Internet to assist cultivators with data collection, processing, monitoring, and making correct decisions on the farm. However, the use of the Internet opens up a wide range of challenges such as security (e.g., performing cyber-attacks), risk of data privacy (e.g., data poisoning and inference attacks), etc. The usage of current conventional centralized security measures has limitations in terms of a single point of failure, verifiability, traceability, and scalability. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we propose a Secured Privacy-Preserving Framework (SP2F) for smart agricultural UAVs. The proposed SP2F framework has two main engines, a two-level privacy engine, and a deep learning-based anomaly detection engine. In the two-level privacy engine, a blockchain, and smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) is designed for data authentication, and to mitigate data poisoning attacks. A Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) is applied for transforming data into a new encoded format for preventing inference attacks. In the anomaly detection engine, a Stacked Long-Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) is used to train and evaluate the results of the proposed two-level privacy engine using two publicly accessible IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and IoT Botnet. Finally, based on thorough analysis, and comparison, we identify that the SP2F framework outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both non-blockchain and blockchain frameworks.}

Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are utilized as platforms for ITS applications. In VANETs, vehicles collect relevant information from sensors and exchange information about road conditions and traffic status with each other and with roadside units (RSUs). Roadside units facilitate reliable communication among the vehicles and perform real-time processing for the sensed data before sending to the cloud. Although cloud computing offers high performance computational and storage resources, it does not conform to the real-time nature of the ITS applications and the massive amount of data exchange and generation rate due to its centralized nature and high communication latency. In this paper we propose a cost-effective strategy to solve the configuration and localization problem of fog-based RSU deployment in VANETs. The proposed strategy is able to assign the computational capacity of each fog node based on the amount of computational demand inside its coverage region. The problem is formulated as a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problem. Our proposed strategy is more efficient than other strategies in terms of the total deployment cost and the overall satisfied computational demand.}

The development of new solutions with integrated energy control is especially attractive for these installations as they present the least limitations in terms of space and adaptation to new technologies. This work describes a solution that was developed and implemented in a farm located in central Portugal. The results show that 83.2% reduction in energy from the grid can be achieved, with 5527 kg CO2 savings, and the return on investment (of € 32,434) is about 8 years.

The sandwich plate consists of a carbon nanotube reinforced nanocomposite (CNTRC) core integrated with two magneto-electro-elastic face sheets. For core layer, three types of carbon nanotube (CNT) distribution such as FG-O, FG-V, FG-X are considered while the volume fraction of BaTiO3  −  CoFe2O4 in each face sheet is chosen to be 0.5. It is assumed that the smart sandwich plate is rested on Pasternak-type elastic foundations and subjected to the combination of external pressure, thermal, electric and magnetic loads. The coupled constitutive relations are derived based on the Hamilton's principle in which the kinematic nonlinearity is defined using Reddy's higher order shear deformation theory. The analytical solutions which satisfy the boundary conditions are assumed to have the trigonometric form. The Galerkin method is used to obtain the closed form expressions of natural frequency, the relation between the frequency ratio and dimensionless amplitude and the dynamic response of the sandwich plate. The numerical results are conducted to illustrate the effect of geometrical parameters, CNT volume fraction, temperature and moisture increment, electric and magnetic potentials on the nonlinear vibration of smart sandwich plate. The reliability of present results is evaluated by comparing with the previous results based on different approach.}

abstract = {A significant part of the economies of several nations throughout the world, including India, where agriculture accounts for 16% of the total economy. Due to their dynamic and turbulent natures, climate prediction in this region is the most difficult because statistical methodologies can't provide accurate predictions. Typically, weather forecasts were made using extraordinarily complex physics techniques that took into account various atmospheric conditions over a long time. These circumstances were usually unstable as a result of weather system disturbances, which led to the development of techniques for making unreliable predictions. In this study, an Automated Climate Prediction for Smart Agriculture is developed utilizing a Pelican Optimization-based Hybrid Deep Belief Network (ACP-POHDBN). The purpose of the ACP-POHDBN approach is to identify the appropriate meteorological conditions. The acp-POHDBN method uses the test data to calculate the appropriate weather conditions. Pre-processing, prediction, and hyperparameter tuning are the three key steps that make up the proposed ACP-POHDBN approach. The min-max normalization procedure is the primary procedure used by the ACP-POHDBN model to convert the meteorological data into a standard format. In addition to pre-processing data, the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model is used to forecast weather conditions. Finally, the DBN method's hyperparameters (epoch, batch size, and learning rate) may be properly tuned using the POA-based hyperparameter tuning technique. The development of a Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA)-based hyperparameter optimizer for the process of predicting the climate demonstrates the originality of the study. The proposed algorithm over other recent approaches with maximum accuracy of 95.03%, sensitivity of 95.03%, specificity of 95.03%, and F-score of 95.03%.}

Whenever SOs interact for services, a feedback is sent to an Edge server to calculate their reputation scores. In this way, the reputation systems is moved from the cloud to the edge servers, but available on the cloud if a SO will change edge domain. To this aim, we designed a distributed Trusted Object Framework (TOF) where heterogeneous OSs host and exploit the assistance of associated software agents and verified its performance in a simulated scenario which confirmed the potential advantages of TOF.}

abstract = {Smart Specialization Strategies have been used to implement European Union Cohesion Policy in recent years, aiming to achieve economic, social and territorial development by reducing disparities between regions. The European Union often declares an alignment between Cohesion Policy, Smart Specialization Strategies and the United Nations Agenda 2030. However, and despite the recurrent Sustainable Development discourse present in the European political agenda, it is not evident that Smart Specialization Strategies integrate Sustainable Development goals and practices. Hence, this paper aims to explore and discuss the degree of embeddedness of the Sustainable Development discourse in the Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialization, using the Portuguese Centro Region as an exploratory study. In this research a content analysis of the Centro Region Smart Specialization Strategy was used for data collection and analysis, framed by the 17 goals of Agenda 2030 and their targets. Results show a good embeddedness of the overall goals of Agenda 2030, but a lower integration of the targets, suggesting that this strategy needs to be revisited to further integrate Agenda 2030. Moreover, the Centro Smart Specialization Strategy has a strong alignment with the goals related with economic and environmental issues, almost disregarding social aspects. These findings are amplified by the fact that this strategy is mainly being implemented through projects financed under the economy pillar. Finally, there is evidence about the need of developing regional innovation policies towards sustainable development from the regional to the national level. Overall, it is critical to enlarge the debate on how Smart Specialization Strategies can be an effective engine for a new development trajectory for European regions assuming the Agenda 2030 as a framework for the necessary change.}

abstract = {C-LIEGE “Clean Last mile transport and logistics management for smart and efficient local Governments in Europe” is a STEER Intelligent Energy Europe Programme 2010 project focused on developing integrated framework for energy-efficient urban freight transport demand management and planning. C-LIEGE is conceived as a showcase for good practices and a helping hand for European cities striving for cleaner and sustainable urban freight transport and logistics. C-LIEGE provides solutions for decision makers and professionals in Local Authorities and for freight operators. C-LIEGE empowers a cooperative approach between public and private stakeholders targeted on the reduction of energetic and environmental impacts of freight transport in European cities and regions. C-LIEGE successfully developed and tested freight transport demand-oriented measures and decision supporting tools towards reduction of energy, environmental and economic impacts of freight transport in urban environments. A set of integrated solutions and measures were implemented and tested by the support of newly developed C-LIEGE tools: the Stakeholder Engagement Manual, Good Practice Database, Push and Pull Measures Database, Guideline for the development of Urban Freight Mobility Plan as well as the C-LIEGE Toolbox for the establishment of a City Logistics Manager. Seven pilot experiments in six European countries assessed effectiveness of the C-LIEGE approach: Bulgaria, Italy, Poland, United Kingdom, Germany and Malta. The pilot cities selected and implemented a package of demand-oriented measures such as access fees and time windows restrictions, environmental zones, recognition schemes, freight maps, Freight Quality Partnerships, etc. A total of 35 demand-oriented measures were implemented in the C-LIEGE pilot cities, based upon the C-LIEGE toolbox and guidelines. The C-LIEGE pilot sites have introduced a wide range of measures aimed at reducing the impacts of urban freight transport: Fleet Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS) in Newcastle (UK), introduction of access restrictions for heavier freight vehicles in Montana (Bulgaria), new freight mapping in Leicester (UK) accessible via smart phone, re-routing measures in Stuttgart (Germany) as well as Hal-Tarxien (Malta), the establishment of Freight Quality Partnerships (FQPs) as well as Local Freight Development Plans (LFDPs) in all pilot cities. The results achieved in each C-LIEGE pilot site is summarized as follows: decreasing of CO, CO2, NOx and PM10 emissions (tons/year) generated by freight vehicles (Leicester: 15.3%; Newcastle: 9.5%; Stuttgart: 13.2%; Szczecin: 27.8%; Montana: 11.9%; Hal-Tarxien: 10.6%; Piacenza/Emilia-Romagna: 41.2%/44.4%), decreasing fossil fuel consumption (Leicester: 10.5%; Newcastle: 9.4%; Stuttgart: 13.1%; Szczecin: 27.8%; Montana: 11.9%; Hal-Tarxien: 10.5%; Piacenza/Emilia-Romagna: 1.7%/1.5%), decreasing operating costs for freight carriers (Leicester: 6.5% Newcastle: 5.4%; Stuttgart: 7.4%; Szczecin: 18.2%; Montana: 7.7%; Hal-Tarxien: 9.1%; Piacenza/Emilia-Romagna: 17.5%/20.1%). C-LIEGE finally filled the existing gap in know-how and professionalism in the sector by designing, fine-tuning and delivering the complimentary capabilities of City Logistics Manager. For the first time in Europe, the well-known Mobility Manager whose duties are focused on passenger transport only can be paired with a City Logistics Manager. We are convinced that the C-LIEGE tools and experiences will be of great value for urban freight transport management and logistics in other European cities and regions.}

The dawn of the Internet of Things and the massive deployment of electronic sensors in the industrial floor lines, such as vision, opened new horizons for the analytics tools for processing. Fundamentals of Computer Vision are being used for analyzing big manufacturing data. Deep learning-based methods have recently overcome the problems existing in traditional methods by constructing deep Convolutional Neural Networks that extract multiple low-level and high-level features from the massive volume of labeled and unlabeled data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of deep learning-based state-of-the-art object detection methods. It discusses their applications in an industrial setting where human workers perform specific tasks using different tools on assembly lines. Firstly, object detection methods using deep learning are discussed while their advantage over traditional methods is introduced. The current techniques for object detection algorithms and their deployment in industrial applications are also discussed. Lastly, challenges and future trends associated with object detection using deep learning are summarized with potential research on improving object detection for smart industrial manufacturing.}

Such reformation has initiated revolutions in various industries and is gradually reshaping our daily routines. Among these trends, the data-driven intelligentization in Urban Public Transportation Systems can bring the most significant impact to our society, because they provide pervasive reachability. Optimizing and constructing such systems, which requires deep insights into passenger behavioral patterns, is a highly domain-specific data mining task. Although computational infrastructures have provided sufficient processing capacity, the practical utilization of such data is facing several challenges: information alignment in heterogeneous data sources and information enrichment for domain-specific applications. In this article, we first propose a cross-domain method to increase the usability of data by removing the inconsistency in vehicles' positioning and passengers' transaction data. We then use rule-based methods to reconstruct latent mobility information, thereby enabling small grained trajectory based applications. Finally, we provide use cases using the reconstructed information to derive insights to the public transportation system of our target city. Our work can serve as a domain-specific information enrichment and data mining framework for CPS in smart cities.}

Any actor in the agricultural value chain may harness weather forecasts at the short and medium-range, local weather history, and prevailing climatic conditions, to inform decision-making. Weather is fundamental to many day-to-day operations, especially at farm-level, influencing decision-making at various spatial and temporal scales. Many operational decisions ideally require hyper-localized service provision. In practice, integrating weather information into decision-support services demands a comprehensive understanding of various categories of weather-related data, their genesis, as well as the specific standards and data formats used by the meteorological community. This paper considers the weather as a crucial context for the delivery of farm-level operational services in smart agriculture, highlighting critical issues for reflection by system designers during the service design and implementation phases.}

For these reasons, in this work, the design, construction and fabrication of an adaptable autonomous solar-powered climatic station with wireless 3G or WiFi communication is presented. The station measures relative humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind speed, and light radiation. In addition, the system monitors the charge state of the main battery and the energy generated by the photovoltaic module to act as a reference cell for solar energy generation capability and agrivoltaic potential in the installation area. The station can be remotely controlled and reconfigured. The collected data from all sensors can be uploaded to the cloud in real-time.

It is found that polycentric structure is significant for alleviating income polarization, which exhibits a nonlinear effect. As the polycentric structure index increases, the inhibitory effect of polycentric cities on income polarization will increase.

The purpose of this study is to report how private rainwater-retention/harvesting facilities can be spread gradually but steadily in the city by citizen-initiated activities. Rainwater harvesting tanks were installed intensively and a rainwater harvesting house was constructed in the city of Fukuoka, Japan after the city experienced a flood disaster. The former enhanced users’ daily preparedness for emergency, and the latter inspired construction of a rainwater-harvesting housing complex. A public elementary school is in use from April 2016, which is inspired by these facilities. The school premises are located on the land reclaimed from an old irrigation pond. Thus the school needs to be adapted to this condition. 3000m3 of rainwater can be retained within the premises. The amounts of retention and discharge are monitored, and the data is utilized for science education. In big cities, people tend to depend too much on the top-down, mega-system, which invites more impervious surfaces in urban areas. Bottom-up, individual/collaborative approaches should be adopted in order to achieve multiple purposes of preventing/mitigating disasters, preserving/conserving ecosystems and nurturing/rebuilding communities in the city.}

However, challenges arise in constructing precise models for such nonlinear systems, preserving accuracy over a long-prediction horizon while capturing short-term dynamics, and handling disturbances uncertainties. This study proposes a novel Ensembled Multi-time scale deep-learning-based Adaptive Model Predictive Control (EMA-MPC) system. It integrates an ensembled Long-Short-Term Memory (ensembled-LSTM) model, comprising two LSTM models for fast and slow time-scale dynamics, respectively, and continuously evolving to changing conditions through online model adaptation. A bound control module is incorporated as an additional safety mechanism ensuring the environmental control within the desired threshold during unforeseen scenarios. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maintain indoor air temperature and CO2 concentration within the predefined comfort range while optimizing energy efficiency by controlling automated windows in a naturally ventilated room in winter. The EMA-MPC system demonstrates superior performance in balancing indoor air quality, temperature regulation, and energy efficiency. The ensembled-LSTM model significantly reduces the mean absolute error by 78.6% and 88.9% for CO2 and indoor air temperature predictions respectively, against a single LSTM model. The proposed EMA-MPC system achieves an 86% reduction in unmet CO2 hours compared to rule-based control and reduces occupied hours with temperature below 19 °C by 44% and 93% compared to enhanced MPC and basic MPC, respectively, while maintaining similar heating demand as other controllers. In conclusion, the proposed EMA-MPC system reduces modeling efforts and provides an effective approach towards reliable use of ML models in smart building control.}

On the supply side, new scientific (optimisation of the supply networks), organisational (self-managed communities) and technological innovations, like robotics, domotics, cyber physic systems (CPS) based on the Internet of Things and cloud computing, offer new utilities and create new businesses for the supply of goods and services to older people, and also provide new job opportunities for the younger residents.

In this paper, we focus on the power systems (i.e. smart grids) in ubiquitous cities, where every meter is linked to an information network through wireless networking. In a smart grid system, information from smart meters would be used to perform a state estimation in real time to maintain the stability of the system. A wrong estimation may lead to disastrous consequences (e.g. suspension of electricity supply or a big financial loss). Unfortunately, quite a number of recent results showed that attacks on this estimation process are feasible by manipulating readings of only a few meters. In this paper, we focus on nonlinear state estimation which is a more realistic model and widely employed in a real power grid environment. We category cyber attacks against nonlinear state estimation, and review the mechanisms behind. State-of-the-art security measures to detect these attacks are discussed via sensor protection. Hope that the community would be able to come up with a secure system architecture for ubiquitous cities.}

abstract = {A city region established around a smaller city typically has a higher percentage of its region being rural relative to city regions based around larger cities. Appreciation of this observation leads to the realisation that much of the existing literature focuses on city regions based around larger cities with small rural hinterlands. This paper develops a conceptual model outlining linkages within and beyond city regions and identifies that not all city regions embrace their rural hinterlands. To operationalise this conceptual model we draw on UK city region data collated from policy documents and socioeconomic performance indicators to analyse the long-term vision of development policies, evaluate how policymakers integrate rural areas in policy, and assess whether the introduction of city regions represents a change in policy focus and/or a change in the effectiveness of policies affecting rural hinterlands. The advantage of the conceptual model is that it is generalisable across any spatial entity and across an evolving urban-rural development landscape. Our analysis of policy documents and socioeconomic data for three UK city regions with large rural hinterlands (Aberdeen, North of Tyne, and Swansea Bay) reveals the marginalisation and peripheralisation of rural areas due to the direction of city region policies and the socioeconomic flows of resources towards their urban cores. The city region approach to development tends not to be cognizant of the potential of rural areas and our findings suggest the need for development strategies that ensure rural areas are not marginalised because disconnected rural areas experience aggravated core-periphery divisions.}

abstract = {There is an active contemporary debate about how emerging technologies such as automated vehicles, peer-to-peer sharing applications and the ‘internet of things’ will revolutionise individual and collective mobility. Indeed, it is argued that the so-called ‘Smart Mobility’ transition, in which these technologies combine to transform how the mobility system is organised and operates, has already begun. As with any socio-technical transition there are critical questions to be posed in terms of how the transition is managed, and how both the benefits and any negative externalities of change will be governed. This paper deploys the notion of ensuring and enhancing public value as a key governance aim for the transition. It sets out modes and methods of governance that could be deployed to steer the transition and, through four thematic cases explores how current mobility governance challenges will change. In particular, changing networks of actors, resources and power, new logics of consumption, and shifts in how mobility is regulated, priced and taxed – will require to be successfully negotiated if public value is to be captured from the transition. This is a critical time for such questions to be raised because technological change is clearly outpacing the capacity of systems and structures of governance to respond to the challenges already apparent. A failure to address both the short and longer-term governance issues risks locking the mobility system into transition paths which exacerbate rather than ameliorate the wider social and environmental problems that have challenged planners throughout the automobility transition.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used in modern smart areas such as smart cities, but data security remains a significant challenge. Blockchain-based IoT access control addresses data security issues by preventing unauthorized devices from accessing limited IoT resources. However, most existing blockchain-based access control schemes still have scalability and security issues. A lightweight and secure framework, MSLShard, is proposed for the blockchain-based access control via sharding, which consists of two parts. First, an adaptive network sharding scheme based on network distance, node credibility, and access frequency is designed in the cloud-edge-end collaboration-based IoT architecture to reduce nodes' storage pressure and improve the scheme's scalability. Second, the trust management based on multidimensional subjective logic explicitly portrays the heterogeneity among edge nodes to motivate cooperation and further improve the security of the blockchain. Experimental results show that MSLShard can achieve high scalability and security in large-scale IoT environments compared to existing methods.}

This paper aims to conduct a review of the integration of edge computing and blockchain into IoT systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review paper that covers all aspects of system architectures and categories of blockchain-based edge deployment, complete security requirements, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization/access control, privacy, trust/confidence, transparency, availability, secure automaticity, and tolerance, and applications of blockchain-based edge potential usages with consideration of security requirements. Additionally, this review provides comprehensive discussions of challenges and insights into the future direction of blockchain-based edge IoT systems.

In the past decades, real-time sensory data have been offloaded to centralized cloud servers for data analysis through a reliable communication channel. However, due to the long communication distance between end-users and centralized cloud servers, the chances of increasing network congestion, data loss, latency, and energy consumption are getting significantly higher. To address the challenges mentioned above, fog computing emerges in a distributed environment that extends the computation and storage facilities at the edge of the network. Compared to centralized cloud infrastructure, a distributed fog framework can support delay-sensitive IoT applications with minimum latency and energy consumption while analyzing the data using a set of resource-constraint fog/edge devices. Thus our survey covers the layered IoT architecture, evaluation metrics, and applications aspects of fog computing and its progress in the last four years. Furthermore, the layered architecture of the standard fog framework and different state-of-the-art techniques for utilizing computing resources of fog networks have been covered in this study. Moreover, we included an IoT use case scenario to demonstrate the fog data offloading and resource provisioning example in heterogeneous vehicular fog networks. Finally, we examine various challenges and potential solutions to establish interoperable communication and computation for next-generation IoT applications in fog networks.}

Previous studies have shown that there is an implicit community between reviewers In this paper, we try to use community discovery approach in secure and smart autonomous multi-robot systems for opinion spammer detection, and improve the prediction precision. We propose a novel approach, named SPClique, which is based on the Clique Percolation Method (CPM) to detect opinion spammer groups by modeling the review dataset as reviewer projection graph. During the process, we introduce approximate computing to get a valuable smaller reviewer-projection graph and expand the computing power. It first executes the CPM algorithm in the reviewer-projection graph to find all k-clique clusters, and then innovatively describes an opinion spammer group based on k-clique clusters. Second, the group-based spam and individual-based spams indicators are used to measure the suspiciousness of each opinion spammer group. Finally, it outputs the suspect ranking of opinion spammer groups. The prediction precision of our proposed method is better than four advanced comparison methods, and our approach can detect more real opinion spammers in large-scale review datasets.}

It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker’s strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.}

As a policy system to change the old and new dynamics of innovation, the impact of innovation pilot cities on the allocation of innovation factors is of great importance. Using a sample of 254 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2019, this paper empirically analyses the impact of innovative pilot city policies on the allocation of innovation factors and their paths of action using a multi-temporal double-difference model. The study finds that the innovative pilot city policy significantly improved the level of innovation factor allocation, and this result held true after considering a series of robustness tests and endogeneity tests. Mechanistic tests show that the innovation pilot city policy has an impact on the allocation of innovation factors through the factor mobility effect and the innovation environment effect. Heterogeneity test shows that the influence of innovation pilot city policies on innovation factor allocation is greater in cities with higher administrative levels and better geographical locations. The economic consequences show that the innovation pilot city policy can significantly promote high-quality regional economic development. This study provides useful lessons for giving full play to the innovation-driven policy's innovation factor allocation effect, thereby enhancing China's high-quality economic development.}

Portable electronic devices and Internet of Things (IoT) require an uninterrupted power supply for their optimum performance and are key ingredients of the futuristic smart buildings - cities. The off-grid photovoltaic cells and photo-rechargeable energy storage devices meet the requirements for continuous data processing and transmission. In addition, these off-grid devices can solve the energy mismanagement problem famously called as “duck curve”. The conventional approach is the external integration of a photovoltaic cell and an energy storage device through a complex multi-layered structure. However, this approach causes ohmic transport losses and requires additional complex device packaging leading to increased weight and high cost. Toward this narrative, in this viewpoint, we shed light on application of disruptive organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite bifunctional materials employed as smart photo-rechargeable energy devices. We also present hybrid halide lead-free perovskite materials for off-grid energy storage systems for indoor lighting applications.}

In this study, a cover system that can be opened and closed automatically has been developed against undesirable natural events that vineyards are exposed to. The developed system consists of a DC gear motor capable to open and close the vineyard cover, a control card that collects the information from the sensors (rain sensor, temperature sensor, hail sensor, and frost sensor) and interprets the results, a solar battery that will store energy, a PV panel that will charge the battery, and mechanical components. In this work, an easily portable prototype was studied. The dimensions of the design have been realized as 1/3 of the dimensions of the real system. The system is designed to be 1 m high and 2 m wide. The control card of the system is designed to be suitable for outdoor conditions. Moreover, a remote management and condition monitoring of the system have been realized via a mobile application.

To expand the diverse paths of constructing megacities, the current research references the nudge theory of behavioral science, adopts the extended case method, and takes Chengdu Tianfu New Area as a typical case to summarize the “nudge” path of “Party City” construction. The study found that the government achieves the lock-in effect by the priming mechanism and uses the nudge strategy of improving environment and guiding public opinion, thereby helping the people make free choices. It realizes the framework effect by the salience mechanism and uses the strategies of highlighting key information and optimizing information delivery methods, which directly affects the behavior of the public. It achieves the commitment effect by the comparison mechanism, including the horizontal comparison and vertical comparison strategies, and gradually realizes the policy goals. It realizes the social norm effect by the imitation mechanism and uses the strategies of creating peer pressure and playing celebrity effect, which in turn influence people’s choices. With the help of the “nudging” mechanism, the construction of the park city has realized the interactive cycle of “government output-citizen feedback” and achieved the goal of “making great change through small actions”. As a new behavioral intervention tool, “nudging” provides an alternative explanation for the construction of the park city in Tianfu New Area and opens up new ideas for the construction of megacities. This study concludes that the construction of megacities can achieve the goal of “common return” through different ways and provides practical inspiration for future urban construction.}

However, due to the occlusion among Oudemansiella raphanipes in the growing bed, it is challenging to accurately and rapidly capture their full shape with conventional methods, resulting in a low measurement success rate. The overall goal of this study is to propose a deep learning-based method (Oudemansiella raphanipes Occlusion Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks, OR-ORCNN) to obtain the morphology of occluded Oudemansiella raphanipes precisely in the mushroom growing bed with high efficiency. To accomplish this, a state-of-the-art attention architecture (OR-SE), which consists of CCA (Criss-Cross Attention) and MSF (Multiscale Fusion) modules, was applied to the deocclusion assignment. Then, the predicted amodal mask combined pinhole camera model was used to compute the size of Oudemansiella raphanipes caps in millimeters (mm). The experimental results showed an improvement in the AP50 of 2.78 % and mAR of 5.60 % compared with the baseline model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the OR-SE module in improving the feature information capability of backbone networks. Meanwhile, the Oudemansiella raphanipes cap size estimation results reported an MAE of 0.93 mm and a MAPE of 4.96 %. Furthermore, to confirm the robustness and generalizability of the OR-ORCNN model, we also conducted experiments on Agrocybe cylindraceas and obtained satisfactory results. In summary, the proposed algorithm provides an effective way to recover the shape of the occluded region of Oudemansiella raphanipes with high efficiency and precision, which can be used to help researchers breed intelligently and growers optimize management.}

This paper presents an intelligent metasurface (IMS) based pattern and beam reconfigurable antenna for indoor as well as outdoor IoT applications including V2X and 5 G Small Cell. The IMS based antenna system consists of a wideband monopole and a programable IMS acting as a reflector. The single–layered metasurface is comprised of 4×4 square ring-shaped unit, where each unit cell can be controlled by a pair of four diodes. Due to the separate control of each unit cell, the shape and size of the reflector can be controlled, resulting in different radiation patterns. The system offers various radiation patterns, starting from omni–directional to broadside, with single or dual beams, along with beam–steering both in elevation and azimuth plane. The antenna system offers a peak gain up to 8.89 dBi with an operational bandwidth of 4.95–7.6 GHz. To validate the design concept, the system is fabricated and tested. A microcontroller is utilized for the switching IMS configuration. The high agreement between simulated and measured results, combined with the low profile, high gain, pattern–beam reconfigurability make the proposed antenna a suitable candidate for the indoor IoT devices along with outdoor application not limited to V2X communication systems as well as for small cell in smart cities.}

The detailed model includes a flexible demand profile in order to manage the energy requirements by incorporating penalizations in the economic objective function for delays in satisfying energy demand. The MILP model for the optimization of deterministic scenarios is reformulated in order to incorporate discrete and hybrid time representations. This approach allows considering a different granularity of the problem. Finally, the improved performance of the hybrid approach introduced is shown by comparing the performance of these two time representations.}

abstract = {With the advanced technologies such as 5 G network and internet of things (IoT), there are incredibly increasing sensors and corresponding applications emerging to benefit our daily lives. However, the power supplies for countless sensors become a serious issue to suppress further expansion of IoT. In this work, a self-powered triboelectric sensor (CN-STS) made of electrospun composite nanofibers is developed towards smart traffic monitoring and management. To meet the requirements of fast-response and high sensitivity for the smart traffic management, transferred charge density is adopted as sensing signals compared to voltage / current outputs for it can perfectly record the subtle differences and suitable for dynamic traffic monitoring. Carbon nanotube is further doped into PVDF nanofibers to improve the electrical output performance and pressure sensitivity. A relatively high sensitivity of 0.0406 μCm−2kPa−1 at low pressure range (0–75 kPa) and a sensitivity of 0.0032 μCm−2kPa−1 at higher pressure range (75–425 kPa) can be achieved by the CN-STS, indicating that the CN-STS is more sensitive at low pressure range. Moreover, by connecting to cloud IoT services, the functions of traffic flow management, overlapping and speeding vehicle capturing, and plate number recognition are realized by the CN-STS arrays with a compensation circuit. A charge amplifier is utilized in power management to process the charge input signals for better distinguishing the signals from none-vehicles and stabilize the volage output for further reading by the A/D convertor build in Raspberry Pi. The engineered self-powered triboelectric sensors not only open a new potential area for triboelectric nanogenerators but also significantly popularize the IoT industry.}

This paper proposes a new framework to measure street activity in real-time. Our framework leverages machine learning and computer vision to classify pedestrian activities and transportation modes using images collected from moving vehicles. We apply our methodology to measure street activity in Paris for five weeks. We produce activity maps for this period showing that streets vary dramatically in their capacity to support pedestrian activity and that these differences are highly persistent. Our proposed framework can be used to measure street activities in other contexts and cities, providing urban researchers with an approach to guide planning interventions, identify infrastructural deficiencies, and inform design policies that foster active streets.}

This study aims to investigate anywhere working, the practice of performing work tasks remotely instead of from a traditional “fixed” office location, as a possible mechanism for reducing traffic congestion and pollution. The research adopts a descriptive survey method to collect primary empirical data on the current working arrangements and commuting habits of HCMC workers, to identify organizational policies relating to anywhere working, commuter transport modes/usage/timings, attitudes toward anywhere working, and the benefits, constraints/concerns, and perceived productivity for working in locations outside of a traditional office space. The results indicated that, while 74% of HCMC commuters would like to engage in anywhere working practices, only 41% were permitted to do so. This low adoption rate was not necessarily due to the nature of the work tasks themselves, but due to managerial decisions of their employers, and the desire to engage in anywhere working was found to be strongest among those who have already had the first-hand experience of working remotely. HCMC is predicted to be the second fast-growing economy in Asia by 2021 (Tu, 2017) and the findings from this research provide timely and valuable new insights into this phenomenon, as a potential mechanism for assisting the cities of the future develop more equitable, sustainable, and livable conditions through the use of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).}

In particular, vehicle-to-home technology has drawn a significant interest in PEVs' parked at smart home to enhance the power consumption profile. This paper proposes a collaborative energy management among PEVs, smart homes and neighbors' interaction. For that, a new supervision strategy based on PEVs power scheduling for smoothing the residential power load profile is developed. The objective of this study is to improve the power demand profile by controlling the PEV power charging/discharging amount to fill the valley of the power consumption curve or by providing power to home especially during peak periods to shave peak. The home energy management for achieving a flattened power load profile is divided into two parts: a local control according to the base demand profile of the considering home, the availability of their PEVs, their arrival and departure times and their initial state of charge (SOC) values. A global control according to the power demand of the specific home, the total power demand of neighbors and the availability of PEVs’ neighbors (arrival and departure times, initial energy of the battery). The simulation results of the power load profile of such smart homes highlights the interaction between PEVs, smart home and their neighbors in order to flatten the power demand curve to the greatest extent possible.}

As a result, five factors critical to the applicability of a smart technology to mobile health care are identified, and the fuzzy geometric mean-fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FGM-FAHP) approach is proposed to assess the relative importance levels of the identified factors. The experimental results showed that the three most critical factors identified include: (a) the relaxation of the related medical laws; (b) unobtrusiveness; and (c) the precise need and situation of a user. Accordingly, approximately 44%, 26%, and 15% of the budget should be allocated to the realization of the three critical factors, respectively.

Therefore, there is an increased demand for envisioning the 6G wireless communication systems to overcome the major limitations in the existing 5G networks. Moreover, incorporating artificial intelligence in 6G will provide solutions for very complex problems relevant to network optimization. Furthermore, to add further value to the future 6G networks, researchers are investigating new technologies, such as THz and quantum communications. The requirements of future 6G wireless communications demand to support massive data-driven applications and the increasing number of users.

Metrics such as the vehicle average speed, travel time, delays, and count of stops, can be used to characterize mobility and traffic congestion in an area. However, effective study of mobility data is often hindered by the difficulty of gathering mobility data in a practical, inexpensive, and prompt way. In this work, we explore the use of city buses as mobility probes, using the existing smart city infrastructure deployed in Aveiro, Portugal. We propose a method for traffic congestion detection considering the low vehicle speed, low traffic flow and road occupancy close to its capacity. Three degrees of congestion are identified using the k-means approach; DBSCAN is used to characterize the typical level of congestion in a road. Using four-weeks of mobility data, it was possible to assess the congestion along the day and for the different days of the week; some road segments proved to be consistently prone to congestion. We also studied parameters of driving safety, considering speed and acceleration. In this work, we show that knowledge discovery can be applied to mobility data being collected by tracking buses, exploring data that is often collected for other purposes also to characterize traffic congestion. These methods can inform decision makers and are easily ported to other cities.}

The internet is built upon a layered architecture that facilitates technology innovations, and its intelligence is distributed throughout a hierarchy of networks. Fundamental differences between data flows and power flows are examined. The current operating paradigm of the grid is based on the conviction that a centralized grid operator is necessary to maintain instantaneous power balance on the grid. A new distributed paradigm can be realized by distributing this responsibility to sub-grids and requiring each sub-grid to maintain its net power balance. A grid as smart as the internet based on this new paradigm, as well as a hierarchical network structure and a layered architecture of operating principles, is presented.}

It is claimed that the varying level of social networking site use is because the scale of the tourism industry and the level of information and communication technology innovation could vary with different types of municipalities.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way future cities are planned. The concept of embedding intelligence into spaces and objects makes it possible to build all sorts of smart and distributed systems that automate and improve everyday operations in the fields of health, energy, manufacturing, and transport, amongst others. One of the most significant visions to come out of the IoT revolution is Smart Cities. Equipped with sensing and communication technologies and powered by renewable energy sources, Smart Cities could be the key to protecting environmental resources and ensuring sustainable urbanization as the world population continues to grow. Of the various available renewable energy sources, solar is one of the most popular and promising. However, solar energy is a function of its environment, and sudden changes in meteorological conditions can cause intermittency and disrupt power generation. In desert regions where solar energy is the most plausible option for renewable energy, dust-based soiling remains the biggest obstacle. The accumulation of dust particles on the surface of PV modules can obstruct the absorption of radiation by the module, effectively reducing its output. One common method to measure soiling loss is to perform Current-Voltage (IV) Tracing; where the characteristics of a PV module are used to evaluate the performance of the module. However, solar facilities in smart cities are often distributed in the form of small farms, rooftop installations, and parking lot shades in order to make use of the available space and reduce power lines. This represents a challenge to monitoring and maintaining soiled panels due to the scale and distribution of the installations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an IoT-based solar monitoring system for city-wide, large-scale, and distributed solar facilities in smart cities. The system uses low-cost hardware and IoT networking technologies to remotely perform and communicate IV curves from individual modules or strings in a remote facility. A prototype was implemented and used to evaluate soiling loss in Sharjah, UAE, over the period of two months under harsh summer weather conditions. The prototype was able to successfully and reliably collect IV tracing and communicate it back to a cloud-based server for researchers to view and analyze. The obtained results show that soiling has a major impact on PV modules efficiency with up to 40 % power loss after two months of soiling. The PV soiling index and PV soiling loss are evaluated to allow solar facility operators to reduce cleaning costs, optimize power output, and enable preventative maintenance in city-wide distributed solar facilities.}

On the other hand is the how to effectively exploit this context-awareness to reduce energy consumption and increase the user comfort. In this paper, we propose an intelligent context-awareness Building Energy Management System (ICA-BEMS). ICA-BEMS uses hybrid energy-saving techniques based on a Smart Context-Awareness Management (Smart-CAM). Smart-CAM uses smart building ontology to organize smart building knowledge and utilizes a new context-awareness mechanism to provide contextual information. The former exploits the contextual information in reasoning to reduce the building energy consumption, promoting users behavioral change and maximizing the user's comfort to bring about a better energy efficiency policy. To evaluate our system, we have developed a smart building simulator (Open-SBS) which simulates smart building comportments and human behaviors. We have created various scenarios of daily life in the smart building simulator. We have tested our ICA-BEMS effect on energy consumption having a positive result. Energy consumption has been decreased by 40% of total energy consumption.}

This new trend involves a renewed perspective on how to generate, transmit, distribute and manage electricity networks, which not only helps to reduce power demand and cost, but can also improve efficiency, reliability, quality and security. This paper aims to study comprehensively the Smart Grid power system by comparing experiences and success stories from around the world. Developed countries, like the United States and those in the European Union, and developing countries, like India and Brazil, have been taken as examples of the current development and state of the Smart Grid concept. Europe and the U.S. lead the development of Smart Grids systems, while Brazil and India strongly depend on foreign technology and investment for their development in their countries. Climate change represents an extra challenge for developing countries, in addition to other issues related to economic and social advancement. Nevertheless, Smart Grids offer an array of possibilities and opportunities that work towards climate change international goals. However, state motivations and national energy resources limit the advancement of Smart Grids on this matter.}

However, there is a lack of research studies investigating real-time mobile air-quality measurement through smart sensing units and even more of any data-driven modelling techniques that could be deployed to predict air quality accurately from the generated data-sets. This paper addresses these challenges by: a) proposing a comparative and detailed investigation of various air quality monitoring devices (both fixed and mobile), tested through field measurements and citizen sensing in an eco-neighbourhood from Lorraine, France, and by b) proposing a machine learning approach to evaluate the accuracy and potential of such mobile generated data for air quality prediction. The air quality evaluation consists of three experimenting protocols: a) first, we installed fixed passive tubes for monitoring the nitrogen dioxide concentrations placed in strategic locations highly affected by traffic circulation in an eco-neighbourhood, b) second, we monitored the nitrogen dioxide registered by citizens using smart and mobile pollution units carried at breathing level; results revealed that mobile-captured concentrations were 3–5 times higher than the ones registered by passive-static monitoring tubes and c) third, we compared different mobile pollution stations working simultaneously, which revealed noticeable differences in terms of result variability and sensitivity. Finally, we applied a machine learning modelling by using decision trees and neural networks on the mobile-generated data and show that humidity and noise are the most important factors influencing the prediction of nitrogen dioxide concentrations of mobile stations.}

However, the traditional storage structure has obstacles to reasonable medical resources access and medical data circulation, such as data security, query privacy, and isolated data island problems. An intuitive solution is to store all the encrypted medical data in a central server. But this method absolutely depends on the central server, causing more performance disadvantages and privacy risks. Therefore, it is urgent to construct a secure and proper medical data retrieval scheme. Based on the existing data storage model, we build a multi-server search scheme to collaboratively perform diagnostic institution location, medical data search, and even cross-domain data search in this paper. The multi-server architecture solves problems of destructiveness and information over-centralization caused by the single server and enhances the reliability and practicality of the system. The utilization of hidden vector encryption, secret sharing, and secure multi-party computation realizes efficient search, identity privacy, search pattern security, and access pattern security. Security analysis demonstrates that identity privacy and query security are protected. Extensive experiments show that the scheme has better data search and data add efficiency through horizontal and vertical comparisons.}

SRDM can facilitate the maximum reclamation of End-of-Life product value while achieving sustainability. Ubiquitous information and computational intelligence technologies empower the implementation of SRDM. These emerging smart technologies not only reduce the information uncertainties but also provide powerful operational methodologies for SRDM. However, there is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive framework to assist practitioners in better understanding SRDM in both theory and practice, as well as directing how to apply these emerging techniques to facilitate SRDM at the operational level. This study is the first effort to address this gap by providing a state-of-art review of SRDM techniques. First, the paper discusses the SRDM enablers and highlights their contributions. The SRDM enablers include the information technique, smart equipment, service platform and closed-loop supply chains. Then the SRDM techniques are reviewed in four aspects: model input prediction, recovery option determination, process planning, and production scheduling and planning. Further, a generalized SRDM implementation framework with a methodology roadmap is proposed to assist practitioners in applying the framework to practice. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in SRDM, inherited, derived, and enabled by the ubiquitous information and computational intelligence technologies, are identified and discussed. This study shows that the research on SRDM remains at an early stage. With the roadmap and insights provided in this work, more research can potentially advance SRDM.}

Current evacuation regulations approaches for underground space generally suggest increasing dimension and number of evacuation paths and exits in architecture design plan, and no better way to improve the evacuation efficiency in underground space that has been built. This study aims to create a smart safety design for fire stairways to improve the evacuation efficiency without altering their architectural characteristics. The smart safety design is made up of two parts, one is the mathematical basis for predictable ascending evacuation speed of evacuees, and the other is the system logical architecture integrating intelligent devices. Therefore, firstly this study proved the relationship between the ascending evacuation speed in underground space and the body mass index (BMI) of a human. The experiment was completed by recruiting volunteers in a teaching building of a university in China. Ascending speed and BMI data were acquired through an observational experiment on individual ascending evacuation using stairways and by simulating an emergency in a 60 m underground environment. The relationship between ascending speed and BMI was analyzed via statistical method. A mathematical model of ascending speed change in different BMI groups was proposed for the ascending evacuation process in 0–60 m underground space. Then, the smart safety design for fire stairways in underground space was proposed based on the mathematical model. Weight sensors, height detectors, and pedestrian identification devices were designed in the same space at the entrance of the underground space and fire stairways. Base on the data from devices, the smart safety system could predict the change of density of occupants for each fire stairway through calculating ascending speed and BMI of occupants so as to suggest dynamic evacuation paths to evacuees. The smart safety design for fire stairways would improve the safety in underground space and promote sustainable development of underground space.}

Unfortunately, societies were unprepared to confront a pandemic and applied movement restriction measures, often harsh and unbalanced, creating confusion, uncertainty, and annoyance to communities. In this paper, we reviewed a wide array of databases to categorise the mobility management measures implemented internationally in response to the social distancing restrictions that had to be taken during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, to comprehensively assess the measures implemented to contain the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of the local community, we conducted focus group interviews with specific population groups that may have been affected to a greater extent. These groups consisted of vulnerable road users, such as mobility-impaired people and people who are facing severe health problems, representatives of the local economy and businesses and representatives of institutional stakeholders and policymakers. Our research showed that in the post-pandemic era, accessibility and not mobility should be at the heart of economic and social welfare. At the same time, the assurance of physical activity, which is strongly associated with the mental health of citizens, and the protection of the local economy are issues of outermost importance. However, local authorities were unprepared to manage these issues and often made fragmented and punitive decisions. By recognising the need for a regional or metropolitan emergency mechanism, this study aims to introduce a new system of indicators specifically adapted to the particularities and challenges encountered during the pandemic, accounts for local communities' unique needs and requirements, and complies with the general principles of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs). In the future, the SUMP methodology should be revised to be able to handle and manage mobility systems under pandemic conditions.}

The current study investigates the influence of Industry 4.0 by assessing internal room parameters in an indoor ventilated room conditions for system output. Smart systems like AI and IoT, integrated with sensors, dynamically adjust indoor conditions based on external climate, enhancing HVAC system efficiency. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), integrated with AI and IoT sensors, optimally adjust indoor conditions in correlation with external climate, maximizing HVAC system efficiency. The study utilizes input parameters including Dry Bulb Temperature (DBT), Relative Humidity (RH), and Solar Radiation across diverse days to analyze system efficiency. ANN and RSM iteratively optimize system efficiency by training on RH, DBT, and air quality data. They converge on recommending 42% RH, 28 °C DBT, and 25 PM air quality, achieving 0.851 desirability. This approach enhances heat load (75.89%) and ventilation load (69.12%) efficiency significantly. Integration of Industry 4.0 sensors in the HVAC system resulted in a 16% efficiency increase and 15% cost effectiveness in the controlled room compared to prior measurements.}

Consequently, they also provide benefits to water service providers, in terms of augmentation deferrals and reduced sized infrastructure. However, while these benefits are acknowledged in the literature, they have not been thoroughly investigated and quantified. This paper empirically demonstrates how the installation of different potable water saving measures would affect the design of urban water supply networks. Peak day water demand profiles were developed for the baseline scenario, which represented the typical building code mandated for new dwellings constructed in Queensland, Australia, and for households fitted with water saving measures. The core novel feature of this study relates to the use of an innovative bottom-up approach to the development of demand profiles based on smart meters enabling comprehensive water end use datasets (i.e. demand in shower, tap, etc.) to be obtained. Hydraulic model runs were conducted for various water savings scenarios across different planning horizons to determine the scheduling of augmentations in a water supply study area. The results of the model runs showed deferred and eliminated augmentations, as well as reductions in infrastructure sizing for the water savings scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. Financial analysis (i.e. NPV) on trunk main augmentation requirements over 50 year asset life cycles indicated that savings of between $1,574,289 (11.4%) and $7,030,796 (51%) could be achieved by incorporating water efficiency and potable source substitution measures in new infill developments in the study region.}

This article focuses on urban practices of walking, driving and ride-hailing with mobile technologies and their failures on an everyday basis in urban Guangzhou (a megacity in south China), based on an analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data collected from the fieldwork in 2021. It finds that digitally mediated mobilities can be seen as everyday digital practices which are simultaneously produced and reproduced through everyday encounters with platforms and their breakdowns, places, and people's knowledge, skills, and imaginations in both digital and physical spaces. Moreover, digital platforms, as well as their failures, affect daily mobilities in contradictory ways. On the one hand, digital platforms mediate and reshape the time-space of people's daily mobilities and make people adjust and adapt their practices to the logic of platforms. While on the other hand, they allow people to creatively produce valuable data for themselves and enhance their skills of re-organising their mobilities with smartphone apps efficiently. These findings can advance digital geographies' understanding of the complex, contingent and messy relations between digital platforms, urban spaces and everyday practices.}

However, in other aspects as distributed generation, microgrid and intelligent demand management etc., the progress is slow and limited. In this paper we analyze the policy, pilot projects, achievements and barriers of developing smart grids in China. We find that lack of a clear national strategy is one main institutional barrier.

abstract = {The Smart Grid (SG) domain especially props up the flow of electricity and operational information flow via a robust and well-founded communications network. This fully digitalized, two-way communication domain furnishes substantial asset optimization and efficacy-fortuity for engaging entities. Smart-Grid uses digital technologies and IoT-solutions to wisely respond to and transform changes in the grid. Infusing energy intelligence is the key to anchoring the data in the grid that allows grid operation to be authentic, cost-effective, pliable, and prudent. This technique can act far-flung on network events and ameliorate our supply and relationship with the territory. End-users’ privacy is a significant concern when collecting energy usage data to deploy and adopt Smart Grid technologies. Smart Grids integrate the conventional electrical power grid with Information and Communication Technologies, Intelligent Information processing and Future-Oriented Techniques. Such integration empowers the electrical-utility providers and end-users to improve the power system’s coherence and bareness while continually monitoring, controlling, and managing customers’ demands. Cyber security should be an intrinsic part of the drafting and design process involved with Smart Grid initiatives’ deployment. They are deploying a Smart Grid without ample sanctuary that might affect the outcome in severe outcomes, such as grid instability, expediency deception, user information, and energy-consumption data loss. Cyber security is a serious problem of the Smart Grid. Cyber security and data privacy questions have provided inherent keyholes since large-scale communication networks will be needed to connect numerous devices from geographically spread sites to a Control center. Organizations need to display intramural privacy policies and supporting procedures for their individual to follow to bring forth behests to effectively and consistently protect consumer and energy usage data, energy-consumption data, and energy-preferring data. Therefore, this chapter describes in detail those seclusion strategies and focuses on new privacy challenges on Smart Grids, while discussing an all-inclusive draw breath privacy amplifying technologies that can be engineered within the many technologies of the Smart Grid to support data-privacy. This chapter presents recent advances and countermeasures on Smart Grid cyber security and discusses some of the current cyber security matters in Smart Grid networks, explains some of the brand-new solutions, and puts forward a state-of-the-art security model based on the IoT archetype. This chapter also spotlights different Smart Grid privacy solutions and identifies their solidity and fragility in their enactment, convolution, potency, toughness, and transparency.}

In this paper, we propose an interoperable Internet-of-Things (IoTs) platform for a smart home system using a Web-of-Objects (WoO) and cloud architecture. The proposed platform controls the home appliances from anywhere and also provides the homes’ data in the cloud for various service providers’ applications and analysis. Firstly, we proposed a Raspberry PI based gateway for interoperability among various legacy home appliances, different communication technologies, and protocols. Secondly, we bring the smart home appliances to the web and make it accessible through the Representational State Transfer (REST/RESTful) framework. Thirdly, we will provide the cloud server for smart homes’ to store the homes’ data due to low storage capabilities at a gateway and provide the data for various application’s service providers and analysis. In the proposed smart home platform, we implement a water-tank control using Zigbee communication, an automatic door security using a normal camera as an IP camera, and provide web connectivity to different home devices for web-based controlling. We aim to reduce the human intervention, secure access control to home devices from anywhere, provide smart homes data for application services as well as for analysis, and improve the utilization of resources.}

abstract = {The rapidly expanding number of IoT-based camera devices makes smart work packaging (SWP) easier to access massive construction workers' personal image information for occupational health and safety (OHS) status monitoring. SWP can then transmit these personal data to the cloud for training the machine learning models and offer safety alerts or health insights. However, there are two urgently important challenges. Firstly, the machine learning model needs to aggregate the SWPs' image data from each construction worker, which may pose a risk to private data leakage without strict privacy and security agreement. In addition, the machine learning models trained on all SWPs' image data may compromise the personalization of image-based OHS status monitoring for each construction worker. To address the above issues, this study proposes a FedSWP framework, the federated transfer learning-enabled SWP for protecting the personal image information of construction workers in OHS management. FedSWP executes the gradient parameters aggregation through federated learning for the image data in each SWP and builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Crane operators' facial fatigue monitoring experiments are conducted and have evaluated that FedSWP can achieve accurate and personalized safety alerts and healthcare. This study paves the way for the generalization and extension of FedSWP in many construction OHS applications.}

The proposed solution allows designers to extend a public transport system with additional routes, which are created dynamically based on the requests from passengers.

This framework has evolved toward having smart CPS with intelligence and decision-making capabilities and highly networked and integrated components. CPSs have been categorized into two types namely Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) for the development of products and Cyber Physical Service Systems (CPSS) for the servicing of products. These developments facilitate the adoption of the CPS in smart cities, smart farming systems, smart manufacturing, and smart supply chain systems, etc., while it gives CPS the importance as one of the core technologies making up Industry 4.0 era. Despite these advances, cybersecurity and privacy, real-time control of systems, interoperability of services, etc. are key challenges facing the development of CPS and they demand solutions overcoming such challenges.

abstract = {Part of Smart Energy Systems are Smart Thermal Grids, which enable bidirectional power flow between prosumers. To facilitate this feature, the network architecture and intelligent control of the decentralized actuators are a major challenge. Therefore, methods for the analysis of prosumer-dominated thermal networks are needed, including the hydraulic actuators and the heat transfer to the prosumers. This paper derives a holistic mathematical system representation that allows to investigate the relations between the control variables of such networks and their thermohydraulic steady-state. At first a suitable network architecture concept is introduced. Based on this, balance equations are combined with common physical models for the network components. Explicitly considered are the heat transfer to the secondary side, flexible prosumer modes and the behavior of decentralized control pumps and valves depending on their control inputs. The resulting system of equations is discussed in the context of two use cases: a) simulation of the system state for given control inputs and b) determining the necessary control inputs for target heat exchanges (optimal control). Exemplary simulation results are presented. For the simulation use case a Python code is provided on Github under open source license, based on the derived model.}

The focus is on the aspects of smart home technologies related to energy management within the home (end-uses) and at network or grid level (system). Four aspects of a home are distinguished: a place for security and control, for activity, for relationships and continuity, and for identity and values. These aspects of home are used to discuss approaches to, and ideas of, the smart home, as reflected in the research literature. It is shown that technical and ‘prospective’ research literature focuses on aspects of security and control in the home as well as on activities, whereas research papers that are more conceptual and evaluative are more likely to include questions of relations, values and identities. The paper concludes that a broader understanding of the home in all aspects is needed when conducting research into smart homes. This can be valuable when evaluating how smart home technologies work in real homes, as well as in the more technical and prospective approaches to developing new socio-technical configurations.}

After the objects are detected, they are assigned markers, and their trajectories are tracked in real-time. The scientific community is intrigued by the possibilities of utilizing MOT technology in the context of smart cities. Their primary focus lies in the domains of intelligent transportation, detection of vehicles and pedestrians, crowd surveillance, and public safety. Deep learning techniques have been developed in recent years to effectively tackle the challenges of real-time MOT tasks and enhance tracking performance. Environmental perception within smart traffic applications relies heavily on sensor data fusion. In traffic scenarios, a thoughtful approach involves utilizing a combination of sensors and cameras to detect and track targets while gathering valuable data effectively. However, it faces challenges when it comes to detecting and tracking objects that are in motion, have complex changes in appearance, or are in crowded scenes. This paper explores the foundational standard for real-time Multiple Object Tracking tasks. We prioritize the examination of quantitative measures by conducting a comprehensive analysis of widely utilized benchmark datasets and metrics. This study also investigates established embedding techniques and multi-modal fusion methods within real-time multi-target tracking algorithms. Each strategy will be classified and assessed according to a predefined set of principles. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis and visual representation of various MOT strategies. Finally, this paper aims to present an overview of the current challenges faced by the MOT mission, as well as the potential objectives that lie ahead.}

This paper proposes a novel secure energy policy and load sharing approach for renewable MGs for independent utilization of off-grid MGs with power electronic jointing (PEJ) on the basis of master-slave (M-S) which is formed in the IIoT environment. Assume that computations for system dispatch are performed by an upper layer however a lower layer calculates proper control proceedings for the PEJ. A decentralized multi-agent system (MAS) realizes the upper layer of intelligent control on the basis of communication. The layer has 2 control mechanisms: economic dispatch and MAS power balance control. Numerous operating, controlling, and planning to be in the energy industry pay special attention to Blockchain technology. In addition to allowing a common and distributed database, Blockchain technology (B.CT) enables safe, automated, transparent, and economic operations in power distribution systems. If a hacker manipulates and alters the data exchanged between agents, it will result in disrupting system performance in terms of economy and stability MG voltage profile, load distribution, optimized parameters including cost, environmental pollution, and unit output. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the cyber security of AC smart MG and increase the security of data measured in the sensors and the transaction data between agents. In this paper, B.CT is presented to secure the exchanged data against malicious cyber-attacks in an AC smart MG whose control layers are M-S organized. The simulated system consists of the MG with several distributed generation units that examine cyber-attack points and then compare the results in normal mode and cyber-attack mode and B.CT is presented to increase the cyber security of AC smart MG.}
