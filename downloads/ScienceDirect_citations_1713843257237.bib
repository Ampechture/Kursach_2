abstract = {Contemporary research into future cities tends to focus on technology, architecture and infrastructure. However, this study highlights the importance of public art projects for our future cities. Very little empirical evidence and academic studies exist to determine whether or not public art is core to the life and demand of citizens. Using a hybrid contingent valuation (CV) and wellbeing valuation (WV) survey approach (Bakhshi et al., 2015), we collected data at two public art initiatives organised by MTArt Agency. 60% of our sample audience were willing to pay at least £5 for the implementation of more public art in their local area, with 84% willing to pay at least £2, and 84% of our sample said regular public art initiatives would increase their wellbeing. A binary logistic regression model was then used to measure the extent to which Londoners are willing to pay for public art and which factors influenced their decision. This paper evaluates the potential financial support and desire from citizens towards public art in their cities. We find evidence to suggest that Londoners are willing to pay for more public art in their local area and discover a range of explanatory variables which influenced their decisions. We hope to add to the existing academic research by demonstrating a core need from the audience towards public art, particularly, a willingness to pay for public art projects to become an integral part of their city experience. It is important to understand the economic value of public art initiatives within smart cities context because it will allow policy makers, urban planners and developers to implement such initiatives in the future. With this innovative multi-disciplinary approach, we hope to enable arts projects to engage wider demographics, obtain stronger financial support and become a more meaningful integration into our urban realm.}

abstract = {In a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, a decision maker may have differing viewpoints on the relative priorities of criteria. However, traditional methods merge these viewpoints into a single one, which leads to an unrepresentative decision-making result. Several recent methods identify the multiple viewpoints of a decision maker by decomposing the decision maker’s fuzzy judgment matrix into several symmetric fuzzy subjudgment matrices, which is an inflexible strategy. To enhance flexibility, this study proposed a fuzzy geometric mean (FGM) decomposition-based fuzzy MCDM method in which FGM is applied to decompose a fuzzy judgment matrix into several fuzzy subjudgment matrices that can be asymmetric. These fuzzy subjudgment matrices are diverse and more consistent than the original fuzzy judgment matrix. The proposed methodology was applied to select the best choice from a group of smart technology applications for supporting mobile health care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the experimental results, the proposed methodology provided a novel approach to decomposing fuzzy judgment matrices and produced more diverse fuzzy subjudgment matrices.}

abstract = {The holistic concept of smart cities has been adopted to increase economic, environmental, and social sustainability. For the sustainable health of a smart city inhabitant, there is a requirement for innovations in implementing health solutions. Given the exponential growth of the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) in health infrastructures, bulk amounts of health-related data are accumulated in Personal Health Records (PHR) and processed in storage data centers. One of the major challenges in this scenario is the security of this enormous medical data. The conventional encryption schemes generate single cipher images making the cryptosystem vulnerable to single-point attacks. This paper evaluates a distributed security module for the clinical images that form 80% of the health data. We utilize the Rivest Cipher 6 (RC6) encryption algorithm with a Computational Secret Sharing Scheme (CSIS) for distributed storage of clinical images. The key is shared using a Perfect Secret Sharing (PSS) scheme. We show that (k-1) key-shares and the 'n' image shares can be made public because of the perfect security of the scheme. The rest of the key shares can be secured using the Deoxyribonucleic Acid substitution (DNA substitution) method. Analysis of the shares generated reveals the strength of the cryptosystem and gives an insight into the degree of security provided to the health-related data. The entropy of the generated shares is higher than 7.99, and structural similarity (SSIM) values are negligible. The Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) values are greater than 99.55% for all the shares that show a high diffusion measure. Comparison with state-of-the-art schemes reveals and validates the robustness of the cryptosystem.}

Herein, considering the adhesive fastness and dispersibility of the conductive layer, an attempt was made to introduce chitosan quaternary ammonium salt (HACC) onto polyethylene terephthalate non-woven (PET non-woven fabrics) substrate through cation-π interactions and then loaded with conductive and well-dispersed MXene. The fabric has satisfactory electrical conductivity (1.77 × 10−2 Ω.m), fast electro-thermal conversion performance, and photothermal conversion performance (surface temperature up to 80.0 °C at a supply voltage of 4 V and light intensity of 300 mW/cm2) due to the continuous conductive network formed by the MXene-wrapped PET fibrics. In addition, the antimicrobial efficiency of the non-woven fabric against Escherichia coli (E. coli) could reach 99.99% under the synergistic effect of HACC and MXene and simulated sunlight irradiation at 300 mW/cm2. At the same time, MXene forms a dense protective layer when burned, which improves the flame retardant properties of the fabric. As a result, this intelligent non-woven fabric demonstrates limitless potential for creating adaptable wearable technology that may satisfy users' needs for a variety of uses.}

I follow other critical analyses in recognizing the centrality of innovation processes in generating smart farming products, services, arrangements, and problematic outcomes. I subsequently use insights from critical human geography scholarship on the significance of understanding topological transformations to move beyond interpretations that identify only a narrow range of smart farming problems, such as a lack of coordination or limited uptake by farmers. Instead, I examine a broader set of challenges produced by smart farming developments. The overriding concern, I argue, is that smart farming unfolds via the production of numerous ‘misconfigured innovations.’ Using insights from literature on responsible research and innovation I then probe the stakes of looking beyond the misconfigured innovations of smart farming and discuss how new technologies might come to play a role in producing emancipatory smart farming. I pay attention to research on the ‘internet of people,’ which paints a stark new picture of social life generally, and in particular how rural life might be computed and calculated according to new conceptualizations of sociality and spatiality.}

To this end, this research work is an inclination toward controlling the miner’s energy consumption based on a realistic and efficacious two-stage energy mechanism toward the distributed energy concept and optimal placement of data mining devices. In this circumstance, such a new structure allows miners to mainly sustain their hash rates as a prominent index for security achievement and optimally decrease their cost. This paper suggests a novel distributed model for miners coincided with the smart electrical grid getting inspired by the Prima-Dual Method of Multipliers (PDMM) based distributed approach to settle down the needed power bartering between miners and energy supply resources. In addition, for a similar purpose, it seems to reach the ideal resolution needs to perform the modified reaffirmation of miners (the mining pool) within the secured grid. To execute this task, this research recommends the Intelligent Priority Selection (IPS) techniques as well.

BST thin films were fabricated using chemical solution deposition methods followed by spin coating with a variety of mole fractions. We assumed that changes in the lattice parameters of its tetragonal crystal structure caused by variations in the mole fraction result in different ions displacement characteristics that induce charges polarization in the crystal structure. We have confirmed that the BST thin film with mole fraction x  = 0.500 was the best thin film for the light sensor in this prototype. Furthermore, it has been found that the smart street lighting gives ∼69.23 % power saving and lower power usage than a conventional street lighting. Additionally, this developed system has successfully reported the lamp status that is to be maintained to an Android phone of the maintainer by using a short message system.

In the proposed system, the dynamic demand based pricing policy for the vehicle owners is proposed using types of vehicles, time of demand and geographical locations. The vehicles’ social welfare and utility are maximized using an optimal scheduling method along with the proposed pricing policy. Also, the vehicle owners’ privacy is protected by applying differential privacy in the proposed consensus energy management algorithm. The numerical analyses show that 89.23% reduction in energy price is achieved as compared to 83.46%, 73.86% and 53.07% for multi-parameter pricing scheme (MPPS), fixed pricing scheme and time-of-use pricing scheme (ToU), respectively. Applying the proposed scheme, the owners can achieve about 81.46% reduction in their operating cost as compared to 80.48%, 69.75% and 68.29% for MPPS, fixed pricing scheme and ToU, respectively. Moreover, the proposed system is 60.32% secure as compared to 39.67% for MPPS system. Furthermore, using less information loss against considerable background knowledge of an attacker, higher privacy protection of vehicles is attained.}

Today, there is a large variety of hardware and software to choose from that is easy to set up and use. Even though there is an increasing number of real-world applications that employ large deployments of IoT devices, the wireless nature of communication in combination with the low-end capabilities of the devices raises security and privacy issues that have not been properly addressed. Considering also that sensor node brands are very different in their capabilities, providing a single solution is very challenging. In this paper we adopt Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as an attractive alternative to conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation on constrained devices where the major computational resources, i.e., speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication protocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels with traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. We provide a generic implementation of ECC that runs on different host operating systems, such as Contiki, TinyOS, iSenseOS, ScatterWeb and Arduino. Furthermore, it runs on smartphone platforms such as Android and iPhone and also any linux based systems (e.g., raspberryPi). Our implementation does not contain any platform-specific specializations, allowing a single implementation to run natively on heterogeneous networks. We look into the Smart Parking application domain and provide a solution that protects the privacy of the users by totally avoiding the exchange of confidential information. We also show how to protect a user’s privacy by adapting the tool of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) with our ECC implementation. We study the performance of our system in an real-world outdoor IoT testbed and analyze the execution time and network overhead for each available hardware platform. Our code is available as open source software and can be used from developers who wish to achieve certain levels of security and privacy in their applications.}

The estimation task is carried out by means of a bank of switching observers and corresponding sensors. One observer at a time is selected from the bank and put in order. Such a selection is based on a recently developed multi-agent reputation mechanism for a class of networked systems. As one of its merits, this methodology is capable to reveal those sensors that have the highest information contents (Quality of Service) on the basis of their reputation (trust) shared among agents.}

abstract = {We used a Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model to evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on transit ridership. We accessed smart-card data from Miyazaki City, Japan. We defined attributes based on card types (commuters, students and elders) and aggregated attributes (high-frequency users and “frequently used bus-stop pairs”) and analyzed the differences between all users and the extracted groups. Among card types, the short-term impact on elders was almost identical to that of all users, however, the short-term impact of the pandemic on commuters was much smaller and that of students was much larger than that of all users. The long-term trend of commuters was less fluctuated than that of all users. The long-term ridership recovery of students was higher than that of all users. Among aggregated attributes, the short-term impact was smaller on “high-frequency users” than on all users: the decrease in ridership immediately after the appearance of COVID-19 was smaller among “high-frequency users” than among all users. The long-term recoveries in the riderships of the extracted subsets were slower than the recoveries of riderships of all users.}

The platform is to improve temporarily challenging situations ‘right-in-time’, help to solve continuous problematic conditions in the buildings and provide a scientific data infrastructure for better political decision-making. Furthermore, the paper suggests that research in active public organizations (‘living labs’) unfolds in erratic and dynamic trajectories, and in order to attain comprehensive understanding and reach innovative solutions, involved actors need to explore and intertwine diverse technical, social, political and organizational circumstances.

The modernization of agricultural methods is essential to increase production rates and preserve natural resources. Smart agriculture provides resources that can enhance farming tasks by efficiently controlling actuators, optimizing utility and resource use, managing production, maximizing profit, and minimizing costs. For these technologies to become popular, they must have a high level of reliability and safety. To improve the reliability in Smart Agriculture, this paper proposes CEIFA, a low-cost, hybrid anomaly detector capable of identifying failures, faults, errors and attacks that impact these systems. CEIFA operates on local or remote cloud servers, filtering data sent by agricultural system sensors. It can operate on resource-restricted devices and save financial resources related to computing costs. Real tests on a set of faults, failures, and errors point to an efficiency greater than 95% in anomaly detection.}

To avoid the need to find power sources for a huge number of such smart meters, they are expected to operate on batteries and the batteries should be able to last for a long time to avoid frequent battery replacements. The operation office of these smart meters needs to collect their usage data periodically for billing purposes. In this work, we used wake-up radios (WuR) and a drone to design and implement a wakeup and data collection system to collect the usage data of smart meters. In our system, smart meters are powered off most of the time to save their battery power. When our drone approaches them and sends out a wake-up signal (WuS) packet, they will be powered on, send their usage data to the drone, and then be powered off. We have conducted real-life experiments to evaluate the performance of our system under different conditions. We measured the wakeup and data transfer success probability, the wakeup and data transfer delay, the amount of data that can be transferred while the drone is flying over a smart meter, and the power saving ratio for a smart meter. Experimental results show that our approach works well and can reduce the energy consumption of a smart meter by a factor of 180 when the data collection cycle is more than 10 days. Even if the data collection cycle is shortened to only 1 day, the energy consumption can still be reduced by a factor of 145.}

IoT is one of the essential pillars in smart systems, as it connects sensor devices to perform various basic tasks. The smart irrigation system included those sensors for monitoring water level, irrigation efficiency, climate, etc. Smart irrigation is based on smart controllers and sensors as well as some mathematical relations. In addition, this work illustrated the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and robots, where they can be achieved several functions such as harvesting, seedling, weed detection, irrigation, spraying of agricultural pests, livestock applications, etc. real-time using IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML) and wireless communications. Moreover, this work demonstrates the importance of using a 5G mobile network in developing smart systems, as it leads to high-speed data transfer, up to 20 Gbps, and can link a large number of devices per square kilometer. Although the applications of smart farming in developing countries are facing several challenges, this work highlighted some approaches the smart farming. In addition, the implementation of Smart Decision Support Systems (SDSS) in developing countries supports the real-time analysis, mapping of soil characteristics and also helps to make proper decision management. Finally, smart agriculture in developing countries needs more support from governments at the small farms and the private sector.}

While smartness is improved by the integration of information, this also leads to complexity. In this paper, smart manufacturing enterprises are modeled as a complex adaptive system with resiliency as a property. Resiliency is indicated by the enterprises’ ability to comprehensively understand risks and adapt to changes, and information integration plays an important role. A systematic literature review reveals that the current perspectives on manufacturing resiliency are narrow as they are concentrated on isolated parts of the manufacturing process and do not account for enterprise-wide risks that are typical to a smart manufacturing enterprise. An expanded set of risk sources is important for resiliency and information integration has a key role to play in reducing these risks. The complex adaptive systems lens employed in the paper prescribes a five-part framework to organize key risk sources including: external environment, internal environment, manufacturing processes, technology; and demand-supply networks. Additionally, for each key risk source, the role of integrated information is discussed. Lastly, complexity of a single function (logistics) is described and the rational for a CAS view is provided.}

abstract = {Extensive research has been conducted on e-tourism spanning a wide range of concepts, challenges and concerns discussed in tourism recommender systems (TRS). Smart tourism can be considered a logical progression from e-tourism laid with the extensive adoption of information and communication technologies and connecting the physical and digital worlds by taking advantage of 12 ‘smart key concepts’ such as privacy protection, Internet of Things and augmented reality, among others. Consequently, several disparate types of research have existed in various classes of TRS that have accomplished smart key concepts where others have failed. However, such piecemeal development is insufficient for a pragmatic smart tourism solution. Accordingly, the current study complements the academic literature with a systematic review that covers all main aspects of the e-tourism management system applied to the smart tourism concepts over the last eight years of publication. This study also provides a state-of-the-art e-tourism data management classification taxonomy based on smart concepts and reviews works in different fields against that classification. To this end, we reviewed the ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science databases. A total of 1240 papers were collected from 2013 to 2020. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion criteria. Finally, 65 articles were selected and classified into two categories. The first category includes smart-based TRS that accounts for 87.70% (n = 57/65) and classified into four approaches: collaborative filtering, content model, context model and hybrid model. The second category includes tourism marketing that accounts for 12.30% (n = 8/65). This multi-field systematic review has exposed new research opportunities, motivations, recommendations and challenges and limitations that need attention for the synergistic smart integration of interdisciplinary studies. The reliability and acceptability of smart-based TRS approach from the implemented 12 smart key concepts show a significant difference. Analysis shows that the content model-based approach has a highly important effect on smart e-tourism, i.e., applying numerous smart key concepts in higher mean (40.2%). Results of several past studies that used a content model-based approach were nearly perceived as smart e-tourism. The smartly achieved key concepts for hybrid and context-based approaches have approximate means of (37.9%) and 36.6%, respectively, thereby confirming results. The results of tourism marketing and collaborative filtering approaches are worse than the previously reported results, achieving means of (33.3%) and (30.3%), respectively. This study is a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in providing avenues and valuable information for future research. This study is also expected to address the ambiguity of e-tourism and smart tourism trends.}

However, the data collection brings huge communication pressure to electric utilities. In this context, considering that different types of devices have different power consumption patterns, and different types of data compression methods have their own applicable scenarios, we propose a divide-and-conquer method for compression and reconstruction of smart meter data. First, based on algorithm of voice activity detection (VAD), a load power fluctuation segment location method is proposed, which is combined with load event detection method to divide the load data into the event segments, fluctuation segments, and steady-state segments. Then, for the fluctuation segments, a cloud-device collaboration adaptive strategy based on the compressive sensing (CS) theory is designed, in which the sparse basis and measurement matrix are updated accordingly to ensure the high reconstruction accuracy in different scenarios. For the steady-state segments, a data compression method based on the improved symbolic aggregation approximation (SAX) is established, in which the dividing rectangle (DIRECT) algorithm and the irregular time partitioning method are combined to reduce the data volume for transmission without losing important information. For the event segments, the original data values are retained since the event power curves are relatively more complex and short duration. Finally, the received compressed data are reconstructed into the original power time series data in the master station on cloud to support advanced data analytics. Comparative experiments are conducted on the private and public datasets of 12 households in North America and China. The results show that our method has higher data reconstruction accuracy and compression efficiency compared to the existing methods.}

As such, it is mainly oriented towards the evaluation of multi-energy grid supervision strategies, that is, energy management, and the corresponding policies and legal organization. The main goal is then to highlight the various possible behaviors and strategies to organize the probable future interconnections between the different energy carriers. In particular, it aims at investigating how to maximize the use of renewable energy sources (RES), using Demand Side Management (DSM) techniques and energy storage, in a shared economy context. The open-source tool PEACEFULNESS, written in Python, is described here in detail. It combines a top-down description of the energy networks and connections between the various agents (energy providers, distribution system operators, aggregators, consumers, producers, prosumers, etc.), together with a techno-economic bottom-up description for all devices. Here, both public databases and users’ data (basic heating demands or based on building modeling) can be used, as well as generic or more specific models (e.g., PV panels with constant or temperature-dependent efficiency). One of its major unique features compared with other tools is that it extends the use of DSM techniques to various energy grids which can also interact together. Furthermore, different economic models can be set for both the aggregators and the customers, and even within these groups. As a last competitive advantage, PEACEFULNESS allows the user to simulate the operation and supervision of tens up to hundreds of thousands of agents. It also provides a reporting system giving access to all the data, with a configurable granularity and frequency for the retained indicators. Finally, several validation cases are presented, followed by a series of test cases with increasing size: a smart home, a smart district (2 000 dwellings) and a smart community (50 000 dwellings).}

In the HC sector, data security and privacy are the prime concern in which the alteration in data values as sensors could modify the diagnosis process, which may cause serious health problems. The immutability and transparency of the blockchain make it a viable option for the safe storage and management of healthcare data. However, the Cloud Storage Server (CSS), consensus latency, majority attacks, Byzantine problem, uncomfortable data Throughput (TP), et cetera, make the blockchain vulnerable to healthcare data transmission. To solve the current disadvantages, a secure IoT was introduced in healthcare using Brooks Iyengar Quantum Byzantine Agreement-centered Blockchain Networking (BIQBA-BCN). This study ensures the sincerity and equity of health data exchange. Based on Blum Blum Shub and Okamoto Uchiyana Cryptosystem (OUCS) mutual authentica1tion, the proposed work provides an OUCS-based mutual authentication system (BBS-OUC). Attackers are prevented from entering the BCN, ensuring the storage remains trustworthy. In addition, the Key Weight Block Function-Quasi-Cyclic Moderate Density Parity Check (KWBF-QCMDPC) algorithm safeguards the confidentiality and dependability of IoT user data. The cryptosystem technique protects sensitive data when the blockchain platform is distributed. The proposed methodology, known as BIQBA-BCN, results in a security level that is %94 effective. Finally, the BIQBA-BC consensus mechanism is used to distribute data to the corresponding Hospital Server (HS). By achieving a higher data TP, lower delay, higher Success Rate (SR), shorter consensus latency, and node communication time, the experimental results show that the proposed methodology is exceptionally safe against assaults and highly scalable.}

The program provided a sample of students between the ages of 15 to 18 a laptop and their household’s free access to unlimited broadband internet for up to two years. The digitally excluded are typically framed as lacking in abilities and access (Thomas et al., 2019), and as those for whom the costs of digital inclusion are too high to achieve (Ogle and Musolino, 2016, Ogle, 2017). Rarely, if ever, are those in low income households or those considered to be digitally marginalised imagined to also live in smart homes. Using experiences described in our data, we show how the uses of smart home technologies in these low-income households fit and contradict current understandings of both smart homes and digital inclusion; and contribute understandings of how those in low-income households experience automated technologies through the intersection of social and economic infrastructures.}

The bibliometric analysis of 364 academic papers shows that smart building is a burgeoning, interdisciplinary field with a relatively high international collaboration level. Keyword's clustering identified two major themes: (1) IoT, WSN, and cloud computing for automation control and (2) the balance between energy efficiency and human comfort based on continuous monitoring and machine learning. The content analysis statistically detected a transition from the cyber-physical system (CPS) to the human-cyber-physical system (HCPS) in smart building research. We therefore proposed an HCPS framework with three dimensions—cyber-physical scale, human needs, and human roles—to summarize current research and discover potential gaps. Under this framework, five HCPS future research directions for occupants-centered smart buildings were proposed: adaptive building envelope, integrated building management system, enhanced building energy management, adaptive thermal comfort, and microgrid adoption.}

abstract = {Digitalization is a driving force behind the ongoing energy industrial revolutions, catalyzing China's pursuit of carbon neutrality and sustainable development. Leveraging provincial data and annual reports from energy enterprises in China, this study constructs a comprehensive analytical framework that encompasses benchmark regression models, mediating effect models, threshold models, and spatial econometric models. These models are utilized to investigate the multi-faceted impacts of energy digitalization on carbon productivity (CP). The aim is to furnish micro-level evidence and policy guidance for advancing energy transformation and fostering low-carbon development enriched with digital elements. This research employs natural language processing and machine learning techniques to compute an Energy Digitalization Index, examining two critical dimensions: digital industry investment and the inclination toward digital transformation. The following key findings emerge: firstly, energy digitalization (ED) exhibits a statistically significant ability to enhance regional CP, a phenomenon marked by temporal and regional variations. Secondly, the analysis confirms the transmission mechanisms associated with energy technology innovation, energy structure, and energy utilization efficiency, as revealed through the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method. Furthermore, the optimal effect of energy digitalization on low-carbon economies materializes in settings characterized by mature market conditions, modest environmental regulations, advanced digital infrastructure, and reduced resource dependency. Additionally, the spatial Markov chain analysis unveils a conspicuous spatial distribution pattern termed “club convergence” in regional CP, accompanied by a pronounced “Matthew effect.” According to the spatial Durbin model, energy digitalization generates favorable spatial spillover effects, primarily in peripheral regions, with a more pronounced short-term influence. Building upon these insights, this paper presents pertinent policy recommendations encompassing the national “digital energy” strategy, regional differentiation policies, and initiatives to stimulate digital technology innovation among enterprises. Our findings furnish robust empirical evidence and constructive policy insights, empowering governments to forge a smarter and cleaner energy ecosystem. Furthermore, these findings offer valuable guidance for other developing nations seeking to implement effective digital strategies.}

This paper analyzes 468 articles on the topic of smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts and identifying intellectual structures and emerging trends. Using exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, six different strands of research are identified that concern technical, social, economic and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law. The interrelations between these groups and individual high-impact publications are visualized using social network analysis. A structured overview of the main strands of research concerning smart contracts, their development over time, the relevance of smart contract platforms in research, and conceptual connections between publications and discourses is obtained. Based on the results, starting points for future research are derived, which offer researchers and practitioners a substantial basis for their work on smart contracts.}

In this perspective, transfer learning aims to improve the performance of a target learner exploiting knowledge in related environments. The present work provides a comprehensive overview of transfer learning applications in smart buildings, classifying and analyzing 77 papers according to their applications, algorithms, and adopted metrics. The study identified four main application areas of transfer learning: (1) building load prediction, (2) occupancy detection and activity recognition, (3) building dynamics modeling, and (4) energy systems control. Furthermore, the review highlighted the role of deep learning in transfer learning applications that has been used in more than half of the analyzed studies. The paper also discusses how to integrate transfer learning in a smart building’s ecosystem, identifying, for each application area, the research gaps and guidelines for future research directions.}

With access to data from multiple sources, manufacturers can provide on-demand and customised products. However, existing research of smart customisation has focused on data generated from the physical world, not virtual models. As physical data is constrained by what has already occurred, it is limited in the identification of new areas to improve customer satisfaction. A new technology called digital twin aims to achieve this integration of physical and virtual entities. Incorporation of digital twin into the paradigm of existing data-driven smart customisation will make the process more responsive, adaptable and predictive. This paper presents a new framework of data-driven smart customisation augmented by digital twin. The new framework aims to facilitate improved collaboration of all stakeholders in the customisation process.

However, the current research on new digital technologies and carbon emissions is still in its infancy and lacks empirical conclusions between them. Therefore, this paper studies the impact of new digital technologies on carbon emissions, identifies its mechanism, and analyzes the regional heterogeneity of its effects. This research treats the National Big Data Comprehensive Pilot Zones pilot in China as a quasi-natural experiment for the development of new digital technologies along with city-level data covering from 2011 to 2019 to conduct a staggered difference-in-difference (DID) model analysis. We find that new digital technologies significantly reduce carbon emissions. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests such as heterogeneity treatment effect analysis, ex-ante trend test, spillover effect test, and placebo test. Additionally, new digital technologies can reduce carbon emissions by promoting the transformation of industrial structure, improving the level of green technology innovation, and promoting industrial agglomeration. At the same time, the heterogeneity analysis shows that new digital technologies' carbon emission reduction effect is more evident in non-western regions, southern regions, and large cities. To expand the carbon emission reduction effect of new digital technologies, the government should promote the development and application of new digital technologies, and implement differentiated policies based on regional characteristics.}

This contributes as well to having better life for citizen. Even with rich infrastructures, the vehicles behavior could decrease the traffic flow. This is why figure out how the mobility is done on the highways can give more details on how it can create traffic jams and then several solutions could be proposed to contribute to the improvements. This is the goal of this study. In this paper, a new stochastic model based on Markov chain is proposed, which represents the behaviors of overtaking on the highways. A full description of the model is given with numerical resolution to calculate several rewards such as delays and congestion. Intensive simulations were carried out to compare both simulations and analytical model results and to provide results for more complex configurations.}

Given this, most waste bins get overfilled easily because of the improper management of waste and the irregular cleaning of waste bins. The internet of things (IoT) is a remarkable modern technology that offers powerful resolutions to modernize traditional systems. In this study, the filling level of waste bins is considered in conjunction with IoT-based waste bins. This paper develops an integrated IoT-based smart bin allocation with a central monitoring system (CMS) and enhanced vehicle routing algorithm in solid waste management. This article proposes the time-dependent penalty concept to waste management authorities if these waste bins are not emptied in time after becoming full. To obtain the solution with faster execution time, an intelligent variable neighborhood search with ant colony optimization method (VNS- ACO) is developed. The proposed model is illustrated with some numerical data, and a sensitivity analysis is established with some parameters. Furthermore, the superiority of our developed VNS-ACO algorithm is established through testing on some traveling salesman problem (TSP) instances in the traveling salesman problem library (TSPLIB). Results have been compared with an advanced version of genetic algorithm (GA) and ACO methods.}

Yet, semantic differences between the prevailing building ontologies hamper their purpose of bringing data interoperability and restrict the ability to reuse building ontologies in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose and adopt a framework to conduct a systematic comparison and evaluation of four popular building ontologies (Brick Schema, RealEstateCore, Project Haystack, and Digital Buildings) from both axiomatic design and assertions in a use case, namely the Terminological Box (TBox) evaluation and the Assertion Box (ABox) evaluation. In the TBox evaluation, we use the SQuaRE-based Ontology Quality Evaluation (OQuaRE) framework and concede that Project Haystack and Brick Schema are more compact with respect to the ontology axiomatic design. In the ABox evaluation, we apply an empirical study with sample building data that suggests Brick Schema and RealEstateCore have greater completeness and expressiveness in capturing the main concepts and relations within the building domain. The results indicate that there is no universal building ontology for integrating Linked Building Data (LBD). We also discuss ontology compatibility and investigate building ontology design patterns (ODPs) to support ontology matching, alignment, and harmonisation.}

This has led to the concept of a zero-waste circular economy (CE), which is gaining increasing attention in both developed and emerging economies. The textile industry, in particular, has a significant environmental impact due to the use of toxic chemicals and the production of toxic waste throughout the clothing value chain. While the textile industry in emerging economies is increasingly attempting to transition to a CE model by implementing Smart Waste Management Systems (SWMS), challenges persist due to the complex industry structure involving numerous stakeholders, changing consumer behavior, and lack of strong standards. To address this significant issue, this study addresses challenges faced by the textile industry in adopting SWMS, specifically in the context of an emerging economy. To systematically identify the significant challenges and analyze strategies to address these challenges, a research framework using a hybrid approach, namely the grey Analytical Network Process (ANP), has been developed. The study uses a case study of the textile industry in Bangladesh to validate the effectiveness of the framework. The findings suggest efficient monitoring and control of waste recovery is the most critical step in adopting SWMS. This study offers detailed and comparative insights into the framework of implementing SWMS in the textile industry. Additionally, this research is the first to undertake an analytical decision approach to map challenges and strategies in implementing SWMS. The study outcomes will be beneficial for industry practitioners to ensure efficient monitoring and control of waste recovery and help the industry move towards a sustainable CE.}

In this paper, metal ions adsorption induced aggregation strategy is proposed to solve this contradiction. The intelligent magnetic fluid designed in this study is a well-dispersed fluid state when treating sewage, and can efficiently adsorb heavy metal ions in wastewater with high adsorption capacity and ultra-fast adsorption kinetics. More importantly, after saturation of adsorption, the magnetic fluid will transform from a well-dispersed fluid state to an agglomeration state which is easy to precipitate and separate via external magnetic field. In a simple and effective way, the particles size of magnetic nanoparticles was precisely controlled by cellulose derivatives modification to obtain a stable magnetic fluid in water. The Freundlich model best described Cu2+ adsorption on magnetite nanoparticles, the correlation coefficients from the Cu2+ adsorption on the two magnetic fluids are 0.9554 and 0.9336, n are 1.868 and 2.117, revealing a favorable adsorption of Cu2+ onto magnetic fluids. The pseudo second-order model fitted the adsorption kinetic data better, the qe are 0.1948 and 0.1315 mmol/g and the R2 are 0.9999, indicating that the adsorption of Cu2+ onto the magnetic fluid was dominated by chemisorption. Moreover, the removal rate of Cu2+ in tap water and lake water was more than 97.1%, and the removal rate of large volume sewage was 81.7%. The synthetic magnetic fluid has high adsorption capacity, ultra-fast adsorption kinetics, reusability and easy separation, indicating its potential application for the removal of heavy metal ions from large-volume sewage.}

Mainly located in urban areas, these facilities seek to make means of production, to design, prototype and repair all kinds of objects available to the citizens. These practices have been supported by activists of the “democratization” of digital manufacturing spearheaded by the maker movement. Urban authorities have gradually been won over by the these activits’ promises to encourage entrepreneurship, generate new knowledge, mobilize citizens and even transform the perceptions of and the way in which manufacturing is conducted in the city. However, these activists’ attractive discourse overly mechanically equates the accessibility of these digital tools to the idea of empowerment. Under what conditions can these practices of making lead to an increase in citizens’ individual and collective power to act, or even to social change? This article aims to answer this question by firstly constructing an analytical framework of makerspaces empowerment, and secondly by analysing the case of the public network of makerspaces in Barcelona: the Ateneus de Fabricació. To do so, our qualitative research will be based on the documentary analysis of official publications, direct observations carried out at the aforementioned workshops, and in-depth interviews with key players Barcelona makerspaces’ scene. Our results will demonstrate that in the context of smart cities, the public acceptance of these places leads to the transformation of administrative practices. Free access to public makerspaces is accompanied by a change in the relationship between public organizations and users in order to promote the empowerment of the inhabitants of Barcelona thanks to these fabrication practices.}

Smart cities, buildings, parkings, emergency services are appearing, where control over energy consumption and better sustainability are coupled with an improvement of the comfort of occupants. In this paper, we address the problem of energy optimization in smart buildings, considering both the planning and operational aspects. Specifically, the first aim is to propose an optimal deployment of the WSN inside a building. For this, we present a model able to identify the optimal locations for different types of sensors and gateways, by optimizing energy consumption while fulfilling connectivity, resource, protection, and clustering coverage constraints. Once the IoT system is deployed, we address the problem of how the building actually functions, according to the behaviour of the occupants. In particular, we propose a Building Management System (BMS) capable of efficiently and automatically manage the building elements using human behavioural models, thus lowering the overall building energy consumption whilst maintaining acceptable levels of comfort.}

abstract = {Changes in the global energy landscape have increased the importance of research on energy management methods in the power grid. In particular, Demand Side Management (DSM) at consumers is attracting worldwide attention. Distributed generation in intelligent consumers, such as Smart Houses (SH), contributes to the introduction of new distributed generation from the demand side by determining optimal scheduling. However, Fuel-cells (FC) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are expensive, and their installation is a significant burden for the demand side. Therefore, this paper proposes a Smart Apartment Building (SAB) model in which multiple distributed power sources are shared by multiple consumers to reduce operation costs and carbon emissions through the implementation of highly efficient operation methods. An important aspect of such a study is to understand the characteristics of the demand side and to propose an operating method that takes into account the preferences of the demand side. In this paper, to provide a variety of options, a Pareto front is generated through multi-objective optimization to reduce the total cost and carbon dioxide emissions of the model. The optimal component capacity is also considered at the same time. A Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based optimization algorithm is then developed to achieve highly efficient operation, thus contributing to the reduction of the two objectives. As a result, in a compromise between the two conflicting objectives, the MPC algorithm successfully reduces operation costs by 44.4% and carbon dioxide emissions by 54.7% compared to the original case.}

This paper constructs a GTD evaluation system from the perspective of prevention and governance at the source, in terms of carbon reduction, pollution reduction, green expansion and growth, and measures the GTD performance of 281 cities based on the EW-TOPSIS model. It is found that the average increase in GTD of the sample cities from 2006 to 2020 is 3.40 %, the GTD progress of the 281 cities has a considerable positive spatial autocorrelation, with the GTD progress of the CETS pilot cities being significantly bigger than that of the non-pilot cities. Further this paper adopts the spatial difference model (S-DID) to scientifically identify the influence mechanism and heterogeneity of the direct and spatial effects of CETS on city GTD, and the results show that CETS has a positive effect on the GTD of both local and neighboring cities. Propensity score matching (PSM) is used to further corroborate these findings. The study also shows that CETS improves local GTD by promoting green innovation, rationalizing industrial structures, and enhancing energy efficiency in cities. Nevertheless, the ensuing siphon effect hinders nearby cities' levels of energy efficiency, industrial structure rationalization, and green innovation. The policy effects of CETS are more significant in large cities, eastern cities, old industrial areas, and non-resource-based cities. CETS can work in synergy with smart city construction, low-carbon city pilot policies, and emission trading policies to accelerate the process of GTD.}

abstract = {Smart buildings aim to create a safe, comfortable and sustainable environment for the occupants while increasing the energy performance of the building to reduce the environmental footprint and operational cost. Towards this direction, the use of model-based digital twins able to simulate key aspects of the building is important. Despite the utilization of various digital twin approaches for smart buildings in recent years, most of these approaches mainly focus on one aspect of the building, such as indoor environmental quality or energy consumption. This observation necessitates the development of a virtual but realistic and non-invasive environment able to simulate all the key domains of the building, including indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy consumption. Towards this direction, this work proposes an architecture for smart buildings investigations, that emulates the thermal comfort, air-quality, and electricity consumption of the building, while considering the activities and behavior of occupants. For simulating the building operations, ordinary differential equations and power balance modeling are incorporated to facilitate real-time or faster than real-time digital twin approaches, while computational fluid dynamics modeling is used complementarily, to enable higher granularity simulations for offline analysis. Both models have been validated in a real building achieving less than 1% average zone temperature error between the simulation models and the actual building sensor measurements. Furthermore, a user-friendly software platform has been developed and integrated with the proposed architecture, where multiple important features and characteristics have been included to enable various investigations. In particular, the developed platform enables physical and simulated building integration, model calibration using field measurements, experimental configuration and management, execution of novel what-if investigations, and evaluation of novel algorithms using hardware-in-the-loop configurations. The proposed architecture is applied in a physical building, allowing the demonstration of several investigations and the execution of interesting use-cases.}

As a key element for smart buildings, solar shading devices coupled with effective control systems need to be strategically assessed. The investment decision-making process for selecting the proper shading systems is influenced by the existence of potential conflicts from economic, environmental, social, and energy standpoints, thus asking to be supported by innovative methodological approaches able to include all these aspects in the decisional framework. To this purpose, the work aims to propose a multi-disciplinary methodological framework to support decision-makers in ranking a set of solar shading device and relative control strategy, integrating energy dynamic simulations with multi-criteria decision analysis techniques. The analysis focuses on office buildings, recognizing their huge impact in terms of energy consumptions and the need to guarantee proper indoor conditions to increase employees’ productivity and well-being. To test the applicability of the multi-step methodology for this building category, the proposed approach is applied to an office building located in the North-West of Italy, aiming to assess and compare different alternative combinations of shadings devices and management strategies. The advanced features of building energy modelling and simulation and the application of PROMETHEE II (Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation II) method as multi-criteria analysis allows to provide recommendations to decision-makers to identify the systems to be installed, able to guarantee the best trade-off between internal comfort, operational energy, and environmental costs for the building under investigation.}

Reliable ULUR results are essential for urban management and planning applications. A key limitation of current ULUR solutions is that they cannot identify land usage classes that are not included in the training data (i.e., untrained classes). To address this limitation, this study investigates a new class-wise sparse ULUR problem in which the goal is to learn an accurate ULUR model that can effectively identify the land usage classes of images of the untrained classes. Two critical challenges exist in resolving this problem: (i) How can the ULUR model learn the unknown class-specific visual characteristics for untrained classes without ground truth labels? (ii) How can we effectively generalize the ULUR model from trained classes to untrained ones given the excessive and fine-grained object details in the images? This paper proposes SparseLand, an active one-shot learning approach, to address these challenges using a novel duo-branch deep recognition framework. The results of a real-world ULUR application demonstrated that SparseLand clearly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with the highest ULUR accuracy under different application scenarios.}

A secure and trusted mechanism can provide peace of mind for users, especially in smart homes where a large number of IoT devices are used. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) provide promising results for detecting any security attacks on smart applications. However, due to the complex nature of the model used for this technique, it is not easy for common users to trust ANN-based security solutions. Also, the selection of the right hyperparameters for ANN architecture plays a crucial role in the accurate detection of security attacks. This paper proposes Multi-tiered ANN Model for Intrusion Detection (MAMID) that is a novel and scalable solution for optimal hyperparameter selection to detect security attacks with high accuracy. The explainability analysis of the predictions made by the model is also provided for establishing trust among users. The approach considers a subset of the dataset for quick, scalable and optimal selection of hyperparameters to reduce the overhead of the process of ANN architecture design. Using a very recent IoT dataset the proposed approach showed high performance for intrusion detection with 99.9%, 99.7%, and 97.7% accuracy for binary, category, and subcategory classification of attacks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous research work has been able to achieve attack detection at the subcategory level beyond 90%.}

In addition, a set of case studies illustrate practical applications of AI to improve urban sustainability. The combination of these approaches led to findings that underscore the pivotal role of AI in optimizing energy use, streamlining waste management, enhancing traffic flow, and contributing to environmental sustainability.

We develop an OPF model considering piecewise invariable load and power generation, which can be evaluated using a linear program.

On the other hand, the costs to obtain this information either with direct measures meant to add instruments on the whole network or acquiring data from international providers such as Google, TomTom, etc. is very high. The traditional modeling and computing approaches are not satisfactory since they are based on many assumptions that typically are doomed to change over time, as it occurs with traffic distribution at junctions; in short they cannot cover the whole network with the needed precision. In this paper, the above problem has been addressed providing a solution granting any traffic flow reconstruction with high precision and solving the indeterminacy of traffic distribution at junctions for large networks. The identified solution can be classified as a stochastic relaxation technique and resulted affordable on a parallel architecture based on GPU. The result has been obtained in the framework of the Sii-Mobility national project on smart city transport systems in Italy, a very large research project, and it is at present exploited in a number of cities/regions across Europe and by a number of research projects (Snap4City, TRAFAIR) of the European Commission.}

Furthermore, it investigates the moderating effect of information search on the relationship between STA attributes and perceived destination image and between perceived destination image and behavioral intention. Using the stratified and convenience sampling approaches, 1484 international tourists visiting Hong Kong participated in the survey. The results show that among six STA attributes, the attributes of smart information systems, smart sightseeing, e-commerce systems, and smart forecasting had a positive influence on tourists' perceived destination image. Consequently, tourists’ perceived destination image positively enhances their behavioral intention. Furthermore, regarding the effect of information search moderation, the less time spent on information search, the more the likelihood of a relationship between STAs and perceived destination image increases. However, the more time tourists spent on information search, the more the relationship between perceived destination image and behavioral intention increases. The findings contribute to the important STA attributes to destination image perception and the moderating role of information search. The managerial implications will be suggested to tourism authorities, destination local government, and tourism enterprises to adopt a competitive strategy at a smart destination to maintain destination competitiveness and sustainability.}

abstract = {A mathematical model has been created with the Systems Dynamics methodology. It is based on a SIR model, with the addition of auxiliary and state variables that represent hospital capacity, contacts, contacts with infected, deaths, giving, as a result, a model of four stock variables. Similarly, using piecewise functions, it was possible to model the “quarantines” or lockdowns, and the effectiveness of reduction in the contacts, Results show the decrease in infected people due to the quarantines. The model was simulated for a population of 100,000. The simulations show trends of infections that could occur in three different scenarios: A) one extended lockdown (60 days), B) two medium lockdowns of 30 days, with a 30-day smart lockdown space, and C) an initial 40-day lockdown and then a 30-day smart lockdown. All the lockdowns start on day 25 after the first reported infection. The model presents a compact structure of broad understanding and successful capture of a COVID-19 outbreak and therefore provides an overview to improve knowledge of outbreak trends and quarantine effectiveness in reducing infection.}

The smart city concept is raised simultaneously in many modern societies. IoT is always playing an important role as smart devices to support complex scenarios in smart cities. A smart toy, such as “Hello Barbie,” is a smart device consisting of a physical toy component that connects to a computing system with online services through networking to enhance the functionality of a traditional toy. In this research, we particularly studied Brazilian and Argentinian consumers’ perceived innovativeness, risks and benefits of smart toys and their purchase intention toward such toys. Results indicate that Brazilian consumers have better perception and evaluation of the toy and thus higher purchase intention than Argentinian consumers do. Such difference may be explained by the cultural differences between the two countries, such as relatively low vs. high uncertainty avoidance. We also provide our recommendations for smart toys manufacturers to address these issues for the future products.}

However, developing a robust application with high accuracy is still a challenging task mainly due to the inherent problems related to human emotions, lack of sufficient data, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel, cost-effective, and energy-efficient framework designed for suspicious activity recognition based on facial expression analysis for smart security in law-enforcement services. The Raspberry Pi camera captures the video stream and detects faces using the Viola Jones algorithm. The face region is pre-processed using Gabor filter and median filter prior to feature extraction. Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) features are then extracted and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained, which predicts the known emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise). Based on the collective emotions of the faces, we predict the sentiment behind the scene. Using this approach, we predict if a certain situation is hostile and can prevent it prior to its occurrence. The system is tested on three publically available datasets: Cohen Kande (CK+), MMI, and JAFEE. A detailed comparative analysis based on SURF, SIFT, and ORB is also presented. Experimental results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system in accurate recognition of suspicious activity compared to state-of-the-art methods and validate its superiority for enhancing security in law enforcement services.}

abstract = {With the widespread implementation of smart cards and with more travel details being recorded, travel patterns can be studied more precisely and deeply. Although considerable attention has been paid to travel patterns, the relationship between travel patterns and the functional structure of a city is yet to be well understood. In this research, we study this relationship by analysing metro passenger trip data (in Beijing and Shenzhen in China and London in the United Kingdom), and we present two unprecedented findings. First, through averaging, a linear relationship is found to exist between individual travel distance and the distance between the origin and the city centre. The underlying mechanism is a travel pattern we call “ring aggregation”, i.e., the daily movement of city passengers is aggregated into a ring (with approximately equal distances to the city centre). Then, for commuting trips, the daily travel pattern can be regarded as switching between the outer residential ring and the inner work ring. Second, this linear relationship and the ring aggregation pattern seem to be exclusive characteristics of metro systems (and may also fit other moderate- and long-distance transportation modes) but do not apply to short-distance transportation modes, such as bicycles and taxis. This finding implies that the ring aggregation pattern is a product of the relationship between travel patterns and the city functional structure at a large scope.}

Therefore, scholars and practitioners seek to make sense of how this phenomenon can be addressed concerning companies’ maturity level of supply chain smartness and sustainability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid methodology combining the Best-Worst Method (BWM) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to assess the level of maturity for supply chain smartness and sustainability by weighting the functions of supply chain management. A twin-QFD technique is used to obtain a conceptual design to determine the relationship between the functions of supply chain smartness tools and sustainability indicators to assess the level of maturity, whereas the BWM is used to determine the weights of the functions of supply chain management. A case study in the automotive manufacturing industry is applied to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The findings disclose the prominent smart technologies (simulation, big data analytics, cloud computing) and sustainability indicators (costs, lead time, and damage and loss) in integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainable supply chain practices. Findings also suggest a guideline to compare the current and targeted levels of smartness and sustainability maturity. This study provides insights for scholars and practitioners and contributes to the body of knowledge by evaluating companies’ maturity of digital transformation and sustainable practices in the supply chain functions.}

Although a variety of recommendation algorithms have been employed in this field, they ignore the massive text resources in the social internet of things, which can effectively improve the effect of recommendation. In this paper, a smart object recommendation approach named object recommendation based on topic learning and joint features is proposed. The proposed approach extracts and calculates topics and service relevant features of texts related to smart objects and introduces the “thing-thing” relationship information in the internet of things to improve the effect of recommendation.

abstract = {Thermochromic windows provide a promising and practical solution to lower building air conditioning energy via automatically reducing window-through solar radiation which imposes large cooling loads on air conditioning systems. The conventional framework for evaluating thermochromic windows assumes that the solar radiation passing through smart windows is immediately absorbed by indoor air, which ignores the deviated occupant comfort by indoor solar radiation and leads to a biased comfort-energy performance of thermochromic windows. This study proposes a novel solar-based human-centered framework to evaluate the comfort-energy performance of hydrogel thermochromic smart windows (HTSWs) via integrating human-solar modelling, solar-based indoor set-point correction, and building simulations. The comfort-energy performance of HTSWs are evaluated with different warm climates and compared to that of normal windows. The main results indicate that, the conventional framework, which ignores solar radiation on indoor human bodies, underestimates the discomfort time duration of indoor occupants by 55.0% and 75.2% when evaluating normal windows and HTSWs, respectively. Under the human-centered framework, with solar-based set-point correction, indoor occupants with HTSWs regulating solar radiation will be comfortable during more than 95% of working hours; and HTSWs reduce nearly 50% of the discomfort hours compared to normal windows. In addition, the average energy saving potential of HTSWs under the human-centered framework is extended by 35.0% compared to that under the conventional framework. To be specific, the air conditioning energy savings of HTSWs under the conventional framework are 9.9%–20.3% (average 14.5%); under the human-centered framework, the energy savings are 13.5%–25.6% (average 19.5%, which is 35% higher than that under the conventional framework). The considerably improved comfort-energy performance of HTSWs under the human-centered framework will further contribute to the wide adoption of HTSWs.}

Lots of cars on the road should spend unnecessary time and consume energy during searching for parking due to limited parking space. To cope with these limitations and give more intelligent solutions to drivers in the selection of parking facility, this study proposes a smart parking guidance algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports drivers to find the most appropriate parking facility considering real-time status of parking facilities in a city. To suggest the most suitable parking facility, several factors such as driving distance to the guided parking facility, walking distance from the guided parking facility to destination, expected parking cost, and traffic congestion due to parking guidance, are considered in the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulation tests have been carried out. The proposed algorithm helps to maximize the utilization of space resources of a city, and reduce unnecessary energy consumption and CO2 emission of wandering cars since it is designed to control the utilization of parking facility efficiently and reduce traffic congestion due to parking space search.}

The information systems in Smart Homes are mainly based on sharing information through smart devices (IoT) and embedded sensors. Each sensor generates data to be processed or assembled by a central system. This data, while being transmitted over the internet to other users or servers, can be compromised for its privacy, user confidentiality and/or service availability. This paper proposes a novel Blockchain-based solution for secure smart home systems, using a combined hyperledger fabric and hyperledger composer. This solution is designed to overcome reported security limitations in commonly used permissioned blockchains approaches. The proposed architecture contains four layers: Cloud storage, Hyperledger fabric, Hyperledger composer, and a smart home layer. Another important aspect of the proposed solution is the mapping of the attributes of a smart home to those from the hyperledger composer. This mapping allows for a customized, designed-for-purpose solution which can meet the security requirements for IoT based smart homes. The proposed architecture was implemented and tested to improve the integrity, confidentiality, availability, authorization and privacy of smart homes as well as some inherited features, including transparency and interoperability.}

This study obtains several important findings. First, we find that STL promotes smart supply chain innovation (SSCI) practices, and companies focus on those practices distinctively. Meanwhile, we find that SSCI practices promote SSCIP. Second, government support policies have positively moderated the role of STL in promoting SSCI practices. Third, the quick response strategy has positively moderated the role of SSCI practices in promoting SSCIP.}

abstract = {Buildings consume vast amounts of energy and pollute the environment in various ways. Façade is a part of building's architecture that can play a significant role in reducing energy consumption, as well as alleviating its negative environmental effects. Although using smart materials in buildings' facades can help dramatically to attain the mentioned goals, very limited studies have been conducted regarding the mentioned issues. Moreover, existing studies have investigated only a few number of smart materials simultaneously. Therefore, this research aims to conduct a wider study, identify and prioritize the most suitable building façade's smart materials according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for Shiraz, Iran. Friedman test and Analytical Hierarchy Analysis (AHP) were used to analyse data using SPSS and Expert Choice software, respectively. Produced results illustrated that “Photovoltaic materials”, “Thermochromic materials” and “Photostrictive materials” were the best alternatives for using in building's façade. Results obtained by this research can help the building industry to move through sustainability.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
The concept of responsible innovation is gaining traction in the Smart Farming field to address emerging socio-ethical issues such as power asymmetries between farmers and technology development companies in farm data ownership, and animal welfare issues arising from the automation of livestock management. Responsible innovation involves the democratisation of science and decision making for societal control of innovations. The application of responsible innovation principles to the adoption phase of Smart Farming technologies is an under explored area in terms of defining what responsible adoption practices are for Smart Farming, and with what effect.
OBJECTIVE
This empirical research aims to provide insights into what responsible adoption practices might involve, based on application of a responsible innovation approach to designing a cross-industry adoption strategy for a virtual fencing technology in Australia. This case study also examines what responsible adoption practices mean for enacting responsible innovation of Smart Farming technologies more broadly.
METHODS
A participatory Technology Assessment (pTA) approach engaged a range of virtual fencing technology end-users (livestock producers) and stakeholders (agricultural advisers, natural resource managers, food retailers, a food processor, and state government department staff) (n = 80). The participants identified and considered the benefits and risks of implementing a specific virtual fencing product in various contexts. The engagement methods were 12 interactive workshops organized in peer/sector groups and one reflective and deliberative consultation process with 13 adoption specialists and practitioners to define an adoption pathway for virtual herding technology.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The adoption of the virtual herding technology product requires multiple levels of support to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and generates private, industry and public goods. This prospective knowledge, built from the considerations of end-users and stakeholders, was integrated into a virtual herding adoption strategy, and accounted for animal welfare concerns, the empowerment of producers to lead their own adoption support network and the desire for some form of regulatory governance. The responsible adoption practices were limited by the lack of institutional pathways to mobilise the strategy beyond the life of the research project.
SIGNIFICANCE
The research indicates that there is value in further pursuing the notion of responsible adoption practices for Smart Farming technologies. These practices need to be designed for understanding the complexity of the adoption situation, testing the assumptions about what the ‘right’ adoption pathway should be, and inclusive participation in the ongoing governance of adoption pathways.}

In this chapter we discuss the design of the system known as smart helmet that has the capability to detect coronavirus automatically by using thermal imaging, which is used to capture the image with less human interaction. The thermal camera technology is integrated with smart helmets and combined with Internet of Things technology for monitoring of the screening process to get the real-time data. It is equipped with facial recognition technology; it can also display personal information of the infectee, which can automatically take temperature and can detect more infectee than normal thermal screening.}

However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.}

This paper aims to provide a distributed energy management using a relaxed consensus + innovation approach in order to converge both the trading price and the transaction power among the microgrids and smart grid. The proposed smart grid consists of the generators, and lines coincided with an IEEE 24-bus test system, and the microgrid proposed in this paper includes renewable sources of wind turbines, photovoltaic units, tidal units and storage units with the aim of satisfying the microgrid's demand loads. In addition, this paper dedicates to analyzing the effect of the uncertainty parameters of the system on the performance of the proposed negotiated approach using the point estimate method.

Smart buildings not only should contribute to reducing carbon emissions but also should be connected into urban systems in which buildings harness low-carbon energy systems. In this respect, smart buildings require special considerations to incorporate new types of technologies and systems. The method to create smart buildings should be discussed under the overarching framework of urban systems design. Buildings are also interfacing between inhabitants and cities as key nodes for networking systems in a city. How humans interact within the smart buildings are discussed.}

To address this challenge, this paper investigates active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted WPCNs, where the reflecting beamforming gain of active RIS can be utilized to enhance wireless energy and information transmissions. We formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem that jointly optimizes time-slot allocation, transmit power control, and reflection parameters of RIS. Due to the highly coupled variables and fractional structure of the energy efficiency expression, we develop an alternating optimization method to solve it through utilizing the Dinkelbach-type method and block coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gain achieved by the proposed method for active RIS-assisted WPCNs, as compared to the passive RIS-assisted method and the counterpart without the aid of RIS.}

The plant also includes control equipment and energy storage tank to insure smart operation under different climate conditions. The proposed plant can also be employed for a larger scale to provide energy demands of a district area. Thermal characteristics and economic features of the proposed plant are taken into account to assess its transient performance using TRNSYS software for a case study location in China with considering real climate conditions of ambient temperature and sun radiation. The produced electricity as well as cooling and heating duties are evaluated for different specifications of PVT panels and the storage tanks’ volumes. The plant performance is appraised in terms of total capital cost, CO2 saving ratio, and the payback period. Finally a multi-objective optimization is carried out and the Pareto frontier for three objectives is represented. It has been concluded that, under optimal operation, the proposed building energy plant has a 5 year payback period with 1.93 CO2 saving ratio and 513328 $. Also it is found that, the volume of storage tanks has a significant effect on economic indicators as well as the CO2 saving ratio.}

Commuting passengers prefer the metro due to its punctual, high speeds and uncongested characteristics compared to private cars, taxis, bus, etc., especially in morning and evening rush hour. So, identifying metro commuters and mining its commuting mobility patterns play an essential role in improving service quality, promoting public transit use, and optimizing operational scheduling. We develop a method to mine metro commuting mobility patterns using massive smart card data. Firstly, we extracted individual daily regular OD (origin and destination) based on spatio-temporal similarity measurement from massive smart card data. The information entropy gain algorithm is used to further identify commuters from individual regular OD. Secondly, the station-oriented commute space model is built from space views. Metro stations are divided into employment, residential, and balanced type according to job-housing function pattern. They are divided into high efficiency, general, and low efficiency type according to commute efficiency pattern. Function pattern refers to the proportional relationship between the residence and employment land use around the rail station. Efficiency pattern is a comprehensive index to measure the commute time and distance. Finally, stations are clustered by the K-means method to determine what type they are. The experiment found that metro commuters accounted for 41% of the morning peak traffic using smart card data in Chongqing, China. Three typical job-housing function patterns and three commute efficiency patterns are discovered, respectively, and the characteristics of each are mined.}

abstract = {Climate change prompts humanity to look for decarbonisation opportunities, and a viable option is to supply electric vehicles with renewable energy. The stochastic nature of charging demand and renewable generation requires intelligent charging driven by predictions of charging behaviour. The conventional prediction models of charging behaviour usually minimise the quadratic loss function. Moreover, the adequacy of predictions is almost solely evaluated by accuracy measures, disregarding the consequences of prediction losses in an application context. Here, we study the role of asymmetric prediction losses which enable balancing the over- and under-predictions and adjust predictions to smart charging algorithms. Using the main classes of machine learning methods, we trained prediction models of the connection duration and compared their performance for various asymmetries of the loss function. In addition, we proposed a methodological approach to quantify the consequences of prediction losses on the performance of selected archetypal smart charging schemes. In concrete situations, we demonstrated that an appropriately selected degree of the loss function asymmetry is crucial as it almost doubles the price range where the smart charging is beneficial, and increases the extent to which the charging demand is satisfied up to 40%. Additionally, the proposed methods improve charging fairness since the distribution of unmet charging demand across vehicles becomes more homogeneous.}

This article reviews the literature and patents in four closely related fields and aims to provide a holistic view of how they are related and their integrability in relation to smart energy management strategies. Artificial intelligence models forecast energy use and load profiles as well as schedule resources to ensure reliable performance and effective utilization of energy resources. Training artificial intelligence models requires immense volumes of data. Utilizing big data systems and data mining enables the discovery of new functions and relationships, which determines the performance of artificial intelligence. Data mining also refines the information; thus, artificial intelligence is trained iteratively with more accurate data. Smart energy management can be further enhanced through advanced digital technologies like Internet of Things and blockchain. An Internet of Things platform containing edge, fog and cloud layers helps connect artificial intelligence to other hardware and software devices and systems. Furthermore, an Internet of Things platform efficiently transmits and stores data, improving access and availability to stakeholders for data mining. Emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency facilitate energy trading and can be designed in the cloud layer of an Internet of Things platform to supplement data storage.

However, the inherent uncertainty and variability in EV charging behavior pose challenges in accurately estimating potential economic gains from coordinated smart charging, presenting difficulties for charging service providers. In response to this, our study introduces a data-driven framework for assessing the profitability of fast-charging stations based on real-world operational data. This framework integrates data analytics, mixed-integer optimization, and behavioral theory. To address the computational challenge posed by optimizing charging schedules for numerous sessions, a tailored sub-gradient method is proposed. Additionally, a logit-based choice model is incorporated to account for the participation decisions of users. The flexibility of 0.7 million charging session profiles is thoroughly analyzed under peak-shaving incentives from the grid and quantifies the resultant monetary benefits. The analysis further extended to multiple influencing factors such as climate and the Covid-19 pandemic. Results suggest that fast charging stations under a coordinated charging scheme could experience a monthly bill curtailment of 20–30% compared to uncoordinated circumstances. These findings could pave the way for more efficient and profitable V2G operations, thereby accelerating the transition toward a more sustainable transportation infrastructure.}

Then, the demand-side response and electricity changes in supply-side under various environmental changes will also become clear by Data Analysis. Data-driven Prediction of load and electricity supply for the SBIPV is the basis of energy management. Data-driven Optimization is the combination of demand-side trading and disturbed system optimization in the field of engineering and sociology. Furthermore, the perspective of data-driven SBIPV, technologies and models, including all four data-driven features to make automated operational decisions on demand- and supply-side are also explored. The data -driven SBIPV system requiring much greater policy ambition and more effort from both supply and demand side, especially in the areas of data integration and the mitigation of SBIPV system.}

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to highlight the usefulness of big data analytics to support smart destinations by studying the online image of Barcelona (a leading smart city and tourist destination) as transmitted via social media through the analysis of more than 100,000 relevant travel blogs and online travel reviews (OTRs) written in English by tourists who have visited the city in the last 10 years. The proposed methodology used in this paper facilitates the massive gathering, cleaning up, and analysis of tourism-related user-generated content (UGC) from the most suitable sources, and helps to define the transmitted image of the city through collecting and processing large volumes of digital data. It is also used to extract business intelligence (BI) from OTRs concerning visits to Barcelona’s main landmark/attraction, La Sagrada Familia. The findings of this massive content analysis of information from a trustworthy source, UGC data, is very useful in appling BI to destination management, both in order to develop and assess marketing strategies and to improve branding and positioning policies among tourism and marketing organizations. It reinforces the ability of cities such as Barcelona to develop a smart city and destination concept, as well as a strategy for themselves.}

abstract = {Big data projects, including smart-city-related big data projects, are facing an alarmingly high percentage of failure. The reasons behind this phenomenon and the lessons learned from it are well researched. However, big data projects are still failing, as there is a lack of effective models to leverage the lessons learned from previous projects to evaluate an organization’s readiness for a big data project. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel readiness assessment model. This model leverages the lessons learned from previous projects and the experience of experts to be better prepared for an upcoming smart-city-related big data project. Cities can use the model to evaluate their readiness for this type of project in a structured and comprehensive way that will allow for higher chances of conducting a successful big data project. To develop the model, hierarchical decision modeling (HDM) and expert judgment quantification were used to provide the categorization and relative ranking of factors that influence smart-city-related big data projects. HDM is an effective way to understand the relationship between multiple factors and allows for expert panels to prioritize those factors. Moreover, desirability functions were used to extend the understanding of the factors’ dynamics and what needs to be done to better prepare for the challenges associated with each factor. Finally, the model was tested by applying it to several smart-city-related big data projects to show its value. This research highlights the importance of readiness assessment for conducting big data projects and provides a readiness assessment model that cities can use to prepare for an upcoming big data project.}

abstract = {Smart (stimuli-responsive) hydrogels constitute a material class suitable for transducers in sensing applications due to their volume-phase transition in response to a change in environmental parameters. In order to assess the viability of new hydrogel compositions for sensing, an easily applicable yet reliable characterization method for relevant static and dynamic properties of the gels, such as swelling and deswelling time constants, repeatability, stability as well as the relative swelling ratio, is crucial. Here we present such an easy-to-implement and affordable method based on the optical detection of the hydrogel's swelling state. We demonstrate the method's viability for characterization of various samples and discuss its advantages and limitations. Additionally, we fully describe the necessary experimental setup, software for automated data evaluation and corresponding procedures to allow interested researchers to implement the method in their own laboratories.}
