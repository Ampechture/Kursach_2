Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) can provide cost-effective treatments, and help the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, knowledge concerning how to innovate GBI strategically in cities remains limited. Together with the others in the special issue, this article aims to enhance understanding of the potential of city-based GBI to tackle local and global challenges practically, and provide theoretical discussions on sustainable transitions and future research on urban GBI. Via envisioning and implementation of integrated urban innovations for GBI, the ecosystem services derived from these nature-based solutions can contribute directly and indirectly to SDG achievement at various scales by increasing water and food security, reducing energy consumption, as by supporting urban biodiversity, health, and life quality. GBI can also contribute to discussions related to such emerging concepts as circular economy, urban transitions, and smart cities.}

The methodology proposed by the authors for detecting leaks and locating them with sufficient accuracy, consists in measuring the radial vibrational status of opportune pipes of the network. The idea arises from the consideration that the variation of the energy transmitted to the pipe walls by the radial component of the vibrations induced by the turbulence of the fluid onto them may be related to the flow leak itself. The structure of the proposed Smart Water Grid (SWG) is described here and a monitoring procedure is formulated starting from the innovative leak detection technique; a loss index is introduced and the first experimental results of the measurement campaign, performed on a specially designed and built test simple network, are here presented.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objectives
To determine the in vitro activities of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) and comparators against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates cultured from hospitalised patient samples in Taiwan from 2012 to 2021 with an additional focus on the temporal and geographical prevalence of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA).
Methods
P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 3013) were collected annually by clinical laboratories in northern (two medical centres), central (three medical centres), and southern Taiwan (four medical centres) as part of the SMART global surveillance program. MICs were determined by CLSI broth microdilution and interpreted using 2022 CLSI breakpoints. Molecular β-lactamase gene identification was performed on selected non-susceptible isolate subsets in 2015 and later.
Results
Overall, 520 (17.3%) CRPA isolates were identified. The prevalence of CRPA increased from 11.5%–12.3% (2012–2015) to 19.4%–22.8% (2018–2021) (P ≤ 0.0001). Medical centres in northern Taiwan reported the highest percentages of CRPA. C/T, first tested in the SMART program in 2016, was highly active against all P. aeruginosa (97% susceptible), with annual susceptibility rates ranging from 94% (2017) to 99% (2020). Against CRPA, C/T inhibited >90% of isolates each year, with the exception of 2017 (79.4% susceptible). Most CRPA isolates (83%) were molecularly characterised, and only 2.1% (9/433) carried a carbapenemase (most commonly, VIM); all nine carbapenemase-positive isolates were from northern and central Taiwan.
Conclusion
The prevalence of CRPA increased significantly in Taiwan from 2012 to 2021 and warrants continued monitoring. In 2021, 97% of all P. aeruginosa and 92% of CRPA in Taiwan were C/T susceptible. Routine in vitro susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa against C/T, and other newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, appears prudent.}

In SG environment, the Smart Meters (SMs) mostly exchange services and data from Service Providers (SPs) via insecure public channel. This makes the entire SG ecosystem vulnerable to various security threats. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we incorporate Digital Twin (DT) technology, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Deep Learning (DL) and blockchain into the design of a novel SG network. Specifically, a secure communication channel is first designed using an authentication method based on blockchain technology that has the ability to withstand a number of well-known assaults. Second, a new DL architecture that includes a self-attention mechanism, a Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) model, fully connected layers, and a softmax classifier is designed to enhance the attack detection process in SG environments. To deliver low latency and real-time services, the SDN is next employed as the network’s backbone to send requests from SMs to a global SDN controller. DT technology is finally integrated into the SDN control plane, which stores the operating states and behavior models of SMs and communicates with SMs. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by the blockchain implementation used in the SG network to assess computing time for the various numbers of transactions per block. Finally, the numerical results based on the N-BaIoT dataset shows better intrusion detection.}

This paper studies this conundrum in California, where state law requires metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to develop regional land use plans for reducing automobile-focused development and transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but gives MPOs no authority over local land use for plan implementation. Unable to compel local development decisions, MPOs instead might use information to nudge cities and counties toward smarter growth. However, we find that California MPOs have uneven access to quality land-use information and that they seldom use it to gauge or nudge local smart growth. Findings support concerns that, absent stronger state or regional powers over land use, California MPOs may not succeed in advancing smart growth under state law SB 375. Structural changes are proposed for bridging the disconnect between regional planning and local land use control.}

Due to the untrustworthy networks, there exist potential security threats (e.g., unauthorized access and modification, malicious data theft) hindering the development of smart grid. While several access control schemes have been proposed for smart grid to achieve sensitive data protection and fine-grained identity management, most of them cannot satisfy the requirements of decentralizing smart grid environment and suffer from key escrow problems. In addition, some existing solutions cannot achieve dynamic user management for lacking the privilege revocation mechanism. In this paper, we propose a decentralizing access control system with user revocation to relieve the above problems. We design a new multiple-authority attribute-based encryption (MABE) scheme to keep data confidentiality and adapt decentralizing smart grid applications. We also compare our proposal with the similar solution from both security and performance. The comparing results show that our access control system can achieve a trade-off among confidentiality, authentication, distribution and efficiency in smart grid.}

With the increasing availability of large-scale individual tracking data, new opportunities have emerged for studying people's travel behaviors and activity patterns. However, the data has not been fully exploited to examine the travel characteristics of vulnerable people and their implications for understanding transport-related disadvantage. This study proposes a methodological framework based on the concept of activity space that enables a comprehensive examination of vulnerable people's spatiotemporal travel characteristics and an investigation of the geographies of transport disadvantage. Using the proposed framework, a case study that investigates the bus activities of the vulnerable population using four-month smart card data is carried out in the city of Wuhu, China. The case study suggests that vulnerable people possess distinct travel behaviors that differ considerably from the mainstream population and that the implications of transport disadvantage, as revealed by the participation in bus activities, vary across different demographic groups and across different spatial contexts. Some of the empirical insights obtained from this study also differ from conclusions drawn from previous studies and will enrich our understandings of vulnerable people's activities. Overall, the paper makes two major contributions. Methodologically, the proposed framework can overcome some of the deficiencies of activity space-based approaches for understanding transport disadvantage and contribute broadly to the studies of travel behaviors and activities patterns using individual-level tracking data. Empirically, the study identifies varying spatial and temporal implications of transport disadvantage associated with different vulnerable groups, which could further shed light on public transit planning and service design.}

The climate in the tropical region is dominated by very high stable temperatures and high humidity and lacks the moderate climate's seasonality. Furthermore, the smart energy system models tend to focus on CO2 emissions only and lack integrated air pollution modelling of other air pollutants. In this study, an integrated urban energy system for a tropical climate was modelled, including modelling the interactions between power, cooling, gas, mobility and water desalination sectors. Five different large scale storages were modelled, too. The developed linear optimization model further included endogenous decisions about the share of district versus individual cooling, implementation of energy efficiency solutions and implementation of demand response measures in buildings and industry. Six scenarios for the year 2030 were developed in order to present a stepwise increase in energy system integration in a transition to a smart urban energy system in Singapore. The economically best performing scenario had 48% lower socio-economic costs, 68% lower CO2e emissions, 15% higher particulate matter emissions and 2% larger primary energy consumption compared to a business-as-usual case.}

However, collecting sensitive personal and business data assets renders smart homes a target for cyberattacks. Anomaly detection is a promising approach for identifying malicious behavior in smart homes. Yet, the current literature primarily discusses IoT-related cyberattacks and gives limited attention to detecting anomalies specific to the smart home context. Furthermore, there is a lack of datasets that accurately represent the complexity inherent in a smart home environment in terms of users with varying levels of expertise and diverse, evolving types of devices. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that focuses on using anomaly detection to identify cyberattacks in smart home environments. The SLR includes an adapted taxonomy that classifies existing anomaly detection methods and a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and future research challenges. Our findings show a growing interest in detecting cyberattacks with anomaly-based models in smart homes using centralized and network-based features. Ensemble and deep learning techniques are popular methods for detecting these anomalies. However, the limited diversity of cyberattacks in existing datasets and the absence of comprehensive datasets representing the complexity of smart home environments call for further research to improve the generalizability of detection models.}

Laypeople should be trained in basic life support and traditional and innovative methodologies may help to obtain this goal. However, there is a knowledge gap about the ideal basic life support training methods. Smart glasses could have a role facilitating laypeople learning of basic life support.
Aim
To analyze the potential impact on basic life support learning of a very brief training supported by smart glasses video communication.
Methods
Twelve laypeople were basic life support tele-trained by means of smart glasses by an instructor in this pilot study. During training (assisted trough smart glasses) and after the training (unassisted) participants’ performance and quality of basic life support and automated external defibrillation procedure were assessed on a standardized simulated scenario.
Results
After the training all participants were able to deliver good quality basic life support, with results comparable to those obtained when real time remotely guided by the instructor through the smart glasses. Mean chest compression rate was significantly higher when not guided (113 /min vs. 103 /min, p = 0.001). When not assisted, the participants spent less time delivering the sequential basic life support steps than when assisted while training.
Conclusions
A very brief remote training supported by instructor and smart glasses seems to be an effective educational method that could facilitate basic life support learning by laypeople. This technology could be considered in cases where instructors are not locally available or in general in remote areas, providing basic internet connection is available. Smart glasses could also be useful for laypeople rolling-refreshers.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented impact on public transport demand. Even though several studies have investigated the change in the use of public transport during the pandemic, most existing studies where large passive datasets have been considered focus on the drop in ridership at the aggregate level. To address this gap, this research aims to identify and model profiles of passengers considering their public transport recovery after the long-term lockdown in Santiago, Chile, during the early stage of the pandemic. The methodology proposed a three-stage approach associated with the analysis of smart card records. First, cardholder residential areas were identified to enrich the available data by integrating demographic information from the census. Then, a clustering analysis was applied to recognise distinctive classes of users based on their public transport usage change between the pre-pandemic and the post-lockdown phase. Finally, two different models were implemented to uncover the relationships between class membership and travellers’ characteristics (i.e. travel history and demographic characteristics of their residential area). Results revealed a heterogeneous recovery of public transport usage among passengers, summarising them into two recognisable classes: those who mainly returned to their pre-pandemic patterns and those who adapted their mobility profiles. A statistically significant association of travel history with the mobility adaptation profile was found, as well as with aggregate socio-demographic attributes. These insights about the extent of heterogeneity and its drivers can help in the formulation of specific policies associated with public transport supply in the post-pandemic era.}

abstract = {Secure and private communications using the Internet of Things (IoT) pose several challenges for smart home systems. In particular, data collected from IoT devices comprise sensitive personal information such as biomedical data, financial data, and location and activity data. Recent research looks into the use of blockchain in smart home systems, protecting the privacy of the data in use. Such solutions need to address the issue of privacy using a formal and mathematical model for data privacy due to the vulnerability associated with privacy-preserving blockchain networks. In the present paper, our approach aims to provide a privacy-preserving data aggregation mechanism in the context of Smart Homes that agree to contribute their data to a cloud server using machine learning to improve services for home users. We propose the use of differential privacy, a powerful concept in privacy preserving schemes to provide formal assurances about how much information is leaked using a privacy budget. The main purpose of using such a privacy-preserving scheme is to limit what can be inferred about individual training data from the model. Our techniques use a R′enyi differential privacy (RDP) machine learning scheme and are based on a variant of the stochastic gradient descent function. The performance of our proposed framework is evaluated using three public datasets: UNSW-NB15, NSL-KDD, and ToN-IoT datasets. Our findings show that differential private models can provide privacy protection against attackers by sacrificing a substantial amount of model utility. Therefore, we propose an empirical value of ϵ, that can optimally balances utility and privacy for the current smart home scenario datasets.}

Smart meters (SMs) are installed at customer places, providing an efficient way of recording household electricity consumption data and communicating it back to electricity providers using Internet. In smart cities, SG is compute-intensive application, which demands strict latency-aware capabilities, and low delays. Through the usage of fog-enabled Internet of Things (IoT)-Aided SG architectures, localized computing and processing facilities can be deployed at the network edge offering: low latency, reduced communication costs, low congestion, and latency-sensitive analytics. Energy consumption data that the meters collect can disclose sensitive information of an individual. The two most important challenges faced by the future smart grid are security and privacy. Although, privacy-preserving fog-enabled aggregation for SG communications have been studied in recent years. However, there exists limited literature that addresses the requirement of fault tolerance, allowing data aggregation activity to continue effectively and efficiently for functional SMs, even in the presence of faulty meters. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a fog-enabled privacy-preserving secure data aggregation scheme with fault-tolerance. Metering data privacy is achieved through the Boneh-Goh-Nissam (BGN) cryptosystem and authentication of the source is provided through elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). The ECDSA generates signatures in quick manner, due to smaller key sizes and is suitable for constrained resources devices like Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Detailed security analysis demonstrate that our proposed scheme preserves the data privacy of metering data, ensures source authentication, supports fault-tolerance, and prevents false data injection (FDI) attacks. In addition, extensive performance evaluations also show that our proposed scheme is efficient in terms of encryption, aggregation, decryption and communication costs when compared with the three existing state-of-the-art schemes.}

Thus, coordination between distributed generators, energy storage systems and flexible loads is expected to add a great value to grid operations and facilitate further RES penetration. The increasing penetration of bus communication technologies into buildings and their control possibilities over electric energy consumption may also make valuable contributions to the grid operation. Thus, the control system of the future grid should be compatible to smart buildings and cities. This paper presents a control system of an experimental microgrid which is made compatible to bus communication technologies at the demand-side, by applying a simple technique. The proposed technique does not require additional interface or software tools, as other methods do and therefore is a cost-effective method and can be easily expanded and used for demand-side management in future smart grids. Experimental results prove that bus communication technologies could contribute to the voltage regulation as well as to the application of efficient energy management policies of microgrid-based smart grid topologies.}

One often disregarded option is the promotion of reforestation in source regions supplying important quantities of atmospheric moisture transported over long distances through aerial rivers, affecting water resources of a city via precipitation and runoff (‘smart reforestation’). Here we present a case demonstrating smart reforestation’s potential as a water management option. Using numerical moisture back-tracking models, we identify important upwind regions contributing to the aerial river of Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Bolivia). Simulating the effect of reforestation in the identified regions, annual precipitation and runoff reception in the city was found to increase by 1.25% and 2.30% respectively, while runoff gain during the dry season reached 26.93%. Given the city’s population growth scenarios, the increase of the renewable water resource by smart reforestation could cover 22–59% of the additional demand by 2030. Building on the findings, we argue for a more systematic consideration of aerial river connections between regions in reforestation and land planning for future challenges.}

The privacy paradox problem may be exaggerated, considering that most existing research has focused on potential purchasers who do not have corresponding purchase and usage experience. For repeat consumers, their perception of smart home appliances is based on their real usage experience, so they may not have such a “privacy paradox” problem unlike potential purchasers. To verify this, this study divided smart home appliance consumers into potential and repeat purchasers, based on the technology acceptance model, and comparatively analyzed the differences in the influence of perceived privacy disclosure risk and other factors on the willingness to purchase smart home appliance. We found repeat purchasers did not have a serious privacy paradox problem. Potential purchasers have a higher perception of privacy disclosure risk of smart home appliances, but this did not influence their willingness to purchase. Conversely, repeat purchasers had a lower perception of privacy risk, which had a weak influence on their willingness to repurchase. While somewhat unexpected, this result shows that repeat purchasers’ perceived privacy disclosure risks and behaviors are more consistent. Moreover, perceived usefulness was the most important factor that impacted potential purchasers’ willingness to purchase, perceived ease of use was the most important factor for repeat purchasers. Collectivism plays an active role in reducing consumers’ perceived privacy risk of smart home appliances and improving perceived usefulness and ease-of-use.}

The model structure was defined with an automated forward selection procedure. 61% of the final models were classified as good fits and the structure of 80% of them was of 5th-order (5 thermal capacitances). An investigation of the 24-hour prediction error of the models showed that the ones classified as good fits are accurate enough for day-ahead predictions and Model Predictive Control (MPC) applications. An analysis of the model parameters suggested no strong correlation between them and the available metadata. The time constants of the houses were estimated, providing valuable information about the houses thermal inertia. Building models that can accurately capture and leverage building thermal inertia are ideal candidates for MPC and energy flexibility applications.}

This trend has been jointly driven by policymakers and domain specialists such as urban planners, property developers, and computer engineers. However, little attention has been paid to understanding the perception of the actual users, whose opinions should have been considered in the design and development of smart living systems. To address the gap, this study aims to investigate the user perceptions towards smart living by adopting an exploratory sequential quantitative research method. A user perception model is proposed based on a comprehensive literature review. Using smart student residence as an example scenario, 221 valid data was obtained through open-ended questionnaires, which were then analysed using a partial least squares structural equation modelling approach. This approach analysed the complex relationship among the identified latent dimensions in realising smart living based on the users' perceptions. The finding demonstrated four significant dimensions to consider in realising smart living: system-to-user conditions, system-to-system conformity conditions, safety and service-related conditions, and tracking and monitoring-related conditions. The proposed model explained 78.3% of the variance in realising smart living for the users considered in the study's context. The study makes a unique contribution to the knowledge body by proposing a model to understand smart living from users' perspectives. It reflects the increasing clamour to incorporate user perspectives into the design of smart living systems. The developed model could serve as a decision-support tool to fulfil users' expectations of smart living.}

In addition, we conduct a case study in Santiago, Chile, using smart card data of the buses system to compute the proposed measures for three different and relevant periods of the COVID-19 pandemic: before, during, and after Santiago’s lockdown. We find that the governmental policies diminished public transport crowding considerably for the lockdown phase. The average exposure time when social distancing is not possible passes from 6.39 min before lockdown to 0.03 min during the lockdown, while the average number of encountered persons passes from 43.33 to 5.89. We shed light on how the pandemic impacts differ across various population groups in society. Our findings suggest that poorer municipalities returned faster to crowding levels similar to those before the pandemic.}

A few of the existing literature review identified the challenges of primary consumer adoption in terms of privacy, eco-efficient feedback, and technology awareness. Provided that these factors were investigated without theoretical association, this study examined the barriers to the adoption of IoT-based smart meters technology by developing a model representing the users’ intention to adopt smart meters by drawing on the variables of the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance And Use of Technology (UTAUT2). Data were collected from 318 users of smart meter from two cities in Malaysia, while the model was validated using a multi-analytic approach using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and the results from SEM were used as inputs for a neural network model to predict acceptance factors. As a result, it was found that technology awareness and eco-effective feedback were the important determinants with a positive impact on the adoption of smart meter technology, while privacy concerns led to an adverse impact. Overall, these study findings contribute useful insights and implications for users, utilities; regulators, and policymakers.}

Synthesising these, a research approach is adopted in which a Technological Innovation System (TIS) analysis is combined with a transformational perspective to identify a broader range of success and failure factors. This study analyses smart grid innovation system development. The main research question is: What systemic and transformational failures are identified in the development of smart grid innovation in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2021 by combining TIS and a transformational perspective? The question is answered by mapping the events to TIS functions and identifying both ‘systemic failures’ and ‘transformational failures’. Transformational failures are linked to events outside the smart grid TIS that work against the alignment and harmonising of activities within the TIS. Results show that the smart grid innovation system experienced three periods and that it suffers from various structural and transformational failures. TIS functions like knowledge diffusion, and the creation of legitimacy were only fulfilled to a limited extent. Consequently, smart grid innovation is currently still not considered a mainstream technology in the energy transition, and there is little attention to the role of end-users. The study ends with suggestions for future research, including the suitability of the research approach for other contexts and when applied to other energy system innovations.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is progressively developing since it was first introduced at the beginning of the 21 st century. The IoT becomes more prominent due to the enormous data generated by the IoT devices called the Big Data. Further, the application of Big Data is widely adopted in many areas such as smart home and city planning, efficient system design, etc. However, during the developing stages of IoT, the researchers have many challenges that need to be addressed before standardizing IoT for general use. These challenges include co-existences of many communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WIFI, and so on. The effect of such technologies on the communication becomes more when these technologies exist in shot communication range. Similarly, other challenges include processing of huge amount of data generated by the IoT devices in real-time. Therefore, in order to address these challenges, we come up with a proposed scheme that enable a generic communication architecture among the IoT devices with less interference. Further, the proposed architecture consists of four main steps i.e. 1) a system to discover and identify electrical appliances in a smart home or smart building, 2) deployment of sensors, 3) applying proposed load balancing on appliances and sensors, and 4) processing the data obtained from these sensors for better usage of home and electrical appliances. The proposed scheme is tested on real electronic appliances and the energy consumption is recorded using the proposed Electronic Device Sleep Scheduling Algorithm (EDSA). Furthermore, the EDSA is responsible for controlling the activities of the sensors while it is active, sleep, and idle modes. The results show that the proposed architecture perform better in a heterogeneous environment compare to simple Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based technologies. The data is also processed using Hadoop Ecosystem is to maximize the efficiency and minimize the time required to process the data in real-time.}

This advance grid system can help to promote cultural heritage because it is responsible to provide un-interruptible and reliable power supply in smart way. Smart grid is one of the key component for enabling smart cities and obviously, any city with more smart amenities will ultimately attract visitors to come and visit rich heritage. In smart grid, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCDA) system is responsible for keeping the underlying communication secure between substations and corresponding control center. While communication between customers and substations needs more enhancements as the existing protocols do not meet the comprehensive security requirements of smart grid. Due to the complex nature of smart grid and diverse security requirements, designing a suitable authentication scheme is a challenging task. For delay sensitive networks like smart grid, an ideal authentication scheme should withstand against all known security attacks, involving lightweight operations with trivial computations. ECC provides same security level with much less key sizes as compared with other security techniques such as RSA, DSA and DH. Keeping in mind the complex and delay sensitive nature of smart grid, a lightweight ECC based authentication scheme is proposed here. The proposed scheme not only provides mutual authentication with low computation and communication cost but also withstand against all known security attacks.}

First, fuzzy clustering based on the forest optimization algorithm is employed to detect outliers and a self-organizing fuzzy logic classifier is applied to supplement missing data in electronic medical records (EMRs). A feature selection technique using the battle royale optimization algorithm is then developed to remove redundant information and identify optimal EMR features. The refined and fused data are further classified using an eigenvalue-based machine learning algorithm to determine whether a patient exhibits a certain disease. Simulation experiments are conducted with widely used heart disease and diabetes datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure as evaluation metrics.}

An alternative technology is offered by triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) that can harvest green energy and convert it into electrical energy. Herein, we assessed three different nopal powder types that were used as triboelectric layers of eco-friendly and sustainable TENGs for renewable energy harvesting from environmental vibrations and powering electronic devices. These nanogenerators were fabricated using waste and recycled materials with a compact design for easy transportation and collocation on non-homogeneous surfaces of different vibration or motion sources. In addition, these TENGs have advantages such as high output performance, stable output voltage, lightweight, low-cost materials, and a simple fabrication process. These nanogenerators use the contact-separation mode between two triboelectric layers to convert the vibration energy into electrical energy. TENG with the best output performance is based on dehydrated nopal powder, generating an output power density of 2.145 mWm−2 with a load resistance of 39.97 MΩ under 3g acceleration and 25 Hz operating frequency. The proposed TENGs have stable output voltages during 22500 operating cycles. These nanogenerators can light 116 ultra-bright blue commercial LEDs and power a digital calculator. Also, the TENGs can be used as a chess clock connected to a mobile phone app for smart motion sensing. These nanogenerators can harvest renewable vibration energy and power electronic devices, sensors, and smart motion sensing.}

abstract = {With the development of digital city and smart city construction, the City Information Model (CIM) has played a critical role as a container of spatial–temporal data to establish the Digital Twin City. For a digital twin city, a virtual high-fidelity CIM model that corresponds closely to the real physical world is the premise and cornerstone of its construction. Therefore, the integration of BIM, GIS and IoT has become the preferred topic for researchers and has received much more attention from a wide academic circle. However, traditional integration mainly focuses on the conversion of both IFC and CityGML, and IoT data are also often used as visualizations. More importantly, the underlying data formats of GIS, BIM and IoT are still independent of each other without a unified data structure expression, so real data-driven analysis and decision-making cannot be implemented. This study aims to establish a general CIM ontology to integrate heterogeneous BIM, GIS and IoT data. First, the related work of BIM, GIS and IoT integration is studied and analyzed. A comparison of three mainstream approaches, data conversion, standard extension and data linking, is conducted, and it illustrates the advantages of ontology techniques in solving data interoperability problems. Second, a technical framework of BIM, GIS and IoT data integration based on ontology technology is proposed. The approach is mainly divided into five steps: geometry processing, data instantiation, ontology construction, ontology mapping and querying application. On the basis of the CIM ontology, an application ontology is built for a specific application domain to illustrate rule-based mapping, querying and inferring. Finally, the case study shows that the Ontology-based methodology in this paper has contributed to establish a general pattern for CIM data integration by mapping and linking concepts from the semantic level. It avoids changes in the original data sources and the missing data problem.}

Over the past decades, standardized occupancy schedules, developed mainly by engineering rule-of-thumb, have been widely used in BEM due to its simplicity and lack of real measured occupancy data. However, the BEM community has recognized their association with uncertainty and reliability in simulation results from BEM. This study introduces representative occupancy schedules in the U.S. residential buildings, derived from a large smart thermostat dataset and time-series K-means clustering, and an open-source tool to generate a stochastic residential occupancy schedule. Over 90,000 residential occupancy schedules were estimated from the ecobee Donate Your Data dataset. Then, the representative occupancy schedules were identified through clustering. This study further investigated the impacts of three parameters (day, house type, and state) on residential occupancy schedules. Then, a tool, the Residential Occupancy Schedule Simulator (ROSS), is developed using the representative occupancy schedules derived in this study. Details of this tool are presented in this paper. The derived representative occupancy schedules and the ROSS tool can help improve the energy modeling of residential buildings.}

Therefore, we theoretically identify three dimensions of experts' competencies—perception, judgment, and decision choice supported by the Throughput Model algorithms for knowledge transfer. Integrating the Throughput Model algorithmic framework and Deming Cycle (i.e., plan, do, check, act), we propose that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems influence experts' decision making towards implementation of Smart Grids (SG). This model was backed up with the perspectives of 32 global experts as surveyed using Carnegie Mellon Maturity model questions and analyzed the results using PLS to validate the findings and compare them to our enhanced knowledge transfer developed from Deming's PDCA cycle. Our results suggest that these key algorithmic decision-making components are critical in explaining the successful application of planning, doing, checking/ acting, and planning of renewable energy technology as well as for a greener environment.}

Herein, an innovative strategy was implemented to achieve self-adaptive smart window that seamlessly integrates the thermochromic and radiative cooling technologies (TRSW), and holds great potential in effectively addressing the intricate thermal radiation requirements arising from unpredictable climatic conditions. The TRSW demonstrated an impressive capacity to regulate solar energy through automatic modulation of emissivity (ε) at both high (εLWIR-H = 0.68) and low (εLWIR-L = 0.35) temperatures, while effectively maintaining Vis-NIR regulation (20.12%). Moreover, the results of TRSW’s outdoor performance exhibited its efficiency in implementing dual solar energy transmission modes, effectively inhibiting the Vis-NIR transmission to mitigate solar overheating in high-temperature conditions, while diminishing heat dissipation and promoting radiative cooling in low-temperature situations. Compared to conventional cooling materials, the dynamic emissivity modulation of TRSW provided an effective approach to prevent overcooling at lower temperatures. Consequently, TRSW fostered an efficient synergy between the solar transmittance modulation (ΔTsol) and Δε, which led to heightened modulation of the entire spectrum and facilitated exceptional thermal management. This work paves an intriguing prospect of developing advanced smart windows with remarkable thermoregulation and promises a wide range of thermal regulation applications, such as windows, roofs, walls, and advanced textiles.}

Scholars argue that lack of willingness to adopt SETs could hinder the transition to SETs. To address this challenge, this study integrates the substantial literature about technology acceptance, and applied the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the theoretical framework. The research model proposed consists of TAM, and five external factors which have been selected based on literature review. A survey-based method was used, sampling more than 3,000 residents from various cities across Denmark. The validated model includes examining the effects of TAM factors and external factors (e.g., attitudes, trust, knowledge, policy, social influence, and awareness) on Behavioural Intention (BI). The majority of the results show statistically significant effects on BI at p= <0.05, except Perceived Usefulness (PU) at p= greater than 0.05. Specifically, Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), attitudes, trust, knowledge, awareness, social influence, and policy have significant influence on BI. On the contrary, PU has no influence on BI at p = 0.904. The findings are relevant for various reasons. Firstly, it is important for ensuring residential buildings can participate in Danish energy goals. Secondly, it provides a valuable reference for relevant stakeholders such as scholars, technology providers, and policy makers to foster the adoption of SETs in residential buildings. Lastly, the findings will be added to the literature of technology acceptance.}

Simultaneously, smart electricity control, often referred to as demand side management (DSM), has raised interest as a core enabler of future sustainable cities. The technological viability of DSM is increasingly researched, but its profitability for real estate has remained unclear. This study examines the economics and environmental implications of DSM by analyzing an energy model using hourly-level energy consumption data in Finland. Accordingly, this study observes new cash flows generated after a daily 2-hour peak shaving of a ground-source heat pump pool in the Helsinki region. Although, DSM decreased the pool's peak electricity consumption, the economic potential of smartness was only 0.03 €/sqm/year, equaling 1% of savings in the energy costs. Furthermore, DSM generated surprisingly low (i.e., 0.02%) reduction in carbon emissions. Despite of the current minor benefits for the real estate owners in the Finnish power market, the end-user smart electricity control likely has a crucial role in the future electricity system with large quantities of intermittent renewable production. Thus, engaging real estate owners in DSM through alternative (monetary) incentives, and other strategic benefits, is essential to support the future energy system decarbonization.}

Machine learning has become a popular tool for forecasting residential electricity demand, but previous studies have been limited by lack of access to high spatiotemporal resolution at a regional scale, which reduces a model's ability to capture the relationship between electricity and its driving factors. In this study, we develop and execute a machine learning framework to predict residential electricity demand at varying temporal and spatial resolutions using hourly smart meter electricity records from roughly 58,000 homes provided by Southern California Edison as well as local weather data, building characteristics, and socioeconomic indicators. The best performing model at the household level, multilayer perceptron (MLP), was able to predict electricity demand most accurately at a monthly resolution, achieving an r2 of 0.45, while the most accurate annual and daily models (also MLP) had r2 values of 0.34 and 0.38, respectively. The results also show that models trained with data aggregated to the census tract level were more accurate (e.g., r2 = 0.82 for the monthly MLP model) than at the household level across all three temporal resolutions analyzed. Total square footage and various climate indicators had the highest feature importance values. Square footage was ranked first in feature importance for the annual and daily models, while the month of the year, which is strongly tied to temperature, was most important to the monthly model. Through this analysis we gain insight into factors that drive electricity demand and the usefulness of machine learning for predicting residential electricity use.}

Nonetheless, such a service is affected directly by multiple urban factors such as traffic, number of existing drivers en-route, and local weather which may cause a huge delay. Dial-A-Ride Problem with Transfers (DARPT) allows passengers to change vehicles during their trip in a bid to minimize the delay. However, DARPT relies solely on using the existing Global Positioning System (GPS) that suffers from delay in propagating raw traffic data (e.g., route coordinates, geodesic distance, and time stamp) on time and ultimately causes traffic disruption and increases ride time constraint. To this end, this work introduces a novel interactive Fog-based navigation simulator, PRYORTIE. PRYORTIE uses roadside smart units in the form of fog nodes as a means for collecting and sharing real-time traffic data comprising of vehicles’ location and speed within the area, they each cover. These nodes can calculate an optimal route for a vehicle using a novel path recommender algorithm that utilizes a vehicle's current position, its destination, and current traffic data. The nodes can update the route in real-time using the same algorithm if traffic conditions within their radius change. A package delivery case study has been implemented and simulated in PRYORTIE to demonstrate the impact of using fog nodes in routing and navigation. Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach shows on average 46.34% improvement in saving travel time. The proposed method clearly demonstrates tangible benefits of communicating real-time data to drivers and lays the ground for subsequent future work in smart transportation and navigation especially in the context of last mile delivery. It can easily be extended to autonomous vehicles and can be easily integrated into existing transportation frameworks that employ a fog-cloud paradigm for smart transportation.}

EU’s explicit emphasis on smart growth has been identified as a major exogenous driver for this pilot funding scheme; whereas the domestic strength and support of the UK government have also proven to be crucial. As a whole, smart city initiatives in the UK were pushed top-down and for FCGP in particular, the Glasgow City Council had been the key, and sometimes the only player in implementing its trial projects. Citizen engagement was primarily ad hoc. Nonetheless, winning this nationwide competition had given the devolved Scottish Government and city council confidence to launch their smart projects as well as lessons to draw upon. Some innovative partnership development was also developed with policy formulation, service design, and delivery. Future research, therefore, is worthwhile to examine how new technologies, social media, and shared learning opportunities could offer new ways for meaningful citizen engagement.}

But the challenge lies in the exchange of enormous information in real-time to drive smart city applications. Therefore, smart city applications make use of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications which provides higher bandwidth and lower latency in message exchanges. D2D communications do not need any infrastructure for communication and hence are cost and time effective. However, this advantage becomes a threat as no third party is involved to verify the authenticity of the devices before exchange of real information. Consequently, a reliable authentication mechanism is required to address the security issues in WiFi (wireless fidelity) Direct communication. In this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for WiFi Direct. The principle of the protocol is based upon a commit/open pair and Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm. It is observed from the simulations that the proposed protocol successfully authenticates the D2D devices in the WiFi Direct environment. Investigation through formal security analysis revealed the strong resistivity of the proposed protocol against the prominent attacks in the WiFi Direct environment. The comparative analysis demonstrates the reliability of the suggested protocol over the traditional one. The proposed protocol eliminates the occurrence of the denial of service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in the discovery and key agreement phase, respectively. The proposed protocol can be easily integrated into the devices enabled with WiFi Direct and can offer a wide security package.}

abstract = {Energy transitions are at the top of global agendas in response to the growing challenges of climate change and international conflict, with the EU positioning itself as playing a pivotal role in addressing climate risks and sustainability imperatives. European energy transition policies identify ‘smart consumption’ as a key element of these efforts, which have previously been explored from a predominantly technical perspective thus often failing to identify or address fundamental interlinkages with social systems and consequences. This paper aims to contribute to interdisciplinary energy research by analysing a forward looking ‘Horizon Scan’ research agenda for smart consumption, driven by the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Reflecting on an extensive systematic Delphi Method exercise surveying over 70 SSH scholars from various institutional settings across Europe, we highlight what SSH scholars see as future directions for smart consumption research. Building from seven thematic areas (under which are grouped 100 SSH research questions), the study identifies three key ‘shifts’ this new smart research agenda represents, when compared to previous agendas: (1) From technological inevitability to political choice, highlighting the need for a wider political critique, with the potential to open up discussions of the instrumentalisation of smart research; (2) From narrow representation to diverse inclusion, moving beyond the shortcomings of current discourses for engaging marginalised communities; and (3) From individual consumers to interconnected citizens, reframing smart consumption to offer a broader model of social change and governance. Social Sciences and Humanities scholarship is essential to address these shifts in meaningful (rather than tokenistic) ways. This agenda and the shifts it embodies represent key tools to enable better interdisciplinary working between SSH and teams from the technical and natural sciences.}

While sustainable cities concept has been pursued for a while now, the emergence of metaverse is expected to escalate and facilitate the sustainable development agenda by promoting best practices such as optimal consumption of scarce resources, encourage users of the metaverse to observe sustainable practices, help reduce the carbon footprint of cities through reduced use of automobiles, as people will have immersive experience working remotely. Additionally, it has the potential to enhance sound energy management, promote social cohesion, and promote sustainable economic activities. All these benefits are very critical especially in the modern era where the need for sustainable cities is inevitable, especially in view of the raging impacts of climate change and the disruptions occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has altered the way people work, interact, and live.}

abstract = {Protecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, PoA-based Blockchain DLT has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provide recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain application in healthcare. Lastly, the study then explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.}

Through the use of quantitative normative service scenarios and qualitative exploratory scenarios, the project generated financially and operationally feasible proposals that community leaders can implement in the future, and also fostered constructive dialogue among transit stakeholders. Survey data show that participants experienced high levels of learning, engaged in quality deliberation, and are generally optimistic about the potential for improved transit. The project’s approach can be replicated elsewhere through the use of five essential elements: a steering committee, stakeholder analysis, a series of engagement workshops, normative and exploratory scenarios, and interaction between data and modeling. Collaborative planning with scenarios can help the transportation field address the need to foster collaboration and epistemic inclusion in a changing world.}

As a score, we use several simple measures of plug-in duration prediction error, as we assume that EV drivers’ suitability for smart charging varies based on their predictability of charging behaviour. To find the best among these metrics we use computer simulations, where we vary the participation levels of the drivers in smart charging. The median relative error provides the most significant results in terms of the energy charged during the off-peak price period.}

IoT devices are becoming the primary data source for a variety of smart-city applications, where critical decisions are based on this collected data. If malicious actors gain control of and/or tamper with the data being transmitted, the integrity of an entire smart city will be compromised. However, through monitoring IoT devices’ behavior, anomalies can be detected and isolated to avoid any negative impact on decision-making. This behavioral monitoring process will complement traditional trust management approaches, since more accurate trust values can be calculated without the need to rely on a majority consensus. In this work, we present a BEhavior-As-a-Service for Trust management (BEAST) that implements a deep learning-based behavioral model to accurately classify IoT devices’ interactions in the system. Through the implementation of the Elo rating system, these classifications will be presented as a vector of behaviors per device, which dynamically reflects each device’s trust in the system. This work presents an analysis of our methodology as well as a threat model. Using simulations, a real-world use case is presented showing the interactions between IoT-based devices. Our results show that our BEAST model is able to dynamically evaluate each IoT device’s trust, as well as capture and mitigate multiple threats targeting the trust in the system.}

This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of quantum computing in transforming smart agriculture practices to enhance sustainable crop management and increase yield. Traditional agriculture faces numerous challenges, including the need for more efficient resource allocation, precise monitoring of environmental conditions, and intelligent decision-making for optimal crop production. The innovation of new methods of agriculture brings into perspective how such capabilities can be integrated into crop and livestock farming to improve productivity, help control pests and diseases, and mitigate inherent risks. The research was explored through a narrative literature review and focused on developing quantum computing-based solutions for smart agriculture, including advanced optimization algorithms for resource allocation, quantum-enhanced machine learning models for crop disease prediction, and agricultural productivity, which can be assessed for climate change impact via modeling and simulation tools. Harnessing quantum systems' inherent parallelism and computational speed will provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations for maximizing yield while minimizing environmental impact.

Hence, this study investigates Smart Parking system, which integrates many Internet of Things (IoT) components alongside leveraging the use of cloud and edge computing could be the solution. Edge computing is a crucial technology that supports sensor level processing, which is a significant element for data privacy and security in Smart Parking applications. Smart Parking would be able to guide the driver directly to the parking spot, which will minimize or even eliminate the issues in the existing mechanism. It is noteworthy that it is necessary to ensure that the Smart Parking system is secure, because IoT devices are very much prone to security attacks. Further, introducing energy-efficient techniques in Smart Parking will contribute to a greener environment and an economically efficient model. Many studies have focused on Smart Parking with IoT, however, from our critical analysis, we have concluded that many studies have failed to address the security and energy efficiency aspect of smart parking. Hence, we have investigated the impact of security and energy efficiency in Smart Parking system, and have classified the existing literature based on the categories of devises such as sensors, communication protocols, security threats, energy efficiency, applications, and reviews of available resources based on the proposed taxonomy, the study has also tabulated few use cases and emphasized the relationship between IoT, security, and energy efficiency in smart parking, and identified and examined most significant research challenges.}

The fusion framework has disaggregate mixed multinomial logit models at its core that predict the most probable origin and destination zones of individual transit trips using smart card transaction records, land use data, and transit system characteristics. The logit models are estimated using revealed trip origin and destination responses from a travel survey that are augmented by land use and transit system data to provide contexts about the zones' trip generation and attraction potentials. For empirical analysis, the methodology is applied to the smart card system of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Specifically, it is tested under different system configurations (tap-on-only and tap-on-and-off) and for networks with substantial shares of automobile and walk access/egress. When applied to transit trips constructed from the smart card transactions, the estimated models successfully capture the spatial distribution of trip origin and destination at the traffic analysis zone level. The empirical analysis also demonstrates that the proposed fusion method can be appropriately used to reconcile information provided by transit smart card and travel surveys to generate up-to-date transit demand data necessary for public transport planning and operations.}

The proposed protocol can securely track and trace smart objects during their movement in the IoT supply chain. Unlike the traditional Ownership Transfer (OT) architecture, the proposed architecture does not require a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and can support Partial Ownership Transfer (POT). The innovative use of immutable blockchain architecture enabled the proposed protocol to effectively support distributed environments and authenticate both the device and involved parties. The proposed protocol is evaluated for its robustness against common attacks outlined in this paper and implemented using the Ethereum blockchain. The testbed results on Ethereum confirm the optimal gas consumption of the proposed model. Furthermore, utilizing the security claim verification tool, Scyther, the experiment validates the security claim regarding the communication between the parties involved in the proposed protocol’s OT process.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of electricity demand in Iraq has consistently outstripped the country's electricity infrastructure, leading to frequent blackouts, especially during peak summer demand. With a heavy reliance on oil 93 % and gas 7 % for electricity generation, the nation is exposed to economic fluctuations associated with global oil prices and environmental impacts from burning fossil fuels. This study explores the implications of integrating smart grids and expanding renewable distributed generation capacity in the country's energy system. Drawing upon the projection of the energy demand by 2035 across four scenarios (Business as Usual, Sustainable Development, High Growth, and Low Carbon), the study underscores solar energy, backed by abundant solar and wind energy, as a key player in the country's renewable transition. However, challenges persist, including the need for technical expertise in renewable energy technologies, financing hurdles, and concerns about policy stability. With the country's policies targeting 25 % renewable electricity by 2030 and the establishment of significant renewable projects, there tangible momentum. The results have drawn out a roadmap for an estimated addition of up to 10 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and 14 GW by 2035. In addition, strategies for distributed generation capacity expansion were highlighted, underscoring the crucial role of solar and wind energy and other renewables in the country's sustainable energy future.}

abstract = {Road Traffic Noise is a major concern in Europe, with more than 20% of people exposed to harmful noise levels. Efficient monitoring and assessment of the sound levels in critical areas are crucial to support decision strategies to control/reduce noise exposure. However, continuous and long-time ranged spatio-temporal measurements require high-cost equipment and maintenance duties. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a cost-efficient smart mobility procedure for the estimation of traffic noise levels based on roadside video images. The developed procedure involves an algorithm that extracts traffic volumes, identifies vehicle classes, estimates each vehicle’s speed from video recordings, and a noise assessment component using dynamic microscopic models. These latter are based on existing Noise Emission Models – NEMs, for the assessment of the source sound power levels, coupled with a sound propagation model able to consider each on-road vehicle speed as input and evaluate the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels. The developed approach is characterized by a modular structure that easily allows to replace NEMs and/or incorporate extra variables in the sound propagation model. The procedure is tested on a rural road of a medium-sized city, under different levels of service, and results show that the errors concerning the noise estimations are below 1 dBA, revealing high accuracy.}

As an important carrier of the chemical industry, China has designated as many as 723 chemical industrial parks (CIPs). Unfortunately, safety concerns have become an obstacle to the sustainability of China's CIPs. Ever since the two devastating hazardous chemical accidents, namely “Tianjin Port 8·12 Explosion” and “Jiangsu 3·21 Explosion,” which occurred in 2015 and 2019 respectively, China has prioritized the safety of CIPs. The smart chemical industrial parks (SCIPs) are considered the optimal strategies toward the goal of sustainable development in China's CIPs. However, there has been a lack of research and subsequent discussion on the role of SCIPs in the forthcoming years. The period between 2020 and 2025 is considered a crucial period for the future development of CIPs and SCIPs in China mainly because the country has released a series of important government documents and national standards (such as “Fourteenth Five-Year (2020–2025) Plan for Hazardous Chemical Safety” and “Guidelines of SCIPs construction”) to promote hazardous chemical safety. With the aim of analyzing the future sustainable development for the construction of SCIPs in China, this paper proposes a systematic methodology in order to conduct an integrated and in-depth review on the standardization construction status (framework with Chinese characteristics, key events, spatial features, and national pilots), future tasks, problems, and sustainable development pathways of China's SCIPs. The method is implemented in accordance with the current scenarios of hazardous chemical safety in China and the latest government documents, regulations, and standards. Furthermore, this study provides basic data and a basis for future studies associated with the safety and sustainability of the SCIPs construction and chemical industry, both within China and in other countries.}

The local and national government and professionals, including disaster management scientists, climate change researchers, and meteorologists, are at the forefront of examining and tackling the issues of urban cyclones. Therefore, the study attempts to assess the vulnerability of urban slum households in India's first smart city Bhubaneswar due to cyclonic events. Primary data have been collected by using a structured questionnaire from two slums, namely “Phd Sahi” and “Kedar Palli” with a sample size of 200 households. The vulnerability is assessed in the context of five elements: social, economic, physical, institutional, and awareness, and their respective yardsticks have been chosen through previous literature and based on the condition of the slum. The study has developed five individual vulnerability indices considering 38 vulnerability indicators mentioned above with a multidimensional vulnerability index. Results show that the slum population is more vulnerable to cyclones based on economic, physical, and awareness vulnerability while less vulnerable in terms of social and institutional. Therefore, the paper advocates some policy suggestions that the state planning should aim at achieving overall economic, physical with infrastructural development to ensure the safety of these marginalized urban communities under participatory slum up-gradation program. Both state and central government should work together to frame policies that will lead to more awareness among the poor slum population, which can, on the other hand, reduce the disaster risks of a cyclone.}

In this chapter, we approach older individuals’ lives from a smart and healthy perspective, aiming to maximize the potential to improve their quality of life (QoL). The primary focus is on identifying and improving deficiencies in adherence to treatments of older adults living at home with diabetes and high blood pressure. Digital solutions were deployed to monitor older individuals’ health conditions, enabling early identification of potentially harmful situations such as hyper/hypoglycemic episodes or hypertension.

The specific objectives of this research are: firstly, to study the implementation of integrated mobility measures in ports to reduce the carbon footprint by promoting an efficient use of transport infrastructure and smart mobility strategies to/from/in the port; secondly, to define and implement electric mobility and digitalization solutions for transport in ports (including the connection between the city and the port). The traffic modelling software PTV VISSIM and the Vehicle Specific Power methodology were used to estimate the emissions of the vehicles present in the road network of a study area. The methodology was applied to the case study of Aveiro, Portugal, which has a port located 8 km from the city centre. The baseline scenario and three alternative scenarios: implementation of electric mobility; digitalization of work patterns through remote work; and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) were defined.

Considerable number of research has been performed on solid waste management system. However, smart system especially for streamlet waste (liquid) management is unavailable. In this study, we developed an efficient management system for streamlet using Internet of Things. This system informs the concerned municipal authority in real time about the current waste levels of streamlets in a city. For this purpose, sensor kits are deployed over the streamlets that transmit data to the cloud server for storage, processing and analysing via the Internet. The municipal authority can visualise the data in graph-form entries along with a sensor location from the cloud. When the waste level reaches a predefined threshold value, the waste collector is automatically notified through a smart phone in real time. The performance and accuracy of the proposed system is tested based on the conducted case studies. Experimental results show that the proposed system efficiently delivers its desired operations. The implementation of such system in the society will enhance the quality of life and will make opportunities for government and businessmen to invest money on such a project.}

Our goal is to analyze previous user’s parking spots and discern private places from on-street ones. We identified the main characteristics of the private parking spots and trained a machine learning model that clusters them and classifies the driver’s last parking. The applicability of our work is in smart parking systems, which can benefit from this classification in three ways: i) tagging parking spots in the city without the need of sensor infrastructure; ii) ease parking exchange when a public parking spot gets available; iii) predict when a user is approaching a public or a private spot based on his last parking in the same area.}

Using Mixed integral linear programming’ (MILP’) and the proposed power management framework it is possible to intelligently optimize the energy procurement of a smart home, which not only guarantee the minimal energy procurement cost as well as it increases consumer comfort.

Although SRT are a core element of the future Smart Road Infrastructures, as they might significantly improve the road system, they are usually presented just as conceptual models instead of actual solutions. Consequently, evidence on the effectiveness of SRT in increasing driving performance and/or safety are scarce and not conclusive. Here, we present an overview of SRT systems (theoretical or existing) to try to identify their goals and objectives in terms of impact on road safety and driving behavior. More than 100 peer-reviewed articles on SRT, published in the last five years, were screened. Based on their impact on the road transportation system, we classified SRT into two main categories: (i) those that encourage appropriate road users’ behaviors and awareness, including active and adaptive road delineator systems such as luminescent horizontal road markings, temperature-sensitive paints, or musical roads, and (ii) those able to reduce the environmental impact of the road transportation system, including technologies such as electrified priority lanes, and smart road lightning. Preliminary empirical evidence has shown the effectiveness of SRT in improving drivers’ performance (e.g., vehicle lane positioning) and perceived safety. This result is based on just eight works, however. Overall, our results pointed out that SRT lack dedicated research aimed at evaluating the effects on driving performance and safety (traffic crash/injury prevention). To discourage the misuse of any new SRT, future research investigating the impact of these advanced innovations, using both simulated and real settings, is needed.}

The ever-increasing amount of data produced, along with the emergence of next-generation computationally intensive applications, requires new service delivery models. Such models should capitalize on the Edge Computing (EC) paradigm for supporting the data offloading process, by considering user’s contextual information in the offloading decision along with the infrastructure resource allocation operations, towards meeting the stringent performance specifications. In this article, a two-level Edge Computing architecture is proposed to offer computing resources for the remote execution of an LBS. At the Device layer, an initial offloading decision is performed taking into consideration the estimated position and quality of the wireless connection of each user. At the Edge layer, a resource profiling mechanism maps the incoming workload to EC computing resources under specific performance requirements of the LBS. Dealing with the dynamic workload, a scaling mechanism simultaneously takes the offloading decision and allocates only the necessary resources based on the resource profiles and the estimation of a workload prediction technique. For the evaluation of the proposed architecture, a smart touristic application scenario was realized on a real large-scale 5G testbed, following the principles of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) orchestration. The experimental results indicate the high accuracy of the localization technique, the success of the two-stage offloading decision and the scaling mechanism, while meeting the performance requirements of the LBS.}

In this paper, we present the development of an integrated smart grid simulation model, using the Anylogic simulation environment. Among the elements which are included in the simulation model are houses connected to a renewable energy source, and batteries as storage devices. With the use of the these elements a neighbourhood model can be constructed and simulated under multiple scenarios and configurations. The developed simulation environment provides users better insight into the effects of running different configurations in their houses as well as allow developers to study the inter-exchange of energy between elements in a smart city on multiple levels.}

Alongside technological interventions designed to shift and shed energy consumption, prevailing discourses regarding heating and cooling regularly emphasise the importance of householders rationally and efficiently using energy at home. Conversely, this study shows that householders routinely draw on practical forms of knowledge, including embodied understandings and everyday know-how, as they heat and cool their homes. Drawing on social practice theories, this article presents insights from 28 ethnographic interviews and home tours conducted in Greater Copenhagen, Denmark, and Canberra, Australia. Both sites incorporate emerging smart technologies which aim to shift and shed household energy demand, including through better facilitating resident's management of the indoor climate. While the selected field sites differ importantly in terms of the technologies and infrastructures present, as well as the prevailing cultures and climate, the cross-national analysis shows a conceptual overlap in the way that residents in these divergent contexts draw on their lay understandings to pursue thermally desirable home environments. The findings thereby highlight how in the course of everyday life technical and ostensibly rational forms of knowledge are often contextualised and operationalised through their combination with practical knowledge. As such, this article seeks to complement existing research into the smart infrastructures increasingly involved in household energy management by demonstrating and advocating for a fuller consideration of the role played by practical knowledge and everyday experience.}

Historical trends, disciplines, regions, themes, relevance, methods, and theories were analyzed to map out the existing research on data privacy and security in smart tourism. Findings reveal that although relevant studies have grown in frequency in recent years, there is still a lack of attention to tourists' information privacy and security in smart tourism research. Specifically, privacy-based conceptualized studies, theory-driven empirical research, and legal analysis in data protection deserve immediate attention. Tourism scholars should also consider proper methods to raise tourists' data privacy and security awareness and build an ethical relationship between tourists and smart tourism applications.}

They are overall public solutions that combine the design and implementation of intelligent systems mainly for electricity, water, and natural gas in addition to tens of different assets like public transportation, healthy environment, water, sanitation with key principles of the “green economy.” Solutions for these systems are luckily driven both by businesses and governments in order to increase resource efficiency. However, due to rapid population growth and limited resources available, very effective urban management is needed in order to meet the requirement for smart utilities to increase the quality of public life in the city by using information and communication technologies. Nowadays, while we live together with digital technologies, mobility, Internet and data communication infrastructure, cloud computing services, etc., our local administrations try to quickly adapt to these developments and show their motivations with successful examples in the area. In this chapter, we will first examine the needs and expectations of the customers, residents who use smart utilities and services and provide general information about these services. We will also discuss the need for energy, the availability of resources, the balance of supply and consumption from the point of consumers and providers, intelligent infrastructures. Secondly, we will start with the electricity, the most important energy source of our daily life, and continue with water, waste water, and natural gas in order to give very detailed information for each in separate sections. In the sections related to the different utilities, the existing resource status, different resource alternatives, applied regulation, smart grids generated, and smart customer usage metering will be given with examples from current studies.}

We argue that digital twins of IoT devices, with the right design, can enhance the security, reliability, auditability, and interoperability of IoT systems. The salient features of digital twins have made them key elements for the IoT and Industry 4.0. In this paper, we leverage advances in W3C's Web of Things (WoT) standards and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to present a novel design of the smart contract-based digital twins with enhanced security, transparency, interoperability, and reliability. We provide two different variations of that general design using two different blockchains (one public and one private, permissioned blockchain), and we present design trade-offs. Furthermore, we introduce an architecture for accessing and controlling IoT devices securely and reliably, providing full auditability, while at the same time using the proposed digital twins as an indirection mechanism (proxy). The proposed architecture leverages the blockchain to offer notable properties, namely,decentralization, immutability, auditability, non-repudiation, availability, and reliability. Moreover, it introduces mass actuation, easier management of IoT devices, and enhanced security to the IoT gateways, enables new business models, and makes consumer devices (vendor-)agnostic.}

Devices will cooperating in a multicast network to collect, share, and forward information way while interacting with one another autonomously and without centralised supervision. The building of an intelligent environment the capability of real-time collection of data, which is crucial for maximising the value of the IoT, will make this possible. A typical electric grid is made up of many power plants that use various power generating units, such as coal-based units, gas-based units, hydro units, etc. The majority of the infrastructure and wires that make up the conventional electricity grid have been in existence for a long time, it should be mentioned. They require significant investments, so providing them could take years. As a result, many grid components are outmoded and must be maintained and monitored on a regular basis to keep power flowing. A sophisticated technology is the smart grid (SG) system that makes it easier to integrate green technology and environmental considerations. The SG cyber–physical system was implemented thanks to the advancement and use of communication technologies in the conventional power system. The Internet of Things (IoT) and essential devices are both present in the complicated architecture of the SG systems. The traditional electric grids are been transformed into smart and efficient grid known as “Smart grid”. The Internet of Things’ smart grid allows for two-way communications among connected devices and technology that can recognise and respond to human needs. The cost and reliability of a smart grid are superior to that of conventional power infrastructure. Through use and data maintenance, smart grid technology will assist in reducing energy use and costs. One of the primary contributions made to grids is the integration of IoT with producing facilities using sustainable energy at various levels. To enhance the smart grid for bidirectional information exchange, improve power quality, and increase reliability Internet of Things (IOT) devices are becoming an important part of smart electric grid. IOT Infrastructure (IOTI) provide a flexible, efficient and secure platform providing strategic management for monitoring and controlling of different operations under different working conditions. This paper discusses cyber security on IOT based infrastructure for electric power systems. A comprehensive study is highlighted which includes type of IOTs, architecture used for smart grid, and future challenges.}

However, the performances of TENGs are lower than those of planar/film configurations due to the complex fiber fabrications and limited mechanical freedom. In this work, we demonstrate an extrusion method combined with thermal drawing (ETD method) for continuous and scalable triboelectric fiber fabrication, providing longitudinal uniform fibers for hundreds of kilometers. Based on the ETD method, super-elastic microstructured triboelectric fibers (SMTFs) were fabricated, consisting of hollow elastomeric and liquid metal cores (EGaIn). The SMTFs showed excellent superelasticity with clear and uniform microstructures. The fibers could withstand strain up to 1800% and exhibited excellent electrical output performance. Utilizing a single fiber as the medium for triboelectric energy collection, the average open circuit voltage and instantaneous power density are respectively up to 210 V/m and 21 μW/m with a 40 MΩ external load resistance. The SMTFs could also be woven into deformable textiles with high electrical outputs up to 160 V, 10 μA, and 50 nC. In addition, the SMTFs-based textiles were further demonstrated as completely soft and stretchable components for self-powered sensing in smart home applications.}

Hence, this article introduces a tri-stage mechanism for the joint management of the energy and ancillary services markets in coordinated TN and DN, taking into account wind and solar renewable resources, SHs and EVs. In the first stage of this mechanism, SHs do their daily planning with the possibility of participating in the regulation market and send it to the DN operator. In the second stage, DN operator determines its strategy for participation in the energy and ancillary services markets according to the programs received from SHs and sends it to the TN operator. Finally, in the third stage, the TN operator settles the markets according to the plans received from the DN operators. This model is designed in the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) format and simulated using CPLEX solver in GAMS. The simulation outputs illustrate that SHs by controlling their internet-of-things (IoT)-based appliances and EVs have provided cheap services in the regulation market and subsequently reduced the costs of this market by 10.4%. Also, the results reveal that the participation of large-scale industrial units in the demand response program (DRP) not only reduces the costs of the energy and ancillary services markets but also improves the voltage profile during the peak period.}

It will investigate the interconnections between AI, accountable decisions made by boards of directors in companies, the associated legal risks, and how to regulate AI to mitigate risks while promoting accountability. In the boardroom, AI is defined as the use of computers to assist, support, collaborate or even duplicate directors’ behaviours. The last few years have seen increased calls for boards to have oversight responsibility at the intersection between AI and the regulatory and policy implications in a corporate setting. AI can be applied to advance the effectiveness and efficiency of corporate governance and to raise awareness of accountable practice in its standardisation and implementation. However, AI can also be a disruptive technology, and the accountable practice of AI needs to be reinforced by regulatory insight to enable its sustainable development. No consensus has yet been reached on the most appropriate regulatory framework to achieve these goals; this article therefore aims to identify the most appropriate regulatory framework to promote sustainable AI by monitoring and mitigating the associated risks in a corporate setting. We investigate the rationale for and advantages of a smart regulatory approach for regulating AI, aiming to achieve the participation of multi-disciplinary teams with members playing particular roles associated with the safe and effective deployment of AI.}

Therefore, this article uses a meta-review with the support of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Protocol. As a result, we identified six dimensions and seventeen categories related to digital transformation. The organizational, technological, and social dimensions are still pivotal in digital transformation, while two new dimensions (sustainability and smart cities) still need to be explored in the existing literature. The need to deepen knowledge in digital transformation and refine the dimensions found is of paramount importance, as it involves some complexity due to organizational dynamics and the development of new technologies.

Within this context, SGMI addresses a spectrum of pertinent security and privacy concerns. This study systematically addresses the inherent research problems associated with SGMI and introduces a lattice-based blockchain-assisted certificateless data authentication and key exchange scheme. The primary aim of this scheme is to establish quantum resistance, conditional anonymity, dynamic participation, and the capacity for key updates and revocations, all of which are imperative facets for the robust implementation of mutual authentication within SGMI. Our scheme harnesses blockchain technology to mitigate the vulnerabilities associated with centralized administrative control, thus eliminating the risk of a single-point failure and distributed denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is meticulously designed to accommodate the resource constraints of smart meters, characterized by lightweight operations. Rigorous formal security analysis is conducted within the framework of the quantum-accessible random oracle model, fortified by ’history-free reduction,’ substantiating its security credentials. Complementing this, simulation orchestration serves to underscore its superiority over existing methodologies, particularly in the realms of energy efficiency, data computation, communication, and the costs associated with private key storage.}

Therefore, this study aims at providing a reliable control method for the voltage problem in distribution networks embedded with high PV and wind sources. The proposed voltage management strategy consists of two controlling stages. The first stage uses battery energy storage systems (BESS), while the second stage employs the smart PV inverters' reactive power injection capability. For BESS operation, a bi-level optimization method based on metaheuristic optimization algorithms (MOA) is developed to regulate the voltage levels by governing the batteries charging/discharging rates. The bi-level optimization problem aims to maximize PV and wind energy exploitation while improving the voltage profile. In this study, a detailed comparison is conducted between three MOA: Social Spider Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Cuckoo Search Optimization. In addition, considering the uncertainty associated with PV system generation, a PV generation forecast is embedded in the voltage control strategy to reinforce the decision-making process of BESS operation. The efficacy of the proposed method is deployed on a modified IEEE-34 bus test feeder with real-world load and PV and wind power generation data. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicate that proper coordination between the BESS and smart PV inverters is beneficial for distribution system operations that seamlessly integrate PV and wind energy. Overall, the proposed voltage management strategy can be used to control the voltage to any desired range at different locations.}

Therefore, optimizing energy use in a city remains a challenge and respective decision support systems are important to guide local authorities toward that direction. This paper provides a holistic approach presenting a Smart City Energy Assessment Framework (SCEAF) along with a specific web based decision support tool, the so-called e-SCEAF, which can provide local authorities with fruitful results for assessing the energy behavior and performance of their city. The tool merges heterogeneous information, such as clearly quantifiable energy related indicators, the related city policy context performance and the integration of smart infrastructure. This multi-source information fusion is based on the 2-tuple linguistic representation model of Herrera and Martínez. This particular model has been widely used in decision problems and was mainly selected due to the fact that it provides linguistic results that are accurate and easy to understand by the cities’ local authorities. The performance, usefulness and effectiveness of the SCEAF framework and the e-SCEAF tool are tested on a real life application in three different cities, Savona (Italy), Sant Cugat del Vallès (Spain) and Zaanstad (The Netherlands). In this respect, the role of fusion methods and algorithms for merging multiple information will be evaluated in a “real life environment”.}

Existing trust management approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead and difficulty in selecting optimal parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a new method for trust management in smart home networks based on swarm optimization, a principle of swarm intelligence. Our proposed approach is based on swarm optimization, which is a principle of swarm intelligence that optimizes communication patterns and manages trust values within the network. In SwarmTrust, the nodes in the smart home network are represented by particles, and the positions and velocities of these particles are adjusted to optimize communication patterns and reduce the computational burden on nodes. This optimization is achieved by evaluating the trust values of each node and adjusting the communication patterns accordingly. The proposed method integrates trust management with several distinct parameters and selects the parameters optimally to maintain efficiency. The proposed approach also addresses optimization challenges by monitoring communication patterns and managing trust values in a distributed manner, which reduces the computational burden on nodes and maintains efficiency. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted simulation experiments and compared the performance of our approach with existing methods. Our results showed notable improvements in terms of computational efficiency and optimized computation.}

Finally, we implemented a case study of the smart product manufacturer ORVIBO and the Oppein MALL platform for whole-house customization to verify these optimal strategies. The results indicate that (i) firms should view the IoT's value in the long term, as their profits do not always increase as the IoT functionality level improves; (ii) the manufacturer's optimal strategy is to adopt service customization in both periods; (iii) service customization strategies can achieve Pareto optimality for the manufacturer and platform, resulting in a win-win state for consumers.}

An Internet of Things-enabled Smart Grid affords better automation, monitoring, and control of electricity consumption. However, rapid growth in connected entities, accompanied by electricity demand, brings about challenges such as securing energy information exchange before an incident occurs. It is argued that Smart Grid systems were designed with no regard for security, which is a serious omission for data, energy information exchange, and consumers’ and utilities’ privacy. This study is motivated by the gap identified between the requirements and controls for cybersecurity in the IoT-enabled Smart Grid's bidirectional data flow. It develops and confirms a model with seven security requirements and 45 security controls. In future, this model is to be verified and validated. This research focuses solely on the information flow's cybersecurity through using technical security controls to counter internet-based threats in IoT-enabled Smart Grids.}

abstract = {Background
In response to the rise of intelligent products and the increasing prevalence of urban "empty nesters," we have developed a product specifically tailored for elderly diabetic patients. This product fulfils functional requirements and addresses stylistic preferences, contributing to the age-friendly evolution of home intelligent medical devices, particularly in intelligent blood glucose monitoring.
Methods
Our approach commenced with a comprehensive user experience analysis to ascertain the needs of elderly users regarding home blood glucose meters. This involved constructing a hierarchy of user demands, followed by analysing and prioritising these needs. Utilizing Quality Function Deployment (QFD), we aligned user requirements with design specifications, identifying specific product functionalities and service design elements. Further, we employed Kansei Engineering (KE) to select sample designs that resonate with the concept of sensual imagery, leading to the derivation of specific modelling intentions. Combining these design elements, we proposed product design strategies and conducted practical case studies. The effectiveness of these designs was then assessed through fuzzy evaluation methods, allowing for user feedback.
Results
Employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process for goal analysis, along with Quality Function Deployment theory and Kansei Engineering, we developed a home intelligent blood glucose meter catered to the elderly. This device not only meets its users' physiological and psychological needs but also provides an operationally convenient, health-conscious, and aesthetically pleasing experience.
Conclusions
This methodology enhances the age-appropriate design of home-based smart glucose monitors for the elderly, offering innovative insights and optimization strategies for designing elderly-centric smart medical products.}
