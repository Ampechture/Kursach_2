abstract = {The years we are experiencing are often identified as those of the Age of Smart Technologies. Smart is now a very popular term, with the meaning of clever, intelligent, sharp, quick on the uptake. Its extensive meaning can be grasped if we consider it as an acronym for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology to indicate the essential features of the innovative technologies that characterize today's society in its daily life. Thus, the advent of the Smart Age, which is therefore the era of smart technologies, has heavily characterized and modified many aspects of today's society compared to the past. In this panorama, some arising questions regard transport infrastructure systems and, first of all, road transport. This research proposes a focus on one main issue: how roads fit into this smart revolution? Actually, the paper aims to offer an overview of the smart approach in road engineering by proposing a broad discussion about the current state of innovation in the smart roads field, i.e. the roads of the Smart Age. After defining the key functions of a smart road, the paper reviews some innovative technologies that make these items effective. These are studied in depth both with regard to motorway-type infrastructures and urban roads and intersections, with attention to the various technological aspects and to the benefits perceivable by management, users and the community. The paper, therefore, offers a bird's eye view of this extremely dynamic sector with innovative technologies for a new intelligent and connected mobility, and discusses some of their criticalities and strengths allowing for optimization and development of new transport functions and services, improving energy efficiency and promoting social, economic and environmental sustainability.}

Recently, the Singapore government has changed the rule for participation in the wholesale market. The Smart Community project, developed by NTU, DNV GL and Green Koncepts, will look into critical factors that will help retail consumers to participate in the demand responses (DR) program and time of use (TOU) pricing. This study reviews benefits for current retail consumer, the impact of DR and TOU on real-time energy consumption of the users, the impact of user experience-focus application toward smart grid participation program on participation reliability and contribution in power reduction during curtailment period. The DR program allows the users to become an active participant in the energy market. It also allows the government to plan better on the limited and costly energy resources, improve system reliability, and reduce transmission and distribution congestion, check and balance on the market power generation. A mobile-based user-experience focus on convenience application is to be developed for consumers to actively participate in the demand-side management programme, which make Singapore Wholesale Energy Market more resilient and reducing market power by introducing competition.}

In the post-pandemic era, equipping schools with a network of smart IoT sensors has become critical to aspire for the optimal control of the IAQ and lowering the airborne infection risk of several pathogens, indirectly related to cumulated human emitted CO2 levels over time. Thermal energy waste in winter due to improved air renewal remains of major concern but can be well monitored within a SHS monitoring architecture thanks to the flexibility of the LoRaWAN protocol able to process also a large amount of energy and climatic data at room and building scale. In this work, we report the design of the AulaSicura platform, an IoT control system co-designed by the main author and Gizero Energie to implement the SHS paradigm via clearly visible (and audible) alarm signalling in existing and new school buildings. The cloud-based LoRa system is capable of continuous and simultaneous monitoring of a variety of sensors and IAQ parameters including indoor/oudoor temperatures, rel. humidities and human-emitted excess CO2. The multi-room monitoring concept of indoor-CO2 levels allows centralized control of natural ventilation levels in individual classrooms and can handle (quasi)-real-time data, relevant for data post-processing and future developments in (quasi)-real-rime assessment of IAQ and infection risk levels at single room scale. The sensor network is also extensible to up to one thousand of classrooms per LoRa-node allowing centralized control of entire school districts at an urban scale. Moreover, through Modbus-LoRa I/O converters, AulaSicura can also control the same amount of mechanical ventilation units per node either in pure or hybrid mechanical ventilation modes.}

At first, we discuss the main features of the SG neighborhood area network (NAN) architecture. We explore the main features of low-rate machine-type wireless networks, and also we describe a technology characterization of wireless neighborhood area networks (WNAN) in medium-range coverage applications. We propose a new-improved irregular repetition slotted ALOHA, combining Raptor codes and irregular ALOHA, namely RapIRSA random access protocol, to better respond to critical high-reliability QoS requirements under a 5G network perspective. Then, we compare and comprehensively analyze the proposed RapIRSA protocol with two existing RA protocols, the IRSA protocol, and the classical Slotted Aloha. Finally, We summarize the potential challenges in implementing the proposed RA protocol for SG critical applications considering a massive number of smart sensors (SS).}

Due to the VANET (Vehicle Ad-hoc Network), many cars are using V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), I2V (Infrastructure-to-Vehicle), and V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communications to notify of and detect collisions. But without prior notification, dangers such as earthquakes/flash floods can endanger the safety of passengers at any time. Thus we need real-time updates and notification through IoT-based sensors and warnings through predictions to the vehicle as I2V and V2I communications. Through apps, we can gather data regarding speed, gravitational force, pressure, sound, and location from the user and when changes occur abruptly and cross a threshold, a notification is sent to a centralized VANET using mobile metadata and IoT, and prediction using machine learning (ML), to determine a hazard-prone area is proposed. A fault-tolerant, low-cost alert system with fewer errors and false alarms is a key focus of this research.}

abstract = {This paper presents a centralized neighbourhood energy management with coordinated smart home energy-sharing model for neighbourhood smart homes, which are integrated with in-house renewable energy resources and energy storage systems. The main aim of this neighbourhood energy management model is to minimize the aggregated electricity bill of all smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area by increasing the utilization of local renewable energy generation. The effective combination of time of use pricing, feed-in-tariff scheme and fixed incentive method is considered in this model to encourage the more electricity transactions among the neighbourhood smart homes. A group of ten smart homes with different level of renewable energy integration and load profiles is considered as a test system to determine the performance of the proposed neighbourhood smart home energy management model. The simulation results show that the centralized neighbourhood coordinated smart home energy management model can provide significant economic benefits to all smart home consumers in the neighbourhood area, when compared to the without neighbourhood power-sharing case. From the results, it is noted that all smart homes together get 56.23% of cost savings in a day with the proposed model when compared to the baseline model. Finally, an economic analysis has also done in this paper to investigate the capital investment benefits of all smart home consumers in neighbourhood area. From the economic analysis, it is clearly noticed that with the proposed model the annual profits of all smart homes (SHs) in the neighbourhood area are improved by 54.48% for SH1, 59.88% for SH2, 85.03% for SH3, 41.55% for SH4, 30.68% for SH5, and 34.70% for SH6 respectively when compared to without neighbourhood energy sharing concept.}

Consequently, drinking water utilities must improve the efficiency of their management systems while guaranteeing a clean effluent that satisfies drinking water standards. One possible solution is via smart growth, an urban development paradigm with the goal of reducing the environmental impact of urbanization. Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of smart growth on the operational energy of drinking water distribution. Projected water use in Tampa’s drinking water service area was estimated based on several urban growth projections. Then, each scenario’s associated projected water consumption is integrated in an EPANET simulation of Tampa’s water distribution system for the subsequent estimation of the operational energies of drinking water distribution. Results show that smart growth has no exclusive influence on the operational energy of water supply. However, location of added demand relative to the location of the water treatment plant has more of an influence on the operational energy. Also, smart growth in the City of Tampa Water Service Area is responsible for a decrease in per-capita residential water and energy use of about 6–10% and 0.5–6.2% respectively. In conclusion, smart growth in areas near the water treatment facility may minimize water-related energy use.}

Despite growing global recognition of Indigenous and local peoples' rights to forests, lands, and oceans as central to socially just and successful conservation, new initiatives to conserve 30% of the Earth's territory by 2030 (‘30 × 30’) under the United Nations' (UN) post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework largely continue to neglect their existing customary rights and uses of biodiverse territories. The consequences of this have become evident in new global conservation partnerships that are taking a ‘technological turn’. ‘Smart technologies’ that rely on artificial intelligence (AI) and complex hardware, such as camera traps, drones, and smartphones, enable new forms of surveillance and securitisation through and beyond conventional conservation practices. Despite their potential to exacerbate social injustices against historically marginalised groups, the situated character of smart technology impacts and outcomes often remain unquestioned by mainstream conservation actors. Our paper shows how the dominant discourses framing such technology as successful and innovative across global and local partnerships belies its potential to: 1) inflict considerable violence upon local and Indigenous peoples; and 2) neglect the main political economic drivers of biodiversity loss. Drawing on examples from Palawan Island, the Philippines, we show how these global-local governance partnerships have valorised the potential success of smart technology for biodiversity conservation in situ without considering how they may adversely impact Indigenous and local peoples' rights and livelihoods, while at the same time neglecting and depoliticising the violence of capitalist extractivist expansion.}

Crucial and promising challenges exist especially with the integration of renewable energy sources and smart grids. The ability to collect data and to properly use it for better decision-making is a key feature; in this work, the benefits and challenges of implementing big data analytics for renewable energy power stations are addressed. A framework was developed for the potential implementation of big data analytics for smart grids and renewable energy power utilities. A five-step approach is proposed for predicting the smart grid stability by using five different machine learning methods. Data from a decentralized smart grid data system consisting of 60,000 instances and 12 attributes was used to predict the stability of the system through three different machine learning methods. The results of fitting the penalized linear regression model show an accuracy of 96% for the model implemented using 70% of the data as a training set. Using the random forest tree model has shown 84% accuracy, and the decision tree model has shown 78% accuracy. Both the convolutional neural network model and the gradient boosted decision tree model yielded 87% for the classification model. The main limitation of this work is that the amount of data available in the dataset is considered relatively small for big data analytics; however the cloud computing and real-time event analysis provided was suitable for big data analytics framework. Future research should include bigger datasets with variety of renewable energy sources and demand across more countries.}

This recognition has led many cities, around the world, to engage more actively in food policies and programs. The literature documenting this experience is largely case study-based and primarily covers actions and outcomes in larger cities. We analyze the overall state of urban food policy across Asia, drawing attention to distinctive patterns across city size categories and testing hypotheses which may explain the diversity of observed patterns of food policy engagement. Particular attention is given to demographic, institutional, and geographical factors which have likely influenced either the motivation or the capacities of cities to act on food matters. We find that most Asian cities are at an early stage in efforts to apply coherent and coordinated approaches to address food-related challenges and opportunities. The opportunities for future economic gain and avoidance of social costs may be greatest among the region's fast-growing small- and medium-sized cities, yet many such cities lack the requisite capacities to influence complex food system matters and will require assistance from national agencies and others.}

In marginal areas of southern Europe, this limits fuel treatment programs from reaching the critical mass of required treated area to modify landscape flammability, the fire regime and its impacts. This study investigates key fuel management initiatives for wildfire risk prevention in southern EU countries. We compared local approaches through a bottom-up selection of 38 initiatives, which we analyzed systematically through a set of fire-smart criteria: sustainability, cost-benefit ratio, synergies and inter-sectoral cooperation, integration between strategic prevention planning and multiple land governance goals (e.g., rural development, biodiversity conservation, energy supply), innovation and knowledge transfer, and adaptive management. We summarized lessons learned from the most innovative initiatives, by identifying solutions and functional approaches for building sustainable fuel management at the landscape scale, under fire-smart management principles. These make synergistic use of private, public and European resources to activate value chains that valorize the products, by-products and services generated by fuel management activities and their positive externalities on ecosystem services. The multiple mechanisms include fire-marketing, Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes, specific taxes, or environmental compensatory measures. These mechanisms catalyze the interest of multiple stakeholders (economic actors, private owners, land and fire management agencies) improving the cost-efficiency of landscape fuel management. We contend that the EU Green Deal offers the political backing and framework (mainstreaming of EU strategies and funding opportunities) to enable the replication of documented fire-smart models and functional approaches to wildfire risk prevention.}

abstract = {Smart local energy systems (SLES) have been promoted in policy as a solution to decarbonisation challenges which also bring wider benefits, such as community prosperity and energy affordability. But the combination of conditions required to enable their successful emergence and operation are still to be elaborated. This paper reports on the development of a Theory of Change (ToC) for the “societal project” of emergence of SLES with benefits. ToC is a process of making explicit the causal links by which activities lead to outcomes, surfacing assumptions, and recognising possible unintended consequences. We describe the ToC development process, involving consultation and collaboration across a research consortium. It consists of layers (e.g. users, skills, data and digital), and shows conditions considered necessary to deliver SLES, and for these to deliver wider benefits. It also provides interactive links to evidence emerging from the consortium, as well as policy/governance conditions and metrics. We reflect on potential uses of the ToC – internally to the consortium and externally – along with challenges we encountered in pursuing this approach. Policy implications relate to the importance of enabling conditions across multiple sectors, the absence of any of which could inhibit delivery of either SLES or their ensuing benefits.}

abstract = {There is a need for enhanced flexibility to allow the high penetration of intermittent renewable power into the power system. In this way, transmission system operators (TSO) need more flexible energy resources that help to control the power system frequency by using balancing services. Distribution system operators (DSO) also seek new flexible energy resources that can counteract stochasticity, control voltage level, and manage congestions in distribution networks. Smart homes located in distribution networks are potential resources. Hence, this paper considers a smart home with flexible appliances and devices, including a battery energy storage system (BESS) interfaced with an inverter, an air conditioner (AC), and an electric vehicle (EV). The smart home aims to provide the system operators with coordinated frequency and DSO-level services while respecting the thermal comfort and schedules of the household residence. The inverter-interfaced BESS not only provides active power support for TSO and DSO, but it also injects and consumes reactive power if the DSO needs local flexibility. Fuzzy logic control system is deployed to obtain this goal. In the simulation section, a smart home with flexible appliances is scheduled. Different operations and the economic outcomes are discussed for the smart home considering real-world data.}

abstract = {Infrastructure modernization is a central concern in many cities of the developing world. Local governments struggle to provide adequate public services under budgetary constraints and vast spatial and economic inequalities. After the demise of the centralized modernist planning paradigm, current approaches to urban development focus on public-private partnerships, resulting in networks of dependency that involve multiple stakeholders and complex relationships of accountability. This stakeholder complexity complicates decision making, but can also lead to new social practices and participatory models of infrastructure governance. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of social practices surrounding the provision and modernization of streetlight and electricity in Paco, Manila, enacted by formal and informal actors. Drawing from the case study, literature on organizational improvisation and improvisational governance (Martijn Hartog, 2015), we propose a model of infrastructure governance that is based on the concept of improvisation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with city officials, planners, residents and local activists, we develop the notion of improstructure as a conceptual model for understanding infrastructure governance as an improvisational process of “call and response” among a diverse set of actors. We apply this perspective to ongoing modernization efforts by the city of Manila and its utility companies, involving smart city technologies including sensor networks, drone mapping, and data analytics. We argue that despite the placeless and generic rhetoric surrounding these technologies, they constitute improvisational responses to local conditions. We conclude by formulating design principles for improvisational infrastructure governance, which are not limited to the Global South, but also apply in developed countries.}

Digital public services are reshaped by emerging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and the Internet of things (IoT). According to both natural increase and migration from rural areas and small towns, the demand for transport in most of the Indian cities has risen. Studies have found that rise in the availability of motorized transportation, an increase in household income, and an increase in commercial and industrial activities have made it even more abundant. Therefore, the travel demand has risen at a significant and rapid rate, and thus, public transport systems have been unable to keep pace. An extremely limited number of major cities are served by rail-based public transportation, whereas the best organized bus services are found in only a few major cities. On the quantitative scale, during peak hours, public transportation is severely overcrowded, as well as tedious to use. As a result, there is a massive movement toward personalized transport, such as cars and two-wheelers, and advancing economic growth and prosperity.}

The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge/cloud computing, 5G networks, big data analytics, and other emerging technologies in IoT systems is leading to the emergence of Smart Systems that support devices to make autonomous decisions in order to improve and facilitate people’s lives. These smart IoT devices produce a huge amount of sensitive data. Thus, establishing Trust between these devices is vital to ensure the security of the sensed data and for the normal functionality of smart systems. To address these challenges, several Trust establishment protocols have been proposed, but they have some limitations such as centralization, the need for human intervention, and the lack of adaptability to smart devices with computation and storage constraints. In this paper, a decentralized trust establishment protocol is proposed for smart IoT devices and is applicable for different scenarios. The protocol provides decentralized identity management, mutual authentication, access control, and secure communication by combining Blockchain technology with PV-SAS-MCA message cross-authentication protocol based on Short Authenticated Strings (SAS). To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to propose a new approach that uses Blockchain as an extra distributed and authenticated channel to exchange Short Authenticated Strings without physical interaction. This helps to allow entities in the Smart IoT environment not only to identify each other but also to exchange their public keys in a secure manner. Moreover, the proposed protocol uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure communications with significantly smaller key sizes and lower computation overhead. Experimental results reveal that the time required to complete the authentication process is less than 90 ms which is a superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art decentralized authentication mechanisms.}

This study further developed an expert questionnaire based on 25 evaluation indicators and evaluated the key indicators of smart port service quality and their causal relationships using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and decision making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). The results of this study showed that the key smart port success factors are: (1) accurate and secure delivery of cargo; (2) accurate electronic document transfer; (3) rapid provision of port berths to shorten the turnover time of ships; (4) convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures; (5) transparent information integration on a single platform; and (6) use of big data to arrange container transport. Causal relationships were found among the indicators, including the fact that "convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures" was influenced by “accurate electronic document transfer," "transparent information integration on a single platform," and "use of big data to arrange container transport." The results of this study can help port operators and government agencies identify key success factors for smart ports. This will enable participants in the supply chain to take early measures to respond to the impact of emergencies in the post-pandemic era, thus improving port operations and customer satisfaction. This research provides a standard model of smart port service quality that can serve as a reference for building a competitive advantage and making sustainable management decisions.}

This makes the future power system highly stochastic; thus, its control on both the source and demand side becomes exceptionally challenging. Therefore, the future power system must be flexible and have enough capacity to sustain this intermittency reliably. There is a need for a survey that analyzes the flexibility concept in detail and discusses how to enable demand-side flexibility through demand-side management and demand response programs. This review paper presents a comprehensive overview of the concepts, modeling, and provision methods related to flexibility in smart grids. Furthermore, it models and studies the various demand-side flexible resources that may be deployed in the flexibility provision. It examines and categorizes flexibility services and resources while considering their key characteristics, such as their scope, purpose, location, and describes some key strategies for designing and implementing flexibility markets. Moreover, it helps formulate mathematical models for flexibility and flexibility provision in smart grids. A brief state-of-the-art review of real-time flexibility by implementing peer-to-peer energy trading in the flexibility framework is provided. The formulation of flexibility and flexibility provided in the distribution system are discussed, and the results are presented. Besides this, the challenges and limitations in flexibility framework and management are explained. Finally, future research directions are suggested to improve the flexibility provision and provide a framework for smart grids.}

abstract = {Goods and services can be tracked in real-time with smart logistics. Smart logistics have been utilized by enterprises, transportation applications, and delivery services for some time now. The primary objective of logistics management is to find the most efficient and cost-effective methods to move resources and goods from their starting point to their final destination and the customer. Logistics is still plagued by high prices and poor efficiency in the current industry. These issues can be solved with the development of smart logistics. Several industries and business solutions rely heavily on a logistics system to handle transportation issues and save costs. The Internet of Everything Smart Logistic Network (IoE-SLN) has been suggested in this paper. Various applications for logistics systems are integrated into many systems, and they cost a lot and are not utilized in certain cases, making it difficult to justify their purchase. IoE is important in information and communication technology because it can generate vast amounts of data and evaluate the complex links between transactions represented by this data using various mathematical techniques. Although the logistics industry is heavily involved, security has become a hot subject of particular concern with complicated technology and a massive volume of data. This paper builds a financial logistics monitoring system using Internet of Everything technologies in the context of an intelligent environment. Numerical results show that the method has a better-quality accuracy ratio of 92.1%, investment ratio of 98.4%, demand forecast ratio of 95.4%, product delivery ratio of 97.6%, and network security ratio of 96.4%. Data transmission, materials management, manufacture, marketing, inventories, shipping, storage, and security are all part of physical item logistics. As a result, simulation programmes have been developed to handle the complexity of logistics. When importing and exporting, logistics is all about saving money and resources. Whether IoE devices gather, transfer, and distribute information significantly impacts data accuracy. Data capture systems that can operate on-premise, as an interface service that can store and send data on miscommunication, are crucial to information management. Smart objects connected to the Internet of Everything(IoE) enable us to improve agriculture and food security, identify and contain fatal infections, and decrease pollution in some of the world's largest cities. Over half the world's population now resides in urban areas, and this trend is expected to continue.}

The samples were characterized using XRD, FESEM, TEM, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. XRD reveal the hexagonal structure of WO3 while nano-rod morphology was ascertained using FESEM and TEM. The average diameter of nanorods calculated using TEM comes out to be 41.9 ± 1.6 nm.

It is crucial that we improve our energy management due to the ever-growing imbalance in demand-supply. The new wave in the energy sector is characterized by the three D's of decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. For a sustainable life, it is necessary that energy is tapped from alternative sources that are renewable to leave a minimal carbon footprint. To integrate different sources with the main power grid, we require two-way communication among them. This makes it indispensable that consumers are empowered to protect their privacy and make them the sole owners of their data. A good access control scheme would ensure security of data, and an efficient trading platform would ensure judicious use of the resources. Here, we propose a framework URJA with an access control scheme and an energy trading platform based on blockchain for a smart grid. The locally available renewable sources of energy are connected to the grid such that demand-supply is managed effectively without loss of efficiency and privacy. A customized consensus scheme based on trust ensures a quick operation in real-time.}

In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of “smart-troubleshooting” that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying fault—causes and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.}

abstract = {Guiding electric vehicles (EVs) in smart energy communities to participate in demand response can significantly benefit users and the load aggregator. However, when the user's travel plans are uncertain, the EV may end up charging before the planned time, leaving the user with an insufficient power supply. This can occur because the control program chooses to charge the EV during periods of low electricity prices to reduce user costs. To address this issue, a new strategy for charging pricing based on service-quality is proposed to help users deal with the uncertainty of travel plans and promote user participation in demand response. In this paper, the proposed charging pricing of EVs consists of three parts. Firstly, the model of charging packages with different service qualities is designed for users. The differences in charging packages are reflected in the percentage of power supply and price within each time slot. Charging packages provide users with at least a certain amount of power in each time slot, allowing them to better cope with the uncertainty of their travel plans. Secondly, a subscription model for charging packages is built to match the user's travel plans. Finally, the pricing model of the charging package is established, representing the master-slave game between the load aggregator and the user. The model is linearized by the KKT condition. The results show that the proposed strategy helps users cope with the uncertainty of their travel plans, reducing charging cost for users by 16.39% while increasing revenue for the load aggregator by 14.8%.}

Attention towards these groups is also important for social justice in sustainable transitions. How can research insights from inclusive innovation contribute to just transitions? In this paper, based on original mixed methods data, analysis built around levels of inclusion is applied empirically to the case of smart local energy systems in the UK. Despite innovators acknowledging inclusiveness as significant for their decarbonised, decentralised and digitalised transition goals, inclusion operates currently at low levels owing to the prevalence of a liberal-individualist approach to justice in the electricity regime. Noting efforts (and constraints) in higher-level inclusion in some demonstration projects, we discuss whether and how social-collectivist approaches to justice open up more transformative possibilities. The case illustrates how analysis of relations between justice and inclusion can invite more transformational innovation policies.}

This concern is particularly relevant when time-dependent and especially real-time pricing of electricity is available. A parallel problem resides in businesses not transferring energy pricing variations onto their customers, in a way that shields them from effectively contributing to demand response. Under such a scenario, for businesses to remain competitive, different levels of services could be offered, according to the time of day at which energy consumption takes place. This paper is grounded on the assumption that energy consumers require assistance for making appropriate energy usage choices in the ever-complex evolving energy market, especially in consuming services and products that optimize overall energy use. A tentative architecture for a community-wide collaborative energy optimization platform is presented, aimed at engaging citizens, business owners, and city authorities into exploring alternative efficient behaviour scenarios. This work also reviews and discusses how developments in fields of cloud-based data acquisition, energy management, and ICT-based engagement platforms can be integrated to realize this vision.}

Therefore, taking into consideration that energy distribution and consumption is highly volatile, there is an emerging need for estimating energy demands, as well as to distribute energy in the best possible way, so that manufacturing processes are not interrupted. Consequently, the contribution of this research work is focused firstly on the modelling of a Smart Grid, then on the design and development of the Digital Twin of the modelled Smart Grid, and to the development of suitable optimization models/algorithms for electric energy distribution. The proposed energy distribution framework can be realized as a platform, on which the energy customers are capable of registering their company to the Smart Grid and use the optimization services in order to optimize their energy profile. Thus, this framework can be considered as Product-Service System (PSS), offered by energy suppliers. The applicability of the simulation framework is validated in a university campus.}

abstract = {The hybrid solar photovoltaic systems are among the most widely used photovoltaic systems due to their high electrical efficiency. In this paper, a set of smart hybrid photovoltaic systems, integrating a semi-transparent photovoltaic panel with smart hybrid solar collector tubes is proposed. Additionally, a smart cooling system is used for the first time to perfectly stabilize the electrical efficiency of the proposed hybrid systems for different solar irradiation. These new systems are mainly proposed for the first time to improve the electrical efficiency of a semi-transparent photovoltaic panel. To obtain the effects of sun irradiation and linear Fresnel lens on the performance of each hybrid system, a set of mathematical equations is coded in MATLAB software. The main results revealed that the maximum electrical efficiency of the SPV/SHC/Bi2Te3, SPV/SHC/PbTe, SPV/SHC/Bi2Te3/Bi2Te3, SPV/SHC/Bi2Te3/PbTe, and SPV/SHC/PbTe/PbTe in absence of smart cooling system are respectively 2.88%, 3%, 5.76%, 5.88%, and 6% higher than that of the stand-alone SPV system. When these hybrid panels are equipped with smart cooling system, the maximum electrical efficiency of the SPV/SHC/Bi2Te3, SPV/SHC/PbTe, SPV/SHC/Bi2Te3/Bi2Te3, SPV/SHC/Bi2Te3/PbTe and SPV/SHC/PbTe/PbTe are respectively 3.58%, 3.7%, 6.46%, 6.58% and 6.7% higher than that of the conventional SPV system. These results also showed that the SPV/SHC/PbTe/PbTe system with smart cooling system is electrically more efficient than the other systems, which is due to its higher efficiency and power output of 14.1% and 410.271 W. The electrical efficiency of the proposed hybrid systems, equipped with an intelligent cooling system, stays stable for higher and medium values of sun irradiation. These results provide a definitive solution to the problem of decreasing electrical efficiency of photovoltaic panels due to the increase of its temperature.}

This particular benefit addresses the main bottleneck in a centralized cloud framework, which is, it cannot process latency-sensitive large video frames generated from the Internet of Things-based video surveillance cameras in real-time. Besides, the recent advancements in the computer vision field offer many state-of-the-art image processing capabilities that can be utilized for real-time surveillance data processing. Deploying those processing powers at several fog computing layers can bring novel solutions for computer vision-based real-time security solutions. This paper proposes a deep learning-based framework for smart video surveillance that can process the real-time frames on two consecutive fog layers, one for action recognition and the other for criminal threat-based response generation. The proposed architecture consists of three major modules. The first module is responsible for capturing surveillance videos by deploying RaspberryPi cameras in a distributed network. The second module is responsible for action recognition using a deep learning-based model installed inside NVIDIA Jetson Nano-devices placed on two fog layers. Finally, the security response is generated and broadcast to the law-enforcement agency. To evaluate the proposed model, experiments on semantic segmentation-based scene object recognition were run. The experimental results came up with a suitable recognition model that can be deployed in the fog layers of our proposed framework.}

The results from the case study, used to demonstrate the proposed methodology, can be extrapolated to the entire university in order to transform it into a smart campus. The case study also shows that the continuous measurement of temperatures allows to avoid excessive heating, reducing unnecessary energy consumption. Additionally, the case study shows the importance of monitoring CO2 concentration in rooms where occupancy is fluctuating, since it enables a control of the HVAC system based on the instantaneous CO2 level (and predictive in the immediate aftermath). This proposed measurement can save between 40% and 70% of HVAC energy consumption.

However, current STEAM education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design.

Further, additions of renewable into such a DN have converted the network into a dynamic multienergy system. Hence, maintaining coordination of protection relay during a fault in a complex and renewable penetrated grid is a challenge and often it may be lost. As a result, a power outage in a large area following a relay and protective device maloperation is inevitable. Extreme environmental conditions such as storms and hurricanes, and other issues like cyberattack on smart grids are the major issues that can cause large power outages. However, earlier power restoration is essential to get people back to normal in most urban areas after the occurrence of any disaster or power failure following a fault. With the smart grid initiative, many sensors, smart meters, and fault recorders are added for proper monitoring and to capture the parameter variations during disturbances. This has increased the ability of the grid to maintain the desirable parameters within the operating limit of the distribution system (DS). Following an outage in a large area, with signals received from large sets of smart meters, fault indicators, relays, and sensor data, it is merely difficult to search the faulty section to initiate the process of power restoration of the healthy section within a minimum time. Hence, effective outage management is crucial to minimize the impact of power outages in terms of outage time, economic loss, and reliability improvement. The outage management system (OMS) is used by utilities to manage and respond to power outages efficiently. The OMS is designed to streamline the outage management process, from the detection and reporting of outages to the final restoration of power. However, the smart grid framework incorporates proactive measures, advanced analytics, and intelligent decision-making to expedite the restoration process. With real-time monitoring, analytics and artificial intelligent tools are integrated to minimize the outage time. The intelligent decision-making component focuses on fault isolation, optimal resource allocation, crew scheduling, and coordination with stakeholders.}

The lack of real-world data can be attributed to the limited availability of tools for long-term data collection. Consequently, a system for data collection with flexible, low-cost, and open-source tools is developed. The viability and reliability of such tools are tested in practice to collect real-world data. This research demonstrates how smart bins solution for textile waste collection can be linked to a dynamic route-optimization system to improve overall system performance. The developed Arduino-based low-cost sensors collected actual data in Finnish outdoor conditions for over twelve months. The viability of the smart waste collection system was complemented with a case study evaluating the collection cost of the conventional and dynamic scheme of discarded textiles. The results of this study show how a sensor-enhanced dynamic collection system reduced the cost 7.4% compared with the conventional one. We demonstrate a time efficiency of −7.3% and that a reduction of 10.2% in CO2 emissions is achievable only considering the presented case study.}

abstract = {Climate change and environmental problems have spurred new strategies to reduce fossil fuel consumption in transportation. Two important strategies include a rapid transition to green energy and the replacement of internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs). However, the increasing demand for electricity by EVs, especially from time-dependent green sources of energy (e.g., solar, wind), will likely overload the grid at peak hours. Smart charging programs for EVs could defer charging to off-peak times and better match demand with supply. Yet, little is currently known about people’s willingness to sign up for a program. To understand incentive effects on smart charging program adoption, we distributed a survey (n = 785) in October 2018 across the United States targeting three groups: 1) EV owners/lessees (n = 151), 2) EV interested buyers/lessees (n = 555), and 3) a general population (n = 79). We first found that a significant portion of both EV groups would be interested in the program without any incentive, but there was a participation limit. Employing three mixed logit models, we found that monetary incentives and free charging equipment increased participation for the two EV groups, although the attributes exhibited heterogeneity. Guaranteed battery level (or rides home) increased participation for all three groups and at least one random parameter was present for all three groups. Penalties deployed to discourage participants from taking back charging control decreased participation willingness in the two EV groups, although EV interested buyers/lessees responded heterogeneously. While higher monetary incentives increased participation, the effects displayed diminishing returns.}

abstract = {Smart healthcare strategies have been identified as a potential solution to address the growing challenges faced by the healthcare sector. The ability of smart healthcare strategies to improve efficiency, patient's outcomes and delivery of quality healthcare has motivated and committed governments and policy makers to invest in this innovation. However, uptake and usage of smart healthcare strategies has not been successful as anticipated, and this is due to a number of challenges faced by different stakeholders during the adoption of these strategies. The objective of this paper is to systematically check published literature to identify and compile a comprehensive list of challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. Knowledge of these potential challenges gives stakeholders awareness and better prospects of dealing with the challenges of adopting smart healthcare strategies. A systematic literature review was conducted. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct were searched for full text, peer reviewed, English language articles that reported the challenges for successful adoption of smart healthcare management strategies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to select eligible articles. After the full screening, 26 articles that met the criteria were analysed and reported. Three main themes of challenges that affect the adoption of smart healthcare strategies have been identified based on technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework. The findings of this study demonstrate that different TOE challenges affect smart health strategies adoption by healthcare sector. This study, therefore, proposes a differentiated approach to policies and practices to effectively scale up adoption of smart health and reduce failure rates of smart health projects. It is concluded that future research is needed in identifying key change management strategies to successfully manage the identified challenges to improve the prospects of successful adoption of smart healthcare strategies.}

Herein, a film was prepared by the Layer-by-Layer assembly of W18O49 nanowires and a Preyssler-type polyoxometalate (POM) [P5W30O110]15− (P5W30). The introduction of amorphous POM decreased the band gap to 2.54 eV, which greatly facilitated the synergy between the EC and charge storage properties. Driven under a low voltage of −0.6 V, this W18O49/P5W30 composite film displayed strong and reversible changes in its optical absorbance in both the visible and near-infrared regions, and it also showed the typical pseudocapacitance behavior with an area capacitance of 34.71 mF cm−2. Moreover, this film was able to simultaneously quantify and visualize its own energy storage state and photothermal conversion in real time by significant color changes (maximum chromaticity difference: 72.44) and high absorbance changes (1.11 at 650 nm and 1.11 at 1200 nm). In addition, a gel EC supercapacitor based on the W18O49/P5W30 film as cathode and NiO film as anode exhibited an absorbance variation up to 0.75 and an area capacitance as high as 4.42 mF cm−2, and it successfully powered a light emitting diode using the stored electrical energy. This work not only broadens the application scope of POM-based EC materials but also provides a feasible design strategy for next-generation smart energy storage devices.}

In the field of smart grids, a plethora of proposals have emerged to utilize blockchain for augmenting intelligent energy management, energy trading, security and privacy protection, microgrid management, and energy vehicles. Compared with traditional centralized approaches, blockchain-based solutions are able to exploit the advantages of blockchain to realize better functionality in smart grids. However, the blockchain technology itself has its disadvantages in low processing throughput and weak privacy protection. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to study how to integrate blockchain with smart grids in a more effective way so that the advantages of blockchain can be maximized and its disadvantages can be avoided. This article surveys the state-of-the-art solutions aiming to integrate the emergent blockchain technology with smart grids. The goal of this survey is to discuss the necessity of applying blockchain in different components of smart grids, identify the challenges encountered by current solutions, and highlight the frameworks and techniques used to integrate blockchain with smart grids. We also present thorough comparison studies among blockchain-based solutions for smart grids from different perspectives, with the aim to provide insights on integrating blockchain with smart grids for different smart grid management tasks. Finally, we list the current projects and initiatives demonstrating the current effort from the practice side. Additionally, we draw attention to open problems that have not yet been tackled by existing solutions, and point out possible future research directions.}

abstract = {The increasing demand in mobility forms a major challenge for modern cities, even more so when examined under the prism of transition from traditional to CO2-free mobility. Railway infrastructure forms a main carrier for the mobility of people and goods and a salient component of critical infrastructures. The increased traffic frequency in urban transport imposes higher capacity demands and leads to more frequent damage and more severe deterioration and associated disruptions to service and availability. Aligning with the spirit of smart cities, and data-driven decision support, infrastructure operators require timely information regarding the current (diagnosis) and future (prognosis) condition of their assets in order to sensibly decide on maintenance and renewal actions. Railway condition assessment has traditionally heavily relied on-site visual inspections. Main measurement parameters for railway tracks are obtained since the 1960s. Quality, accuracy, and precision of measurements heavily evolved since then, including aspects such as storage, analysis, and interpretation of data. In recent years, specialized monitoring vehicles offer an automated means for relaying essential information on condition, obtained from diverse measurements including laser measurements, vibration, image, and ultrasonic information. Powered by this information diagnostic vehicles have shifted assessment from a reactive to a predictive mode. More recently, in-service vehicles equipped with low-cost on-board monitoring (OBM) measuring devices, such as accelerometers, have been introduced on railroad networks, traversing the network at higher frequencies than the specialized diagnostic vehicles. The collected information includes position, acceleration, and in some cases force measurements. The measured data require interpretation into quantifiable track-quality indicators, before it can be meaningfully incorporated in asset management tools. These indicators form the basis for real-time forecasting of condition evolution and asset management, which are essential traits of a transport infrastructure that fits the vision of smart cities. This chapter explores the state of the art of OBM for railway infrastructure condition assessment, conducting a thorough review of data-processing methodologies, which is further complemented with application examples.}

To describe the prevalence of Owlet Smart Sock (OSS) use in infants with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and associated demographic and clinical characteristics of users and to analyze the association of OSS use on medical resource use and clinical outcomes from emergency department (ED) encounters for SVT.
Study design
This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of infants with confirmed SVT from 2015 to 2022. OSS users and nonusers were compared across clinical and demographic parameters. Medical resource use (phone calls, office visits, ED visits) and outcomes (need for intensive care, length of stay, echocardiographic function, clinical appearance) were compared between OSS users and nonusers.
Results
Of 133 infants with SVT, OSS was used by 31 of 133 (23%), purchased before SVT diagnosis in 5 in 31 (16%) of users. No demographic difference was found between OSS users and nonusers. OSS users had more phone notes than nonusers, (P = .002) and more ED visits (P = .03), but the number of office visits and medication adjustments did not differ. During ED presentation, OSS users had better preserved left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiogram (P = .04) and lower length of hospital stay by a mean 1.7 days (P = .02).
Conclusions
OSS is used by a portion of infants with SVT. It is associated with more frequent phone calls and ED visits but lower length of stay and better-preserved cardiac function upon presentation.}

abstract = {In this paper, the application of smart glazing systems as shading devices is evaluated for US residential buildings. Specifically, static and dynamic overhangs are considered using smart glazing that can change their tint state to reduce the heating and cooling thermal loads for prototypical housing units in high-rise apartment buildings. The tint settings as well as the overhang tilt angles are specified on hourly, daily, and monthly basis depending on the window orientation and the time of the year to minimize the annual energy demand for the housing units. The performance of smart glazed overhang systems is compared to both static and dynamic shading devices made-up of conventional opaque materials. In addition, the impacts of various design and climatic conditions are considered to assess the energy performance of the smart glazed overhangs. The results of the analysis indicate that the annual energy consumption for existing housing units with conventional windows located in Boulder, CO, can be reduced by over 7% for static smart glazed overhangs and by over 22% for dynamic smart glazed overhangs. These savings are even higher with larger windows and wider differentials between optical properties between clear and dark states. The smart glazed overhangs allow the use of low-cost smart glazing as a retrofit measure for existing buildings. Moreover, the smart glazed overhangs allow the specification of large windows for new constructions with limited energy penalties.}

Based on these factors, a model for heating energy consumption was developed. Moreover, the study found that residents' heating energy consumption behavior had a strong explanatory power in both space heating and hot water energy consumption models. Therefore, to achieve accurate prediction and evaluation of energy consumption in the residential sector, future research should thoroughly consider resident characteristics and energy use behavior, taking into account different types of final energy. Furthermore, it is crucial to comprehensively consider residents' characteristics when developing energy-saving policies for buildings, as this will lead to meaningful outcomes.}

abstract = {New forms of urban governance are emerging with the onset of digital twins and a changing relationship between digital cities and designers. (Digital twins were developed by NASA for technology roadmaps and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for computational simulation of material complexity and failures of systems on aerospace vehicles. Digital twins refer to digital replicas of existing and proposed assets to improve management, virtualize testing and maintenance, and maximize efficiency gains. The term was coined by Michael Grieves in 2001. (Michael Grieves and John Vickers, “Digital Twin: Mitigating Unpredictable, Undesirable Emergent Behavior in Complex Systems.” In Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Complex Systems: New Findings and Approaches, eds, Kahlen, F.-J., S. Flumerfelt, and A. Alves. Cham (Switzerland: Springer International Publishing 2017), 87.) As networks of emerging digital twins are drawn together in a national model for the United Kingdom, it is worth exploring the implications of each digital twin and its sensor systems and ICT framework in relation to physical places. (This mode resulted from the UK government’s Industrial Strategy, Infrastructure and Projects Authority, National Infrastructure Commission's Data for the Public Good (2017), and the Digital Framework Task Group (DFTG). The Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) is developing the digital twin information management group along with ICE.) City digital twins are an evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city concepts, where advanced information modeling and networking are leveraged to facilitate complex urban management. The fundamental driver is to unlock built environment data for improved decision-making, operation, and testing of scenarios. Digital twins, as an integral part of a smart city and smart nation digital ecosystem, may have captured the imagination in terms of urban futures, but their relation to the specifics of place warrants critical analysis. There remain many urgent and important questions on the “frictionless futures” the smart city paradigm presents as a seamless entity of large-scale digital infrastructure and physical cities and what it inadvertently excludes (Dunn and Cureton, 2019). Ambitions for city digital twins would ideally need to avoid the ambiguity and intangible nature of the smart city. The absurdity of the pursuit is rendered by Michael Batty: “Thus the question ‘what and where is the smartest city?’ not only has no answer, it is also ill-defined, largely because smartness or intelligence is a process, not an artefact or product.” (Michael, Batty, Inventing Future Cities. Cambridge (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2018), 178.) In practice, as with many technologically driven impulses, city digital twins may never achieve the potential they are conceived to be capable of. City digital twins in their current form are GIS and BIM fusions, providing useful test and semantic models of places released as open data on web and mobile platforms. These city information models (CIMs) are useful for urban designers as they provide a level of digital detail for placemaking, which also function as a platform for consultation. However, while considerable attention has been given to their seemingly unfettered capacity to address complex urban issues, in this chapter, we examine the limits of their capability to frame why the future cities they supposedly shape are always out of reach.}

abstract = {Abstract:
We propose a multi-scale methodology for complex software systems using the model transformation techniques. The methodol- ogy provides a correct by design approach for the description of multi-scale architectures. It is founded on a rule-oriented iterative modeling process ensuring transition from a coarse-grained description to a fine-grained description. The rules manage the re- finement between scales and are applied with respect to the system constraints. Multi-scale architectures are modeled graphically using UML notations. The design process supports model transformation and validation of UML models with the OCL constraints defined on UML models. We illustrate our approach with a case study dedicated to the smart cities.}

False data injection attacks are the most malicious threats in the smart grid paradigm and have been widely applied recently. Last few years, several detection algorithms for identifying the false data injection attack have been developed. Addressing these issues, this paper reports a false data injection attack and threat mathematical model, impacting the on-grid system, economy, and society. The classification of false data injection attack detection algorithms and mathematical models are mainly presented.

This study analyses data collected through the Expression of Interest survey of the European Commission's 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, which contains inputs directly provided by local authorities responsible for implementing climate policies. The results reveal the significant progress cities have made in adapting their governance approaches to effectively address climate challenges through for instance the institutionalisation of climate change, and the introduction of enabling and participative forms of governing with the involvement of key stakeholders in the decision-making processes. It also highlights the challenges cities face concerning climate financing and the need to unlock private investments.}

In this study, we aim to increase understanding of the spatial dimensions of new forms of decentralised energy systems that integrate electricity, storage, transportation, and heating. Drawing on workshops and secondary data from three, early-stage case studies funded under a UK government programme, we examine how stakeholders responsible for development construct the ‘local’ in Smart Local Energy System (SLES) demonstrators. We employ three analytical concepts to address this aim: emplacement, place-framing, and place/boundary-making. In terms of emplacement, stakeholders use place-based narratives that draw on distinctive infrastructural, social, ecological, and political characteristics to argue that diverse locations (Oxford city, Oxfordshire, and the Orkney Islands) are ‘suitable’ places for decentralised energy. Stakeholders frame projects around non-local goals of creating technological and business models for replication across the UK and worldwide, even if some community-centred benefits are recognized. Lastly, our findings on place-making show pragmatism in flexing ‘local’ boundaries in order to align with project objectives. The three analytical concepts provide a useful framework to uncover ‘local’ complexities of early-stage decentralised energy projects, and emphasise intersections of space, place, and justice that deserve further scrutiny, notably in later stages of project implementation.}

Then, as a countermeasure, an online detector based on convolutional neural networks is designed to detect the cyber attacks and mitigate impacts. The vulnerability of power distribution systems with and without the proposed detector is analyzed with reference to a case study concerning the IEEE 34 bus test feeder. The results show that the power distribution systems is vulnerable to the studied cyber attack and the proposed detector can achieve high accuracy and mitigate the impact of cyber attacks with fixed change rates, whereas the attacks with variable change rates are inherently challenging to detect.}

Although whole countries have been implementing new water management schemes such as the Water Sensitive Urban Design in Australia, the 4 Taps in Singapore, and Sponge Cities in China, among others, there has been a lower interest in the side of the industry for changing the plan of action towards a more sustainable water management. Although many companies have adapted their infrastructure into the Sponge Cities model contributing to a better administration of the resource by absorbing water from the rain, promoting a natural filtering by the soil and minimizing water waste, their inner processes still struggle to optimize the use of water. Models such as Zero Liquid Discharge and Zero Water Discharge are an important support, despite the resource, energy and infrastructure requirements. In the last decade these efforts have been targeted towards reaching sustainability and resilience. Nonetheless most of the systems are still highly vulnerable to suffer the effects of a human-detonated or natural-phenomena crisis, that is why the aim of this article is to present the concept of a Smart water crisis-proof industry that may be able to reduce water wasting into zero percent with the idea of a catchment device for providing additional scopes and potential water stock, that if implemented might help prevent and mitigate crisis and become a vehicle for reaching sustainability.}

To address this issue, Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) technologies that incorporate Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can replace or complement caregivers by enabling intelligent learning in smart buildings. This review evaluates the intelligence complements provided by smart buildings enabled with such capabilities to increase the quality of life and autonomy of cognitively declined occupants. Existing contributions primarily focus on learning occupants’ behavior to identify assistive services and solutions, which are delivered through technological interventions or caregivers. However, there are several key research gaps that need to be addressed. The most important is the lack of adequate implementation of technological interventions to fully support the occupants’ autonomy and independence. Other gaps include challenges in usability and acceptability, ethical concerns, systems’ comprehensiveness, and the need for human-in-the-loop. To address these gaps, a conceptual framework is proposed as future research directions for the applications of smart buildings supporting cognitively declined occupants. The framework aims to facilitate the implementation of technological interventions that can enhance occupants’ autonomy and independence, address usability and acceptability challenges, and ensure ethical considerations and system comprehensiveness. This review provides insights into the current state-of-the-art of AAL technologies and highlights research directions for improving the quality of life and autonomy of cognitively declined occupants.}

Conversely, the second harbors skepticism towards technological fixes, emphasizes energy sufficiency and questions energy opulence, linked to environmental justice considerations, and calling for corrective principles by regulatory means. Finally, the paper presents a conceptual framework to re-shape deep deliberative transformation, highlighting the importance of re-connecting to defined values, re-generating actionable knowledge, restructuring institutions in societal experimentation, and recognizing underlying processes such as justice claims.

Smart manufacturing includes the use of demand-side management to store energy in various forms as well as schedule operations so that power is used at optimal times. This work presents a case study of a mineral manufacturing site in the United States comparing different methods of smart manufacturing integrated with renewables. Using historical utility bills and various process models, the study seeks to quantify the savings and costs of various schemes in an overall effort to improve the economics of facility operation. The models compare solar arrays, battery storage, smart pumping schemes, and various combinations of those with process-integrated technology as viable ways to reduce energy costs. The study finds that a solar array by itself is prohibitively expensive for this facility. This is due to relatively high peak demand charges and the fact that the solar array's output does not align well with the facility's real-time power usage. The addition of a battery for load shifting helps the economics significantly, bringing the payback period down from 28.4 to 17.0 years. A key finding of this study, however, is that rather than battery storage, the facility can utilize existing process flexibility, namely pumps with variable frequency drives and built-in water storage capacity, to shift loads. The combination of solar with this novel smart pumping scheme brings the payback period for this investment down to 10.2 years. The smart pumping scheme by itself, however, has a near instant payback (0.13 years), demonstrating that enhanced automation can be used to leverage existing process equipment to operate as a “battery”, but at only a fraction of the cost of an actual battery.}

The present study used a multi-criterion decision (MCDA) support model to conduct an optimal site selection analysis for a smart hydrogen energy plant focusing on solar power plants in the Gangwon region of South Korea. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data were utilized to locate and evaluate potential sites for a solar based SHEP project. The evaluation considered 18 sub-factors, including the presence of green energy sources, the demand for hydrogen, existing infrastructure, environmental effect, and the impact of natural disasters. The suitable areas for solar based SHEP installation were identified using a holistic GIS approach by defining appropriate ranks and weights through MCDA. The results showed that 3.74% (627.67 km2 ) of the study region was very high suitable for constructing solar power plants, particularly in Cheorwon-gun, Chuncheon-si, and Wonju-si regions. The suitability zones determined through the analysis were compared with the global solar plant inventory data, and the results showed good consistency between the two. This suggests that the identified optimal areas can be utilized for the installation of the solar based SHEP. Furthermore, the framework developed in the study can be used to assess the suitable sites for solar energy in other parts of the country.}

Smart Gene is a point-of-care (POC)-type automated molecular testing platform that can be performed with 1 min of hands-on-time. Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 is a newly developed Smart Gene molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical performance of Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 has not been evaluated.
Methods
Nasopharyngeal and anterior nasal samples were prospectively collected from subjects referred to the local PCR center from March 25 to July 5, 2021. Two swabs were simultaneously obtained for the Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 assay and the reference real-time RT-PCR assay, and the results of Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 were compared to the reference real-time RT-PCR assay.
Results
Among a total of 1150 samples, 68 of 791 nasopharyngeal samples and 51 of 359 anterior nasal samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the reference real-time RT-PCR assay. In the testing of nasopharyngeal samples, Smart Gene SARS-CoV-2 showed the total, positive and negative concordance of 99.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.4–99.7%), 94.1% (95% CI: 85.6–98.4%) and 99.7% (95% CI: 99.0–100%), respectively.

abstract = {In Colombia, about 34% of the food available in the country is lost or discarded. Recent studies reveal that one of the main reasons why Colombians discard food is because they do not have enough information about the current state of the product. Developing smart packaging with indicator agents can help to reduce food waste by providing consumers with accurate information about food conditions. Anthocyanins (AA) are ideal pH-sensitive indicator pigments for this application. In addition, new packaging should prioritize the use of biodegradable materials such as polylactic acid (PLA) and natural fibers. These fibers can be obtained from agro-industrial waste, such as those generated in cocoa processing, which reach up to 80% of the total production. This study aimed to evaluate the ultrasound-assisted extraction of anthocyanins from Andean blackberry and its use as a natural indicator in a sustainable smart biofilm developed with cocoa beans shell (CBS) fiber-filled PLA composite material. For the ultrasound-assisted extraction of anthocyanins from blackberries, a 3² factorial experimental design was proposed to assess the effect of biomass: solvent ratio and extraction time on the extraction yield (%) and Monomeric Anthocyanin Content (MAC). The assays were conducted using a power of 110 W and a frequency of 40 kHz. The solvent employed was ethanol (80% v/v) acidified with 0.1% (v/v) hydrochloric acid. The results showed a maximum anthocyanins extraction of 161.66 mg/L, achieved with an extraction time of 15 min and a biomass-solvent ratio of 1:10 g/mL. The successful integration of anthocyanins into the biofilm was demonstrated by FTIR. However, it was found that they affect the thermal, mechanical, and physical properties of the biofilm. In PLA_AA biofilms, the total color difference (ΔE) increased with the pH after pH8, while in PLA_CBS_AA, there were higher ΔE values observed across the tested pH values, with the highest value presented in the intermediate range (pH 7). There was not a clear pattern of color change between pH 4 and pH 6. The potential use of these films in smart packaging applications was proved by significant color changes from pink (pH 2) to brown (pH 12). Overall, this study highlights the potential of utilizing anthocyanins as a natural indicator in sustainable smart packaging.}

Generally, traditional WSN nodes are powered by limited energy capacity, non-rechargeable batteries. The WSN lifetime (days) depends upon, duty cycle, type of application deployment, and battery state of charge (SoC) level. We propose an innovative solution to the limited energy availability design problem by utilizing the ambient solar energy harvesting for battery charging of WSN nodes. However, there are many challenges in solar energy harvesting like intermittency of available power, solar energy prediction, thermal issues, solar panel conversion efficiency, and other environmental issues. The objective of this research work is to maximize the WSN network lifetime using solar energy harvesting technique. From our simulation results, it is proved that the sensor network lifetime is increased from 5.75 days to 115.75 days @ 25% duty cycle and higher, ideally up to infinite network lifetime. Furthermore, the network throughput is also increased from 100 K bits/s to 160 K bits/s. in SEH-WSNs.}

abstract = {Access control is essential for the IoT environment to ensure that only approved and trusted parties are able to configure devices, access sensor information, and command actuators to execute activities. The IoT ecosystem is subject to various access control complications due to the limited latency between IoT devices and the Internet, low energy requirements of IoT devices, the distributed framework, ad-hoc networks, and an exceptionally large number of heterogeneous IoT devices that need to be managed. The motivation for this proposed work is to resolve the incurring challenges of IoT associated with management and access control security. Each IoT domain implementation has particular features and needs separate access control policies to be considered in order to design a secure solution. This research work aims to resolve the intricacy of policies management, forged policies, dissemination, tracking of access control policies, automation, and central management of IoT nodes and provides a trackable and auditable access control policy management system that prevents forged policy dissemination by applying Software Defined Network (SDN) and blockchain technology in an IoT environment. Integration of SDN and blockchain provides a robust solution for IoT environment security. Recently, smart contracts have become one of blockchain technology’s most promising applications. The integration of smart contracts with blockchain technology provides the capability of designing tamper-proof and independently verifiable policies. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable solution for implementing immutable, verifiable, adaptive, and automated access control policies for IoT devices together with a successful proof of concept that demonstrates the scalability of the proposed solution. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of throughput and resource access delay between the blockchain component and the controller as well as from node to node. The number of nodes in the IoT network and the number of resource access requests were independently and systematically increased during the evaluations. The results illustrate that the resource access delay and throughput were affected neither linearly nor exponentially; hence, the proposed solution shows no significant degradation in performance with an increase in the number of nodes and/or requests.}

We showcase a novel method of combining open source and commercial software for creating digital twins of any urban context in a procedural way from raw input data and using Unreal Engine as a visualization front-end. We combine two different workflows, one based on the commercial software suite Feature Manipulation Engine and in parallel we utilize the open source code developed within the Centre, dubbed DTCC Builder. The assets created can be used in urban planning, multi-physics continuum mechanics simulations and for visualization and illustration on a 3D scale. By using, in a complementary way, established commercial software and state of the art open source C++ code we manage to utilize the quality of life features the first provides, while assigning the demanding tasks of comforming mesh generation to the former. The longer term goal is (nearly) real-time mesh digital twinning of any city and user interaction with the 3D assets provided.}

These are continuing to increase in line with urbanisation and climate change, leading to a recognition that the historic paradigm of passive management using centralised infrastructure is insufficient to manage future hazards to our society, environment, and economy. The cross-sector Internet of Things revolution has inspired a new generation of smart stormwater management systems which offer an effective, cost beneficial and adaptive solution to enhance network capacities and reduce hazards. However, despite growing prominence within research, this technology remains under-utilised, in a large part due to fragmented and inconsistent alignment and terminology, obscuring the strategic co-ordination of research. We respond to this through systematically reviewing the terminology, practice and trajectory for smart stormwater management and developing a framework which can be applied to both coordinate and understand the existing research landscape, as well as identifying key research gaps for future development. We find that literature almost universally agrees that smart technology is, or will be, beneficial to stormwater management and that technology has reached partial maturity in terms of quantity management, although this has not yet transferred to water quality. However, research is dominated by proof-of-concept modelling studies, with limited practical application beyond real time control of large assets, individual pilot studies and monitoring. We recommend that future research explores and evidences the substantial benefits likely through expanding current implementation towards a coordinated, decentralised, and optimised catchment-scale approach.}

In particular, the energy efficiency benefits of rule-based and optimized controls to operate smart glazing are evaluated for office spaces. Several rule-based control strategies are considered to operate smart glazed windows including those that switch to specific tint levels using measurable environmental parameters such as outdoor ambient air temperatures as well as direct and total solar radiations. In addition, the analysis evaluates optimal controls that minimize the total energy consumption for the office space with and without daylighting capabilities using hourly, daily, or monthly switching frequencies. The results of various sensitivity analyses indicate that optimized controls perform generally better than rule-based controls even when their threshold settings are adequately selected. However, the performance of rule-based controls can be substantially enhanced when optimal threshold settings are used to switch between various smart glazing tint states. These optimal switching settings depend on various factors including the type of smart glazing used as well as orientation and size of the windows and the location of the office space. Moreover, the analysis indicates that optimized hourly settings provide higher energy savings than any other control strategy with reduction of annual energy consumption of the office spaces reaching up to 20% relative to static glazing.}

abstract = {The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) inherently couples the transportation system with the electricity system through charging stations (CSs). Today's regulatory context highly incentivizes CS infrastructure investments that are expected to have a significant impact on reducing air pollution, cutting emissions and promoting environmentally sustainable cities. The Sizing problem of a CS typically concerns the minimization of the investment cost for charging facilities, subject to the CS being able to fulfill a certain level of charging requests. Several studies have shown the potential of Smart Charging technologies, towards controlling the charging profiles of EVs, so as to achieve a lower operational cost or a lower peak to average power consumption ratio for the CS, by shifting the charging of some EVs. By making more efficient use of charging facilities, Smart Charging can also help reducing the amount of chargers required in order to achieve a certain Quality of Service (QoS) for the CS's clients. In this paper we solve the CS's sizing problem (i.e. decisions on number and types of installed chargers) through an optimization framework that minimizes the investment cost of CS operators, subject to achieving a certain QoS for their clients (EV owners). In particular, we extend the existing CS sizing models by taking into account also the smart charging capabilities during operation. We present a novel formulation for the QoS level of the CS using chance-constraints and propose some relaxations that constitute the problem solvable. Finally, we present a methodology that enhances the scalability of the optimal sizing algorithm. The proposed methodology is able to offer valuable services to CS operators in competitive environments.}

The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts.}

Therefore, based on the sample data of 118 listed companies in China from 2010 to 2019, this study empirically examines the impact of SAPI announcements on shareholder value, as indicated by abnormal returns of stocks. Further, we tested the moderating effect of certain characteristic factors on abnormal stock returns. The research results illustrate a significant positive connection between SAPI announcements and shareholder value. Moreover, considering the announcement content and company factors, this study investigates the impacts of different investment targets and industries on the market reaction to SAPI announcements. We find that non-agricultural companies have a more positive market reaction to SAPI than agricultural companies; the higher the liability-asset ratio, the more positive will be the stock market reaction to SAPI.}

The objectives of this research were to 1) evaluate and compare the performances of the traditional broadcast application and a newly developed precision spraying technology for control of weeds in dormant bermudagrass turf, and 2) investigate the influence of weed coverage on the spray volume requirement when using the precision spraying technology developed here. DenseNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet were evaluated for discriminating the grid cells containing weeds (spray) with the grid cells containing bermudagrass turf exclusively (nonspray). All three neural networks had an F1 score above 0.989 in the validation datasets. ResNet outperformed DenseNet and GoogLeNet with the highest F1 scores (≥0.992) in the testing datasets. Applying herbicide only to turf areas infested with weeds saved a significant amount of the herbicide, while achieving the same level of weed control compared to the broadcast application. The developed precision spraying technology performed well and effectively reduced the amount of herbicide input applied to the dormant bermudagrass turf, compared to the broadcast herbicide application. Overall, the smart sprayer prototype developed in this research can be used for precision weed control in dormant turf, although its design needs to be further optimized.}

abstract = {With the advancement of technology and Internet penetration in all aspects of life in today's modern world, smart vehicles, particularly connected vehicles, are rising. As a result, as smart vehicles have evolved and grown in popularity, so have the cyber threats that threaten them. Vehicles may communicate with other vehicles, road infrastructure, and other smart devices; as a result, the security of related equipment must be ensured. Researchers presented many articles investigating smart vehicle intrusion, anomaly, and attack detection methods. In most of these, researchers only examined the proposed detection methods on in-vehicle networks (IVNs) and external networks for smart ground vehicles. However, reviewing and analyzing the detection methods provided in all communications and connections related to smart ground/air vehicles is necessary. This paper examines the detection methods for in-vehicle networks, inter-vehicle networks, ground vehicle power stations, and the Internet of Drones (IoD). Besides, it analyzes recently published studies in the four categories: intrusion detection systems (IDSs), anomaly detection, attack detection, and hybrid detection methods in smart vehicles. The methods examined in this survey were published in 2018–2022 in reputable journals such as Elsevier, IEEE, Springer, ScienceDirect, etc. We examine datasets, simulations/implementations, and key evaluation criteria for each detection method studied. Also, we compare these methods using appropriate tables and diagrams and analyze the problems in detecting intrusions, anomalies, and attacks in smart vehicles. Finally, we address the research questions and discuss future research challenges.}

abstract = {Climate smart agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices are important for achieving soil moisture conservation, erosion reduction, soil fertility enhancement, increasing and stabilizing crop yield and livelihoods, enhancing ecosystem services, achieving food security, tackling climate change problems, and improving the climate change resilience of farming ecosystems. Awareness (and subsequent adoption) of these technologies by farmers depends heavily upon a number of factors related to the farmer and the farming environment. There are very few studies that investigate how such factors influence awareness levels of CSA technologies in urban farming households, as most completed studies are on determinants of adoption of the technologies, especially by rural farmers. Yet urban agriculture is an important economic activity in many cities, especially in developing countries. This paper evaluates the factors that influence levels of awareness of CSA technologies among urban farmers in Kuje town (Nigeria), using data collected from 491 farming households. The results showed that the farmers that are more educated; older; having larger family sizes, income sources and economic assets; with greater climate change experience and local knowledge; and having farmlands with better physical conditions have more awareness of CSA adaptation strategies. Eleven other factors (namely marital status, tribal inclination, gender, religion, extension service, capacity building, security of tenure, institutional support, farmer organisational affiliation, distance to farmlands, and availability of loans and incentives) have no significant influence on the farmers’ awareness levels of CSA adaptation strategies in the study area. Some ideas were given on how to improve these explanatory factors to help more awareness in the area learn about the CSA.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the threat of password leakage from sensors on mobile phones and smart wearables. We investigate attack methods for recovering a short random number entered on PEDs using a combination of data collected by from microphone, accelerometer and gyroscope in devices on the person entering the number. We take into consideration features based on keypress sounds, from either phone and/or smart watch, in addition to hand movement acceleration and angular velocity captured by the smart watch. We used the fusion features from these three sensor sources to train a Neural Network to recover key entries on a keypad. Our method based on linear acceleration and angular velocity, with acoustic data used to segment individual keystrokes, showed an improved 74% probability to predict a single keystroke in one guess and 52% for a 6-digit PIN in three guesses.}

abstract = {The operation of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is essential for the indoor thermal environment and is significant for energy consumers in commercial properties. Although earlier studies suggested that reinforcement learning controls could increase HVAC energy savings, they lacked sufficient details regarding end-to-end management. Recently, the focus on gathering and analyzing data from smart meters and buildings connected to energy-saving studies has increased. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) suggests novel methods for operating HVAC systems and lowering energy usage. This paper evaluates energy consumption by Convolution Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning is used. This is intended to forecast energy use under various climatic circumstances, and the processes are assessed under different communication protocols. The suggested control technique might directly accept quantitative elements, such as climate and indoor air quality conditions, as input and control indoor thermal set - points at a supervisory level by utilizing the deep neural network. In a highly effective office area in the Houston area, time series data, CRNN, and DRL are effectively used to uncover new energy-saving options (TX, USA). The article presents 1-year information from the Net Zero, Energy Star, and Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED)-certified building, demonstrating a potential energy savings of 8% with the presented design. The findings demonstrate how useful the suggested strategy is in assisting building owners in locating new potential for energy conservation.}
