abstract = {Smart high-performance cementitious composite (SHPCC) with sensing abilities, high mechanical, and high durability is a potential smart material instead of current sensors applied for structural health monitoring systems of infrastructures. This study deeply investigated the sensing properties of SHPCCs containing multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), steel fibers, and steel slag aggregates (SSAs) under compression. SHPCCs containing different contents of MWCNTs (0.1% and 0.5% of cement weight), steel fibers (2 and 4 vol%), SSAs (10% and 50% instead of sand), and free water (fully dried and moisture specimens) were prepared and evaluated. The results indicated that the SSA content was a key factor controlling the electrically conductive network response and the stress-sensing ability of SHPCCs. MWCNTs significantly enhanced the stress-sensing ability of fully dried SHPCCs under compression. Besides, the free water content in pore systems significantly influenced the stress-sensing ability of SHPCCs. A conductive network of SHPCCs with MWCNTs, fibers, SSAs, and free water at micro and nano levels was proposed and analyzed to explain the electrical resistivity response under compression.}

abstract = {To reduce the energy consumption of buildings and limit their impact on the environment, greater attention has been paid, in recent years, to adaptive building envelopes technologies. Combining the dual function of sensors and actuators, smart materials are configured as excellent allies of adaptive technologies. Their responsiveness facilitates the dynamic interaction between the building and the environment through the building envelope configured as a living interface, similar to the skin of natural organisms. This study aims to explore the current trends and potential applications of smart materials to define biomimetic solutions for environmentally adaptive building envelopes. Starting from specifying the fine distinction between adaptive and responsive solutions, the PRISMA method is used to conduct a systematic literature review, together with a bibliometric analysis, to identify the main common occurrences of the keywords, the predominant geographical areas and the main sources. Only materials that respond to the environmental triggers of light, temperature and water were considered to create a design matrix that enriches the implementation phase of the biomimetic-Adaptive Model and provides researchers with a new useful tool for the biomimetic design phases. The study shows how smart materials can be used to realise the responsive functions of the biomimetic envelope, capable of regulating temperature, shielding solar radiation, filtering or reacting to variable environmental parameters. The application of smart materials in architecture is still limited, paving the way for future research discoveries and synergistic collaboration between architectural technologies, biology, and material sciences, and leading to a more sustainable built environment.}

Information about residential houses is useful for promoting community well-being, protecting the environment, and fostering economic growth. By digging into the residential houses, we can accurately identify sudden spikes in energy consumption. Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) play a critical role in reducing wasteful energy consumption by providing precise information about a home's energy efficiency. Unfortunately, inadequate EPC evaluations and suggestions contribute to the growing demand for energy. This research presents the creation of a smart web-based visual analytics platform that utilises data from cross-sectoral data to examine the effect of various variables on current house energy performance certificates (EPCs). In addition, our study illustrates a technique for mapping stakeholder assessments before offering substantial recommendations for refurbishments. To determine which smart home criteria are most important, we apply the Criterion Importance Through Intercriterion Correlation (CRITIC) method and weight the criteria based on their correlations. Finally, we sort smart house by their Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings using the COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) technique.}

With ubiquitous Internet, connected sensors and actuators, networking and communication technology along with artificial intelligence (AI), smart cyber-physical systems (CPS) provide services rendering assistance and convenience to humans in their daily lives. However, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as coronavirus) pandemic has exposed and highlighted the limitations of contemporary technological deployments especially to contain the widespread of this disease. IoT and smart connected technologies together with data-driven applications can play a crucial role not only in the prevention, mitigation, or continuous remote monitoring of patients, but also enable prompt enforcement of guidelines, rules, and administrative orders to contain such future outbreaks. In this paper, we envision an IoT and data-supported connected ecosystem designed for intelligent monitoring, pro-active prevention and control, and mitigation of COVID-19 and similar epidemics. We propose a gamut of synergistic applications and technology systems for various smart infrastructures including E-Health, smart home, supply chain management, transportation, and city, which will work in convergence to develop ‘pandemic-proof’ future smart communities. We also present a generalized cloud-enabled IoT implementation framework along with scientific solutions, which can be adapted and extended to deploy smart connected ecosystem scenarios using widely used Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructures. In addition, we also implement an E-Health RPM use case scenario to demonstrate the need and practicality for smart connected communities. Finally, we highlight challenges and research directions that need thoughtful consideration and across the board cooperation among stakeholders to build resilient communities against future pandemics.}

As city planning requires innovative ways of dealing with the rapid urbanization trend, technological solutions were proposed such as cloud computing, smart vehicles, and Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET). In this paper, we take advantage of next-generation network technologies to propose a responsive and lightweight framework for smart transportation system which employs blockchain for authentication using fog computing’s improvement over cloud computing for distributed applications to provide an efficient and secure transportation system. We take into account the future technologies of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) and argue that the integration of B5G technologies, federated learning, blockchain, and edge computing provides the perfect platform necessary for a smart transportation system The evaluation of the proposed framework is done by comparing it to the current cloud-based approach in iFogSim, a popular simulation tool for fog computing research. The evaluation of blockchain-based authentication was done using a customized implementation of blockchain executed in an experimental setup. The simulation results showed that the proposed framework provides superior performance in terms of security, latency, and energy consumption of the system.}

abstract = {Due to the pervasive diffusion of personal mobile and IoT devices, many “smart environments” (e.g., smart cities and smart factories) will be, among others, generators of huge amounts of data. To provide value-add services in these environments, data will have to be analysed to extract knowledge. Currently, this is typically achieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However, according to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from the standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One possibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to where data is generated. In this paper we tackle this issue by proposing and analysing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are performed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where data is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are performed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by (e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of other nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them accordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics services. In the specific case analysed in the paper we focus on a learning task, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity recognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we compare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud solution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show that using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to drastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance comparable to the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The analysis also shows when each distributed learning approach is preferable, based on the specific distribution of the data on the nodes.}

Smart scales, smart watches, and smart rings with bioimpedance technology may create interference in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).
Objectives
The purpose of this study was to determine interference at CIEDs with simulations and benchtop testing, and to compare the results with maximum values defined in the ISO 14117 electromagnetic interference standard for these devices.
Methods
The interference at pacing electrodes was determined by simulations on a male and a female computable model. A benchtop evaluation of representative CIEDs from 3 different manufacturers as specified in the ISO 14117 standard also was performed.
Results
Simulations showed evidence of interference with voltage values exceeding threshold values defined in the ISO 14117 standard. The level of interference varied with the frequency and amplitude of the bioimpedance signal, and between male and female models. The level of interference generated with smart scale and smart rings simulations was lower than with smart watches. Across device manufacturers, generators demonstrated susceptibility to oversensing and pacing inhibition at different signal amplitudes and frequencies.
Conclusions
This study evaluated the safety of smart scales, smart watches, and smart rings with bioimpedance technology via simulation and testing. Our results indicate that these consumer electronic devices could interfere in patients with CIEDs. The present findings do not recommend the use of these devices in this population due to potential interference.}

This paper analyzes the “visions” put forward in Germany from smart home industry actors, users in smart homes and policymakers and the processes through which legitimacy for the smart home is created. When it comes to digital energy futures, the multiple ways in which visions legitimize the uptake of emerging technologies belong to the driving forces in institutionally stabilizing sociotechnical imaginaries. We identify legitimation strategies that can be found within those visions. Our analyzes are empirically based on a qualitative content analysis of smart home marketing websites from the ten most common smart home providers in Germany and on policy documents from German ministries, as well as on qualitative interviews with German smart home users. We discovered four different legitimation strategies that contribute to institutionally stabilizing emerging German smart home imaginaries: cognitive/emotional alignment, solutionism, coupling with normative goals and expert/scientific legitimation. Our findings reveal how visions that, in their formation phase, are shared only between small actor collectives gain traction through several legitimation strategies.}

This work is for a smart global village by applying real-time embedded monitoring system (such as traffic purpose) using visual sensor networks. In general, images are obtained from a number of visual sensor nodes and cameras. The visual sensor node conveys them to the computer devices for processing. To this end, a process called image super-resolution is needed. In this work, a filter design method is researched by using a regression approach. There are two main stages of this work. First, we study filter designing method training dataset. Second, we implement super-resolution process by applying pre-designed filters. Experimental results are given to show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the conventional methods.

The proposed method uses a probabilistic method for uncertainty quantization to make sure that the maximum modeling of the prediction interval would be achieved in a renewable based environment. In this regard, the innovative lower upper bound estimation method (LUBE) is trained using the real-time data of the smart grid gathered by the digital twin of the system. This would result in much higher results due to the avoidance of malfunction of the smart metering devices located within the smart grid. Digital twin can help predict the load demand in solar based smart grids by using machine learning algorithms to analyze the data from the smart grid. This data can be used to create a model of the system and predict how the load demand will change based on different factors such as weather, time of day, and season. By understanding the load demand, solar based smart grids can better manage their energy resources and optimize the performance of the system. In order to improve the model performance, white shark optimization algorithm (WSOA) is used as the trainer of the prediction model in a heuristic environment. The results advocate the high accuracy and reliability of the proposed method on practical dataset,}

PRISMA methodology is used to systematically review 63 studies published between January 2011 and October 2021; and a review of known cases is undertaken to illustrate the literature review findings with real-world scenarios. Published literature identifies that smart homes may pose threats to confidentiality (unwanted release of information), authentication (sensing information being falsified) and unauthorised access to system controls. Most existing studies focus on privacy intrusions as a prevalent form of harm against smart homes. Other types of harms that are less common in the literature include hacking, malware and DoS attacks. Digital harms, and data associated with these harms, may vary extensively across smart devices. Most studies propose technical measures to mitigate digital harms, while fewer consider social prevention mechanisms. We also identify salient gaps in research, and argue that these should be addressed in future crossdisciplinary research initiatives.}

To address the question of whether urban shrinkage has an impact on the level of local basic public services supply, this paper uses panel data from 298 prefecture-level cities in China from 2010 to 2018 to empirically analyse the impact of urban shrinkage on the level of basic public services supply by dividing shrinking cities into different regions and dividing basic public services into different dimensions. The results show that the impact of urban shrinkage on the supply level of basic public services is an ‘inverted U-shaped’ non-linear process that first promotes and then inhibits the level of basic public services supply; the impact of urban shrinkage on various dimensions of the level of basic public services supply varies, and generally shows a positive and then negative trend. Regarding regional heterogeneity, urban shrinkage has a more significant negative impact on the central region's basic public services supply level, followed by the western region and, to a lesser extent, the northeastern region. Therefore, local governments should make Smart Shrinkage according to local conditions, improve the basic public services supply system to enhance residents' happiness and satisfaction, introduce corresponding policies for the introduction of talents and focus on employee training and education activities to achieve the goal of equalising of basic public services supply in China. This research could also provide identification methods and improvement measures for other countries and regions just beginning to face the shrinking problem, especially those with high population densities and tight urban connectivity, such as China's cities.}

Employing a two-stage Quality Function Deployment (QFD) framework with the interval-valued 2-Tuple linguistic (IV-2-TL) model, the methodology offers a nuanced analysis of relationships between sustainability-digitalization and SA. Validation through a Turkey-based case study demonstrates the methodology's effectiveness in identifying digital solutions for sustainability needs and prioritizing SA design requirements. This study contributes significantly in three key ways. Firstly, the IV-2-TL-QFD method provides a valuable decision-making framework to assess digitalization-sustainability-SA interconnections ensuring optimal SA design. Secondly, it identifies vital digitalization requirements for addressing sustainability challenges in the QFD framework. Third, a 10-step roadmap guides the transition to SA, portraying digitalization as instrumental in achieving broader sustainability. This study provides profound insights and tools, bridging the gap between digitalization and sustainable agriculture for a more resilient and environmentally responsible future in food production.}

In this study, we analyse the Expressions of Interest in the Mission on 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030, an unprecedented dataset of city inputs to 374 different questions on the transition to (net) zero. We i) delineate emissions baselines, accounting methodologies, and inventories’ completeness (sectors/sources, carriers, gases), ii) analyse emission trends and cities’ capacity to deliver on their climate mitigation commitments, iii) examine the estimated magnitude and origin of residual emissions by 2030 together with the envisioned offsetting strategies, and iv) elucidate gaps, methodological deficiencies, and forms of assistance. Data suggest that if all 362 eligible cities were to reach climate neutrality, approximately 650 MtCO2eq would be removed. However, this would require at least a quadruple effort in half the time compared to current mitigation achievements. Beyond the challenge of emissions baselining, cities lack adequate data collection and monitoring systems and show little familiarity with non-technological and technological avenues to tackle harder-to-eradicate emissions. Capacity building will be key across multiple (e.g., technical, financial, operational) domains to turn ambitious mayoral commitments into factual contributions to climate mitigation.}

The study analysed the structures and materials used for construction of bus terminals from various Indian states and compared with various global standards focused on creating standards for usage of materials for construction with architectural aspects, structural response and able to fulfill the needs of the stakeholders. The study covers major bus stations in India and other countries like UK, Turkey, Malaysia and USA. Following a review of the situation as it stands, subsequent research takes into account various bus terminal designs from around the world. The examination includes a comprehensive review of urban, architectural, and structural approaches, as well as current global trends in terminal design. The link between structural design and architectural expression is the focus of the analysis. The intention is to demonstrate how the operation ability of bus terminals is dependent on functional characteristics that are influenced by architectural expression and structural systems, including their influence on the creation of memorable and observable landmarks. Few materials were suggested in the study for bus terminus constructions such as shape memory alloys, piezoelectric materials, smart concrete for large structures like terminal buildings and single/double decked bus parking, etc. It helps the architects and transit planners to design the bus terminus as per global standards design in India.}

Governments seek to employ disruptive technologies to substantially transform government-citizen relationships, enhance citizens’ experiences, transform public decision making, emphasize citizen engagement in the democratic decision-making process, provide more agile and resilient government structures, create substantial public value and generally improve quality of life. Despite its numerous potential advantages, smart government is still in its early phases of development. Examining issues related to the usage behavior of smart government services has received little attention. Outcomes of the usage of online technologies in general, and electronic public services in particular, have been largely overlooked. Accordingly, this study aims at developing and empirically validating an integrated model of smart government usage by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) through the incorporation of a set of determinants and outcomes of smart government usage following an extensive review of extant literature. The data were obtained from 414 smart government clients in the United Arab Emirates through an online questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of this study indicated that, among all significant antecedents of smart government usage, performance expectancy has the strongest impact, whilst facilitating conditions has the weakest influence. It has been also reported that personalization has no significant effect on smart government usage. The results further revealed that the strongest impact of smart government usage is on information transparency. Implications for theory and practice are also offered.}

The innovative smart windows with photovoltaic electrochromic (PV-EC) modules are designed, and consisted with photovoltaic areas, EC areas and transparent areas. Because the position of different modules can be adjusted freely, the system can select the most suitable combination mode for different building applied conditions. The PV-EC modular smart window test rig was established to learn the influence of different combinations of the windows on lighting condition. The combination(d) has the largest useful daylighting illumination among them, and which reaches 75.26%. PV area is installed at the lower layer, EC area is installed at the middle layer, and transparent area is installed at the upper layer in combination (d). Compared with ordinary windows, the window system can save up to 15.79% energy. And for different floors, radiation areas and space types, the system can select the corresponding combinations to adjust the lighting environment. It shows that the window system could improve the lighting environment and energy saving of the building, and effectively copes with different building condition.}

A smart city operates using large numbers of networked sensors to collect, store, and analyze massive amounts of data in near-real time; these data may also have secondary applications. This study proposes one such use of the data gathered by home energy management systems (HEMS). Current HEMS focus mainly on energy efficiency, but residents typically value indoor comfort as well. HEMS collect various types of data that can be used to create an index for short-term indoor comfort called the predicted mean vote (PMV). This study implements a system to identify information within the stored data that is relevant to reducing electricity consumption while maintaining indoor comfort according to each resident’s PMV preference. The system was tested in three households in Japan for 12 days in winter. The system reduced electricity consumption by 5.15% and increased the comfort satisfaction expressed as PMV by 42.3%. Qualitative assessments of indoor comfort increased by 16.4%. Providing users with information selected according to their PMV preferences was more effective in reducing electricity consumption and increasing indoor comfort than providing them with random information.}

We investigate optimizing patient data processing performance in smart healthcare centers. The upgraded particle swarm optimization-long short-term memory (PSO-LSTM) algorithm is introduced to optimize the IoT-based SHS model. In order to perform a more suitable classification of the patient medical data, PSO is determined to be compared with PSO-LSTM to tune several metrics and benchmarks to achieve the highest value on patient data process performance. The proposed outcomes discovered that in terms of the test sets, the predicted values of patient health risks, and just six of them are varied, with an accuracy of 92.5%.

The interdependencies between these contributing factors illustrates the multi-attribute nature of SLES. This article highlights how insightful models can be in upscaling SLESs. The models considered were categorized according to their modes of application, and instances where they have been used for modelling a multi-energy system upscale. Multi-criteria analysis was used to rank these models according to their ability to represent SLES. Four major aspects of upscaling (growth, replication, accumulation, and transformation) were used to weight the criteria using the entropy method and CRITIC method, respectively. The TOPSIS method was used to rank the models and the result indicated that among 21 models considered, the hybrid combination of an optimization model, a weighting model, and a multi-criteria decision model was the closest to the ideal solution.}

While such approaches have either been resisted or condemned by affected households, state and city authorities have defended them as the most appropriate remedies. Have flood events been properly understood? Are flood management approaches aimed at addressing the problem? What are the actual effects of current flood management practices? In responding to these questions, this study seeks to: (i) examine the contours and politics of managing flood vulnerability in the city (ii) understand the factors that have shaped city government's responses to flood events; and (iii) explore the challenges within the current institutional and legal arrangements for flood management. Using Agbogbloshie and Old Fadama – the largest slum communities in Accra - as cases, the study adopts mixed qualitative methods including: interviews of flood victims, focus group discussions, institutional consultations and review of government documents in gathering relevant empirical data. The study reveals that flood management approaches have been shaped by a complex network of actors with entrenched interests. Two levels of smart flood risk and vulnerability management have been proposed.}

abstract = {In recent years, permanent outages and lack of access to electricity have been significant problems in most cities of Iran. The increasing growth of fossil fuel consumption made it necessary to change the design of buildings. Designing a net-zero energy building (with natural ventilation and renewable energy systems) is a solution for reducing fossil fuels. In this paper, dynamic energy modeling of the building for the smart operation of the trapezoidal Trombe wall and underground air ducts is performed. In the first step, the Trombe Zones are considered for heating. Then the combination of the Trombe zones with underground air ducts for cooling is simulated. Then the system combination with a solar hot water system to supply hot water energy is evaluated. Finally, the economic analysis of the optimal hybrid system (with a photovoltaic system, wind turbine, battery, and inverter) for supplying the electricity of the building equipped with both passive energy strategies was evaluated by Homer software. The results show that by integrating the Trombe wall, the heating load is reduced by 44 %, and by integrating a coupled geothermal cooling system with the air duct and the Trombe wall, the cooling load is reduced by 39%. Also, the net present cost over the 25-year life of the optimized renewable system is reduced by about 12.5% due to both passive strategies. The average daily electricity energy demand of the base building is equal to 86.37 kWh and for the passive building, it is equal to 67.49 kWh.}

This study adopted thematic analysis, with data collected using in-person interviews. The participants for the study were selected using the snow-balling technique. We explored the process of developing smart technologies during the pandemic and its impact on smart rural tourism technology development upon travel restart. The subject was investigated by focusing on five selected villages in central Iran which have tourism dependent economies. Overall, the results indicated that the pandemic partially changed the government's resistance towards the fast development of smart technologies. Thus, the role of smart technologies in curbing the virus spread was officially recognized. This change of policy led to the implementation of Capacity Building (CB) programs to improve digital literacy and minimize the digital gap that exists between urban and rural areas in Iran. Implementing CB programs during the pandemic directly and indirectly contributed to the digitalization of rural tourism. Implementing such programs enhanced tourism stakeholders' individual and institutional capacity to gain access to and creatively use STT in rural area. The results of this study improve our understanding and knowledge of the impact of crises on the degree of acceptability and use of STT in traditional rural societies.}

The effectiveness of the dynamic modulation of glazing properties to improve energy efficiency and users’ comfort was tested comparing the EC windows with a typical law-compliant static commercial glazing system and with a clear windows. To better understand the performances of the proposed EC film, six different locations – ranging from Seville to Helsinki – were selected throughout the European continent to conduct energy and daylighting analyses on three different exposures (east, south, west). The results obtained show reductions of summer cooling and winter heating as well in all the locations considered. Eventually, the effect of electrochromic switching of transmittance on the indoor visual comfort, is considered using a well-established metric: Useful Daylight Illuminance; with regards to daylight analyses, a significant reduction of hours in which excessive illuminance occurs was observed in all the locations considered, confirming that properly controlled EC devices improve both energy efficiency and visual comfort.}

Findings demonstrate that both traditional and “smart” factors impact the final evaluation of e-book suppliers. In addition, the influence of smart service factors on the efficacy of library innovation can be evaluated by the linear regression method.

abstract = {In smart farming, information and communication technologies such as IoT are driving the agricultural industry towards improved efficiency and productivity while reducing human intervention. As agricultural systems become increasingly connected to the Internet, they provide many new opportunities but also introduce new challenges. Connecting such systems to a network exposes them to cyberattacks and vulnerabilities; therefore, security and privacy are important challenges that should be addressed. Specifically, because of the distinct characteristics of smart farming such as environmental and farm conditions, security solutions suitable for smart farming are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a location verification (LV) protocol as a security solution for autonomous and intelligent moving devices such as drones and robots deployed in smart farming. Moreover, as an application of the proposed LV protocol, we propose a blockchain-based secure drone rental mechanism for smart farming. We present a security analysis in which the proposed LV protocol and rental mechanism are secure against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, modification, replay, and relay attacks, with the rental mechanism providing mutual authentication. Through a performance evaluation of the LV protocol in terms of the communication overhead, computation cost, and storage cost and a performance evaluation of the blockchain for drone rental with regard to throughput and latency, we confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the LV protocol and drone rental mechanism in the smart farming.}

We mostly focused on the following issues of the state of the art solutions: scalability, interoperability to address the heterogeneity of IoT devices, low energy consumption, and timely prediction of the availability of the parking spots. To this we leverage the Social IoT (SIoT) Lysis environment to create virtual entities of the real world objects involved in the SP system for on-street parking areas. The usage of the social virtual entities allows for addressing the interoperability issues among different types of IoT devices used by separate solutions deployed in adjacent areas. Magnetometer sensors are used to automatically detect the presence of a vehicle in each parking spot and the sensors data are collected through concentrators that cover the whole parking areas through low-energy Wi-Fi. Additionally, a control dashboard has been designed and developed to manage the monitored parking areas and provide responsive data analytics regarding the occupancy of parking areas in the city, which can be accessed through an Android App. Finally, a smart payment service allows the users to automatically pay for the used services making use of Bluetooth beacons. Experiments have been performed with the developed test-bed to show the performance of the system to timely detect the presence of a vehicle and identify the owner ID to trigger the payment procedure.}

It will trigger a multi-fold increase in cooling demand, especially at a residential level, mitigation to which remains a policy and research gap. This study forwards a novel residential energy stress mitigation framework called REST to estimate warming climate-induced energy stress in residential buildings using a GIS-driven urban heat island and energy modelling approach. REST further estimates rooftop solar potential to enable solar photo-voltaic (PV) based decentralised energy solutions and establish an optimised routine for peer-to-peer energy sharing at a neighbourhood scale. The optimised network is classified through a decision tree algorithm to derive sustainability rules for mitigating energy stress at an urban planning scale. These sustainability rules established distributive energy justice variables in urban planning context. The REST framework is applied as a proof-of-concept on a future smart city of India, named Amaravati. Results show that cooling energy stress can be reduced by 80 % in the study area through sensitive use of planning variables like Floor Space Index (FSI) and built-up density. It has crucial policy implications towards the design and implementation of a national level cooling action plans in the future cities of the Global South to meet the UN-SDG – 7 (clean and affordable energy) and SDG – 11 (sustainable cities and communities) targets.}

However, it also brings many new risks that CI owners and operators must be prepared for to facilitate effective risk mitigation and response. These risks, however, have not been systematically assessed for CI systems. This paper investigates how the cyber-physical risk landscape will be impacted by 5 G for four major CI sectors in detail: smart transportation, smart water, smart power, and smart oil and gas networks. Compared to prior work only examining a single CI network, the authors present a comprehensive assessment of the types of threats that these sectors can expect based on past incidents, the new vulnerabilities introduced by 5 G and existing vulnerabilities exacerbated by the introduction of more connected devices, along with mitigation recommendations for each risk. Risks associated with the rollout of and transition to 5 G, risks from 5 G network disruptions, cyberattack risks, and privacy risks are included. While each of the sectors has a unique risk profile, general themes also emerged across multiple CI networks. Notably, there will be an increased number of threat vectors from smart devices reliant on the telecommunications network to provide monitoring and control of infrastructure services. Because many of these devices are accessible by the public, the risk of social engineering attacks and vulnerability to physical hacking are exacerbated. Successful risk mitigation requires collaboration among CI's many stakeholders to implement security measures at the interfaces between connected devices to limit the access to assets in case one security measure is successfully bypassed. Due to the increased interdependencies between CI networks, operators must create backup plans to keep the most essential services running on a smaller bandwidth in case of a 5 G outage or similar failure. As 5 G capabilities continue to develop and the risk landscape evolves, ongoing research is needed and CI owners and operators should be prepared to update security measures to remain ahead of identified risks and threats.}

With smart meters, machine learning models can anticipate equipment behavior by monitoring and recording residential power use. Multi-Energy Management Systems, which allow smart grid flexibility, have garnered interest. Smart meters and smart energy gadgets in homes require autonomous multi-energy management systems. These systems should efficiently utilize real-time data to plan device consumption, reducing costs for end users. The model incorporates two Long Short-Term Memory networks, capturing short-term and long-term dependencies in energy consumption patterns. This enables the Multi-Energy Management Systems to make accurate predictions and manage energy resources in real-time. The primary objectives are to minimize reliance on the grid and maximize the utilization of renewable energy sources. The proposed Deep Dual- Long Short-Term Memory model achieves impressive accuracy rates, with scores ranging from 97% to 99% for recall, F1-score, and precision. Numerical findings demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches, showcasing its ability to lower energy consumption and meet operational constraints. The results indicate that the proposed strategy optimizes energy use, providing cost savings and satisfying user requirements.}

Based on the findings, the study proposes a conceptual framework and a series of principles of urban resilience to pandemics, consisting of four spatial levels: housing, neighborhoods, city, and the regional and national scales, and three dimensions of pandemic resilience: pandemic-related health requirements, environmental psychological principles, and general resilience principles. The findings show that resilient cities should be able to implement the pandemic-related health requirements, the psychological principles of the environment to reduce the stresses caused by the pandemic, and the general principles of resilience in the smart city context. This framework provides scholars and policymakers with a comprehensive understanding of resilience on different scales and assists them in making better-informed decisions.}

This dynamic feature, with multiple transparency states, is suitable for building in hot and arid climates. It can effectively reject unwanted solar energy, allowing visible light while contributing to building energy efficiency by reducing the carbon footprint. In this work, the PDLC glazing system was included with a low-e coated glass and this coupled system was investigated with two control approaches for residential buildings in hot arid climates. The first control is a standard On-Off operation based on the tenant preferences, while the second is able to set glazing transparencies according to the solar radiation intensity, in order to minimize the penetration of direct solar radiation and to provide daylighting and indoor privacy protection. The system is reversed to examine the proper positions and layer order in the glazing system. The proposed system demonstrates remarkable enhancements in indoor thermal performance, surpassing clear glass by 21 % in the south orientation and 25.5 % in the west orientation. Furthermore, when the PDLC is oriented towards the outdoor environment, the system achieves an impressive 53.9 % improvement in heat gain control compared to clear glass. Additionally, the system not only enables dynamic control over direct solar radiation but also offers efficient daylighting and indoor privacy protection.}

Smart-SUR has geographical, procedural and teleological aspects. Its mechanism involves local engagement, institutional strengthening, tight project screening and innovative regenerative funding.

With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, the way of green travel has gradually become the way of travel advocated by people who living in the metropolis. Convenience and environmental protection are a major advantage of public transport, but unfortunately, the functions, services and environment of many bus stops are not convenient and friendly; Therefore, the smart bus stop was born, it can not only provide real-time bus information, but also provide a safe and comfortable waiting space. However, with the upgrading of service functions, the problem of energy consumption has become increasingly prominent. Powering through solar panels can naturally provide a sustainable energy source for smart bus stops, but many studies have found that solar panels themselves are not environmentally friendly, regardless of their materials and recyclability. The author’s investigation found that relevant studies have confirmed that spraying an aqueous solution containing carbon nanotubes or graphene on mulberry leaves for feeding silkworms doubles the toughness of the silk spit, and the conductivity of carbonized silk is 10 times higher. In addition, the robotic fiber spinning technology will allow silkworms to independently complete the production of silk objects without killing the silkworms. Through the research on graphene silk materials and robotic fiber spinning technology, this paper proposes a biologically autonomous solution to the production of graphene silk thin-film solar panels, so as to seek to solve the pollution problem of solar panels in the smart stop.}

It also necessitates the expansion of power grid infrastructure. Furthermore, the problem is critical in remote places and resource-limited environments. One alternative solution for this evaluative problem is to incorporate EV smart charging. Smart charging circumscribes load fluctuations on the grid while charging EVs and paves the way for renewable energy use in recharging EVs. The current study presents a systematic approach to identify and suggest the most effective charging policies for building a smart EV charging station. The study employed a three-step process. First, a critical analysis of smart charging policies from the literature is performed and corresponding control parameters are identified. Secondly, the identified parameters are classified into categories of direct influence, indirect influence, and enhancement parameters. The final step recommends a set of parameters for a smart EV charging station controller, covering the basic design level, real-time operational level, and enhancement level. While numerous studies have explored various EV charging policies, control parameters, and optimization techniques, there is still a lack of procedural approaches for identifying the optimal control parameters specific to a given charging policy. This study aims to address this gap by taking a focused approach that centers on the adoption of a particular charging policy for the development of a smart charging station.}

This will be particularly disastrous if the grid is unprepared for the climate-induced shifts in electricity demand that will result from increased temperatures. Recently, the use of data-driven modeling has emerged as a way to predict these climate-induced changes in electricity demand, however, much of the work has focused on entire sectors or regions. Here, we focus on the impact of climatic variables on hourly household electricity use for air conditioning. Our goal was to determine the best model for predicting the air conditioning use based on climate variables, as well as use that model to extract insights related to the household-level climate-electricity nexus. Using smart meter data from three US cities (Austin, Texas, Ithaca, New York, and San Diego, California), we tested seven different models of varying complexity. Ultimately, Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) was selected as the best model across all three cities (NRMSE ranged between 0.085 and 0.250). Additionally, we found that while the majority of the climate variables were important, relative humidity was the most important variable in each city. Given that air conditioning tends to drive non-base electricity demand in the summer, understanding these nuances in the climate-electricity nexus as it applies to air conditioning is critical for building a resilient grid.}

Smart transportation is an integral part of modern-day smart city projects. However, the world climate institution has reported that carbon emissions from the overall transportation system accounts for one-fifth of global carbon dioxide with a sum of around 24% of energy. Electric vehicles (EV) represent a solution for this issue, yet, it is not sustainable. The communication between EVs and a roadside unit (RSU), and the continuous computational power required to support an IoV system also requires a reliance on energy harvesting. With this in mind, in this paper, we propose a decentralized trust management solution for IoV systems to reduce both carbon footprint and offload the computation power required. Our solution resides in developing the digital twin of vehicles on an intelligent edge environment to simulate the physical vehicle and handle the required data processing. Also, we implement a smart contract model for fast, secure, and sustainable on-road battery recharging between EVs.}

Some intelligent methods to foresee stability are required to mitigate unintended instability in a smart grid design. This is due to the rise in domestic and commercial constructions and the incorporation of green energy into smart grids. It is currently hard to forecast the stability of the smart grid. In this framework, a smart grid with reliable mechanisms is being implemented to meet the fluctuating energy demands as well as providing more availability. The involvement of consumers and producers is one of the many factors influencing the grid's stability.This study suggested anovelapproach for locating stability statistics in smart grid systems utilizing machine learning frameworks was presented. This paper outlined the multi-layer perceptron-Extreme Learning Machine (MLP-ELM)methodology to predict the sustainability of the smart grid. Additionally, this utilized the principal component analysis (PCA) approach for extracting features. In addition to an empirical assessment and a comparison to various approaches, this article presents an implementation result for smart grid stability. Simulation findings demonstrate that the suggested MLP-ELM approach outperforms traditional machine learning techniques, with accuracy reaching up to 95.8%, precision at 90%, recall at 88%, and F-measure at 89%.}

Nevertheless, the full-fledged deployment of IoT-based applications exposes this infrastructure to a high risk of cyberattacks. Since IoT devices establish communication with cloud services via inbuilt sensors, the probability of sabotaging the communication channel by malicious attacks is always high. This paper aims to explore an anomaly detection method that makes use of techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k- Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF) to neutralize threats and boost the cybersecurity of a smart city. The paper goes on to examine the role of ensemble techniques like bagging and boosting to provide an additional security layer to the detection architecture. This is where the paper departs from the erstwhile approaches that have revolved around single classifiers to boost the detection system and have not considered the integration of cross-validation and feature selection. The experimental results conducted on the datasets UNSW-BC15 and CICIDS2017 and several measures like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score establish that the proposed approach outperforms various state-of-the-art methods used in detecting rare attacks.}

This study aimed to evaluate the potential use of quantum computing in transforming smart agriculture practices to enhance sustainable crop management and increase yield. Traditional agriculture faces numerous challenges, including the need for more efficient resource allocation, precise monitoring of environmental conditions, and intelligent decision-making for optimal crop production. The innovation of new methods of agriculture brings into perspective how such capabilities can be integrated into crop and livestock farming to improve productivity, help control pests and diseases, and mitigate inherent risks. The research was explored through a narrative literature review and focused on developing quantum computing-based solutions for smart agriculture, including advanced optimization algorithms for resource allocation, quantum-enhanced machine learning models for crop disease prediction, and agricultural productivity, which can be assessed for climate change impact via modeling and simulation tools. Harnessing quantum systems' inherent parallelism and computational speed will provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations for maximizing yield while minimizing environmental impact.

The rise in demand from critical industries for gas sensors is due to environmental regulation of gas emissions or the monitoring of air quality in metropolitan areas due to vehicle emissions; these are the major factors driving the growth of the gas sensors market, which can open new opportunities for small companies in high technology and nanotechnology. The advent of a new era based on the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart cities, residences, and farms, as well as on smartphones and wearable devices, also represents an opportunity for advanced gas sensors. These lower-power, more affordable sensors are becoming available and are being integrated into consumer electronics. Here our emphasis is on highlighting the market segments and the different priorities underlying the choice of environmental sensor, which varies with the application. The principal gas sensors are pellistor sensors, infrared sensors, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors, electrochemical sensors, and optical particle monitor (OPM) sensors.

This study found an increase in electricity usage during the COVID-19 lockdown period for residential buildings, likely associated with the imposed restrictions. The research also highlighted a shift in energy usage from the morning peak to the central hours of the day during the working days of the lockdown period, while a gradual increase in electricity usage throughout the day and no morning peak was observed during the Autumn (post-COVID) period.

We conducted a deep survey on CE and smart mobility literature and sorted out potential solutions (alternatives) and fundamental indicators based on the Quintuple Helix model. Then, a rough-based multiple criteria decision analysis model was adopted by the incorporation of LMAW (logarithm methodology of additive weights) and MARCOS (measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution) methods. To analyse the potential solutions, ten experts from relevant sectors assisted us in composing an assessment platform through qualitative comparison. Initial results showed that public transport (good practices) and shared mobility services are amongst the best solutions for establishing a smart mobility plan.

Future projections show a concerning increase in building energy consumption, prompting researchers to investigate the potential of smart window technology to mitigate this issue. However, current research on smart windows has primarily focused on individual functionalities that do not meet consumer demands. Therefore, researchers must exploit the inherent properties of materials to develop multifunctional smart windows that can cater to consumer needs. The integration of smart windows into the construction of green buildings shows great promise, but mutual working mechanisms must be achieved to produce a synergistic effect toward high-performance smart window technology. Multifunctional smart windows can be achieved by incorporating applications, such as electrochromic, thermochromic, photochromic, and supercapacitor technologies, into one device. Implementing multifunctional smart windows is possible if the mechanisms and properties of composite materials meet both criteria for feasible applications. In evaluating the feasibility of integrating electrochromic and energy conversion devices, this review assesses the state-of-the-art smart window technology, limitations and roadblocks to commercialization, and potential materials for smart window technology. Notably, there is no previous review paper on the feasibility of integrating energy storage and energy harvesting applications to produce smart windows technology and its potential for net-zero buildings. In the future, multifunctional smart windows technology could be applied to more buildings and retrofits to reduce energy consumption and increase human comfort.}

abstract = {Smart home technologies (SHTs) encompass a wide range of products and services that fulfill users' needs and wants regarding the enhancement of the quality and comfort of their daily lives. Despite the pervasive impact of these technologies, SHT penetration is still growing at a relatively slow pace. A prominent reason of this might be inadequate understanding of the factors that motivate consumers to embrace SHTs. However, it is difficult to explain the adoption of SHTs with a replication of traditional adoption models due to differences in contextual factors. In addition, existing models solely use conventional adoption variables from the consumer perspective and exclude the business viewpoint. Hence, to fill this gap, initially, in-depth interviews with industry experts have been conducted and some predictive variables that were not mentioned in the literature have been identified. Consequently, these variables were used to enrich the existing diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and offer an extended SHT adoption framework. Based on this framework, value superiority, consumer protection, design & reputation, enjoyment, complexity, and compatibility have been extracted through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as the dimensions of SHT adoption. However, the relative impact of these dimensions may be different for distinct consumer segments. To identify these differences and better design marketing and communication efforts, it is crucial to consider different characteristics of user segments and cohorts. For this purpose, users were classified into meaningful segments based on Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0. Therefore, first, the TRI 2.0 variables were grouped into two categories as technology motivators and technology inhibitors after running another EFA. Based on these two dimensions, users were grouped under three segments after cluster analysis as Tech Savvies, Tech Yin-Yangers, and Tech Mediocres. Ultimately, the final objective of this research is to discover the differences among these segments in terms of their attitude toward and intention to adopt SHTs. Subsequently, independent regression analyses have been run to figure out the relative impact of the six dimensions of SHT adoption on attitude toward and intention to adopt SHTs for three different clusters. It is observed that there are significant differences among these segments that signal the vital importance of treating these consumer groups in distinct ways.}

Two simple yet fast methods for estimating energy savings were developed to instantly calculate heating and cooling energy-saving rates, allowing users to immediately adjust temperature schedules. Measured data from 50 households were collected and analyzed to improve indoor thermal comfort and identify potential energy savings. The results showed that 62% of the surveyed users tended to maintain a constant indoor air temperature throughout the year. Equipped with functions for schedule setting, indoor temperature fluctuation range control, and occupancy detection, the introduced OCST can reduce annual heating and cooling energy consumption in single-family houses by 7 to 25% and 15 to 40%, respectively. Additionally, the temperature control logic of the OCST with multiple connected terminals aims to ensure maximum comfort in as many rooms as possible.

abstract = {Distributed ledger technologies, together with AI, smart systems and robotics could provide a scalable and robust platform for the smart underwater and surface marine infrastructures of the close future. They will be harbours or ports, marine farms or remote tourism facilities - only accessible through robotic avatars - for protected areas or for the elders. Autonomous Marine Vehicles, IoT networks, and humans will coexist in highly heterogeneous multivendor multiplatform environments where market transactions and complex administrative procedures will be ubiquitous. Some blockchains such as the Ethereum network are able to provide distributed scalable computing and trustable functionalities, capable of managing both technical interactions and market transactions among very diversified autonomous agents. For these reasons they seem to provide a valuable backbone for the smart marine infrastructure of the coming decades. In this paper we outline our research and innovation strategy and present our results showing the potential benefits of a subsidiary architecture integrating distributed ledger technologies with swarms of autonomous surface robots implemented by a Belief Space Planning approach.}

Large-scale integration of various electric vehicle (EV) types into a distributed renewable energy system has not been studied before, and their systematic integration method and quantitative impacts are still unclear in academia. Therefore, this project converted an existing net-zero metro railway network into a smart charging EV hub by transforming the stations to smartly charge all types of EV intersecting at a station, such as public EV charging stations, electric shuttle buses and metro-owned EV cars. Accordingly, the methodology begins with the multiobjective analyses of integrating a public EV charging station into a swappable battery-powered metro station. Secondly, an electric shuttle bus is integrated into the stations without and with bidirectional energy sharing and evaluated for the impact of driving patterns, parking time, and schedule coordination. Thirdly, the metro-owned EV cars are incorporated into the stations and analysed for the number of journeys without and with bidirectional energy sharing. Finally, the importance of control priority while designing the smart charging EV hub is examined. Overall, converting a metro railway into a smart charging EV hub significantly increases the renewable energy consumption from 0.58 to 0.76, improves the net present value from 71.35 × 106 HKD to –35.02 × 106 HKD, and reduces the annual maximum grid import from 1099 kW to 777 kW. The success of vehicle-to-building energy sharing mainly depends on the driving demand ratio to the battery size.}

abstract = {For the past decade, there has been a significant increase in customer usage of public transport applications in smart cities. These applications rely on various services, such as communication and computation, provided by additional nodes within the smart city environment. However, these services are delivered by a diverse range of cloud computing-based servers that are widely spread and heterogeneous, leading to cybersecurity becoming a crucial challenge among these servers. Numerous machine-learning approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the cybersecurity challenges in heterogeneous transport applications within smart cities. However, the centralized security and scheduling strategies suggested so far have yet to produce optimal results for transport applications. This work aims to present a secure decentralized infrastructure for transporting data in fog cloud networks. This paper introduces Multi-Objectives Reinforcement Federated Learning Blockchain (MORFLB) for Transport Infrastructure. MORFLB aims to minimize processing and transfer delays while maximizing long-term rewards by identifying known and unknown attacks on remote sensing data in-vehicle applications. MORFLB incorporates multi-agent policies, proof-of-work hashing validation, and decentralized deep neural network training to achieve minimal processing and transfer delays. It comprises vehicle applications, decentralized fog, and cloud nodes based on blockchain reinforcement federated learning, which improves rewards through trial and error. The study formulates a combinatorial problem that minimizes and maximizes various factors for vehicle applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MORFLB effectively reduces processing and transfer delays while maximizing rewards compared to existing studies. It provides a promising solution to address the cybersecurity challenges in intelligent transport applications within smart cities. In conclusion, this paper presents MORFLB, a combination of different schemes that ensure the execution of transport data under their constraints and achieve optimal results with the suggested decentralized infrastructure based on blockchain technology.}

Drawing on Self-Determination Theory, this paper develops a model of the process of consumer disempowerment associated with smart meter-induced data vulnerability. This process ultimately leads to the erosion of consumers' internalization of energy transition goals through the mediation of their perceived competency in using the device. Several aspects of electricity supplier behavior that could reduce the negative effects of smart meter-induced data vulnerability are explored, including managing data transparency in a relational way, ensuring fairness in the exchange with the customer, and avoiding pricing personalization based on the customer's private data. A quantitative survey conducted in France validated this model. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on customer data vulnerability and enriches the understanding of smart meter acceptability by identifying potential drawbacks of feedback-based smart devices for sustainable consumption. It also outlines how companies should engage in ethical practices when deploying smart technologies.}

Firmware of this type is typically heterogeneous and closed source. At the firmware level, it is harder to detect and evaluate security vulnerabilities since their effects are faster and larger. In recent years, several similarity-based firmware security detection techniques and tools have become research hotspots. Security concerns and attacks have risen to the top of the list for IoT security equipment, particularly IoT cameras.

In addition, the growth of Smart City solutions, which involve the deployment of large-scale network infrastructures, has revealed the benefits of processing data as close as possible to the source, a key principle of Edge Computing. However, the benefits of service orchestration in real-world applications have not been demonstrated to date given the novelty and difficulties related to large-scale deployments. To overcome this barrier, this work presents the design, deployment, and validation of a cloud–edge microservice-based architecture for service orchestration on top of a real-world network consisting of 175 nodes. These nodes were deployed as part of a regional network of touristic terminals to raise tourism’s potential in the region of Badajoz, Spain. The integration of the openBalena open-source cloud platform into the architecture enables remote and centralized management. The experiments carried out revealed an orchestration latency time to deploy new applications from scratch throughout the entire region between 22 s and 292 s depending on the size of the application image. In addition, CPU load and memory usage have been monitored and the lack of suitability of virtualized environments for interactive applications has been overcome, and a step-by-step guide from a successful deployment is provided. As a result, this integral solution contributes valuable insights into how to bring the benefits of orchestration to reality.}

Smart card systems in many cities, however, record only the bus boarding information (namely an open system), which makes it challenging to use smart card data for origin-destination estimations and subsequent analyses. This study addresses this research gap by proposing a machine learning approach and applying the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm to estimate the alighting stops of bus trips from open smart card data. It advances the state-of-the-art by including, for the first time, weather variables and travel history of individuals in the GBDT algorithm alongside the network characteristics. The method is applied to six-month smart card data from the City of Changsha, China, with more than 17 million trip-records from 700 thousand card users. The model prediction results show that, compared to classic machine learning methods, GBDT not only yields higher prediction accuracy but more importantly is also able to rank the influencing factors on bus ridership. The results demonstrate that incorporation of weather variables and travel history further improves the prediction capability of the models. The proposed GBDT-based framework is flexible and scalable: it can be readily trained with smart card data from other cities to be used for predicting bus origin-destination flow. The results can contribute to improved transport sustainability of a city by enabling smart bus planning and operational decisions.}

The need for SG exponentially increases as more variable renewable energy sources are integrated into the power system, with the power grid and the electricity market gradually being transformed from a centralized to a more distributed form.

The approach employs a multi-physical coupling isogeometric formulation based on Non-Uniform Rational Basis Spline (NURBS) to analyze the behavior of laminated FG-CNTMEE plate structures. It incorporates a refined zig-zag theory to accurately capture the Von Kármán nonlinear strain–displacement relationship, as well as the magneto-electro-elastic coupling properties of laminate layers. To achieve nonlinear damped responses, the smart constrained layer damping (SCLD) treatment is applied. Furthermore, to enable smart control of structures using the time-dependent passive/semi-active damping mechanism of viscoelastic materials, the formulation is transformed into the Laplace domain using the Golla–Hughes–McTavish model. The results are then converted back to the time domain through inverse techniques. The proposed approach has been rigorously validated through verification work and demonstrated its effectiveness in simulating and controlling FG-CNTMEE plates in two numerical examples.}

Surfactant-based EOR is one of these effective methods, which is applied after the primary and secondary recovery phases. This paper presents an experimental study on the use of a cationic surfactant, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, CH3(CH2)15N(Br)(CH3)3), and smart seawater (SW) for EOR in low-permeability carbonate rock with medium viscosity crude oil. Smart SW was prepared by modifying the concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- in synthetic offshore SW. The aqueous stability of CTAB was tested in different salinities of smart SW at the reservoir temperature. It was demonstrated that CTAB is stable at 55 °C, which was further confirmed through optical transmittance measurements, revealing values mostly exceeding 93%. The use of smart SW and CTAB significantly altered the wettability of carbonate rock towards water-wet and reduced the interfacial tension (IFT) between crude oil and water, reaching levels below 0.087 mN/m. However, the presence of smart SW increased the adsorption of CTAB onto the surface of carbonate rock. Nevertheless, the adsorption values were significantly below 1 mg/g-rock. Smart SW + CTAB resulted in a total oil recovery of 76.71% of original oil-in-place (OOIP), compared to 71.70% of OOIP with unmodified SW + CTAB. These results suggest that the use of smart SW in combination with CTAB is a promising approach for enhancing the recovery of medium-viscosity oil from tight carbonate reservoirs. Findings from this study can help in better understanding the optimal conditions for the application of smart SW-CTAB flooding to improve the effectiveness of tertiary recovery operations in the upstream oil sector.}

Technology-driven breakthrough has usually pushed agriculture to the brink of another development that can affect not only plant diversity and yield, but also climatological and socio-economic outcomes. The concept of sustainable agriculture has become increasingly popularized as research and farming communities believe that productivity with environmental and social consequences need to be judiciously balanced. Agriculture of developed nations has practically benefitted of this concept worldwide during the 1990 s. In order to be successful worldwide, extensive research must be conducted not only for large-scale farms in developed nations but also for small-scale farms in developing nations. Climate smart agriculture conserves biodiversity by adopting coherent, multifunctional, and multi-cropping approach through design oriented spatial planning and flow among them.

Citizens in Nanjing were selected to conduct a case study, and the results showed that the overall outcome was in demand exceeding supply, whereas the Existence dimension was in supply matching demand, and the Related and Growth dimensions were in demand exceeding supply. The heterogeneity of the supply-demand matching degrees caused by citizens’ age and usage frequency was confirmed. Finally, the theoretical contributions were extracted and three practical implications were proposed, including adjusting the SGS supply based on regular citizen investigation, increasing the channels for citizens to participate in the whole process of SGS supply, and balancing the heterogeneity of SGS supply and information privacy security. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of SGS, but also provides guidance for global governments to formulate sustainable SGS supply strategies.}

abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, devices will predominate, using it in a manner similar to how people used it. Devices will cooperating in a multicast network to collect, share, and forward information way while interacting with one another autonomously and without centralised supervision. The building of an intelligent environment the capability of real-time collection of data, which is crucial for maximising the value of the IoT, will make this possible. A typical electric grid is made up of many power plants that use various power generating units, such as coal-based units, gas-based units, hydro units, etc. The majority of the infrastructure and wires that make up the conventional electricity grid have been in existence for a long time, it should be mentioned. They require significant investments, so providing them could take years. As a result, many grid components are outmoded and must be maintained and monitored on a regular basis to keep power flowing. A sophisticated technology is the smart grid (SG) system that makes it easier to integrate green technology and environmental considerations. The SG cyber–physical system was implemented thanks to the advancement and use of communication technologies in the conventional power system. The Internet of Things (IoT) and essential devices are both present in the complicated architecture of the SG systems. The traditional electric grids are been transformed into smart and efficient grid known as “Smart grid”. The Internet of Things’ smart grid allows for two-way communications among connected devices and technology that can recognise and respond to human needs. The cost and reliability of a smart grid are superior to that of conventional power infrastructure. Through use and data maintenance, smart grid technology will assist in reducing energy use and costs. One of the primary contributions made to grids is the integration of IoT with producing facilities using sustainable energy at various levels. To enhance the smart grid for bidirectional information exchange, improve power quality, and increase reliability Internet of Things (IOT) devices are becoming an important part of smart electric grid. IOT Infrastructure (IOTI) provide a flexible, efficient and secure platform providing strategic management for monitoring and controlling of different operations under different working conditions. This paper discusses cyber security on IOT based infrastructure for electric power systems. A comprehensive study is highlighted which includes type of IOTs, architecture used for smart grid, and future challenges.}

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) plays a vital role in these initiatives within the smart grid infrastructure. The rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies, especially the Internet of Things (IoT), will enable successful architectural designs for HEMS. This study proposes an incentive-based DR implementation using IoT-enabled HEMS for the Indian residential sector that represents 25% of the total power demand. The proposed HEMS automates the management of categorized loads during peak hours through load shifting and scheduling. The proposed algorithm is deployed in real-time residential setup using IoT modules. Emphasizing sustainability and consumer affordability, the work integrates a Photo-Voltaic (PV) based Battery Storage System (BSS) to support critical loads during peak hours. Consumer load preferences obtained through a survey are incorporated into the deployment of the proposed HEMS. Experimental studies demonstrated significant energy savings of 49% with the loads under consideration and substantial cost savings like approximately 49% with Load Management (LM) alone, 53% with the inclusion of Time of Day (ToD) tariff, and an impressive 78% with the proposed incentives for participating in DR. Additionally, this study highlights the synergistic savings realized through the combined implementation of the proposed LM strategy and ToD tariff in India.}

We calculate the mean velocity and the diffusion coefficient through the statistical analysis of the parametric curves produced by car movements. We found that a power law relationship closely relates both quantities as in kinetic theory but with a different exponent than those found in Brownian motion theory. We close the paper by discussing the possibility of using the Diffusion coefficient to characterize the city, as it is traditionally done with the mean speed and the flux rate; and how to calculate this quantity in a smart city.}

In addition, numerous compounds may be present in very different amounts. Cannabinoids and terpenes represent the main components of Cannabis sativa inflorescence samples, whose quantities are relevant for many application purposes. The analyses of both families are performed by different methods, at least two different separation methodologies, mainly according to their chemical characteristics and concentration levels. In this work, concentration differences and sample complexity issues were addressed using an LC×LC method that incorporates an optimized modulation strategy, namely smart active modulation, for the simultaneous analysis of cannabinoids and terpenes. The system was built by interposing an active flow splitter pump between both dimensions. This set up aimed to exploit the known advantages of LC×LC. In addition, here we proposed to use the splitter pump for online control over the splitting ratio to facilitate the selective dilution of different eluted fractions containing compounds with highly different concentrations. This work represents the first application and demonstration of smart active modulation (SAM) in LC×LC to simultaneously determine analytes with significant differences in concentration levels present in complex samples. The proposed method was tested with eight different strains, from which fingerprints were taken, and numerous cannabinoids and terpenes were identified in these samples. With this strategy, between 49 and 54 peaks were obtained in the LC×LC chromatograms corresponding to different strains. THCA-A was the main component in six strains, while CBDA was the main component in the other two strains. The main terpenes found were myrcene (in five strains), limonene (in two strains), and humulene (in one strain). Additionally, numerous other cannabinoids and terpenes were identified in these samples, providing valuable compositional information for growers, as well as medical and recreational users. The SAM strategy here proposed is simple and it can be extended to other complex matrices.}

The main areas of focus have been evaluated based on the cities’ priorities: transportation (both public and private) and consumers’ perspectives on the use of smart electricity meters. The use of electric vehicles in Sweden, and a techno-economic evaluation of biogas-derived biomethane and electricity use in public transportation have been analyzed.

While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary. More than 3300 data-driven models are trained for optimizing the model performance to achieve accuracy of greater than 80% F1 score for detecting anomaly events, which are subsequently localized within 400 m with 2–3 days lead time.}

Smart cities efficiently manage assets, services, and resources with better IoT technologies and new smart devices. However, their deployment elevates the potential security threats making IoT smart city projects vulnerable to disparate attacks. Hence, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) must be developed for IoT-enabled smart cities to alleviate IoT-associated security attacks. Achieving high-level detection accuracy and lower training time are significant challenges in IDS. However, the existing traditional IDS are inefficient in handling them. This paper proposes a hybrid optimization and deep-learning-centric IDS to face these challenges in IoT-enabled smart cities. The dataset initially undergoes pre-processing to acquire an effective and accurate IDS. Then, feature selection and clustering are performed utilizing the Hybrid Chicken Swarm Genetic Algorithm (HCSGA) and MinK-means Algorithm. Lastly, the transformed data is loaded to the Deep Learning-based Hybrid Neural Network (DLHNN) classifier, classifying the normal and attack data. The proposed model is validated with the NSL-KDD dataset and the experimental outcome shows the efficiency of the proposed IDS compared with similar state-of-the-art techniques.}

The results show that the camp's sanitation infrastructure is wholly unsafe, with faecal sludge (FS) not being properly contained, emptied, or treated.

Meanwhile, the dynamic management of Smart City is becoming more and more complex, it requires new tools. SIS technology can provide such utilities. However, their implementation is slowed down by various barriers. The aim of the study was to identify barriers that slow down the implementation of SIS technology tools. For this purpose, a five-level model of SIS technology application development was worked out. The model shows the direction of development of SIS technology application, and thanks to it, it was indicated what barriers may appear when moving to the next levels. In order to identify them, a two-stage empirical study was carried out in Polish cities with a population of about 100,000. Their aim was first to check, whether the examined cities use SIS technology tools. This was confirmed by the survey conducted by means of electronic observation. Afterwards, studies were conducted in 13 medium-sized cities in Poland. Based on the results, the model of development of SIS technology application was positively verified by assigning an appropriate level of development to each of the examined cities. Barriers were then identified and included: mental, financial, organizational and legal, information, technological and mental barriers.}

In building refurbishment projects, efficient technologies such as smart controls and heat pumps are increasingly being used as a substitute for conventional technologies with the aim of reducing carbon emissions and determining operational energy and cost savings, together with other benefits. Measured building performance, however, often reveals a significant gap between the predicted energy use (design stage) and actual energy use (operation stage). For this reason, lean and interpretable digital twins are needed for building energy monitoring aimed at persistence of savings and continuous performance improvement. In this research, interpretable regression models are built with data at multiple temporal resolutions (monthly, daily and hourly) and seamlessly integrated with the goal of verifying the performance improvements due to Smart thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) and gas absorption heat pumps (GAHPs) as well as giving insights on the performance of the building as a whole. Further, as part of modelling research, time of week and temperature (TOWT) approach is reformulated and benchmarked against its original implementation. The case study chosen is Hale Court sheltered housing, located in the city of Portsmouth (UK). This building has been used for the field-testing of innovative technologies such as TRVs and GAHPs within the EU Horizon 2020 project THERMOSS.

In these industrial systems, the industrial internet of things (IIoT) significantly improves system efficiency, scalability, ease of control, and monitoring. These benefits have been achieved at the cost of greater security risks, thus making the system vulnerable to cyberattacks. Historically, industrial networks and systems lacked security features like authentication and encryption due to intended isolation over the Internet. Lately, remote access to these IIoT systems has made an attempt of holistic security alarmingly critical. In this research paper, a threat modeling framework for smart cyber–physical system (CPS) is proposed to get insight of the potential security risks. To carry out this research, the smart firefighting use case based on the MITRE ATT&CK matrix was investigated. The matrix analysis provided structure for attacks detection and mitigation, while system requirement collection (SRC) was applied to gather generic assets’ information related to hardware, software and network. With the help of SRC and MITRE ATT&CK, a threat list for the smart firefighting system was generated. Conclusively, the generated threat list was mapped on the national institute of standards and technology (NIST) security and privacy controls. The results show that these mapped controls can be well-utilized for protection and mitigation of threats in smart firefighting system. In future, critical cyber–physical systems can be modeled upon use case specific threats and can be secured by utilizing the presented framework.}

abstract = {With the increasing numbers of vehicles, the parking space management is becoming a critical issue especially for congested settlement areas. Especially during the peak hours, the difficulty of finding a parking spot can introduce significant challenges to drivers. In order to locate the parking spot, most of the time drivers rely on their own limited knowledge of where the parking spaces are available at a given time. Even in these cases, large numbers of vehicles may try to access limited numbers of parking spaces which in turn leads to traffic congestion. Furthermore, when the parking region is rather complicated with large numbers of spots, the identification of a suitable parking spot becomes an expensive process since it often causes an increase of vehicle traffic which in turn also causes a consequent increase of pollution. Therefore traffic on roads and parking space has been an area of concern in the majority of smart city studies and applications. Parking monitoring is known in the literature as one of the promising solutions to these issues. In this paper, we present a hierarchical approach based on the binary search tree (BST) for parking monitoring systems that helps users to reach a free parking spot easily. The solution proposed introduces an approach which makes searching process in car parking applications efficient in terms of time and energy. Two levels of hierarchy are employed for this purpose. In the first level, our algorithm only checks for the nearest car park. At the second level, the algorithm focuses on the car park that is the nearest and checks the nearest parking spot in that car park. Using this hierarchical approach, the search for an empty spot becomes more time efficient. Simulation results are presented in this study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical approach with BST. Non-hierarchical, hierarchical and hierarchical with BST support approaches are employed for same scenarios in order to show the effectiveness of the new approach. According to simulation results, hierarchical approach with BST is superior in terms of search time and energy efficiency.}

In addition, the smart grid requires high reliability and network availability that can be achieved by utilizing multiple radio access technologies in EDs. Radio access technologies (RATs), i.e., narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) and long-term evolution machine type communication (LTE-M), have been identified as promising solutions for these use-cases. This work first reports results of an extensive performance evaluation measurement campaign showing that LTE-M can be considered a preferred option and NB-IoT as a possible backup solution for smart grids. We also show that none of the selected technologies can fully meet the requirements of smart grid use cases. We then develop a theoretical model and corresponding association algorithm for balancing traffic load between two low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies to minimize the mean access delay. Our results demonstrate that the optimized usage of multi-RAT EDs considerably increases the number of supported EDs operating in polling-based mode. For 500EDs utilizing a single LTE-M technology, the mean access delay is over two seconds — contradicting the minimum requirements of smart grid applications. On the other hand, multi-RAT EDs running the developed algorithm increase the service capacity by up to six times (up to 3000EDs) while still satisfying the two-second latency budget.}

abstract = {Human activities, primarily carbon dioxide emissions, have undeniably caused global warming. The transportation sector contributes about a quarter of global CO2 emissions. While replacing traditional buses with electric ones has reduced emissions, it is crucial to consider the indirect emissions resulting from electricity consumption. This study proposes a framework for modeling bus emissions using smart card data, integrating spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and emission reduction potentials. Our analysis reveals that routes spanning 10–30 km contribute to 81% of total bus emissions, with an average emission rate of 56.2 gCO2/per-km for residents traveling by bus. Bus emissions also exhibit cyclical variations during holidays, weekdays, and weekends, indicating spatial clustering and trends. Although the area within Beijing's 4th Ring Road constitutes only 13% of the total area within the 6th Ring Road, it generates almost half of the CO2 emissions. With urban expansion, total bus emissions increase gradually, but emission intensity decreases. This study emphasizes the potential for reducing emissions through improved public transportation operations. It recommends fully electrifying the bus fleet and employing low grid emission factors, which could reduce emissions by up to 71% compared to diesel options. Electrification of buses and optimizing power generation on the grid are essential priorities for emission reduction.}

abstract = {In the smart home, inconsistencies in multi-source information often occur due to the vast quantities and diverse varieties of context information, and the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory exhibits remarkable efficacy in addressing this issue. However, the use of basic possibility assignment (BPA) to quantify the credibility of information may introduce the uncertainty contained in the original data. In order to obtain a more reliable BPA and improve the accuracy of multi-source information fusion, an index that combines the relationships of sources and the information volume of context (RSIVC) is defined to comprehensively calculate the uncertainty of context information. In addition, interval distance is introduced to calculate the credibility of the proposition (CoP), which quantifies the correspondence among uncertain context information and all propositions in the frame of discernment (FoD). Finally, based on the d-S evidence theory, a multi-discount context information inconsistency elimination (MDCIE) algorithm using RSIVC and CoP is proposed, which is specifically applied to address the problem of inconsistency in multi-source light intensity information in smart homes. In the experimental part, we compare the traditional and state-of-the-art inconsistency elimination algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Besides, we also test the efficiency of various components of the MDCIE algorithm as well as several RSIVC indicator-building strategies to ensure that the proposed algorithm is optimal. Under the conditions of high precision, medium precision, and low precision of sensors, the context-judge rate reaches 99.24 %, 98.58 %, and 98.09 %, respectively, which corroborates that the MDCIE algorithm is highly effective.}

abstract = {To achieve low carbon cities or green smart city, it is very important to foresee how we can reduce the number of cars in the residential communities without losing convenience and comfort of people. For that purpose, walkability is one of the key performance indicators expressing the environmental quality of a district. As the first step for creating a low-carbon smart community, this study attempts to evaluate the influence of walkability on traffic behavior of people by using mobile GPS data. Specifically, we statistically analyze the relationship between various walkability indices (centrality, betweenness, angularity, etc.) evaluated by road network data, and pedestrian movement estimated by mobile GPS data in the six main wards in Tokyo, Japan. The result suggests the usefulness of our approach for low-carbon smart community design rousing people’s walking activity. The walkability results and data are then compared to the results of a macrosimulation traffic model for the Sumida Ward of Tokyo to understand the impact that walkability may have on emissions if built environment conditions are improved in favor of a lesser automobile mode share.}
