abstract = {Express companies and users prefer contactless pickup and delivery methods such as smart lockers, particularly during the pandemic. Extant studies have examined the determinants of user intentions in using smart lockers but ignored the analysis of the process of their switching from traditional home pickup or delivery to contactless smart lockers. Moreover, neither the moderating role of user characteristics or senders' perspectives have been investigated. To address these gaps, we developed a push-pull-mooring framework and collected two online questionnaires to investigate senders' switching intentions and compare the differences between senders and receivers. The results of the PLS-SEM analysis identify the push effect of low perceived value of home pickup, pull effect of the attractiveness of smart lockers on switching intention and the mooring effects of inertia. The attractiveness of smart locker fully mediates the relationship between low perceived value and switching intention in sending condition and play a suppressing effect in receiving condition. The inertia of using home pickup negatively affects switching intention and strengthens the positive impact of the low perceived value of home pickup on switching intention. This study sheds new light on users’ switching intention to contactless pickup and delivery methods and assists express companies in understanding user intentions and making scientific decisions.}

The relative lack of carbon footprint analyses of urban public transportation systems (UPTS) is therefore surprising, given that UPTS is an important component of urban transportation and one that may play a crucial role in carbon emission reduction. This study conducts a spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS during the COVID-19 pandemic based on smart card data in Beijing. Since the core of carbon footprint calculation is to estimate travellers' trip trajectories and the ridership of urban rail transit (URT) and buses, we construct a novel multi-layer urban rail network model to calculate passenger volume and travellers' trajectories through a traffic assignment model. Furthermore, we utilize the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to analyse the correlation relationship between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. Additionally, we conduct statistical analysis of the carbon footprint of UPTS. The results of the spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS show significantly lower carbon emissions during holidays compared to those on working days, and emissions during peak hours contribute approximately half of the total daily UPTS emissions, while there are notable variations in the distribution of the carbon footprint among different districts. Moreover, our analysis reveals a positive correlation between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. The statistical analysis reflects different patterns of carbon footprint distribution on different dates during the pandemic, but the carbon footprint distributions on selected dates all follow a power-law distribution. This study may facilitate the understanding to the impacts of UPTS on the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also provide important guidance and reference for the development of carbon emission reduction strategies.}

To develop a successful smart PSS, customer requirement management from smart experience perspective is necessary. However, it is a challenging task to identify and evaluate diverse, implicit and interrelated smart experience-oriented customer requirement (SEO-CR) in smart PSS context. Hence, this paper proposes an effective methodology to elicit and analyze SEO-CRs. At first, a generic, two-dimensional SEO-CR system is presented as a basis to derive the tailored SEO-CRs for various smart PSS applications. Second, a novel HFLC-DEMATEL (hesitant fuzzy linguistic cloud-based Decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory) method is proposed to accurately evaluate the priority and complicated interaction of SEO-CRs, considering the hesitancy, fuzziness and randomness under uncertain decision environment. Some new operations (e.g., cloud total-relation matrix and weight determination method) and a cloud influence relation map are developed to fully take advantage of cloud model in DEMATEL implementation. Finally, a real case of smart vehicle service system (SVSS) is presented. The 18 SEO-CRs of the SVSS are derived based on the generalized SEO-CRs. By using HFLC-DEMATEL, some important SEO-CRs in context of SVSS are identified, such as autonomous and convenience. The finding of results can help designers make proper decisions in design and development of SVSS with a superior smart experience. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are validated by conducting some comparative analyses.}

The emphasis and focus on energy transition towards a renewable energy-based energy system has increased, alongside the need to understand the economic feasibility of energy system development built around adaptation and implementation of renewable energy resources and smart technologies to a pre-existing energy system. Likewise comes the importance of evaluating and understanding the positive social and environmental impact obtained through energy transition towards a greener and cleaner energy system. This paper applies the cost-benefit analysis method to assess the economic feasibility of implementing renewable energy resources and smart energy technologies in a pre-existing energy system in two pilot sites (St-Jean, France and Barcelona, Spain). The evaluation process encompasses all relevant parameters such as investment, operating and maintenance costs, energy prices, energy demand, energy supply and energy technologies characteristics needed to carry out an economic feasibility assessment of investments and implementation projects. In addition, the evaluation process allows assessing the environmental benefits obtained through implementation by calculating the estimated emission reduction achieved through energy system retrofitting and transition, alongside identifying the society's economic gains attained from the emission reduction. The results show that investing in energy transition and system development toward renewable energy-based energy systems is economically viable since the analysis highlights a considerable low payback period with 8.2 years for the Barcelona pilot, and 2.8 years for St. Jean pilot. Likewise provides significant economic benefits to energy system operators and stakeholders, which is demonstrated with a 22% increase in revenue in the case of the St. Jean pilot and 4% decrease in overall costs at the Barcelona Pilot. The results highlight that energy transition offers various other benefits, such as increasing energy system flexibility with the St Jean pilot experiencing a 21% average increase in energy flexibility in the system through implementation of the energy system development. Also, this includes other benefits such as emission reduction of 23.5% for St. Jean pilot and 4% for the Barcelona pilot, which can help improve public health.}

The results showed that EfficientNet-v2 and ResNet never fall below 0.992 for discriminating and detecting the grid cells encompassing weeds susceptible to ACCase-inhibiting and synthetic auxin herbicides. MCPA, a synthetic auxin herbicide, is used to evaluate the performance of the developed smart sprayer for precision control of broadleaf weeds in dormant bermudagrass turf. The developed smart sprayer prototype detected and sprayed every grid cell containing broadleaf weeds in field experiments. Compared to the broadcast application, precision spraying of MCPA provided the same level of control of broadleaf weeds. By 18 days after treatment (DAT), the nontreated control had 13 weeds no. m−2, while the plots that received broadcast and precision spraying had 0 and 1 broadleaf weed plant no. m−2, respectively. Precision herbicide application according to the herbicide weed control spectrum (HWCS) with the developed smart sprayer provided the same level of broadleaf weed control and could save more herbicides compared to an approach without discriminating weed species. Overall, these findings clearly indicated that the developed smart sprayer prototype could effectively detect, discriminate, and spray herbicides onto the grid cells containing target weeds based on the HWCS.}

The addition of Pec and PSAs significantly improved the physical properties and mechanical resistance of the films. So that, the permeability to water vapor and oxygen reduced from 2.81 to 2.74 (g‧s−1‧Pa−1‧m−1) and 5.25 to 4.70 (meq/kgO2), respectively. In addition, the strength and flexibility of halochromic film reached 0.7 MPa and 56 % compared to Gel film (0.62 MPa, and 46.96 %). Most importantly, the color changes of the smart film from cherry/pink to yellow/brown, which were proportional to the color changes of the anthocyanin solution at different pHs, were able to monitor the shrimp freshness and spoilage at room (20 °C) and refrigerated (4 °C) temperature for 14 days.}

The sudden outburst in smartphone technologies has revolutionised human relations creating new possibilities of encounter and connectivity. This paper examines people's smartphone usage patterns and highlights how this is increasing human vulnerabilities in cities with resultant wider societal implications. Drawing on the theory of vulnerability, Hofstede's cultural dimension theory and carrying out semi-structured interviews in the United Kingdom and Ghana, the paper reveals that the current scale of usage and addiction to smartphones and social media are fostering emerging forms of everyday vulnerabilities. Victimisation, privacy breach, home emergencies and road accidents are prevalent vulnerabilities in both Accra and London. By comparing participants' smartphone usage patterns and their motives for adopting or ignoring certain social media practices, the study illustrates how the concept of attitudinal vulnerability extends our understanding of Hofstede's theory of collectivism and individualism. While the finding from Accra complicates Hofstede's collectivism label as there seems to be a loss of genuine sense of care and people-centeredness among participants it confirms individualism tendencies among the participants in London though some tendencies of ‘virtual collectivism’ were observed. In conclusion, the study emphasises how significant behavioural changes among smartphone users can reduce human-induced vulnerabilities in cities. By so doing, we add weight to the literature that focuses on the importance of developing context-specific cutting-edge ICT policies vis-à-vis building smart, safe and sustainable cities.}

It is hypothesized that there are no statistically significant differences in the level of response with SBP characteristics and challenges between respondents according to their experience, affiliation, and project type. A questionnaire was distributed to professional engineers and the quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Structure Equation Modelling (SEM) to test the research hypotheses. The experience and affiliation did not affect the response level with SBP characteristics and challenges while the project type did with a 95% confidence level. Overcoming the challenges, enhancing awareness, clarifying purpose objectives, creating standards, and opening a deep discussion about SBP in Bahrain should occur and further improvements to the SBP sector could be achieved in Bahrain by studying digital building twins and blockchain technology for performance-based smart contracts.}

abstract = {Nowadays, to ensure people’s and property’s safety, cities have dozens of cameras installed on almost every corner. However, the haphazard deployment of these cameras often results in overlapping fields of view, leading to redundant processing of the same events by multiple cameras. This situation requires more power, huge bandwidth, and more storage capacity for collecting, processing and distributing multimedia data over the network. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Internet of Video Things-based system that efficiently reduces the number of cameras involved in processing redundant events. The proposed system operates through a two-step process. Firstly, a leader is elected from a group of cameras based on the degree of overlap in their fields of view, serving as the coordinator. Secondly, the system intelligently selects suitable assistants from neighboring cameras to complement the leader’s vision when it becomes inadequate for effective object tracking. Consequently, only the leader and its assistants remain active, while other neighboring cameras remain in an inactive state. The evaluation demonstrates that our IoVT-based solution offers an efficient approach by minimizing redundancy, optimizing resource utilization and overcoming the challenges posed by the random installation of cameras in urban environments.}

However, these smart devices – mostly cloud-based – can capture and share a variety of sensitive and private data about the occupants, exposing them to various privacy threats. Given the non-intrusive nature of these devices, individuals typically have little or no awareness of the data being collected about them. Even if they do and claim to care about their privacy, they fail to take the necessary steps to safeguard it due to the convenience offered by the IoT devices. This discrepancy between user attitude and actual behaviour is known as the ‘privacy paradox’. To address this tension between data privacy, consent and convenience, this paper proposes a novel solution for informed consent management in shared smart spaces. Our proposed Informed Consent Management Engine (ICME) (a) increases user awareness about the data being collected by the IoT devices in the SB environment, (b) provides fine-grained visibility into privacy conformance and compliance by these devices, and (c) enables informed and confident privacy decision-making, through digital nudging. This study provides a reference architecture for ICME that can be used to implement diverse end-user consent management solutions for smart buildings. A proof-of-concept prototype is also implemented to demonstrate how ICME works in a shared smart workplace. Our proposed solution is validated by conducting expert interviews with 15 highly experienced industry professionals and academic researchers to understand the strengths, limitations, and potential improvements of the proposed system.}

There is a need for addressing the issues related to post floods, so in this work, we focus on creating a system for real-time post-flood management using Artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated Smart IoT devices. We selected Mumbai as the study city based on five years of rainfall and flood frequency. We split Mumbai into separate clusters based on population density, where we treated Santacruz and Colaba as two clusters. The AI model data is collected for the training and testing of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for the Indian Metrological Department (IMD), Mumbai. We chose ANN here because the data to be evaluated is ambiguous and discreet; for this type of data, the choice must be made correctly. 80 percent of the data obtained is used for ANN model training and 20 percent for research. We discovered that this suggested model is better than the current outgoing flood control techniques. Decision-making and data processing have been automated so that casualties can be reduced and the stakeholders can conduct rescue operations better than the old methods of urban flood management}

abstract = {In promoting green life and environmental protection, encouraging mass participation in environmental protection activities and increasing mass willingness to use circular economy service platforms (CESPs) are of high importance. In light of this stance and other several dimensions, including green concept, hedonic value, and user benefits, the multiple attribute decision-making technique was used to develop an evaluation model that assesses the influential factor of one's willingness to use CESPs. By employing the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach, the degree of mutual influence between different evaluation dimensions and criteria was first determined to generate an influential network relation map (INRM). Next, the weights of influence of varying evaluation dimensions and criteria were calculated by combining the DEMATEL approach with analytic network process. Finally, an empirical analysis of comprehensive performance of different evaluation dimensions and criteria was carried out based on the modified VIKOR technique. Referring to the INRM, green information emerged as the primary aspect that should be improved and adjusted, followed by green management, hedonic value, user benefits, green appeal, and green participation in order of priority. These outcomes may serve as reference regarding ways to enhance mass willingness to use the ECOCO CESPs and its smart recyclers.}

Recent works have shown some of the security and privacy issues they stand upon. In this work, we propose a methodology to carry out a systematic security analysis of Smart Personal Assistants using a comprehensive set of tests designed to measure issues around the installation, the interaction, key functionality, and overall Security and Privacy controls. We apply this methodology to analyse security and data control in predominant commercial Smart Personal Assistants (SPA), including Apple HomePod, Google Home and Nest, Amazon Echo (Show and Dot), and Facebook Portal. The main findings of our research are: (i) SPA are not resilient to voice replay attacks; (ii) their skills activation mechanisms can be significantly improved to be more reliable in multi-user households; (iii) the users’ control to restrict the collection and access of Personally Identifiable Information can be also improved; (iv) they lack configurations adapted to minors, which should be included to make them more appropriate for a segment of users who interact more and more with them and have especially high regulatory requirements regarding security and data protection. Among the many hot research topics within this area, we find voice authentication and authorization especially interesting since they may push the usability of Smart Personal Assistants further, as long as they are robust enough from the security perspective.}

The system incorporates smart wearable sensing units for real-time, remote monitoring of vital health parameters such as Blood Pressure (BP), Heart Rate (HR), and Body Temperature (BT). A key innovation is the development of a hybrid wireless network communication mechanism within the IoWT-HHMS, utilising the FiPy microcontroller. This mechanism supports both short- and long-range connectivity and integrates an algorithm for efficient data acquisition and updating to the IoT platform. The IoWT-HHMS has undergone extensive testing and validation across various scenarios, including sensor functionality, performance of Wi-Fi and LoRaWAN networks, hybrid network connectivity, and accuracy assessment using the Datacake dashboard. The tests evaluated crucial aspects such as communication reliability, power consumption, and latency. The results demonstrate the system's high stability and accuracy in reading health parameters. Comparisons with reference devices reveal impressive accuracy levels for Systolic BP (SBP), Diastolic BP (DBP), HR, and BT, recording 96.37 %, 95.17 %, 97 %, and 98.57 % accuracy, respectively. Both Wi-Fi and LoRaWAN networks proved reliable in indoor and outdoor settings, maintaining data transmission over distances up to 1.5 km without data loss. In conclusion, the developed IoWT-HHMS shows great promise for efficient and effective real-time remote monitoring of patients' health conditions using an innovative hybrid wireless network communication mechanism.}

abstract = {According to academics and urban planners, the smart city concept favors technological products and solutions over end users and their adherence to a smart city proposal. The smart city concept is also considered in the cities of Latin America, one of the most urbanized and unequal regions of the world. Smart city implementation in such contexts can provide lessons on urban innovation when resources are scarce and the environments are volatile. Thus, it is possible to verify that one of the most implemented solutions to diminish the increasing urban congestion and its effects on citizens’ quality of life is related to smart urban mobility. This paper sought to evaluate the perception of bike-sharing users in a smart city and analyze the main motivations for using this system. The research analyzed the bike-sharing system of Passo Fundo, a medium-sized city in southern Brazil. Interviews with 526 residents identified three main motivations for using the bike-sharing system: (i) health and the environment, (ii) being social influencer, and (iii) the cyclist lifestyle. The respondents’ overall perception revealed their low satisfaction with the bike-sharing system and with the overall conditions for cycling. This finding calls for a better understanding of the planning and management of smart cities in conjunction with citizen’s perception and their effects on the city smartness. The research provides contributions regarding understanding the interconnected aspects of bike-sharing systems in the developing countries context. From a smart city perspective, we conclude that success within the domain of smart mobility can be achieved by observing the three factors revealed by the analysis. According to our results, meeting these criteria through public policies would increase bike-sharing, creating a green behavior trend.}

Herein, based on the simulation of SPG and IRC properties on building energy consumption, a tailored hydrogel is employed in a reversible glass mold with anisotropic infrared radiation emission (ε) in the different surfaces, successfully integrating excellent SPG parameters (phase transition temperature (τC), 28°C, post-phase solar transmittance (Tsol−HT), 3.52%) and IRC parameters (switchable infrared emissivity (Δε), 0.75–0.90). By utilizing summer and winter climate data from Wenzhou, as well as annual climate data from Singapore and Helsinki, it is determined that this gel window may save up to 64.68 MJ/m2, 11.31 MJ/m2, 201.84 MJ/m2, and 60.16 MJ/m2 in the respective locations, when compared to regular glass using the same model in EnergyPlus software. With the exceptional pre-phase visible light transmittance (Tlum−LT=84.86%) and building energy saving performance, the all-day and all-region smart window deserves attention, further investigation, and discourse for alleviating the energy crisis and mitigating greenhouse emissions.}

The complexity and heterogeneity of smart cities have become vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks, especially privacy-related attacks such as inference and data poisoning ones. Federated Learning (FL) has been regarded as a hopeful method to enable distributed learning with privacy-preserved intelligence in IoT applications. Even though the significance of developing privacy-preserving FL has drawn as a great research interest, the current research only concentrates on FL with independent identically distributed (i.i.d) data and few studies have addressed the non-i. i.d setting. FL is known to be vulnerable to Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) attacks, where an adversary can presume to act as a contributor participating in the training process to acquire the private data of other contributors. This paper proposes an innovative Privacy Protection-based Federated Deep Learning (PP-FDL) framework, which accomplishes data protection against privacy-related GAN attacks, along with high classification rates from non-i. i.d data. PP-FDL is designed to enable fog nodes to cooperate to train the FDL model in a way that ensures contributors have no access to the data of each other, where class probabilities are protected utilizing a private identifier generated for each class. The PP-FDL framework is evaluated for image classification using simple convolutional networks which are trained using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The empirical results have revealed that PF-DFL can achieve data protection and the framework outperforms the other three state-of-the-art models with 3%–8% as accuracy improvements.}

The proposed objective function is presented on four levels, which include minimizing operating costs, minimizing environmental pollution costs, minimizing risk costs, and reducing the destructive effects of cyberattacks such as false data injection (FDI). The proposed approach is implemented in the structure of the central controller and local controller and is based on the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method (MADRL). The MADRL model is formulated based on the Markov decision process equations and solved by multi-agent soft actor-critic and deep Q-learning algorithms in two levels of offline training and online operation. The different scenario results show operation cost reduction equivalent to 19.51 %, risk cost equivalent to 19.69 %, cyber security cost equivalent to 24 %, and pollution cost equivalent to 20.24 %.

abstract = {The complexity of a system, such as the Smart Grid, comes from the interaction of different fields of expertise and actors cooperating together. As a result, co-simulation frameworks are emerging to meet the need for analysis from a broader perspective. The feature to better understand the Smart Grid environment is the ability to simulate its different components simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent co-simulation framework that can serve as a test-bed for multiple Smart Grid strategies. In particular, we focus on Demand Response programs that exploit the thermal behaviour of residential buildings. The proposed framework is modular to test Plug&Play models. Moreover, it is highly flexible and configurable to evaluate realistic scenarios. We tested the platform on a case study of 1,000 buildings, performing an analysis of the effects of micro temperature deviations in buildings on the primary grid substation balancing problem. The results show the flexibility of the platform in testing different strategies. Moreover, power imbalances could be mitigated simply by acting on the indoor temperature set-points with smaller deviations.}

Interviews with multiple stakeholders from the agriculture sectors of three European countries (Belgium, Italy, and the United Kingdom) were used to develop a new conceptual model that attempts to generalize the complex interplay existing between skills and psychological factors in the context of smart technology adoption. This conceptualization provides a systematic view of the correlation between skills and psychological factors, complements the TAM by introducing the new concept of attitude to learning, and clarifies how the interplay between cognitive and emotional components influences the decisions to adopt and use smart technologies. In addition to these theoretical contributions, the paper emphasizes the importance of designing policy initiatives that tackle both cognitive and emotional barriers to the adoption of smart technologies, urging decision makers to move away from the simplistic assumption that increasing the digital skills of potential users automatically leads to growth in the adoption and implementation of smart technologies.}

The prominent stratum of power and energy becomes more effective and smarter due to improved communication support and IT infrastructure sustainability. Due to modern urban planning and architecture, SGs currently are designed for developing and innovating fundamental services to transmit provisions that are better aligned with the materialistic infrastructures of smart cities. The extensive use of new message-passing techniques, changing environments, and energy efficiency are helpful in improving quality of life and meeting the requirements of citizens, managements, and organizations. With the emergence of powerful technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices connect to the Internet and towns become smarter. At the same time, the connection faces challenges because it is not possible to maintain good data transmission quality over the Internet using these instruments. This chapter systematically presents the overview of the smart network grid with its operational challenges as well as how modern IoT protocols and IoT-based smart approaches specially designed for smart network grid applications are implemented in applications such as smart metering using micronetwork grids via IoT plug-ins and through smart devices with security provisioning.}

This solution could lead to energy saving and a thermal comfort improvement, but also a reduction of possible glare, improving the visual comfort. On the basis of an extended literature analysis there are some smart window technologies, such Electrochromic ones, most mature at research level, showing a large impact in the reduction in cooling demand. On the other hand, these solutions have some issues, like the long switching period or the alteration of indoor perceived colours. An example of promising alternative to Electrochromic technology could be the liquid crystal device, which performances have not been enough investigated in the current literature. In this context the purpose of the present study is to develop a deep investigation, thus numerical and experimental, of a full-scale electric-driven window (liquid crystal technology) installed in an outdoor test-room, in order to evaluate the effect of its usage on energy consumption and daylight control. Based on continuous monitoring, a numerical model of HVAC-building system with smart window was developed and calibrated. It allowed to carry out a sensitivity analysis on the energy demand by considering all window exposures, the window control logic (based on illuminance level or indoor air temperature), different climate zones (Benevento, Athens, London and Cairo) and the window to wall ratio (18% or 100%) also. Comparing the results with a static window, for all exposures and all climates, the dynamic window could reach an energy saving, up to −17%.}

A network of inter-connected devices are assumed to dynamically generate the required set-points for the system actuators at the remote control center where global optimization algorithms calculate real-time operational decision-making target values. These target values activate the local controllers to manipulate the spatially distributed detention basin's outlets enabling a smart catchment scale optimal control. A real world watershed with four outlets to a nearby watercourse is chosen to test the applicability and efficiency of the proposed dynamic control approach, based on model simulation results. Results show that the proposed autonomous control approach has the ability to enhance the global performance of the stormwater management system in terms of quality and quantity to balance the network flow dynamics and environmental demands, while reducing the potential for erosion of receiving water bodies. Climate change is specifically discussed as a challenge for the designed control framework. Although, the performance criteria are shown to be affected by the increased rainfall intensities compared to actual rainfall scenarios, the proposed methodology still improves the peak flow reduction and detention time of water, at global scale, up to 54% and 14 h respectively under climate change conditions.}

The objective of the comparison was to gain new insights that could support the successful deployment of future residential Smart Grids. Measured data on electricity generation and electricity consumption of households in 2013 and 2014 were evaluated. Existing reports with results of surveys of users were also analyzed. The energy performance revealed that the average domestic electricity consumption of households in PowerMatching City was lower compared to Pecan Street (2.6GWh versus 10.1GWh). At the same time, households in Pecan Street generated a higher amount of electricity compared to PowerMatching City (6.8GWh versus 1.14GWh). Households in Pecan Street consumed on average, 8% less electricity with respect to the USA average household domestic electricity consumption of 10.9GWh; while households in PowerMatching City consumed 19% less electricity compared to the Dutch average household domestic electricity consumption of 3.1GWh. Households in PowerMatching City appeared to have a higher potential to contribute to electricity demand and supply balancing, because their electricity consumption from the grid was largely reduced with increased self-generation. User experiences revealed that end-users in both pilots preferred technologies that automatically shift their energy use, since this requires minimal effort from them. We conclude that the pattern of households’ electricity generation and consumption in Smart Grid pilot projects, and their contribution to peak load balancing in the electricity network is largely influenced by existing Smart Grid set-ups, local climate and related needs for heating and cooling, the average capacity of installed energy generating technologies and the prevailing energy behavior.}

Understanding individual travel regularity under different activities is crucial for individual mobility prediction and urban facilities planning. Existing studies need further improvement as they have not adequately taken into account the impact of activity factors on individual travel patterns. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework for exploring travel regularity and the correlation with urban region attributes at the individual level. The framework’s novelty and uniqueness lie in its three layers: (i) A trip pre-processing layer for extracting every complete public transit trip and trip purposes (e.g. commuting activity and non-commuting activity) by combining individual’s travel characteristics and public transport network. (ii) An entropy-based travel regularity measurement and K-means based multiple-view clustering layer to assess the extent of individual travel repetition over time for various travel activity and investigate the similarities and differences among users. (iii) A region dependence correlation analysis layer for exploring the correlation between individual travel regularity and regions attributes of two key locations: home and workplace More importantly, by employing the framework, we gained empirical insights based on a large-scale dataset (covering 0.64 million users) collected from public traffic smart cards. For instance, commuters can be categorized into four groups based on the regularity of their commuting activities: Regular Workers (24%), Flex-time Workers (21%), Overtime Workers (35%), and Other Workers (20%). The distribution of these four groups is associated with workplace’s administrative characteristics, with a Pearson correlation of 0.503. In addition, individuals can also be classified into two groups based on their travel regularity of non-commuting activities: Limited Visitors (37%) and Active Explorers (63%). The distribution of these individuals is correlated with the coverage ratio of public transit facility in their home locations, showing a Pearson correlation of 0.604.}

Presently, large volumes of medical data are stored on cloud platform. However, outsourcing medical data to these popular platforms may introduce security issues. Thus, a secure watermarking algorithm based on integer wavelet transform (IWT)-Schur-Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) is put forward for medical records sharing in the cloud environment. To ensure high level of authentication, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based embedding is conducted to achieve dual watermarking by concealing system MAC address in the logo image. Prior to this, the system address is encoded via turbo code to reduce /eliminate the channel noise, if any. Further, both invisibility and robustness are achieved by fuzzy inference system (FIS), and the marked image is encrypted using chaotic encryption scheme to further improve the security. Furthermore, experimental results is reported and compared with the existing works which demonstrated promising outcomes, indicating its potential towards realization of a value-added tool for smart healthcare applications.}

The SHEMS approach is based on the state of charge of battery, supercapacitor and hydrogen tank as well as day-ahead forecast of solar irradiation, wind speed and household load. Fuzzy logic decision making technique is the core of the SHEMS strategy for deciding power-side operation mode (power source selection) and demand-side consumption mode (appliances and electrolyzer operation strategies) of the RSMG. Minimizing hydrogen consumption and battery usage are considered in the SHEMS strategy. The RSMG consists of photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) as the main power source while the backup source is formed by supercapacitor (SC), battery (Ba), fuel cell (FC), electrolyzer (El) and hydrogen tank (HT). The optimization model uses total net present value of costs (NPC) as the objective function. The considered residential household load profile consists of ten appliances, classified into four consumption categories (shiftable, adjustable, curtailable and critical) and applied to four different occupancy patterns (four classes), in addition to electrolyzer unit. The day-ahead prediction is obtained for hourly power generation and consumption using SVM-PSO model. The results, which are compared with previous researches, indicate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy to minimize the cost of the zero-emission power system balancing among cost effectiveness, technical feasibility and residents' comfort. The simulation is performed under Amman weather conditions using GAMS-MATLAB-Excel platform.}

The aim of this paper is to illustrate differences and similarities in technical and economic drivers and barriers to smart home market development in three European countries characterized by different policy and socio-economic contexts. The research reveals key barriers to the adoption of smart homes such as reliability, data privacy, and costs of smart home technologies across the countries studied. On the other hand, housing stock characteristics, both age of buildings and tenure, reveal deeper cross-country differences in attitudes and perceptions towards these technologies. The research highlights the need for smart home services that go beyond energy consumption and management services. Only when such a holistic approach is adopted, where other applications such as health or security, suited to the householders’ needs and making positive contribution to their daily lives, are enabled, will the benefits of smart homes become clear to the consumer.}

An important part of this concept of “smart cities” is the characterization of vehicular traffic flows and the prediction of urban mobility. Although there are several sensors that are able to infer the traffic flows in the city, road-mounted traffic counters can measure the number of vehicles in different parts of the roads. However, they are not usually used in traffic city prediction; therefore, we can provide a first step for the usefulness of these sensors in the city management. In this paper we study both statistical and deep learning methods to describe, understand and predict the city traffic profile. Although traffic presents seasonal patterns, in occasional situations these may not be verified. Considering the proposed approaches, statistical algorithms, such as SARIMA, and neural network algorithms, such as FFNN, LSTM, CNN and hybrid LSTM-CNN, we found that statistical models are significantly good to predict the traffic counters data in the short-term, even when anomalous traffic conditions are observed. For long-term predictions, CNNs have shown to be efficient and robust. Long-term and short-term forecasting, in the context of traffic flow prediction, may be a strategy to accomplish different goals. Long-term forecasting can be chosen for traffic flow description, and short-term forecasting can be used to identify and mitigate anomalies.}

abstract = {Real-time monitoring in smart grids requires efficient handling of massive amount of data. Fog cloud nodes can be strategically located within the smart grid to: pull readings from smart meters, implement local processing and control, and make all data available to the smart grid control center with minimum overall latency. Unlike existing studies in literature, we propose a novel Fog node allocation strategy that is tightly coupled with the power grid structure, and hence, accounts for the spatial distribution of data traffic sources (e.g., smart meters) within the power grid. Furthermore, the allocation strategy considers the diverse latency requirements of fixed scheduling and event driven data services within the power grid. The proposed allocation strategy first implements an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine initial number and locations of Fog nodes that can serve the data traffic with minimum overall latency. Then, a reinforcement-based mechanism is applied to minimize the required number of Fog nodes, and hence capital cost, through efficient mapping between Fog nodes and smart meters while still complying with the latency requirements. Our simulation studies demonstrate that a 50% reduction in required number of Fog nodes can be achieved while minimizing overall latency when the proposed allocation strategy is adopted.}

In this chapter, we present a vision of how smart materials, and technologies like additive manufacturing and transient electronics, can enable the transition from a linear consumption model to a circular one. By presenting a variety of R&D projects that aim to create environmentally conscious consumer goods, clothing, and natural and built environments, we illustrate how sustainability and smart functionality can be complementary forces, rather than antagonistic ones.}

Although many studies have investigated consumers’ purchase decisions regarding sustainable products, little research has addressed SSCCs and the relationship between privacy, disclosure intentions, and purchase intentions in SSCCs. These relationships are important because the use of smart technology products requires large volumes of consumers’ personal information, which can lead to severe privacy issues when adopting SSCCs. Accordingly, consumers’ preferences for features of sustainable products could conflict with their privacy concerns when they disclose personal information. Thus, we investigate the relationship between the several benefits of SSCCs and privacy-related decisions when purchasing SSCCs. We propose an extended privacy trade-off model based on three critical assumptions: two types of privacy trade-offs, bidirectional privacy reduction, and anchoring effects. We also investigate the effects of government subsidies for purchasing SSCCs regarding the relationship between governments, companies, and consumers. To validate our model, we test the effects of interaction between privacy concerns and the benefits of SSCCs on disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. Our repeated tests for the various benefits of SSCCs demonstrate the robustness of the model. Our results indicate that when consumers consider purchasing SSCCs, sustainability plays the role of the common good in trading for privacy concerns. In addition, government subsidies to encourage companies’ sustainable products increase disclosure intentions and purchase intentions. We conclude that the status of sustainability as a common goal among governments, companies, and consumers represents an opportunity to balance the privacy tensions in the sale and purchase of SSCCs.}

Smart Product-service System (Smart PSS), as a promising and sustainable business model, can respond to personalized and dynamic demands through effective configuration/reconfiguration processes. Mass personalization (MP), which emphasizes diversified values to improve user experience by considering both functional and affective elements, can significantly contribute to Smart PSS. However, Smart PSS field still lacks a unified knowledge representation framework and an effective configuration method in the MP context. Aiming to fulfill the gap, this research proposes a novel Smart PSS configuration method oriented to MP to meet personalized and dynamic requirements of users, especially satisfy affective and functional requirements simultaneously throughout the reconfiguration life-cycle. Due to the extreme complexity of heterogeneous data from Smart PSS and MP, Knowledge Graph (KG) is introduced as a powerful tool for managing intricate system knowledge. The common schemas of three KGs are constructed as the basis of configuration, with design knowledge, related field knowledge, and user information integrated comprehensively. KG-based question answering is combined with similarity calculation as a hybrid method in the configuration process to provide satisfactory and complete solutions. Moreover, the configuration process is placed in the reconfiguration life-cycle of Smart PSS to deal with dynamic changes through the latest knowledge in updating KGs. Furthermore, an illustrative case study of the intelligent management system for family medication is demonstrated. Through the comparison with other approaches, the proposed method is proved to be valuable for the implementation of Smart PSS configuration for MP.}

Conventional city planning approaches do not integrate considerations on energy, economy and environment in transition plans in an easily comparable way, yet making decisions with regards to these parameters is vital to determine outcomes of planned developments on future sustainability of the city. The paper presents a framework model based on emergy synthesis which integrates energy, economic and environmental city systems in the decision making process, examining associated theoretical challenges and application limitations. The method is applied on the city of Sisak in Croatia which has developed plans to implement several initiatives geared towards creating a smart energy city.

abstract = {Introduction
Mutual support groups (e.g. SMART Recovery) are an important source of support for people experiencing addictive behaviours. Little is known about the use of mutual support groups by people who use methamphetamine, or the factors that may influence group cohesion.
Methods
This study uses post-group data reported by SMART Recovery facilitators in Australia between 2018 and 2020. Group cohesion was indexed by facilitator ratings of The Group Entitativity measure (GEM-GP). Participant characteristics (gender, age, new or returning group member, voluntary or mandated attendance) and group location (major city vs. regional/remote vs. online) were used to (a) compare methamphetamine and non-methamphetamine related attendances; and (b) explore relationships to group cohesion within groups where the majority attended for methamphetamine.
Results
Methamphetamine use was the second most common reason for attending SMART Recovery groups (n = 4929; 22.2 % service occasions). Methamphetamine-related service occasions were more likely amongst men, people aged <45 years, returning attendees and regional/rural groups (allp < .05). GEM-GP scores were high (signalling strong cohesion), and did not significantly differ according to proportion of participants attending for methamphetamine (F(1,2) = 0.482, p = .618). Group cohesion increased with larger group size, proportion of women and proportion of younger people (F(4, 504) = 11.058, p < .001)).
Discussion and conclusions
This study improves current understanding of service utilisation by people who use methamphetamine. SMART Recovery groups offer an avenue for supporting a diverse range of people who use methamphetamine, outside the formal treatment system. This provides an important foundation for improving community support options for people who use methamphetamine.}

Technological advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT) provide a broad range of energy sector applications, such as transmission and distribution, energy supply, power generation, renewable energy integration, load demand management, etc. We have conducted a comprehensive and critical IoT study on business applications and smart energy systems for this objective. Four main areas of smart energy systems have been chosen, including: i) the use of IoT in business; (ii) the use of IoT in smart energy applications; (iii) the use of IoT in data transmission networks; and (iv) the use of IoT in power generation and terminal hardware/devices. Each research area is further divided into different sub-areas; for example, IoT business includes energy operational policy, energy management and planning, energy management systems, business models, and customer services. Energy forecasting, state monitoring and estimation, anomaly detection, data mining and visualization are among the IoT applications in smart energy systems. Cloud computing, edge computing, and quantum computing are provided using IoT in data transmission networks. A variety of renewable sources, pricing, and load management strategies involve the use of IoT in energy generation. Many new solutions for smart energy systems are provided with critical thinking and clear vision, and key industries for IoT revenue generation and application development are described. This study aimed to provide a clear insight into IoT devices' recent developments in smart energy systems, supported by high-quality published literature. It is noted that in 2015, the IoT worldwide energy market exceeded USD 6.8 billion and is projected to reach USD 26.5 billion by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 15.5 % in 2016−23.}

This paper leverages the knowledge from the UK’s largest SLES demonstrator in the Orkney Islands, named the Responsive FLEXibility (ReFLEX) project, to propose a framework that will help communities to successfully implement a SLES. First, this paper describes how the multi-services electrical SLES implemented in Orkney reduces the impact of the energy transition on the electrical infrastructure. We identify and discuss the main enablers and barriers to a successful SLES, based on a review of SLES projects in the UK. Second, to help future communities to implement SLES, we extend the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) into a comprehensive multi-vector Smart Local Energy Architecture Model (SLEAM) that includes all main energy services, namely power, heat and transport. This extended architecture model describes the main components and interaction layers that need to be addressed in a comprehensive SLES. Next, to inform successful deployment of SLES, an extensive list of key performance indicators for SLES is proposed and implemented for the ReFLEX project. Finally, we discuss lessons learnt from the ReFLEX project and we list required future technologies that enable communities, energy policy makers and regulatory bodies to best prepare for the energy transition.}

Hence, IoT technologies can significantly improve the overall WM process and its logistics. It is then crucial to identify the challenges of IoT adoptions for WM in DCs, to ensure more successful adoptions. While the IoT literature is booming, very little research has been conducted focusing on WM in DCs specifically. Hence, this research summarizes and provides an overview of the existing literature on the challenges of implementing IoT technologies for WM in DCs. The primary purpose of this review is to present the findings from the reviewed articles, shed light on current research gaps, and offer recommendations for future research. Our main findings suggest that DCs can develop optimization plans for WM processes that may aid them in joining the worldwide efforts to protect public health and reach the sustainable development goals put forward by the UN.

It has good acceptance in the Northern countries, a low-carbon footprint, and can easily integrate intermittent renewable energy sources when coupled to the electrical grid. Even though district heating is seen as a vital element for a sustainable future, it requires extensive planning and long-term investments. To increase the understanding of the district heating network performance and the demand-side dynamics of the connected buildings, several countries, including Denmark, have installed smart heat meters in different cities. In that context, this paper presents several methodologies to analyze the datasets from the smart heat meters installed in a small Danish town. The first method is concerning data curation to remove the anomalies and missing data points. The second method analyses measured variables (heat consumption, outdoor temperature, wind speed, and global radiation) to acquire new knowledge on the building characteristics. These results were compared with the values given by the energy performance certificates of a smaller sample of 41 households. Finally, to communicate and visualize the analysis outputs in a user-friendly way, an interactive web interface tool has been created.}

Innovative and cutting-edge technologies foster the process of decision-making by collecting data to create comprehensive feedback. As smart technologies have already enhanced the well-being of societies through various ways, their great potential in the fight against climate change has been discussed vastly among scholars. Nevertheless, the need for clarification of modern technologies’ role in adapting and mitigation of climate change in urban infrastructures is still crucial as the stage of knowledge is not comprehensive enough. It is important to highlight the fact that the implementations of frontier technologies can address this challenge and develop sustainable urban infrastructures, which is otherwise impossible to achieve due to the limitations of conventional technologies. On the other hand, since cities are the most affected environmental by, and most influential factor for climate change, focusing on the role of smart solutions and technologies in urban infrastructures looks vital. To this end, this chapter by employing the descriptive analytical method, explores the current trends of modern technologies and their peripheral applications applied in urban infrastructures to address climate change. In this respect, the key effective areas of frontier technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, 5G, and Digital Twin will be discussed. Results indicate that frontier technologies have an essential role in tackling the climate change issues by providing environmental resilience, sustainability, and in general, smartness for urban infrastructures. However, despite all the positive impacts of these technologies’ implementation in achieving climate actions, it should be noted that they could also act as a double-edged sword that could cause unintended environmental consequences that may result in detriment of the environment. Therefore, these possible adverse impacts of using these technologies must be considered before their implementations.}

abstract = {The study presents the sizing of a hybrid renewable islanded system that can feed both electrical and thermal energy simultaneously. The aforementioned energies are generated through the utilization of wind systems and bio-waste units. The integration of combined heat and power technology in the bio-waste unit enables the concurrent generation of electricity and heat power. Electric vehicles consume electric energy, but function based on a smart charging. The study employs compressed air energy storage as a means to bridge the disparity between the patterns of electric power generation and consumption, with the aim of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing planning expenses. Thermal energy storage serves as an intermediary between renewable power and load profiles within the thermal sector. Objective here is find the minimum annual capital and maintenance costs of sources, storages, and power electronic converters. Problem is constrained to operational model of renewable sources, storages, and electric vehicles. The present model prioritizes the utilization of renewable sources for the purpose of supplying electrical and thermal loads. Electric vehicles regulate their active power to minimize the disparity between load and electric production profiles. Storages perform charging and discharging functions to bridge the disparity between power generation and consumption. Strategy incorporates uncertainty related to load, wind speed, bio-waste-derived gas production, and electric vehicles parameters. The study employs a point estimate method to attain a dependable solution. The numerical results indicate that incorporation of compressed air storage in the hybrid system results in a decrease of 7.7 % (12.9 %) in the planning costs relative to system with batteries (hydrogen storage). The proposed design's concurrent provision of electrical and thermal energy leads to an approximately 57 % increasing in planning costs when compared to a system that solely provides electrical energy. The implementation of a smart charging strategy for electric vehicles drop the hybrid system's overall scheduling cost by 3.9 %.}

abstract = {In spite of research recognizing the home as a shared space and privacy as inherently social, privacy in smart homes has mainly been researched from an individual angle. Sometimes contrasting and comparing perspectives of multiple individuals, research has rarely focused on how household members might use devices communally to achieve common privacy goals. An investigation of communal use of smart home devices and its relationship with privacy in the home is lacking. The paper presents a grounded analysis based on a synergistic relationship between an ethnomethodologically-informed (EM-informed) study and a grounded theory (GT) approach. The study focuses on household members’ interactions to show that household members’ ability to coordinate the everyday use of their devices depends on appropriate conceptualizations of roles, rules, and privacy that are fundamentally different from those embodied by off-the-shelf products. Privacy is rarely an explicit, actionable, and practical consideration among household members, but rather a consideration wrapped up in everyday concerns. Roles and rules are not used to create social order, but to account for it. To sensitize to this everyday perspective and to reconcile privacy as wrapped up in everyday concerns with the design of smart home systems, the paper presents the social organization of communal use as a descriptive framework. The framework is descriptive in capturing how households navigate the ‘murky waters’ of communal use in practice, where prior research highlighted seemingly irreconcilable differences in interest, attitude, and aptitude between multiple individuals and with other stakeholders. Discussing how households’ use of roles, rules, and privacy in-practice differed from what off-the-shelf products afforded, the framework highlights critical challenges and opportunities for the design of communal privacy experiences.}

Meanwhile, it is arduous to visit medical professionals intermittently by the patients for fear of spreading the disease. This IoT-based healthcare monitoring system is utilized by many professionals, can be accessed remotely, and provides treatment accordingly. In context with this, we designed an IoT-based healthcare monitoring system that sophisticatedly measures and monitors the parameters of patients such as oxygen level, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate. This system can be widely used in rural areas that are linked to the nearest city hospitals to monitor the patients. The collected data from the monitoring system are stored in the cloud-based data storage and for the classification our approach proposes an innovative Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based Puzzle optimization algorithm (PO). Based on the outcome further treatments are made with the assistance of physicians. Experimental analyses are made and analyzed the performance with state-of-art works. The availability of more data storage capacity in the cloud can make physicians access the previous data effortlessly.}

The proposed iterative four-stage optimization framework is another contribution of this paper, which utilizes a self-healing performance index to assess the level of resiliency of the multi-carrier energy system. In the first stage, the optimal decision variables of planning are determined. Then, in the second stage, the smart buildings and parking lots contribution scenarios are explored. In the third stage, the optimal hourly scheduling of the energy system for the normal condition is performed considering the self-healing performance index. Finally, in the fourth stage, the optimization process determines the optimal scheduling of system resources and the switching status of electrical switches, heating, and cooling pipelines’ control valves. The proposed method was successfully assessed for the 123-bus IEEE test system. The proposed framework reduced the expected values of aggregated system costs and energy not supplied costs by about 49.92% and 93.64%, respectively, concerning the custom planning exercise.}

abstract = {A smart demand response control system aiming towards real-time operational optimisation of district heating (DH) network temperature levels, both in the return and supply pipes, has been developed in the TEMPO project. The return temperature is mainly dependent on the demand side. The controller optimises its value through control of the customers’ heat load. The network supply temperature, however, is directly controllable on the production side. The capabilities of supply temperature control are twofold. On the one hand, lowering the network supply temperature as close as possible to the limits determined by customer thermal demands. On the other hand, activating the intrinsic thermal capacity of the piping to temporarily store heat and thereby shifting the heat load in time. This provides additional energy flexibility potential on top of building demand response. In this study, the two features of the smart control system have been tested in a part of the DH network of Brescia (Italy). A cloud-based platform is used to collect real-time data from various sources and to communicate control signals calculated by the smart controller. The article presents the results of the tests and an evaluation of the controller performance. The analysis indicates that daily flow-weighted average return temperature reductions of almost 1 K on average can be achieved, and up to 15 K instantaneously. Using supply temperature control, the daily peak load energy supply could be reduced by 262 kWh (34%) on average, by shifting the heat load.}

Smart classrooms integrate advanced technology to provide equitable digital learning and interactive environments for these students. However, determining optimal pedagogical approaches for smart classrooms and investigating the potential technology novelty effect remain areas of exploration. This study delved into the impact of smart classrooms combined with various student-centered pedagogies (SC-SCP)—team-based learning (TBL), problem-based learning (PBL), and project-based learning (PjBL), on rural students' learning outcomes. These outcomes encompassed academic achievement, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the research examined how student-centered pedagogies and intervention duration moderated the effects of SC-SCP. A meta-analysis across 24 rural schools in Taiwan was conducted, each with a comparison class and an experimental class, resulting in a total of 48 classes. While the comparison classes within traditional classrooms combined with teacher-centered pedagogies (TC-TCP), the experimental classes embraced SC-SCP in smart classrooms. The findings indicate that: 1) The experimental classes outperformed the comparison classes in enhancing students’ learning outcomes; 2) when considering the moderating impact of student-centered pedagogies, PjBL exhibited the most substantial improvement in problem-solving skills, followed by PBL, and finally TBL; additionally, 3) SC-SCP demonstrated a minor improvement effect size in problem-solving skills after four weeks of intervention, which escalated to a significant effect size after eight weeks of intervention. In summary, these results suggest that a combination of smart classrooms and PjBL, implemented for a duration of over two months, leads to the most substantial enhancement in learning outcomes for rural students.}

The advent of smart health can be attributed to the convergence of various technologies, including wireless communication, embedded systems, artificial intelligence (AI), medical technologies, and information security. It is essential for smart health firms to systematically comprehend TC patterns and anticipate emerging convergent technologies at an early stage to leverage potential technological opportunities. This paper proposes a machine learning methodology that integrates network analysis to predict and analyze changing TC patterns from patent data related to smart health. A machine learning-based link prediction method is developed to forecast convergent technologies from a comprehensive set of link prediction measures. Network centrality analysis is then used to understand and evaluate the convergent patterns in the predicted technological knowledge interaction network and identify critical convergent technologies that may play significant roles in the future. The research not only demonstrates that convergent innovation is a continually growing trend in the smart health industry but also identifies several important emerging convergent patterns.}

Exploring daily PT riders’ traffic flows using anonymized big data is a first step to analyze when and to where people travel. Nevertheless, assessing the degree to which PT usage patterns correlate with the spatial distribution of points of interest (POI) and subsequently affect the city structure is less attempted. Classic approaches use questionnaires and survey data that are costly and often yielding limited statistical significance. The purpose of this research is to understand associations between travel patterns of urban commuters and the functional organization of a city. To this end, we propose a network-constrained temporal distance measure for modeling PT rider travel patterns from smart card data; and further introduce a fully autonomous approach to describe the span of services available at catchment areas around metro stations. The end result is a detailed analytical prescription of spatiotemporal commuting patterns in the city of Lisbon as well as an analytical contextual information that enables us to understand the functional modular structure of urban facilities. Using the city of Lisbon as the guiding case study, the gathered results confirm the hypothesis that PT rider’s daily flows along the PT network of metro stations reveal a city modular structure.}

Taking Nanjing, China, as a case study, this paper analyzes the combined travel route of metro-bikeshare users based on three-week metro- and shared bike smart card data. The smart card data provides both boarding/borrowing and alighting/returning location and time, which makes it possible to trace each combined mode user’s actual metro routes. By assuming that the bike routes are the shortest paths between a specific OD pair from smart card records, we extract the combined metro-bikeshare travel routes of each user by using a metro route reconstruction method. The results show that over 60% of the metro-bikeshare users, most of whom are youth adults (18–35 years old), only occasionally use this mode. Further, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the combined metro-bikeshare travel routes are analyzed visually across different age groups. We find that most of the combined metro-bikeshare routes concentrated on Metro Line 2 with different cycling access/egress routes; however, the routes mostly travelled by different age groups are significantly different. Young adults are mainly distributed in suburban and exurban areas. Adults are more likely to be metro-bikeshare commuters, with travel routes usually passing through the central area of the city. Besides, the routes mostly travelled by the elderly are longer than those by other groups, and highly coincide with the routes mostly travelled by adults during the rush hours. Finally, relevant policy implementations are proposed in conjunction with metro-bikeshare users’ travel route characteristics.}

It also supports senior management's decision-making, because it allows assessing preventive measures and actions taken. The VQC algorithm models the adequacy of classroom ventilation according to the number of persons present. The input used is the organisation's existing data relating to CO2 concentration and number of room occupants. AI techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were employed to determine the relationship between the different data sources included. A prototype of value-added services was developed for the Smart University platform of the University of Alicante, which allowed to implement the resulting models, together with the VQC. The prototype is currently being replicated in other universities. The case study allowed us to validate the VQC, demonstrating both its usefulness and the advantage of using pre-existing university services and resources.}

abstract = {Lighting demand in built environments corresponds to more than 10% of the global energy use, with great potential for energy saving thanks to innovative smart materials and combination of passive–active strategies. This paper focuses on an innovative smart lighting system based on a blue-diode laser technology combined with photoluminescent pavements, to obtain a self-lighting surface with a substantial reduction in electricity consumption. A laser variable angle scanner prototype was developed and operated through a dedicated management software. The prototype was installed in lab to measure the emitted luminance/illuminance of the pavement, its time decay, and the electricity consumption. This application is yet a prototype, the scanning area and the investigated pavement are more compatible with pedestrian street and sidewalk because of the lower illuminances to be maintained. The results were compared to standard solutions installed in typical roads. The results presented promising benefits in terms of electricity saving (about 40% compared to standard LEDs) and luminance uniformity (higher than 0.9 compared to standard systems, i.e. 0.17÷0.33). Important future ideas derive from preliminary experimental campaigns to improve the smart laser system, and the coupled pavement properties to reduce the consumptions and improve the lighting conditions for pedestrians and vehicles, within potential self-lighting streets.}

Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics. Later, this paper discusses some important concerns that blockchain in smart logistics might face. We have also provided potential solutions to tackle these concerns.}

abstract = {Background
Operating rooms generate significant greenhouse gas emissions. Our objective was to assess current institutional climate-smart actions and pediatric surgeon perceptions regarding environmental stewardship efforts in the operating room.
Methods
A survey was distributed to members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association in June 2022. The survey was piloted among ten general surgery residents and two professional society cohorts of pediatric surgeons. Comparisons were made by demographic and practice characteristics.
Results
Survey response rate was 15.9% (n = 160/1009) and included surgeons predominantly from urban (n = 93/122, 76.2%) and academic (n = 84/122, 68.9%) institutions. Only 9.8% (n = 12/122) of pediatric surgeons were currently involved in operating room environmental initiatives. The most common climate-smart actions were reusable materials and equipment (n = 120/159, 75.5%) and reprocessing of medical devices (n = 111/160, 69.4%). Most surgeons either strongly agreed (n = 48/121, 39.7%) or agreed (n = 62/121, 51.2%) that incorporation of environmental stewardship practices at work was important. Surgeons identified reusable materials/equipment (extremely important: n = 61/129, 47.3%, important: n = 38/129, 29.5%) and recycling (extremely important: n = 68/129, 52.7%, important: n = 29/129, 22.5%) as the most important climate-smart actions. Commonly perceived barriers were financial (extremely likely: n = 47/123, 38.2%, likely: n = 50/123, 40.7%) and staff resistance to change (extremely likely: n = 29/123, 23.6%, likely: n = 60/123, 48.8%). Regional differences included low adoption of energy efficiency strategies among respondents from southern states (n = 0/26, p = 0.01) despite high perceived importance relative to other regions (median: 5, IQR: 4–5 vs median: 4, IQR 4–5, p = 0.04).
Conclusions
While most pediatric surgeons agreed that environmental stewardship was important, less than 10% are currently involved in initiatives at their institutions. Opportunities exist for surgical leadership surrounding implementation of climate-smart actions.

ATFs (Accident Tolerant Fuels) can improve nuclear power plant safety by improving its performance during normal operation, transient situations, and accident scenarios, as well as providing longer accident response time. In the present study, we assessed the FCM fuel thermal hydraulic performance during steady state normal operation and accident conditions. We compared the performances of special designs of the FCM fuel to the conventional fuel during normal operation and anticipated operational occurrences. The neutronic safety parameters, such as temperature reactivity coefficients, power peaking factor, effectivedelayed neutronfraction and generation time, determine the reactor dynamic response. Therefore, assessment of reactor behavior throughout the operational cycle is a key factor in reactor safety analysis for transient conditions. We analyzed the thermal hydraulic performance of SMART reactor, and compared the results to conventional UO2 fuel. MATLAB R2015a and RELAP5 were used to carry out the thermal hydraulic analysis of FCM designed cases with successful neutronic safety parameters (from a previous study). We simulated the reactor dynamics based on point kinetics and lumped parameters thermal hydraulic model. A ramp input reactivity was inserted into the core and the behavior of both fuel types was analyzed. The homogenized thermal properties of the Fully Ceramic Microencapsulated -Uranium Carbide (FCM-UC) fuel rods were evaluated using the volume fraction of the material (volumetric average model).}

This paper proposes a strategy for smart energy management among residential consumers using machine learning algorithm that intelligently classifies high power consumers contributing to peak demand in every quarter of a day as Category A, Category B, Category C and Category D. Classification is performed on daily load profile data of 29,546 residential consumers using different supervised learning techniques. The raw data of consumers are preprocessed with statistical analysis to label peak consumers in different time slots and highest testing accuracy of 92.23% has been achieved with Random Forest classifier. The peak loads of classified consumers are then individually clipped to curtail the load of every consumer within baseline power of every quarter. Adoption of this methodology will facilitate to provide recommendations to every classified consumer of different categories for load curtailment and imposition of penalty based on the baseline limit. The power deficits during different quarters of a day estimated as 0.968%, 0.740%, 0.993% and 0.164% of load have been effectively adjusted by the classified consumers with per capita load adjustment of 3.641 kW, 1.164 kW, 1.628 kW and 0.984 kW respectively. Thus, overall power deficit, 0.73% of daily total load (12,265.7 kW) has been mitigated through intelligent distribution of load with minimal stress on consumers, which proves the efficiency of proposed Demand Side Management algorithm in sustaining growing demands within limited resources.}

The glazing temperature that affects TC thermo-optical properties directly impacts its energy-saving performance. However, the impacts of solar radiation and natural convection occurring on this temperature-sensitive material are not yet fully understood. Compared to previous focuses on material properties and energy evaluation, this study aimed to provide a different view from thermo-fluid dynamics on the heat transfer characteristics of a TC window, with impacts of environmental factors addressed. A validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model identifies the environmental impacts on the TC glazing temperatures under the coupled radiative and convective heat transfer. Furthermore, a theoretical model was developed with an empirical factor obtained from CFD results. It enables a simple calculation to obtain the TC glazing’s temperature by using solar factors, outdoor temperatures and optical properties. The model suggests that the temperature difference between the TC glazing and the ambient is a function of absorbed solar irradiation (∝q̇total0.75). The predictive model is then tested using typical climate conditions in three cities in China with different solar angles, which demonstrates good agreement with an average absolute error of 5% compared to simulated glazing temperature. This estimation method can further assist in material design, product selection and Building Energy Simulations to achieve a TC window design that is ‘smart’ on seasonal change requirements for different regions.}

Its focus is to explore spatial disparities of households’ energy burden and their exposure to ambient particulate matters (PM2.5 as end point) in supporting energy efficiency goals of cities. In this study, energy burden is defined as energy affordability of households for paying energy costs. And natural ventilation (NV) is examined as a catalyst of building energy efficiency to measure tradeoffs between energy burden mitigation and exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution. The framework is built upon a five-step workflow using spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) with gradient boosting machine (GBM) and bringing human behavioral patterns along with array of urban big data from smart cities platforms into the model to improve the explanatory capacities of the exposure model. We tested Chicago, IL as a case study. Findings indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in integrating urban energy and human health systems for envisioning urban building energy reduction goals. A web-based interactive platform is designed to communicate the results. iEnEx framework can assist designers, engineers, planners, and policymakers in better understanding these systems from environmental and social lenses in the context of equity within the built environment to ensure future sustainable cities.}

The share of hydrogen and related energy technologies in reducing global warming and emissions will continue to increase day by day. For this reason, projections and investment opportunities should be determined for the coming years. In energy projections, the evaluation of hydrogen in terms of energy diversity until 2030 is carried out with EnergyPlan software. Accordingly, the reduction in the amount of emissions and costs were determined by mixing hydrogen into the natural gas pipelines by 5–10, and 20% by volume by producing electrolyzers with photovoltaic systems and according to the number of vehicles with fuel cells in the transportation sector until 2030.}

As a result, other discourses are emerging in the field of urban branding, with a meaningful divide between the ‘internal’ dimension of branding (messages directed to inhabitants and city users) and its ‘external’ dimension. Specifically, the article considers the role and heritage of ‘old’ discourses on culture and creativity and the diffusion of new branding messages related to food and to the imagery of the ‘smart city’.}

More recently, the competitive environment is requiring an increasing attention towards sustainability issues leading to the implementation of practices to also improve sustainability performance and, in particular, the environmental impacts. The relationships between lean and green approaches in terms of their mutual influence in achieving target performance have been investigated in several studies (see for example (Dieste et al., 2019)– (Henao et al., 2019)). Most of related studies identify a supportive relationship between the two paradigms, and only few negative effects have been identified. Whilst the impact on performance in lean-green contexts has become a field of research in its own, little has been said in literature about how the new Industry 4.0 (smart manufacturing) paradigm and the emerging technologies, impacting in every area of a production company, can be of support to further strengthen the lean-green binomial (an exception is represented by (Duarte and Cruz-Machado, 2017)). This paper aims at proposing a framework to analyse how a smart environment relying on the Industry 4.0 tools and technologies can support the evolution of a lean-green company towards higher levels of operational performance. The final goal is to support practitioners in the strategic choice of what smart technologies to adopt in combination with selected lean and green practices to create an impact on selected operations strategy indicators or to identify initiatives to fill operational gaps in the context of a continuous improvement and radical innovations plans. Such approach may serve as a signpost for the shaping of operations strategies, especially in relation to technology management. In order to achieve the above-mentioned goal, a four-step methodology has been adopted to review the existing literature and to organize it in a way that allows highlighting the impacts of smart technologies, lean and green practices on performance indicators and to identify possible reciprocal influences. Eventually, to get a validation of the proposed approach, a semi-structured interview has been shared with four manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to get their perspective on framework potential benefits.}

In this paper, we adopt a bilinear logistic regression model in which the parameters are trained in a data-driven fashion on a real-world dataset of power grid failure data. The bilinear white-box model – grounded on a specific neural architecture – has been proven effective in classifying faulty states with a performance comparable to several classifiers in technical literature. Additionally, the low computational complexity of the bilinear model, in terms of the number of free parameters, allows gaining insights into the fault phenomenon correlating the events that impact the power grid (exogenous causes) with its constitutive characteristics, thence eliciting the relational information hidden in the data. The proposed model is also able to estimate a vulnerability vector that can be associated, as a suitable characteristic “label”, to power grid components, opening the way, as will be deeply demonstrated in the following, not only to predictive maintenance programs or condition monitoring tasks but also to risk assessment and scenario analyses in line with the explainable AI paradigm.}

Our study evaluates recent efforts to deploy emerging technologies to design, secure, and enhance the efficiency of SHS that are based on medical images. It is hoped that this work will stimulate further interest aimed at the pursuit of more advanced algorithms and frameworks covering all aspects of security and privacy in emerging and future smart healthcare applications.}

abstract = {Due to climate change and the occurrence of natural disasters in recent decades, energy supply to consumers has faced risks in different areas, especially in urban areas. Hurricanes are the most common natural disaster in urban areas due to damage to energy grids like electrical distribution grids. This study focused on enhancing resilience oriented in the electrical distribution grids in urban areas with smart grid technologies. The pole outage by hurricanes in the electrical distribution grid is introduced as a natural event subject to scenario generation via the pole fragility function. The short-term reserve scheduling is proposed as a pre-event response for enhancing resilience against events at day-ahead. The reserve scheduling is implemented with attention to three strategies such as installing backup generators (BGs), demand response program (DRP), and storage systems (SSs) utilization considering microgrid formation in the damaged areas. The BGs are fed by urban gas grids to supply electrical demand in the damaged areas. In the following, DRP is considered for demand management based on offering prices to consumers for demand reduction. Also, the SSs are operated by consumers as the onsite generation to meet self-demand during the event. The implementation of the proposed approach is done by using tri-objectives such as 1) minimizing the reserve costs, 2) minimizing the consumers' dissatisfaction, and 3) maximizing the resilience oriented of the electrical distribution grid. The GAMS software and augmented ε-constraint method are presented for solving reserve scheduling. Finally, the superiority of the pre-event responses considering proposed reserve scheduling is verified via numerical simulation on the IEEE 33-bus distribution grid in several case studies. The implementation of all strategies leads to minimizing reserve costs and consumers' dissatisfaction by 1.8 % and 3.7 % and improving resilience by 3.8 % in comparison with the lack of implementation strategies.}

abstract = {A thorough understanding of carbon lock-in is an essential precondition for the effective design and continuous improvement of climate policy. Based on a balanced panel dataset of 30 provinces in China during the period 2002–2021, we explore the nexus between smart transportation and carbon lock-in using the System-Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) model. We also investigate the heterogeneous, asymmetric, and threshold effects among the above two issues, and examine three internal impact mechanisms. We thus arrive at the following four main conclusions: (1) Smart transportation significantly reduces carbon lock-in, highlighting its importance in eradicating carbon lock-in. (2) Smart transportation has the most pronounced impact on carbon lock-in in the central region, and can effectively mitigate all aspects of carbon lock-in, especially industry lock-in and institution lock-in. (3) Smart transportation is more effective in alleviating carbon lock-in in provinces with a higher level of carbon lock-in. Moreover, a threshold of environmental regulation exists between smart transportation and carbon lock-in, with stricter environmental regulation leading to a stronger carbon lock-in reduction effect of smart transportation. (4) Smart transportation indirectly influences carbon lock-in through three channels of economic scale, industrial structure upgrading, and technological innovation. Based on these findings, we propose some policy recommendations for smart transportation development and carbon lock-in mitigation.}
